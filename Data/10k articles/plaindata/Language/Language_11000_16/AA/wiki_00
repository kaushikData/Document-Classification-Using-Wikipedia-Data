The term comes from the Latin \"abjurare\", \"to forswear\".\n\nAbjuration of the realm was a type of abjuration in ancient English law. The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly, never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken sanctuary:\n\nNear the start of the English Civil War, on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed \"An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements.\" The enlargements included an oath which became known as the \"Oath of Abjuration\":\nIn 1656-7, it was reissued in what was for Catholics an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be \"adjudged a Papist\" who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the recusant's goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right.\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopaedia make the point that the oath and the penalties were so severe that it stopped the efforts of the Gallicanizing party among the English Catholics, who had been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which was condemned anew about this time by Pope Innocent X.\n\nDuring The Killing Time of the 1680s an Abjuration Oath could be put to suspects where they were given the option to abjure or renounce their allegiances. The terms of the oath were deliberately designed to offend the consciences of the Presbyterian Covenanters. Those who would not swear \"whether they have arms, or not\" could be \"immediately killed\" by field trial \"before two witnesses\" on a charge of high treason. John Brown was included among those executed in this judicial process by John Graham (Bluidy Clavers) on 1 May 1685. The wives and children of such men could also be put out of their houses if they had spoken to the suspect or refused the oath themselves.\n\nIn England (and after 1707 Great Britain) the Oath of Abjuration denied the royal title of James II's heirs (i.e. the direct Catholic descendent of the House of Stuart exiled after the Glorious Revolution in 1688). In England, an Oath of Abjuration was taken by Members of Parliament, clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current British monarch and repudiated the right of the Stuarts and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under William III, George I and George III. It was superseded by the oath of allegiance. In Ireland the oath was imposed of state office holders, teachers and lawyers, and on clergy of the established church in from 1703, the following year it was on all Irish voters and from 1709 it could be demanded of any adult male by a magistrate.\n\nAnother famous abjuration was brought about by the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe of July 26, 1581, the formal declaration of independence of the Low Countries from the Spanish king, Philip II. This oath was the climax of the Eighty Years' War (Dutch Revolt).\n"}

{"id": "31858003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31858003", "title": "Articulation (phonetics)", "text": "Articulation (phonetics)\n\nIn phonetics and phonology, articulation is the movement of the tongue, lips, jaw, and other speech organs (the articulators) in ways that make speech sounds. \n\nSound is produced simply by expelling air from the lungs. However, to vary the sound quality in a way useful for speaking, two speech organs normally move towards each other to contact each other to create an obstruction that shapes the air in a particular fashion. The point of maximum obstruction is called the \"place of articulation\", and the way the obstruction forms and releases is the \"manner of articulation\". For example, when making a \"p\" sound, the lips come together tightly, blocking the air momentarily and causing a buildup of air pressure. The lips then release suddenly, causing a burst of sound. The place of articulation of this sound is therefore called ', and the manner is called ' (also known as a \"plosive\").\n\nArticulation can be shown with magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate how the tongue, lips and jaw move and the rise and fall of the soft palate. Such movement alters resonant properties of the vocal tract, and imposes a \"time-varying formant structure\" onto the speech signal. The study of articulation in making speech is called articulatory phonetics.\n\nAn obstruction is necessarily formed when two articulators come close together. Generally, one is moving (the active articulator), and the other is stationary (the passive articulator). As a result, what is normally termed the \"place of articulation\" is actually a combination of a \"place of active articulation\" and a \"place of passive articulation\". For example, the English \"f\" sound is '—a shorthand way of saying that the active articulator is the lower lip, which moves up (along with the jaw in general) to contact the upper teeth. The lower lip can also be the active articulator for other places of articulation (e.g. ', where it contacts the upper lip, as in English \"p\"). Likewise, the upper teeth can be the passive articulator for other places of articulation (e.g. \"\", where the tongue contacts the upper teeth, as in the English \"th\" sound).\n\nThe places of articulation used in English are:\n\nThe place of articulation is clearest for consonants, where there is generally a significant amount of obstruction. For vowels, part of the tongue moves closer to the roof of the mouth, but there is still enough of a gap that it is difficult to precisely specify the location of maximum obstruction. As a result, vowels are normally described by \"height\" and \"frontness\" of the tongue (as well as amount of rounding of the lips) rather than by a specific place of articulation. For example, the vowel in the first syllable of \"father\" is a \"low back unrounded vowel\"; the vowel in \"tooth\" is a \"high back rounded vowel\", and the vowel in \"men\" is a \"low-mid front unrounded vowel\".\n\nSometimes there can be more than one obstruction (although rarely more than two). There are two kinds of double obstruction: Either both obstructions block the air flow in equal amounts, or one obstruction blocks the air flow more than the other. The former type, a doubly articulated consonant, does not occur in English. The latter type, however, is more common and does occur in English; \"w\" is one example. With \"w\", the place of greatest obstruction, called the \"primary articulation\", occurs at the soft palate; the rounding of the lips causes less blockage, and is called the \"secondary articulation\". Another example in English is the \"qu\" of words such as \"quit\", with the same primary and secondary articulations, but a complete blockage of the air at the soft palate rather than only a restriction of the flow (a difference in \"manner of articulation\"; see below). (Note that the sound of \"qu\" is normally analyzed as a sequence of \"k\" plus \"w\", but both parts are actually pronounced at the same time.)\n\n\"Manner of articulation\" refers in general to characteristics of the speech organs other than the location of the obstruction(s). There are multiple parameters involved here, and different types of each. The manners of articulation used in English are:\n\n1. Degree of stricture: How much blockage occurs at the primary articulation (the place of greatest obstruction). The types in English are:\n\n2. Alternative air flow: The air travels a path other than down the center of the mouth: \n\n3. Dynamic movement of the tongue: \n\nApproximants, nasals, laterals, flaps, and trills are often grouped together as \"sonorants\" or \"resonants\" (which also includes vowels); all of them have in common the fact that there is smooth airflow throughout the consonant, and they are nearly always voiced (see below).\n\nVoicing: How closely the vocal cords are placed together. In English there are only two possibilities, \"voiced\" and \"unvoiced\". Voicing is caused by the vocal cords held close by each other, so that air passing through them makes them vibrate. All normally spoken vowels are voiced, as are all other sonorants except \"h\", as well as some of the remaining sounds (\"b\", \"d\", \"g\", \"v\", \"z\", \"zh\", \"j\", and the \"th\" sound in \"this\"). All the rest are voiceless sounds, with the vocal cords held far enough apart that there is no vibration; however, there is still a certain amount of audible friction, as in the sound \"h\". Voiceless sounds are not very prominent unless there is some turbulence, as in the stops, fricatives, and affricates; this is why sonorants in general only occur voiced. The exception is during whispering, when all sounds pronounced are voiceless.\n\n\n"}

Boring is a technique used in many aspects of building. Woodworkers have used boring as a form of drilling for centuries. In woodworking, the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts. In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular. In metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the X or Y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel, or it may be moved only in an up-and-down motion (on the Z axis) to create a perfect circular hole.\n\nModern boring tools have three primary components although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (\"bar holder\") is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the \"dial screw\". As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if the cutting tool is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called \"unbalanced gyroscope precession\". Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the \"boring tool\". Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.\n\nBoring can be done on mills, lathes or drill press machines, either with a boring head or with just a boring tool. The shorter the distance between the tool holder and the material, the less distortion created from vibration or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a boring head increases the mass of the tool holder and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted perpendicular to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.\n"}
{"id": "796941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=796941", "title": "Brian Merriman", "text": "Brian Merriman\n\nBrian Merriman or in Irish Brian Mac Giolla Meidhre (c. 1747 – 27 July 1805) was an Irish language poet and teacher. His single surviving work of substance, the 1000-line long (The Midnight Court) is widely regarded as the greatest comic poem in the history of Irish literature.\n\nMerriman in an oral account collected after his death was said to have been born illegitimately in Clondagad or Ennistymon, County Clare. His mother was surnamed Quilkeen and his father's identity remains unknown.\n\nShortly after his birth, his mother married a stonemason who was working on the walls of the Deerpark estate in Ennistymon. The family moved to Feakle and some years later Merriman is known to have owned a 20-acre (81,000 m²) farm near Loch Gréine. He was a teacher of mathematics and is known to have taught the hedge school nearby in the townland of Kilclaren. He married around 1787 and had two daughters. In 1797, the Royal Dublin Society awarded him two prizes for his flax crop. Around 1800 he moved to County Limerick, where he ran a school until his death. He is buried in Fiacla graveyard.\n\nThe poem begins by using the conventions of the Aisling, or vision poem, in which the poet is out walking when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, this woman is Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her 'sons' to rebel against foreign tyranny. In Merriman's hands, the convention is made to take a satirical and deeply ironic twist.\n\nIn the opening section of the poem, a hideous female giant appears to the poet and drags him kicking and screaming to the court of Queen Aoibheal of the Fairies. On the way to the ruined monastery at Moinmoy, the messenger explains that the Queen, disgusted by the twin corruptions of Anglo-Irish landlords and English Law, has taken the dispensing of justice upon herself. There follows a traditional court case under the Brehon law form of a three-part debate.\n\nIn the first part, a young woman calls on Aoibheal declares her case against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She complains that, despite increasingly desperate attempts to capture a husband via intensive flirtation at hurling matches, wakes, and pattern days, the young men insist on ignoring her in favour of late marriages to much older women. The young woman further bewails the contempt with which she is treated by the married women of the village.\n\nShe is answered by an old man who first denounces the wanton promiscuity of young women in general, suggesting that the young woman who spoke before was conceived by a Tinker under a cart. He vividly describes the infidelity of his own young wife. He declares his humiliation at finding her already pregnant on their wedding night and the gossip which has surrounded the \"premature\" birth of \"his\" son ever since. He disgustedly attacks the dissolute lifestyles of young women in general. Then, however, he declares that there is nothing wrong with his illegitimate children and denounces marriage as \"out of date.\" He demands that the Queen outlaw it altogether and replace it with a system of free love.\n\nThe young woman, however, is infuriated by the old' man's words and is barely restrained from physically attacking him. She mocks his inability to fulfill his marital duties with his young wife, saying that she was a homeless beggar who married him to avoid starvation. She vividly argues that if his wife has taken a lover, she well deserves one. She then calls for the abolition of priestly celibacy, alleging that priests would otherwise make wonderful husbands and fathers. In the meantime, however, she will keep trying to attract an older man in hopes that her unmarried humiliation will finally end.\n\nFinally, in the judgement section Queen Aoibheal rules that all laymen must marry before the age of 21, on pain of corporal punishment at the hands of Ireland's women. She advises them to equally target the romantically indifferent, homosexuals, and unmarried skirt chasers who boast of the number of notches on their belts. Aoibheal tells them to be careful, however, not to leave any man unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is beyond her mandate and counsels patience.\n\nTo the poet's horror, the younger woman angrily points him out as a 30-year-old, bachelor and describes her many failed attempts to attract his interest in hopes of becoming his wife. She declares that he must be the first man to suffer the consequences of the new marriage law. As a crowd of infuriated women prepares to flog him into a quivering bowl of jelly, he awakens to find it was all a terrible nightmare.\n\nThe language of the poem is essentially the everyday Munster Irish of the time, the vernacular of Clare. In its frank and satirical treatment of sexuality, ironic parody of the battle of the sexes, and its biting social commentary, \"Cúirt An Mheán Óiche\" is a unique document in the history of Irish poetry in either language.\n\n\"Cúirt An Mheán Oíche\" was never written down by its author and was preserved, like much Gaelic poetry, in an oral format. It was first published in 1850 in an edition by the Irish scholar John O'Daly. In the 20th century, a number of translations were produced, including notable English versions by Arland Ussher, Frank O'Connor, Edward Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford, David Marcus, Ciarán Carson, Thomas Kinsella and a partial translation by Seamus Heaney. Brendan Behan is believed to have written an unpublished version, since lost. O'Connor's translation, which is perhaps the most popular, was banned in Ireland by the Censorship Board in 1946, because of the sexual frankness of the content.\n\n\"Cúirt an Mheán Oíche\" has been dramatised by Tom MacIntyre and Celia de Fréine and has been turned into a comic opera by composer Ana Sokolović with English libretto by Paul Bentley.\n\n\"Cumann Merriman\" was founded in 1967 to promote the poet's work. They run an annual Merriman Summer School in County Clare each August.\n\nIn 2005, the Clare County Library released a CD recording of a local seanchaí reciting \"Cúirt An Mheán Óiche\" in the traditional oral manner. Although it has not been made available for purchase, \"Cumann Merriman\" has posted excerpts on their website. For added contrast, the same passages are also reproduced from a modern dramatic reading of the poem.\n\nIn recent years, Merriman's poem and other Gaelic satires has been widely admired and translated by several modern Irish poets like Seamus Heaney and Thomas Kinsella.1\n\nIn a 1993 lecture on Merriman's life and work, Seamus Heaney declared, \"Perhaps I can convey the ongoing reality of the poem's life more simply by recollecting a Saturday evening last August when I had the privilege of unveiling a memorial to Brian Merriman on the shore of Lough Graney in Co. Clare, where the opening scene of 'The Midnight Court' is set. The memorial is a large stone quarried from a hill overlooking the lake, and the opening lines are carved on it in Irish. The people who attended the ceremony were almost all from the local district, and were eager to point out the exact corner of the nearby field where the poet had run his hedge school, and the spot on the lough shore where he had fallen asleep and had his vision. This was, and is, the first circle where Merriman's poem flourished and continues to flourish. Later that evening, for example, in a marquee a couple of miles down the road, we attended a performance by the Druid Theatre Company from Galway in which the poem was given a dramatic presentation with all the boost and blast-off that song and music and topical allusion could provide. Again, hundreds of local people were in the tent, shouting and taking sides like a football crowd, as the old man and the young woman battled it out and the president of the court gave her judgement. The psychosexual demons were no longer at bay but rampant and fully recognised, so that the audience, at the end of the performance, came away from the experience every bit as accused and absolved as the poet himself at the end of his poem. The 'profane perfection of mankind' was going ahead and civilisation was being kept on course; in a ceremony that was entirely convincing and contemporary, Orpheus has been remembered in Ireland.\"\n\n\n"}

It offers a hypothesis about the cause and nature of the presenting problems and is considered an adjunct or alternative approach to the more categorical approach of psychiatric diagnosis. In clinical practice, formulations are used to communicate a hypothesis and provide framework for developing the most suitable treatment approach. It is most commonly used by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and is deemed to be a core component of these professions. Mental health nurses and social workers may also use formulations.\n\nDifferent psychological schools or models utilize clinical formulations, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and related therapies: systemic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and applied behavior analysis. The structure and content of a clinical formulation is determined by the psychological model. Most systems of formulation contain the following broad categories of information: symptoms and problems; precipitating stressors or events; predisposing life events or stressors; and an explanatory mechanism that links the preceding categories together and offers a description of the precipitants and maintaining influences of the person's problems.\n\nBehavioral case formulations used in applied behavior analysis and behavior therapy are built on a rank list of problem behaviors, from which a functional analysis is conducted, sometimes based on relational frame theory. Such functional analysis is also used in third-generation behavior therapy or clinical behavior analysis such as acceptance and commitment therapy and functional analytic psychotherapy. Functional analysis looks at setting events (ecological variables, history effects, and motivating operations), antecedents, behavior chains, the problem behavior, and the consequences, short- and long-term, for the behavior.\n\nA model of formulation that is more specific to CBT is described by Jacqueline Persons. This has seven components: problem list, core beliefs, precipitants and activating situations, origins, working hypothesis, treatment plan, and predicted obstacles to treatment.\n\nA psychodynamic formulation would consist of a summarizing statement, a description of nondynamic factors, description of core psychodynamics using a specific model (such as ego psychology, object relations or self psychology), and a prognostic assessment which identifies the potential areas of resistance in therapy.\n\nOne school of psychotherapy which relies heavily on the formulation is cognitive analytic therapy (CAT). CAT is a fixed-term therapy, typically of around 16 sessions. At around session four, a formal written reformulation letter is offered to the patient which forms the basis for the rest of the treatment. This is usually followed by a diagrammatic reformulation to amplify and reinforce the letter.\n\nMany psychologists use an integrative psychotherapy approach to formulation. This is to take advantage of the benefits of resources from each model the psychologist is trained in, according to the patient's needs.\n\nThe quality of specific clinical formulations, and the quality of the general theoretical models used in those formulations, can be evaluated with criteria such as:\n\nFormulations can vary in temporal scope from case-based to episode-based or moment-based, and formulations may evolve during the course of treatment. Therefore, ongoing monitoring, testing, and assessment during treatment are necessary: monitoring can take the form of session-by-session progress reviews using quantitative measures, and formulations can be modified if an intervention is not as effective as hoped.\n\nPsychologist George Kelly, who developed personal construct theory in the 1950s, noted his complaint against traditional diagnosis in his book \"The Psychology of Personal Constructs\" (1955): \"Much of the reform proposed by the psychology of personal constructs is directed towards the tendency for psychologists to impose preemptive constructions upon human behaviour. Diagnosis is all too frequently an attempt to cram a whole live struggling client into a nosological category.\" In place of nosological categories, Kelly used the word \"formulation\" and mentioned two types of formulation: a first stage of \"structuralization\", in which the clinician tentatively organizes clinical case information \"in terms of dimensions rather than in terms of disease entities\" while focusing on \"the more important ways in which the client can change, and not merely ways in which the psychologist can distinguish him from other persons\", and a second stage of \"construction\", in which the clinician seeks a kind of negotiated integration of the clinician's organization of the case information with the client's personal meanings.\n\nPsychologists Hans Eysenck, Monte B. Shapiro, Vic Meyer, and Ira Turkat were also among the early developers of systematic individualized alternatives to diagnosis. Meyer has been credited with providing perhaps the first training course of behaviour therapy based on a case formulation model, at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London in 1970. Meyer's original choice of words for clinical formulation were \"behavioural formulation\" or \"problem formulation\".\n\n"}

Effective choices in group awareness, participation, and coordination are critical to successful collaborative writing outcomes.\n\nCollaborative writing is writing done by more than one person; they may discuss what they are going to write before they start, and discuss what they have written after they finish each draft they write. The writing might be organized by dividing the writing into sub-tasks assigned to each group member, with the first part of the tasks done before the next parts, or they might work together on each task. The writing is planned, written, and revised, and more than one person is involved in at least one of those steps. Usually, discussions about the document's structure and context involve the entire group.\n\nMost usually it is applied to textual documents or programmatic source code. Such asynchronous (non-simultaneous) contributions are very efficient in time, as group members need not assemble in order to work together. Generally, managing such work requires software; the most common tools for editing documents are wikis, and those for programming, version control systems.\nMost word processors are also capable of recording changes; this allows editors to work on the same document while automatically clearly labeling who contributed what changes. New writing environments such as Google Docs provide collaborative writing/editing functionalities with revision control, synchronous/asynchronous editing. Another tool that uses collaborative editing is Addteq's Excellentable. Excellentable is an app for Confluence that enable users to collaborate on spreadsheets in real-time directly inside of Confluence.\n\nWikipedia is an example of a collaborative editing project on a large scale, which can be both good and bad, because of the large contributions by the public, Wikipedia has one of the widest ranges of material in the world. Unfortunately, this also leads to online 'graffiti', in which members of the public can submit incorrect information or random rubbish.\nCollaborative writing can lead to projects that are richer and more complex than those produced by individuals. Many learning communities include one or more collaborative assignments. However, writing with others also makes the writing task more complex. There is increasing amount of research literature investigating how collaborative writing can improve learning experiences.\n\nCorrect access management systems can prevent duplicated information. Access management systems require access to a server, often online. Online collaboration can be more difficult due to issues such as time zones.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46438", "title": "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously", "text": "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\n\nColorless green ideas sleep furiously is a sentence composed by Noam Chomsky in his 1957 book \"Syntactic Structures\" as an example of a sentence that is grammatically correct, but semantically nonsensical. The sentence was originally used in his 1955 thesis \"Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory\" and in his 1956 paper \"Three Models for the Description of Language\". Although the sentence is grammatically correct, no obvious understandable meaning can be derived from it, and thus it demonstrates the distinction between syntax and semantics. As an example of a category mistake, it was used to show the inadequacy of the then-popular probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models.\n\nChomsky writes in his 1957 book \"Syntactic Structures\": \n\nWhile the meaninglessness of the sentence is often considered fundamental to Chomsky's point, Chomsky was only relying on the sentences having never been spoken before. Thus, even if one were to ascribe a likely and reasonable meaning to the sentence, the grammaticality of the sentence is concrete despite being the first time a person had ever uttered the statement, or any part thereof in such a combination. This was used then as a counter-example to the idea that the human speech engine was based upon statistical models, such as a Markov chain, or simple statistics of words following others.\n\nThe sentence can be partially interpreted through polysemy. Both \"green\" and \"colorless\" have figurative meanings, which allow \"colorless\" to be interpreted as \"nondescript\" and \"green\" as either \"immature\" or pertaining to environmental consciousness. The sentence can therefore be construed as \"nondescript immature ideas have violent nightmares\", a phrase with less oblique semantics. In particular, the phrase can have legitimate meaning too, if \"green\" is understood to mean \"newly formed\" and \"sleep\" can be used to figuratively express mental or verbal dormancy. \"Furiously\" remains problematic when applied to the verb \"sleep\", since \"furiously\" denotes \"angrily\", \"violently\", and \"intensely energetically\", meanings which are generally incompatible with sleep, dormancy, and unconscious agents typically construed as conscious ones, e.g. animals or humans, which truly \"sleep\".\n\nWriters have attempted to provide the sentence meaning through context, the first of which was written by Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao. In 1985, a literary competition was held at Stanford University in which the contestants were invited to make Chomsky's sentence meaningful using not more than 100 words of prose or 14 lines of verse.\n\nAn example entry from the competition, from C.M. Street, is:\nIt can only be the thought of verdure to come, which prompts us in the autumn to buy these dormant white lumps of vegetable matter covered by a brown papery skin, and lovingly to plant them and care for them. It is a marvel to me that under this cover they are labouring unseen at such a rate within to give us the sudden awesome beauty of spring flowering bulbs. While winter reigns the earth reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously.\n\nUsing the triangle-box method, \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" is divided into two phrases: [Colorless green ideas] and [sleep furiously] per the LINZ algorithm based on parts of intent. In the first phrase the word 'ideas' is the core (ZC), the main focus of the phrase. In the second phrase, there are no core but rather an action (TAP), which is the focus of the second phrase. Returning to the first phrase, the desire or intent of this phrase is 'ideas' (ZC). 'Colorless' and 'green' are boolean. Specifically description booleans (green) and its modifier (colorless). In the second phrase, 'sleep' is the action or intent of the phrase. Furiously is an intensity action type (ZAI). All triangle-box phrases consist of either a core, boolean and or TAP. This sentence contains the intent/desire or focus of ideas and sleep. It can be inferred that sleep when done furiously produces colorless green ideas or ideas that are not clear and concrete.\n\nFernando Pereira of the University of Pennsylvania has fitted a simple statistical Markov model to a body of newspaper text, and shown that under this model, \"Furiously sleep ideas green colorless\" is about 200,000 times less probable than \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\".\n\nThis statistical model defines a similarity metric, whereby sentences which are more like those within a corpus in certain respects are assigned higher values than sentences less alike. Pereira's model assigns an ungrammatical version of the same sentence a lower probability than the syntactically correct form demonstrating that statistical models can learn grammaticality distinctions with minimal linguistic assumptions. However, it is not clear that the model assigns every ungrammatical sentence a lower probability than every grammatical sentence. That is, \"colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" may still be statistically more \"remote\" from English than some ungrammatical sentences. To this, it may be argued that \"no\" current theory of grammar is capable of distinguishing \"all\" grammatical English sentences from ungrammatical ones.\n\nThe pioneering French syntactician Lucien Tesnière came up with the French language sentence \"Le silence vertébral indispose la voile licite\" (\"The vertebral silence indisposes the licit sail\").\n\nThe game of \"exquisite corpse\" is a method for generating nonsense sentences. It was named after the first sentence generated in the game in 1925 \"Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau\" (the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).\n\nIn the popular game of \"Mad Libs\", a chosen player asks each other player to provide parts of speech without providing any contextual information (e.g., \"Give me a proper noun\", or \"Give me an adjective\"), and these words are inserted into pre-composed sentences with a correct grammatical structure, but in which certain words have been omitted. The humor of the game is in the generation of sentences which are grammatical but which are meaningless or have absurd or ambiguous meanings (such as 'loud sharks'). The game also tends to generate humorous double entendres.\n\nThere are likely earlier examples of such sentences, possibly from the philosophy of language literature, but not necessarily uncontroversial ones, given that the focus has been mostly on borderline cases. For example, followers of logical positivism held that \"metaphysical\" (i.e. not empirically verifiable) statements are simply meaningless; e.g. Rudolf Carnap wrote an article where he argued that almost every sentence from Heidegger was grammatically correct, yet meaningless. Of course, some philosophers who were not logical positivists disagreed with this.\n\nThe philosopher Bertrand Russell used the sentence \"Quadruplicity drinks procrastination\" in his “An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth” from 1940, to make a similar point; W.V. Quine took issue with him on the grounds that for a sentence to be false is nothing more than for it not to be true; and since quadruplicity doesn't drink \"anything\", the sentence is simply false, not meaningless.\n\nIn a sketch about linguistics, British comedy duo Fry and Laurie used the nonsensical sentence \"Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.\"\n\nJohn Hollander wrote a poem titled \"Coiled Alizarine\" in his book \"The Night Mirror\". It ends with Chomsky's sentence.\n\nClive James wrote a poem titled \"A Line and a Theme from Noam Chomsky\" in his book \"\". It opens with Chomsky's second meaningless sentence and discusses the Vietnam War.\n\nAnother approach is to create a syntactically-correct, easily parsable sentence using nonsense words; a famous such example is \"The gostak distims the doshes\". Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky is also famous for using this technique, although in this case for literary purposes; similar sentences used in neuroscience experiments are called Jabberwocky sentences. In Russian schools of linguistics, the \"glokaya kuzdra\" example has similar characteristics.\n\nOther arguably \"meaningless\" utterances are ones that make sense, are grammatical, but have no reference to the present state of the world, such as Russell's \"The present King of France is bald\" from On Denoting (also see definite description).\n\n"}
{"id": "41319316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41319316", "title": "Common area maintenance charges", "text": "Common area maintenance charges\n\nCommon Area Maintenance charges, or CAM for short, are one of the net charges billed to tenants in a commercial triple net (NNN) lease, and are paid by tenants to the landlord of a commercial property. A CAM charge is an additional rent, charged on top of base rent, and is mainly composed of maintenance fees for work performed on the common area of a property.\n\nEach tenant pays their pro rata share of a property's total CAM charges, which prorated share is the percentage of the tenant's rented square footage of the total, rentable square footage of the property.\n\nA common example of a CAM item is the cost of cleaning the walkways in a shopping mall. It is assumed that every tenant benefits from a clean environment, and should share in that cost. An example of a CAM that is charged to only a subset of tenants might be the charges for cleaning the food court area, where all of the vendors in the court collectively cover the higher cost of cleaning the tables on a frequent schedule.\n\nLandlord and Tenant negotiate CAM charges before signing the lease, so the charges vary from lease to lease, and operating costs that can be billed as CAM charges by the landlord vary from tenant to tenant. Generally, landlords want CAM charges defined so broadly that they can pass through a majority of their operating expenses to tenants. The tenant generally wants CAM charges defined narrowly in hopes that the landlord pays a majority of the operating costs.\n\nExamples of services often billed to tenants as CAM charges include portering, parking lot striping, parking lot lighting, and landscaping.\nCAM charges can be broken into two subcategories—\"controllable\" and \"uncontrollable\". Uncontrollable CAM charges are security costs, utilities, and snow removal expenses. All other expenses charged as a CAM charge are considered controllable.\n\nIn certain leases, CAM charges also consists of administrative and management fees. Administrative fees are a negotiated percentage of all costs of operating and maintaining a property. Management fees are a percentage of gross rents collected, which percentage is defined in the management agreement between the management company and ownership of the property.\n\nCAM charges are subject to wide variations as tenants move in and out and various inflationary items occur. This can make it difficult for both the tenant and landlord to predict their future cash flows with any accuracy. To address this, some leases include \"cap\" and \"floor\" terms which limit these changes to fixed values on a year-over-year basis.\n\nA cap on CAM charges limits the amount by which CAM charges can rise each year, and are presented as a percentage. Again, as with the CAM charges themselves, caps are also negotiated between the tenant and landlord, and thus vary from lease to lease. Caps can be cumulative or compounded, and calculated year-over-base or year-over-year.\n\nYear-over-base caps allow the cap to raise each year by a certain, predetermined percentage of a pre-determined, initial (base) CAM charge. Year-over-year caps mean the percentage increase applies not to a base amount, but to the actual CAM charge of the previous year. Cumulative caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to accumulate. Thus, a yearly 5% cap would grow the cap each year by 5%, so that the first year it was a 5% cap, the 2nd year a 10% cap, the third year 15, and so on. Compounded caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to grow at a compounded rate each year.\n\nIf actual CAM charges are lower than the cap, the cap does not apply. In these cases, a floor might be used instead. Floors are useful when there is some assumption that there will be inflation in CAM charges over time, even if there is no inflation in a given year. A floor will budget in a minimum increase in the charges, with the expectation that it will lessen a more major increase in the future.\n\nAlso known as reconciliations, true-ups, and billbacks, CAM Recoveries are the annual reconciliation of the actual Common Area Maintenance Charges for a fiscal year versus the monthly charges billed to the tenant.\n\nThe monthly CAM charges a tenant pays as a part of the rent are actually estimates of that tenant's monthly, pro-rated CAM charge for the current fiscal year. The estimate is created from a property's budget by the property manager. After the fiscal year ends, an audit is done of the paid CAM charges versus the actual CAM charges, and the difference is either paid to the landlord, or the tenant.\n"}

Dividing the momentum by the projectile mass gives the velocity. Robbins published his results as \"New Principles of Gunnery\" in 1742. The ballistic pendulum could make only one measurement per firing because the device catches the projectile. The gun's accuracy also limited how far down range a measurement could be made.\n\nAn early chronograph that measures velocity directly was built in 1804 by Grobert, a colonel in the French Army. This used a rapidly rotating axle with two disks mounted on it about 13 feet apart. The bullet was fired parallel to the axle, and the angular displacement of the holes in the two disks, together with the rotational speed of the axle, yielded the bullet velocity.\n\nThe Bashforth screens were made with several threads and series connected switches. A projectile passing through a screen would break one or more threads, the broken thread caused a switch to momentarily (about 20 ms) interrupt a current as the switch arm moved from its weighted position to its unweighted position, and the momentary interruption would be recorded on a paper chart.\n\nThe modern chronograph consists of two sensing areas called \"chronograph screens\", which contain optical sensors that detect the passage of the bullet. The bullet is fired so it passes through both screens, and the time it takes the bullet to travel the distance between the screens is measured electronically.\n\nThe first electronic ballistic chronograph was invented by Kiryako (\"Jerry\") Arvanetakis in the 1950s. As consulting engineer under contract by NACA (later NASA), he was asked to find a way to accurately measure the velocity of various projectiles fired at hyper-velocities into a variety of engineered materials in anticipation of manned space flight. His first design was an open rectangular frame of square aluminum tubing with a screen of fine copper wire at both ends. Breaking the first wire started charging a capacitor, breaking the second wire stopped it. Measuring the accumulated voltage and knowing the rate of charge the elapsed time could be accurately calculated.\n\n\n\n"}

Later explorations of masculinity have placed the aggressive aspects of the Laius complex within the broader frame of mammalian aggression against their young: what Gershon Legman called \"the killing of the male (i.e. sexually uninteresting) children by the father\".\n\nTwo specific psychosexual aspects of the complex have been particularly highlighted. One lays stress on the magical thinking behind the complex – the unconscious belief that if one has no successors, one will be effectively immortal.

These developments led to fears by French-Canadian nationalists that French speakers would be assimilated into the increasingly Anglophone culture of Ontario, leading the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969) to recommend that the Government of Canada and all provinces offer more services in French.\n\nSince that time, Quebec has used provincial law to encourage the use of French (see Charter of the French Language) at the expense of other languages, while the other provinces have begun to offer more and more services in French and in other languages besides English, including Aboriginal languages and immigrant languages. The 1982 amendments to the Constitution of Canada included a right of minority-language education that has forced policy changes in all of the provinces. Quebec is unique in requiring private businesses to use French and requiring immigrants to send their children to French-language schools. In other provinces there is no requirement that businesses use a particular language, but English predominates, and immigrants may send their children to English, French or third-language schools.\n\nAt the time of Confederation in 1867, English and French were made the official languages of debate in the Parliament of Canada and the Parliament of Quebec. No specific policies were enacted for the other provinces, and no provisions were made for the official languages to be used in other elements of the government such the courts, schools, post offices, and so on. The official language policies of the provinces and territories were initially set when they were created by the federal government, or in the case of provinces that were separate colonies before joining Confederation (Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia) were inherited from their own histories. Language policies in all provinces have evolved over time in response to changing demographics, public attitudes, and legal rulings.\n\nPrior to becoming part of Canada in 1869, English was a minority language in the Prairies, where French and Aboriginal languages were more common. The arrival of settlers from Ontario, the British Isles, and the United States changed the demographic balance, however. One of the outcomes of the Red River Rebellion of 1870 was the creation of Manitoba as an officially bilingual province, to protect the French-speaking Métis from being overpowered by the incoming English speaking settlers. This guarantee failed, however, and in the aftermath of the Manitoba Schools Question, that province was allowed to become officially English-only, until these policies were declared unconstitutional in 1985.\n\nThe Northwest Territories Act of 1891 made English and French official languages in the rest of the Canadian West. But in 1892 the Legislature of the Northwest Territories declared itself English-only.\n\nThis trend continued to the creation of the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905, and beyond. \n\nSection Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees that Canadian-born or educated parents (not recent immigrants) have a right to educate their children in their choice of either French or English wherever there are \"sufficient numbers\". This was a major change in that education is normally considered solely provincial jurisdiction, and policy had been majoritarian. Court cases such as \"Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)\" have indicated that this is a positive right that demands timely and sufficient action from the provincial governments.\n\nNew Brunswick and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English. Manitoba was officially bilingual at its creation, became officially Anglophone only, but this was later reversed by the courts.\n\n\nNew Brunswick has been officially bilingual since the passing of the \"Official Languages in New Brunswick Act (1969)\". This was complemented by \"An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick\" in 1981. New Brunswick's bilingualism was constitutionally enshrined in the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" in 1982. The \"Charter\" was amended in 1993 to clarify that the two language communities are legally equal. In 1999 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in \"Moncton (City) v. Charlebois\" that New Brunswick's official bilingualism also applied to municipalities in the province. In 2002 the \"Official Languages Act\" became New Brunswick's new language law, leading to the creation of the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages for New Brunswick in 2003.\n\nManitoba was established as an officially bilingual province under section 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870. However, in subsequent years the provincial government moved to end French-language services and become English-only. In the famous Supreme Court of Canada case \"Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights\" of 1985 the court found these policies unconstitutional. The province of Manitoba is now overwhelmingly English-speaking and the first language of the courts, government ministries, and schools is English. However, in order to comply with the court's ruling the province is required to provide nearly all its services in French (as well as English). The government's policy is summarized in the \"French Language Services Policy\", last updated in March 1999.\n\nOntario has a regionalized language policy, where part of the province is English-only and other areas are bilingual. Province-wide services (such as websites and toll-free telephone numbers) are provided in both English and French. However individuals only have a \"right\" to French-language services in certain designated regions of the province under the \"French Language Services Act\" (1986). There are 25 regions so designated. These are: areas with 10% or more Francophones; urban centres with 5,000 or more Francophones; and areas previously designated by the Government of Ontario between 1978 and 1985. Notably this includes Toronto, the provincial capital and Canada's largest municipality (although not all of the regional municipalities of the GTA are included), and the National Capital Region including Ottawa, the national capital, as well as many other cities, counties, districts, townships, and towns. For the purposes of the policy, the definition of a \"Francophone\" was broadened in 2009. Previously it included only mother-tongue speakers, however it now includes allophones (people whose first language is neither French or English) who \"have particular knowledge of French as an official language and use French at home, including many recent immigrants to Ontario for whom French is the language of integration\".\n\nUntil 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.\n\n\"An Act to promote the French language in Québec\" was passed in 1969 by the Union Nationale government of Jean-Jacques Bertrand. It required the education ministry to ensure that French as a second language was taught to all English-speakers and immigrants in Quebec, but allowed Quebecers freedom of choice in deciding in which language to educate their children. This was considered too weak by many Quebec nationalists, leading to the creation of the Mouvement Québec français and increased support for the new Parti Québécois.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973, the Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec investigated how to strengthen the position of French in Quebec. Its recommendations led to the passage of the \"Official Language Act\" or \"Bill 22\" in 1974 by the Quebec Liberal Party government of Robert Bourassa. This made French the sole official language of Quebec and required its use in business.\n\nBill 22 was replaced by the \"Charter of the French Language\" (Bill 101) by Quebec's National Assembly in August 1977, under the Parti Québécois government led by René Lévesque. It is structured as a list of rights, where everyone in Quebec has the right to be served in French by the government and businesses, and also provides rights for speakers of English and aboriginal languages. Most government services are available in both French and English. Regional institutions in the Nunavik region of northern Quebec offer services in Inuktitut and Cree.\n\nSeveral legal challenges have been raised against Bill 101 in the ongoing legal dispute over Quebec's language policy. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in \"Ford v Quebec (AG)\" that the ban on outdoor signs in languages other than French was unconstitutional. The government of Quebec choose to invoke the \"notwithstanding clause\" to shield the legislation from the courts. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights ruled similarly in \"Ballantyne v Canada\" in 1993. The ban on non-French signs was lifted with the passage of Bill 86 in 1993.\n\nMost provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts, but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.\n\nAlberta inherited its English-only status from the Northwest Territories in 1905, and this was strengthened over time. The Language Act 1988, reaffirmed the unilingual English nature of the province, while recognizing a right to use French in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta and before certain courts. The Language Policy in Education (1978) requires school boards to establish French programs at the request of a local advisory committee. The Schools Act recognizes a right to instruction in French for the official language minority (1988) and right of Francophones to manage their own schools (1993). Laws are drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French may be used orally in all provincial courts in Alberta. There is no requirement that healthcare services be provided in French, and it is left up to the initiative of individual hospitals and clinics. There is no requirement that social services be provided in French and this is left up to individual NGOs and charities that work with the provincial government. Other government services are provided in English only, except where the provincial government sees a need for French, including tourism and immigration, or where the federal government has provided funding. There is no official policy requiring municipalities in Alberta to provide services in French, but the Alberta Bilingual Municipalities Network includes the communities of Beaumont, Legal, Falher, Plamondon, Morinville, St. Albert, St. Paul, Bonnyville and the Smoky River Municipal District. Since 1993 there have been distinct separate and public Francophone school boards in Alberta in addition to the existing public and separate school boards which also offer French immersion. Besides French the government does not offer most services in many other languages, but there are exceptions. Official government toll-free lines related subjects like family violence and gambling are available in 170 languages. The government publishes an educational curriculum to assists teachers of Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Punjabi, Spanish, and Ukrainian, as well as of Cree and Blackfoot.\n\nIn June 2017 the province unveiled a new French Policy aimed at improving services for Franco-Albertans. The province maintains a partial French version of its website, bonjour.alberta.ca.\n\nNova Scotia has no legal requirement to provide any services in a language other than English, which was already well-established as the official language when the province joined Confederation in 1867. However the province has an Office of Gaelic Affairs whose mission is \"to work with Nova Scotians in the renewal of Gaelic language and culture in the Province\" and an Office of Acadian Affairs: The province also maintains a French-language web portal, gov.ns.ca/bonjour\n\n The French Language School Board was created on July 1, 1990. This was followed by the opening of new French-language school in Summerside-Miscouche, West Prince, and Rustico in 2000, and Souris in 2003. The Francophone Affairs Division was established on April 1, 1989 Under the French Language Services Act (2000), Prince Edward Island made a variety of mostly non-binding commitments to provide services in French, but according to a government report (as of 2005), many sections of the Act have not proclaimed into law, as the province is still in the process of building its capacity to deliver services in French.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, a 1968 amendment to the School Act permitted the establishment of designated French schools. Prior to this date, English was the only language which could be used as a language of instruction in Saskatchewan schools. The Language Act In 2010, the Government of Saskatchewan launched a bilingual website that indexes all the services it provides in French: bonjour.gov.sk.ca\n\nAccess to French-language education in British Columbia is determined not only by \"Charter\" rights under Section 23, but also by a provincial policy decision to extend French-language schooling to francophone non-citizens living in British Columbia. There are 59 regional English language school boards in the province and one province-wide francophone board. There is one French language college (Educacentre College), no French-language universities but some French-medium instruction at Simon Fraser University.\n\nOutside of education, there is no legal framework for minority language services by the civil service or the courts.\n\nMany Aboriginal and European languages were once widely spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador. However, Britain eventually gained firm and unchallenged control of the island and adjacent coast following the French defeat in the Seven Years' War, and English then became the language of administration and commerce, as in most of the British Empire. In isolated fishing villages many minority languages persisted in private use, however, until the coming of standardized education in the 19th, and more so the 20th centuries. When Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 it had already used English as the sole language of government for several centuries. Today, Newfoundland is the most linguistically homogeneous province in Canada. In 1999, 98% of the population spoke only English as their sole mother tongue. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has no statutory language policy, simply having inherited English from colonial times. The island of Newfoundland was once the homeland of the Beothuk language, and also seen some Mi'kmaq speakers. The Labrador coast is home to the Innu-aimun and Inuttut languages. Newfoundland was also home to unique regional dialects of the French and Irish Gaelic languages, now extinct, as well as smaller groups of Old Norse, Basque, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Scots Gaelic speakers. Today the Government offers minimal French-language services through its French-language webisite, in all other respects, it is English-only, including in the legislature, the courts, the schools, and the civil service.\n\nIn its January 2012 report on the costs and benefits of official bilingualism at the provincial level in Canada, the right-wing think tank, the Fraser Institute, identified several potential methods for classifying the provinces based on language circumstances and policies (territories were not included).\n\nFirst it stated that linguistic minorities were only of a significant size in three provinces, either in absolute numbers (Quebec [575,000] and Ontario [489,000]) or as a proportion (New Brunswick [just over 30%]), while in the other seven provinces minority communities are quite small, as low as 1.3% in British Columbia\n\nSecond, the report suggested that in six of the provinces, governments only offer those minority-language services they are obliged to under Section 23 of the \"Charter\" (i.e. education). In three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec) there are other constitutional rights that come into play, over and above Section 23. In Ontario, there is a developed policy of statutory (not constitutional) minority language rights.\n\n"}
{"id": "618592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618592", "title": "Languages of the Caucasus", "text": "Languages of the Caucasus\n\nThe Caucasian languages are a large and extremely varied array of languages spoken by more than ten million people in and around the Caucasus Mountains, which lie between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.\n\nLinguistic comparison allows these languages to be classified into several language families, with little or no discernible affinity to each other. However, the languages of the Caucasus are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \"family\" of languages.\n\nThree of these families have no current members outside the Caucasus, and are considered indigenous to the area. The term Caucasian languages is generally restricted to these families, which are spoken by about 11.2 million people.\n\n\nIt is commonly believed that all Caucasian languages have a large number of consonants. While this is certainly true for most members of the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families (inventories range up to the 80–84 consonants of Ubykh), the consonant inventories of the South Caucasian languages are not nearly as extensive, ranging from 28 (Georgian) to 30 (Laz) – comparable to languages like Russian (up to 37 consonant phonemes, depending on definition), Arabic (28 phonemes), and Western European languages (often more than 20 phonemes).\n\nThe autochthonous languages of the Caucasus share some areal features, such as the presence of ejective consonants and a highly agglutinative structure, and, with the sole exception of Mingrelian, all of them exhibit a greater or lesser degree of ergativity. Many of these features are shared with other languages that have been in the Caucasus for a long time, such as Ossetian (which has ejective sounds but no ergativity).\n\nSince the birth of comparative linguistics in the 19th century, the riddle of the apparently isolated Caucasian language families has attracted the attention of many scholars, who have endeavored to relate them to each other or to languages outside the Caucasus region. The most promising proposals are connections between the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families and each other or with languages formerly spoken in Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia.\n\nLinguists such as Sergei Starostin see the Northeast (Nakh-Dagestanian) and Northwest (Abkhaz–Adyghe) families as related and propose uniting them in a single North Caucasian family, sometimes called Caucasic or simply Caucasian. This theory excludes the South Caucasian languages, thereby proposing two indigenous language families. While these two families share many similarities, their morphological structure, with many morphemes consisting of a single consonant, make comparison between them unusually difficult, and it has not been possible to establish a genetic relationship with any certainty.\n\nThere are no known affinities between the South Caucasian and North Caucasian families. Nevertheless, some scholars have proposed the single name Ibero-Caucasian for all the Caucasian language families, North and South, in an attempt to unify the Caucasian languages under one family.\n\nSome linguists have claimed affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct Hattic language of central Anatolia. See the article on Northwest Caucasian languages for details.\n\nAlarodian is a proposed connection between Northeast Caucasian and the extinct Hurro-Urartian languages of Anatolia.\n\nLinguists such as Sergei Starostin have proposed a Dené–Caucasian macrofamily, which includes the North Caucasian languages together with Basque, Burushaski, Na-Dené, Sino-Tibetan, and Yeniseian. This proposal is rejected by most linguists.\n\nOther languages historically and currently spoken in the Caucasus area can be placed into families with a much wider geographical distribution.\n\nThe predominant Indo-European language in the Caucasus is Armenian, spoken by the Armenians (circa 11 million speakers). The Ossetians, speaking the Ossetian language, form another group of around 700,000 speakers. Other Indo-European languages spoken in the Caucasus include Greek (Pontic Greek), Persian (including Tat Persian), Kurdish, Talysh, Judeo-Tat, and the Slavic languages, such as Russian and Ukrainian, whose speakers number over a third of the total population of the Caucasus.\n\nTwo dialects of Neo-Aramaic are spoken in the Caucasus: Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, with around 30,000 speakers, and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, with around 1,000 speakers. Both of these were brought to the Caucasus by ethnic Assyrians fleeing Assyrian Genocide during World War One.\n\nA dialect of Arabic known as Shirvani Arabic was spoken natively in parts of Azerbaijan and Dagestan throughout medieval times until the early 20th century. In the nineteenth century, it was considered that the best literary Arabic was spoken in the mountains of Dagestan.\n\nSeveral Turkic languages are spoken in the Caucasus. Of these, Azerbaijani is predominant, with around 9 million speakers in Azerbaijan and more than 10 million in North Western Iran. Other Turkic languages spoken include Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai, Turkish, and Turkmen.\n\nThe Kalmyk language, spoken by descendants of Oirat-speakers from East Asia, is a Mongolic language.\n\n"}
{"id": "38751187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38751187", "title": "Lingua Franca Nova grammar", "text": "Lingua Franca Nova grammar\n\nThis article is an outline of the grammar of Lingua Franca Nova (a.k.a. LFN, Elefen), a proposed international auxiliary language originally created by C. George Boeree and elaborated by the members of the LFN community. LFN has an analytic grammar and resembles the grammars of languages such as the Haitian Creole, Papiamento, and Afrikaans. On the other hand, it uses a vocabulary drawn from several modern romance languages – Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French, and Italian.\n\nComplete grammars are available in English, French, Esperanto, and LFN.\n\nLFN has a strict word order. The general word order is:\n\nA noun phrase has this order:\n\nA verb phrase has this order:\n\nA prepositional phrase generally follows what it modifies, and has this order:\n\nThe roles of nouns in a sentence are indicated through prepositions and word order. There are no cases.\n\nNouns are commonly preceded by determiners. Plural nouns are formed by appending -s to nouns ending in vowels or -es to nouns ending in consonants. This does not alter the stress:\n\nMass nouns include liquids, powders, and substances, such as \"acua\" (water), \"arena\" (sand), and \"lenio\" (wood). They do not normally require determiners or the plural. However, one may add these to indicate specific examples or different types:\n\nGender is typically not indicated. If necessary, nouns may be followed by mas (male) or fema (female):\n\nA few terms for family members and traditional roles do show distinctions of gender. For example:\n\nApposition — the use of one noun to modify another — is mostly limited to names and titles:\n\nDeterminers in LFN precede the noun they modify. There are two articles: la (the) and un (a), used as in English:\n\nOther words function similarly:\n\nIn addition, numbers and possessive determiners (see below) are also used.\n\nPersonal pronouns are invariant:\n\nEl is used for people and higher animals. Its use can be extended metaphorically to lower animals, robots, the moon, hurricanes, etc. Lo is used for things, simple animals, plants, ideas, etc. The exact dividing line is left to the speaker.\n\nThere is an indefinite pronoun on, which is used like German \"man\" or French \"on\":\n\nThere are no gender distinctions between \"he\" and \"she\". If gender is significant, one can use words like la fem, la om, la fia, la fio, la fema, la mas (the woman, the man, the daughter, the son, the female, the male), etc, or gender-irrelevant terms such as la plu grande, la carnor, or la otra (the bigger one, the butcher, the other one).\n\nUnlike in the Romance languages, there is no polite/impolite contrast for the second person: tu is always used for the singular, vos always for the plural.\n\nThe reflexive pronouns are also me, nos, tu, and vos. For the third person, singular and plural, lfn uses se:\nThe possessive determiners are mea, nosa, tua, and vosa. Sua is used for all third persons:\n\nFor the possessive pronouns, LFN uses the possessive determiners, preceded by la:\n\nOther pronouns include the following:\n\nThere are no conjugations of verbs in LFN. The basic form remains the same regardless of person, number, or tense.\n\nThe present tense is represented by the basic verb: \n\nThe present tense is also used to indicate habitual actions and states, facts of nature, and as a \"historical\" tense, such as when relating a story that has been clearly established as occurring in the past:\n\nThe past tense is indicated by the particle ia: \n\nThe future tense is indicated by the particle va: \n\nThe particle ta indicates the irrealis mood and can be used where other languages might use a conditional or subjunctive mood. Its use is optional:\n\nOne combination ― ia ta ― is used to express \"would have\":\n\nCertain adverbs and verbal constructions add precision to the tenses:\n\nNegation is indicated by putting no before the tense particle or (in the present tense) the verb. Double negatives should be avoided:\n\nCommands are indicated by dropping the subject pronoun. Hortative sentences include the subject, but are preceded by ta ce:\n\nLo and on are used as dummy pronouns before verbs that refer to weather or other general situations:\n\nA verb that is fundamentally intransitive may be used as a transitive causal verb by moving the original subject to the object position, and adding a new subject:\n\nVerbs can be made into adjectives: The active participle is formed by adding -nte to the verb. For example, \"come\" becomes \"comente\", meaning \"eating\". This should never be used as a gerund, as it often is in English (e.g. \"I love eating\").\n\nOne can emphasize the idea that the subject is in the midst of an activity or process (the progressive aspect) using the active participle. Or one can use expressions such as \"en la media de\":\n\nThe passive participle is formed by adding -da to the verb. For example, \"come\" becomes \"comeda\", meaning \"eaten\". This should not be confused with the past tense.\n\nThe passive participle can be used to express the passive voice. Or one can usa a generic subject pronoun instead:\n\nVerbs can be used as nouns without change by adding la or other determiner. Without a determiner, the word serves as an infinitive or gerund:\n\nIn LFN, verbs often come in pairs. Some \"leading\" verbs are like modal verbs in English. However, the idea of leading verbs goes beyond modals to include \"attitudinal\" verbs such as finje (pretend) and pare (seem). There is no equivalent to the word \"to,\" and the \"following\" verb is left in its simplest form: \n\nSubject complements are introduced by es and words such as pare (seem) and deveni (become):\n\nObject complements are introduced by the preposition a:\n\nAdjectives follow the noun they modify, with two exceptions: Bon (good) and mal (bad) may come before the noun, due to their frequent use. Unlike the natural Romance languages, adjectives in LFN do not have gender or plural forms, i.e. they don't \"agree\" with the nouns they describe.\n\nThe comparative is made with plu (more) or min (less). \"The most\" is la plu and \"the least\" is la min:\n\nEquivalence is indicated with tan... como:\n\nLike verbs, adjectives can be used as nouns. For example, \"bela\" means \"beautiful\", but \"un bela\" means \"a beautiful one\" or \"a beauty.\" This works with participles, too: \"la studiante\" and \"la studiada\" mean \"the student\" and \"the studied,\" respectively, from the verb \"studia,\" \"study.\"\n\nAn adjective can be made into an abstract noun by adding -ia (-ity, -ness, -ship, -hood). In this way \"bela\" becomes \"belia,\" meaning beauty. This can also be used with nouns: \"madre\" (mother) becomes \"madria\" (motherhood).\n\nLFN doesn't have an explicit way of marking adverbs. Instead, any adjective can be used as an adverb by placing it after a verb or at the very beginning of the sentence. \"Un om felis\" for example means \"a happy man\", whereas \"el dansa felis\" means \"he/she dances happily\". Adverbs used to modify adjectives \"precede\" the adjective. Dedicated adverbs, such as \"aora\" and \"oji\" can fall anywhere, as long as they don't cause confusion.\n\nExamples of common adverbs include the following:\n\nPrepositions are placed before the noun or noun phrase, and the prepositional phrase is placed after the noun being modified, or, if used adverbially, at the beginning of the sentence or after the verb. There are 22 basic prepositions in LFN:\n\nSome prepositions can be used as adverbs by placing a or de before them.\n\nThere are three coordinating conjunctions in LFN and three correlative conjunctions:\n\nThere are a number of interrogative words that are used to introduce questions:\n\nFor example:\n\nQuestions may include one of these words or may be indicated by rising intonation alone. One may also express questions by beginning the sentence with the interrogative particle esce (\"is it that... ?\") or by adding no (no) or si (yes) to the end of the sentence. In writing, questions always end with a question mark (?):\n\n\nRelative clauses (or adjective clauses) function like adjectives. There are two relative pronouns which typically introduce relative clauses:\n\nRelative clauses follow the noun or noun phrase that they modify:\n\n\nRelative pronouns may be preceded by prepositions:\n\nCuando and do can also be used to introduce relative clauses:\n\n\nNoun clauses function the same way that nouns and noun phrases do in a sentence. Two subordinating conjunctions commonly introduce noun clauses:\n\nFor example:\n\n\nRelative pronouns and interrogative words can also introduce noun clauses:\n\n\nAdverbial clauses function like adverbs, modifying the verb or the sentence as a whole. Some are introduced by these subordinating conjunctions:\n\nAdverbial clauses usually follow the main clause:\n\n\nSome of the interrogative words can also be used to introduce adverbial clauses:\n\n\nDo and cuando are often preceded by prepositions:\n\nFor example:\n\n\nNumbers in LFN are as follows:\n\nHigher numbers are constructed as follows:\n\nNumbers that express quantity precede the noun; numbers that express order follow the noun:\n\nFractions are constructed with -i, e.g. dui, tri, cuatri... desi, senti, mili, etc. These are also used as verbs meaning \"to halve\", \"to divide into three parts\", etc.\n\nMultiples and groups can be referred to with -uple, as in duple ― \"double, duo, couple, pair\". Add -i to make a verb, such as dupli - \"to double\".\n"}
{"id": "13740841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13740841", "title": "Low Dietsch dialects", "text": "Low Dietsch dialects\n\nLow Dietsch (, , or ) refers to a handful of transitional Limburgish–Ripuarian dialects spoken in a number of towns and villages (e.g., Gemmenich, Hombourg, Montzen, Welkenraedt).\n\nThis area, located in the Belgian (Walloon) \"tri-state area\" from Voeren (Fourons), to Plombières (Bleiberg), to Eupen, is called the Low Dietsch zone (). Classified by German dialectologists as Ripuarian Franconian and by Dutch-language dialectologists as Southeast Limburgish, Low Dietsch is more precisely a transitional dialect between both. Low Dietsch is one of several Meuse-Rhenish varieties that make the north-western part of the dialect continuum known as the Rhenish fan. As the southernmost dialect of Limburgish, the Low-Dietsch speech area corresponds to the core of the old Duchy of Limburg.\n\nIn French, the term (\"Carolingian Franconian\") is also used, because it is thought to be the language of the Carolingian dynasty and court, although that would be an anachronism. Low Dietsch is thought to have been spoken from Tongeren to Cologne, which would presumably make it the likeliest candidate for Charlemagne's native language. However, this expression is controversial since there is no way to prove that hypothesis. Nor is it possible that the current dialectal map was the same 1,500 years ago. Of those early documents that have survived, one, the Strasbourg Oaths (AD 842), is in Rhine Franconian, and the other, the \"Wachtendonck Psalms\" (10th century), is in a form of southern Limburgish (with a few Ripuarian Franconian traits).\n\nIn 1963 the Low Dietsch zone was incorporated to Wallonia, and since 1992 the dialect has been recognized as a \"regional language\" by the Walloon authority, affording it certain rights and protections. It is not, however, related to Walloon, but French is the language of officialdom in the area. It forms the northwestern border of Ripuarian Franconian and the southeastern portion of the Meuse-Rhenish area.\nSoutheast Limburgish (), as spoken around Kerkrade, Bocholtz and Vaals in the Netherlands, Aachen in Germany and Raeren and Eynatten in Belgium, also shows the gradual transition from Limburgish towards Ripuarian. It is adjacent to the southeastern border of the Meuse-Rhenish language area, and is related to Southern Meuse-Rhenish. Limburgish straddles the borderline between Low Franconian and West Central German varieties. They are more-or-less mutually intelligible with the Ripuarian dialects, but show fewer 'High German shifts' (R. Hahn 2001).\n\nDialects belonging to the Ripuarian group almost always call themselves \"Platt\" like \"Öcher Platt\" (of Aachen) or \"Eischwiele Platt\" (of Eschweiler). The reason behind this is, that most of the far more than hundred Ripuarian dialects are bound to a village or municipality. Usually there are small distinctive differences between neighboring dialects, and increasingly bigger ones between the more distant ones. These are described by a set of isoglosses called the 'Rhenish fan' (\"Rheinischer Fächer\" in linguistics). The way someone talks, even if he is not using Ripuarian, quite often makes it possible to trace him precisely to the village or city quarter where he learned to speak.\n\nCurrently, all varieties within a half circle some 15–20 km around Aachen, including two-thirds of Dutch South Limburg and also the Low Dietsch area between Voeren and Eupen in Belgium, can be considered a group of its own, which recently has been named Limburgish of the Three Countries (, ), referring to the place where the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany meet (Frins 2005). This variety still possesses interesting syntactic idiosyncrasies, probably dating from the period when the old Duchy of Limburg existed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1635646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1635646", "title": "Monocropping", "text": "Monocropping\n\nMonocropping is the agricultural practice of growing a single crop year after year on the same land, in the absence of rotation through other crops or growing multiple crops on the same land polyculture. Corn, soybeans, and wheat are three common crops often grown using monocropping techniques.\n\nMonocropping allows for farmers to have consistent crops throughout their entire farm. They can use the same seed, pest control, machinery and growing method on their entire farm giving them a larger yield for a significantly lower cost. \n\nWhile economically a very efficient system, allowing for specialization in equipment and crop production, monocropping is also controversial, as it damages the soil ecology (including depletion or reduction in diversity of soil nutrients) and provide an unbuffered niche for parasitic species, increasing crop vulnerability to opportunistic insects, plants, and microorganisms. The result is a more fragile ecosystem with an increased dependency on pesticides and artificial fertilizers. The concentrated presence of a single cultivar, genetically adapted with a single resistance strategy, presents a situation in which an entire crop can be wiped out very quickly by a single opportunistic species. An example of this would be the potato famine of Ireland in 1845–1849, and according to Devlin Kuyek is the main cause of the current food crisis with monoculture rice crops failing as the effects of climate change become more acute.\n\nMonocropping as an agricultural strategy tends to emphasize the use of expensive specialized farm equipment—an important component in realizing its efficiency goals. This can lead to an increased dependency on fossil fuels and reliance on expensive machinery that cannot be produced locally and may need to be financed. This can make a significant change in the economics of farming in regions that are accustomed to self-sufficiency in agricultural production. In addition, political complications may ensue when these dependencies extend across national boundaries.\n\nThe controversies surrounding monocropping are complex, but traditionally the core issues concern the balance between its advantages in increasing short-term food production—especially in hunger-prone regions—and its disadvantages with respect to long-term land stewardship and the fostering of local economic independence and ecological sustainability. Advocates of monocropping tend to claim that in its absence many human populations would be reduced to starvation or to a degraded level of civilization comparable to the Dark Ages. On the other hand, critics of monocropping dispute these claims and attribute them to corporate special interest groups, citing the damage that monocropping causes to societies and the environment.\n\nA difficulty with monocropping is that the solution to one problem—whether economic, environmental or political—may result in a cascade of other problems. For example, a well-known concern is pesticides and fertilizers seeping into surrounding soil and groundwater from extensive monocropped acreage in the U.S. and abroad. This issue, especially with respect to the pesticide DDT, played an important role in focusing public attention on ecology and pollution issues during the 1960s when Rachel Carson published her landmark book \"Silent Spring\".\n\nSoil depletion is also a negative effect of mono-cropping. Crop rotation plays an important role in replenishing soil nutrients, especially atmospheric nitrogen converted to usable forms by nitrogen-fixing plants used in fallow fields. In addition, it performs an important role in preventing pathogen and pest build-up. In a monocropping regime, farmers are less likely to rotate their crops and replenish such essential soil nutrients. In addition, artificial high-nitrogen fertilizers can \"burn\" the soil by creating an unfavorable environment for indigenous organisms, a phenomenon well-known to organic gardeners and farmers (who avoid it), resulting in further disruption of soil ecology and dependence on further short-term fertilizer strategies. Lacking a stable ecology, in the absence of substantial irrigation and chemical \"fixes\", the soil can become dry and begin to erode. As the soil becomes arid and useless, the need for more land becomes an issue, leading to the destruction of even more land—a high-tech version of slash and burn agriculture.\n\nUnder certain circumstances monocropping can lead to deforestation or the displacement of indigenous peoples. For example, since 1970 the Amazon Rainforest has lost nearly 1/5 of its forest cover. A main cause of this deforestation is local farmers clearing land for more crops. In Colombia, the need for more farming land is causing the displacement of large populations of peasants.\n\nIn order to help reduce dependence on fossil fuels the U.S. government subsidizes the monocropping of corn and soybeans to be used in ethanol production. However, monocropping itself is highly chemical- and energy-intensive, as studies by Nelson (2006) indicate. Such studies have shown that the \"hidden\" energy costs associated with producing each unit of bio-fuel are significantly larger than the amount of energy available from the fuel itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "21269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21269", "title": "Nasreddin", "text": "Nasreddin\n\nNasreddin or Nasreddin Hodja () was a Seljuq satirical, born in Hortu Village in Sivrihisar, Eskişehir Province, present-day Turkey and died in 13th century in Akşehir, near Konya, a capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, in today's Turkey. He is considered a populist philosopher and wise man, remembered for his funny stories and anecdotes. He appears in thousands of stories, sometimes witty, sometimes wise, but often, too, a fool or the butt of a joke. A Nasreddin story usually has a subtle humour and a pedagogic nature. \nThe International Nasreddin Hodja festival is celebrated between the 5th and 10th of July in his hometown every year.\n\nClaims about his origin are made by many ethnic groups. Many sources give the birthplace of Nasreddin as Hortu Village in Sivrihisar, Eskişehir Province, present-day Turkey, in the 13th century, after which he settled in Akşehir, and later in Konya under the Seljuq rule, where he died in 1275/6 or 1285/6 CE. The alleged tomb of Nasreddin is in Akşehir and the \"International Nasreddin Hodja Festival\" is held annually in Akşehir between 5–10 July.\n\nAccording to Prof. Mikail Bayram who made an extensive research on Nasreddin, his full name is Nasir ud-din Mahmood al-Khoyi, his title Ahi Evran (as being the leader of the ahi organization). According to him, Nasreddin was born in the city of Khoy in West Azerbaijan Province of Iran, had his education in Khorasan and became the pupil of famous Quran mufassir Fakhr al-Din al-Razi in Herat. He was sent to Anatolia by the Khalif in Baghdad to organize resistance and uprising against the Mongol invasion. He served as a kadı (an Islamic judge and ombudsman) in Kayseri. This explains why he addresses judicial problems in the jokes not only religious ones. During the turmoil of the Mongol invasion he became a political opponent of Persian Rumi. He was addressed in Masnavi by juha anecdotes for this reason. He became the vazir at the court of Kaykaus II. Having lived in numerous cities in vast area and being steadfastly against the Mongol invasion as well as having his witty character, he was embraced by various nations and cultures from Turkey to Arabia, from Persia to Afghanistan, and from Russia to China, most of which suffered from those invasions.\n\nAs generations have gone by, new stories have been added to the Nasreddin corpus, others have been modified, and he and his tales have spread to many regions. The themes in the tales have become part of the folklore of a number of nations and express the national imaginations of a variety of cultures. Although most of them depict Nasreddin in an early small-village setting, the tales deal with concepts that have a certain timelessness. They purvey a pithy folk wisdom that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The oldest manuscript of Nasreddin dates to 1571.\n\nToday, Nasreddin stories are told in a wide variety of regions, especially across the Muslim world and have been translated into many languages. Some regions independently developed a character similar to Nasreddin, and the stories have become part of a larger whole. In many regions, Nasreddin is a major part of the culture, and is quoted or alluded to frequently in daily life. Since there are thousands of different Nasreddin stories, one can be found to fit almost any occasion. Nasreddin often appears as a whimsical character of a large Persian, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Judeo-Spanish, Kurdish, Romanian, Serbian, Russian, and Urdu folk tradition of vignettes, not entirely different from zen koans.\n\n1996–1997 was declared International Nasreddin Year by UNESCO.\n\nMany peoples of the Near, Middle East, South Asia and Central Asia claim Nasreddin as their own (\"e.g.\", Turks, Afghans, Iranians, and Uzbeks). His name is spelt in a wide variety of ways: \"Nasrudeen\", \"Nasrudin\", \"Nasruddin\", \"Nasr ud-Din\", \"Nasredin\", \"Nasiruddin,\" \"Naseeruddin\", \"Nasr Eddin\", \"Nastradhin\", \"Nasreddine\", \"Nastratin\", \"Nusrettin\", \"Nasrettin\", \"Nostradin\", \"Nastradin\" (lit.: Victory of the Deen) and \"Nazaruddin\". It is sometime preceded or followed by a title or honorific used in the corresponding cultures: \"Hoxha\", \"Khwaje\", \"Hodja\", \"Hoja\", \"Hojja\", \"Hodscha\", \"Hodža\", \"Hoca\", \"Hocca\",\"Hooka\",\n\"Hogea\", \"Mullah\", \"Mulla\", \"Mula\", \"Molla\", \"Efendi\", \"Afandi\", \"Ependi\" ( \"’afandī\"), \"Hajji\". In several cultures he is named by the title alone.\n\nIn Arabic-speaking countries this character is known as \"Juha\", \"Djoha\", \"Djuha\", \"Dschuha\", \"Chotzas\", \"Goha\" ( \"juḥā\"). Juha was originally a separate folk character found in Arabic literature as early as the 9th century, and was widely popular by the 11th century. Lore of the two characters became amalgamated in the 19th century when collections were translated from Arabic into Turkish and Persian.\n\nIn Sicily and Southern Italy he is known as \"Giufà\".\n\nIn the Swahili and Indonesian culture, many of his stories are being told under the name of \"Abunuwasi\" or \"Abunawas\", though this confuses Nasreddin with an entirely different man – the poet Abu Nuwas, known for homoerotic verse.\n\nIn China, where stories of him are well known, he is known by the various transliterations from his Uyghur name, 阿凡提 (Āfántí) and 阿方提 (Āfāngtí). The Uyghurs believe that he was from Xinjiang, while the Uzbeks believe he was from Bukhara. Shanghai Animation Film Studio produced a 13-episode Nasreddin related animation called 'The Story of Afanti'/ 阿凡提 in 1979, which became one of the most influential animations in China's history. The musical Nasirdin Apandim features the legend of Nasreddin effendi (\"sir, lord\"), largely sourced from Uighur folklore.\n\nIn Central Asia, he is commonly known as \"Afandi\". The Central Asian peoples also claim his local origin, as do Uyghurs.\n\nThe Nasreddin stories are known throughout the Middle East and have touched cultures around the world. Superficially, most of the Nasreddin stories may be told as jokes or humorous anecdotes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasreddin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, followed by a moral and usually the little extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic a little further on the way to realization.\n\nNasreddin was the main character in a magazine, called simply Molla Nasraddin, published in Azerbaijan and \"read across the Muslim world from Morocco to Iran\". The eight-page Azerbaijani satirical periodical was published in Tiflis (from 1906 to 1917), Tabriz (in 1921) and Baku (from 1922 to 1931) in the Azeri and occasionally Russian languages. Founded by Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, it depicted inequality, cultural assimilation, and corruption and ridiculed the backward lifestyles and values of clergy and religious fanatics, implicitly calling upon the readers to modernize and accept Western social norms and practices. The magazine was frequently banned but had a lasting influence on Azerbaijani and Iranian literature.\n\nSome Nasreddin tales also appear in collections of Aesop's fables. \"The miller, his son and the donkey\" is one example. Others are \"The Ass with a Burden of Salt\" (Perry Index 180) and \"The Satyr and the Traveller.\"\n\nIn some Bulgarian folk tales that originated during the Ottoman period, the name appears as an antagonist to a local wise man, named \"Sly Peter\". In Sicily the same tales involve a man named \"Giufà\". In Sephardic culture, spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, a character that appears in many folk tales is named \"Djohá\".\n\nIn Romanian, the existing stories come from an 1853 verse compilation edited by Anton Pann, a philologist and poet renowned for authoring the current Romanian anthem.\n\nNasreddin is mostly known as a character from short tales; whole novels and stories have later been written and production began on a never-completed animated feature film. In Russia, Nasreddin is known mostly because of the Russian work \"Возмутитель спокойствия\" by Leonid Solovyov (English translations: \"The Beggar in the Harem: Impudent Adventures in Old Bukhara\", 1956, and \"The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin: Disturber of the Peace\", 2009). The composer Shostakovich celebrated Nasreddin, among other figures, in the second movement (\"Yumor\", \"Humor\") of his Symphony No. 13. The text, by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, portrays humor as a weapon against dictatorship and tyranny. Shostakovich's music shares many of the \"foolish yet profound\" qualities of Nasreddin's sayings listed above.\n\nThe Graeco-Armenian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff often referred to \"our own dear Mullah Nasr Eddin\", also\ncalling him an \"incomparable teacher\", particularly in his book \"Beelzebub's Tales\". Sufi philosopher Idries Shah published several collections of Nasruddin stories in English, and emphasized their teaching value.\n\nHe is known as \"Mullah Nasruddin\" in South Asian children's books.\n\nFor Uzbek people, Nasreddin is one of their own; he is said to have lived and been born in Bukhara. In gatherings, family meetings, and parties they tell each other stories about him that are called \"latifa\" of \"afandi\".\nThere are at least two collections of stories related to Nasriddin Afandi.\n\nBooks on him:\n\n\nIn 1943, the Soviet film \"Nasreddin in Bukhara\" was directed by Yakov Protazanov based on Solovyov's book, followed in 1947 by a film called \"The Adventures of Nasreddin\", directed by Nabi Ganiyev and also set in the Uzbekistan SSR.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17899435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17899435", "title": "Pahawh Hmong", "text": "Pahawh Hmong\n\nPahawh Hmong (: \"Phajhauj Hmoob\" , known also as \"Ntawv Pahawh, Ntawv Keeb, Ntawv Caub Fab, Ntawv Soob Lwj)\" is an indigenous semi-syllabic script, invented in 1959 by Shong Lue Yang, to write two Hmong languages, Hmong Daw \"(Hmoob Dawb\" White Miao) and Hmong Njua Hmong Leng \"(Moob Leeg\" Green Miao).\n\nPahawh is written left to right. Each syllable is written with two letters, an onset \"(la,\" an initial consonant or consonant cluster) and a rime \"(yu,\" a vowel, diphthong, or vowel plus final consonant). However, the order of these elements is rime-initial, the opposite of their spoken order. (That is, each syllable would seem to be written right to left, if it were transcribed literally into the Roman alphabet.) This is an indication that Shong conceived of the rimes as primary; Pahawh Hmong might therefore be thought of as a vowel-centered abugida. Tones and many onsets are distinguished by diacritics.\n\nThe onset \"k\" is not written, so that a rime letter (V) written by itself is read as \"kV.\" Nor is the rime \"au\" (on mid tone) written, so that an onset letter (C) written by itself is read \"Cau,\" except following a bare rime, as otherwise these could be read as a single syllable. The \"absence\" of an onset, however, is indicated with a null-onset letter. Again, this is similar to an abugida, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed.\n\nFor an example of the positional variation, consider the phrase (in RPA orthography) \"kuv rau tshais rau koj noj\" \"I serve you breakfast\". Since the first word, \"kuv,\" starts with a \"k,\" it is written as the bare rime \"uv\" in Pahawh. The word \"rau,\" with mid-tone \"au\" as the rime, is normally written as a bare onset \"r,\" and indeed this is the case for the second instance in this sentence. However, since the first \"rau\" follows a bare rime, it cannot be written as a bare onset \"r,\" or the combination might be read as \"ruv\" rather than \"kuv rau.\" Therefore, the combination \"kuv rau\" is written \"uv rau\" rather than \"uv r,\" with the rime \"au\" made explicit (Smalley \"et al.\" 1990:58).\n\nPahawh has twenty onset letters to transcribe sixty phonemic onsets. This is accomplished with two diacritics, a dot and a tack, written above the onset. However, although there is some scattered similarity between the sounds of the resulting forms, there is no overall pattern to the system. For example, the letter for \"h\" with a dot is pronounced \"th,\" and with a tack is pronounced \"pl.\" The null consonant does not take diacritics in Hmong Daw, but does in Hmong Njua, for two onsets, \"ndl\" and \"ndlh,\" which only occur in Hmong Njua. (Similarly, Daw \"d\" and \"dh,\" which do not occur in Njua, are used for Njua \"dl\" and \"dlh,\" which do not occur in Daw.)\n\nThe rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are thirteen rime sounds, but twenty-six letters to represent them. One of each pair takes four of the eight tones, while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written \"-d\" in RPA, is not phonemic but is a prosodic unit-final allophone of the creaky register \"-m.\" It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a short stroke, but it is not used by many people.\n\nShong used the rimes with the values \"kiab\" and \"kab\" in Hmong Daw for \"kab\" and \"kaab\" () in Hmong Njua. However, Cwjmem retains the Daw values for Njua and adds a pipe (|) to the left of \"kab\" etc. to write \"kaab\" etc.\n\nIn addition to phonetic elements, Pahawh Hmong has a minor logographic component, with characters for\n\nPunctuation is derived from the Roman alphabet, presumably through French or Lao, except for a sign introduced by one of Shong's disciples that replaced Shong's , but also includes a native sign for reduplication and a native cantillation mark.\n\nThere are two orthographic systems in use for Pahawh Hmong, the \"second reduced stage\" from 1965 and the \"third reduced stage\" from 1970 (see history, below). Some Hmong communities consider second stage to be more authentic, while others prefer third stage as more regular. It would appear that stage two is more widespread.\n\nThe differences are primarily in tone assignment. Bare rimes—that is, rime letters without a tone diacritic—have various values in stage two, but are regularly high tone \"(-b)\" or rising tone \"(-v)\" in stage three. Likewise, although the pedagogic charts are organized so that each column corresponds to a single tone, the tonic diacritics are scattered about the columns in stage two, but correspond to them in stage three. (Stage 4, which today is only used for shorthand, dispenses with the \"-v\" rime letters, replacing them with additional diacritics on the \"-b\" rime letters, so that each rime and tone has a single dedicated glyph.)\n\nTone transcription is that of the Romanized Popular Alphabet.\n\nPahawh Hmong was the product of a native messianic movement, based on the idea that, throughout history, God had given the Hmong power through the gift of writing, and revoked it as divine retribution.\n\nIn 1959 Shong Lue Yang (\"Soob Lwj Yaj\"), a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created Pahawh. Yang was not previously literate in any language. An illiterate peasant, Shong claimed to be the Son of God, messiah of the Hmong and Khmu people, and that God had revealed Pahawh to him in 1959, in northern Vietnam near the border with Laos, to restore writing to the Hmong and Khmu people. Over the next twelve years he and his disciples taught it as part of a Hmong cultural revival movement, mostly in Laos after Shong had fled Communist Vietnam. The Khmuic version of the script never caught on, and has disappeared. Shong continually modified the Hmong script, producing four increasingly sophisticated versions, until he was assassinated by Laotian soldiers in 1971 to stop his growing influence as part of the opposition resistance. Knowledge of the later stages of Pahawh come to us through his disciple Chia Koua Vang, who corresponded with Shong in prison.\n\n\n\nPahawh is not as widespread as RPA romanization for writing Hmong, partially because of the difficulties in typesetting it, but it is a source of great pride for many Hmong who do not use it, as in Southeast Asia every respectable language has a script of its own, which RPA does not provide. However, for some educated Hmong, Pahawh is considered an embarrassing remnant of a superstitious past (Smalley \"et al.\" 1990:165).\n\nChao Fa (means \"Lord of the Sky\" in Lao, Hmong: \"Cob Fab\" ), an anti-Laotian government Hmong group, uses this writing system.\n\nBecause Shong was illiterate, it is sometimes assumed that he invented Pahawh \"ex nihilo.\" However, Shong was acutely aware of writing and of the advantages that it provided; indeed, that was the basis of his messianic movement. It would appear that existing scripts provided his inspiration, even if he did not fully understand them, much as the Roman alphabet inspired the illiterate Sequoyah when he invented the Cherokee script, in a process called trans-cultural diffusion. Not only do the forms of the majority of the letters in the oldest stage of Pahawh closely resemble the letters of the local Lao alphabet and missionary scripts such as Pollard and Fraser, though they are independent in sound value (much like the relationship between Roman and Cherokee), but the appearance of vowel and tone diacritics in those scripts, which would appear nearly random to the illiterate, may explain the idiosyncratic use of diacritics in early Pahawh. Nevertheless, even if the graphic forms of Pahawh letters derive from other scripts, much of the typology of the script, with its primary rimes and secondary onsets, would appear to be Shong's invention.\n\nThe later stages of Pahawh became typologically more like Lao and the Roman alphabet, suggesting that perhaps they influenced its evolution. However, even from the start, Pahawh is \"fascinatingly similar [...] and fascinatingly different\" from the Lao alphabet (Smalley \"et al.\" 1990:90). For example, it resembles an abugida such as Lao where the order of writing does not reflect the order of speech, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. There is an inherent vowel, as in Lao, though only on one tone, but also an inherent consonant. In Lao, tone depends on the consonant; it is modified with diacritics, but the patterns of modification are complex. In early Pahawh, tone depends on the rime and is modified with irregular diacritics. Starting with stage 2, there are two tone-classes of rime, just as in Lao there are two tone-classes of consonant.\n\nNearly all other scripts invented by illiterates are syllabaries like Cherokee. However, to represent Hmong as a syllabary, Pahawh would have needed 60×91 = 5460 letters. By breaking each syllable in two in the fashion of Chinese phonetics, Shong was able to write Hmong, in his original version, with a mere 60+91 = 151 letters.\n\nThe Pahawh Hmong alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Pahawh Hmong is U+16B00–U+16B8F:\n\n\n"}

Reshaina, where he lived, is located about midway between the then intellectual centres of Edessa and Nisibis, in northern Mesopotamia. \n\nThe ninth-century translator Hunain ibn Ishaq gives the names of twenty-six medical texts by Galen which Sergius translated into Syriac; they were the first significant translations of medical works from Greek into a Semitic language, and presumably were the textbooks Sergius himself had used when he studied at Alexandria. Hunain is not always complimentary about Sergius's translations, though some he thinks are better, as Sergius became more experienced. Sergius also translated various other works, including the \"Categories\" of Aristotle, Porphyry's \"Introduction to the Categories\" and theological works by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. He also composed two works of his own, \"On the Influence of the Moon\" and \"The Movement on the Sun\", probably drawing heavily on Greek sources.\n\nRecently (early 21st century), a palimpsest with an undertext of Galen, translated by Sergius from Greek to Syriac, gathered the attention of scientists. It contains chapters of Galen's \"On Simple Drugs\" that had been lost. The imaging and reading of the text is considered crucial, as it will elucidate the role that Sergius played in the transmission of medical knowledge from Greek into Arabic. Sergius' translations of Galen were copied and recopied for centuries, and eventually became a bridge for moving the medical expertise of the ancient Greeks to Islamic societies. Syriac texts were much easier than Greek ones to translate into Arabic.\n\nAlthough Sergius kept in close contact with the mostly Nestorian scholars nearby, he was himself a Monophysite Christian priest.

He earned his BA and PhD from Fuad al-Awal University, which would later be known as Cairo University. He was later a professor of Arabic literature at his alma mater for several decades. He was a member of the Egyptian Academy of Sciences and was president of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo for a few years.\n\nDaif studied Egyptian literary history under Ahmad Amin during the latter's 1939–1946 tenure. Amin stated his initial belief that Egyptians had not contributed to Arabic poetry during the Middle Ages the way other Arab populations had. Daif replied that the dearth of properly published Egyptian works from the period made such a judgement tenuous and suggested that he and Amin republish the Egyptian sections in anthologies of poetry from the period. Amin redily agreed, and they embarked on the long term project during which Daif wrote the preface and Amin wrote the introduction. Fellow scholar Ihsan Abbas assisted with editing the folios for republishing from 1951 to 1952.\n\nDaif would later author more than 50 works in arts and literature. His study of the development of Arabic poetry during the Umayyad Caliphate is still considered to be the most important reference book on the topic. His magnum opus was his 100-volume \"History of Arabic Literature\", a project that took 30 years to complete, and was an overview of all poetry, literary criticism and rhetorical studies from Pre-Islamic Arabia up to the post-Abbasid era. The work is considered indispensable for students of Arabic literature, and some volumes have been reprinted up to 20 times.\n\nDaif caused minor shockwaves during the mid-20th century when he rediscovered the ancient linguistic tract of Ibn Maḍāʾ known as \"Refutation of the Grammarians\". Daif agreed with the central theme of the \"Refutation\": linguistic governance and analogy had rendered Arabic language education needlessly difficult and convoluted, and both took the theme as a rallying point for his calls to modernize language arts education in the Middle East.\n\nDaif was widely respected throughout the Arab world, having earned the King Faisal International Prize for literature in 1983 as well as the Egyptian Presidential Prize for Literature in 2003. During his career, he was also awarded two state prizes in Egypt and the Academy of the Arabic Language Prize.\n\nDaif had many admirers and critics.

KG () is a German fine writing instrument company and a manufacturer and supplier of writing, artist, and engineering drawing instruments. The firm was founded by J.S. Staedtler in 1835 and produces a large variety of writing instruments, including drafting pencils, propelling pencils, professional pens and standard wooden pencils. It also produces plastic erasers, rulers, compasses and other drawing/writing accessories. Staedtler claims to be the largest European manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, OHP pens, mechanical pencil leads, erasers, and modelling clays. Staedtler has over 20 global subsidiaries and seven manufacturing facilities. Over 85% of the production takes place in the headquarters in Nuremberg, though some of its products are made in Japan. Its \"Noris\" line of pencils are extremely common in British schools.\n\nThe origins of the brand can be traced since the XVII century, when Friedrich Staedtler took over the totality of the pencil manufacturing process, from the lead to the wood. Nevertheless, that activity was forbidden by the Council of Nuremberg, which stated that the manufacturing had to be developed by two different experts. Finally, Staedtler's work helped to abolish that regulation, therefore facilitating the work of other pencils manufacturers in Nuremberg.\n\nThe company was founded by Johann Sebastian Staedtler in 1835 as a pencil factory, first established in Nuremberg, but the roots of the company go back to 1662, when references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annals. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce blacklead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901 the \"Mars\" and \"Noris\" brands were created. In 1922 the US subsidiary (located in New York) was established, which was followed by the Japan subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to \"Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory\" and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949 began the production of ballpoint pens, which started to be widely used instead of fountain pens (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).\n\nIn 1950 propelling pencils (or mechanical pencils) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of wood. Four years later, the \"Lumocolor\" brand was registered. This brand was used to design the wide range of Staedtler markers. In 1962 the company began producing technical pens.\nAs from 2010, FIMO, MALI, Aquasoft and further brands are being marketed under the Staedtler name. In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2010.\n\nStaedtler's first logo came in 1908, when the company introduced the head of Mars (the god of war in Ancient Rome religion), for its homonymous brand of pencils. The Mars figure became the official logo of the whole company in 1958.\n\nThe image of the head of Mars has had several style modifications since its creation, specifically in 1912, 1925, 1952, 1957, 1963, 1973 and 2001. \n\nThe following chart contains all the Staedtler product lines.\nStaedtler products have been manufactured in Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\n\nStaedtler is committed to introducing innovative products and has won awards as a result. Most recently, the Wopex Graphite Pencils (design with TEAMS Design) and the Triplus line have won awards.\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n"}

The idiom is glossed in the original sources as being used of a person who is guilty of the very thing of which they accuse another and is thus an example of psychological projection.\n\nThe earliest appearance of the idiom is in Thomas Shelton's 1620 translation of the Spanish novel \"Don Quixote\". The protagonist is growing increasingly restive under the criticisms of his servant Sancho Panza, of which one is that \"You are like what is said that the frying-pan said to the kettle, 'Avant, black-browes'.\" The Spanish text at this point reads: \"Dijo la sartén a la caldera, Quítate allá ojinegra\" (Said the pan to the pot, get out of there black-eyes). It is identified as a proverb (\"refrán\") in the text, functioning as a retort to the person who criticises another of the same defect that he plainly has. Among several variations, the one where the pan addresses the pot as \"culinegra\" (black-arse) makes clear that they are dirtied in common by contact with the cooking fire.\n\nThis version was also recorded in England soon afterwards as \"The pot calls the pan burnt-arse\" in John Clarke's collection of proverbs, \"Paroemiologia Anglo-Latina\" (1639). A nearer approach to the present wording is provided by William Penn in his collection \"Some Fruits of Solitude in Reflections and Maxims\" (1682):\nApart from the final example in this passage, there is not a strict accord between the behaviour of the critic and the person censured.\n\nAn alternative modern interpretation, far removed from the original intention, argues that while the pot is sooty (being placed on a fire), the kettle is shiny (being placed on coals only); hence, when the pot accuses the kettle of being black, it is the pot's own sooty reflection that it sees: the pot accuses the kettle of a fault that only the pot has, rather than one that they share. The point is illustrated by a poem that appeared anonymously in an early issue of \"St. Nicholas Magazine\" from 1876:\n\n"}

Apart from numerous short stories he also wrote novels, tales, diaries, poems, radio plays and (beginning in the 1960s) children's books which he partly illustrated himself.\n\nSchnurre grew up in Frankfurt before his father, a librarian, moved to Berlin in 1928. Here Schnurre attended a socialist elementary school and grammar school. Between 1939 and 1945 he involuntarily became a Wehrmacht soldier. In April 1945 he fled to Westphalia and returned to Berlin after the end of war. In the beginning he lived in the Eastern part of the city, but in 1946 he moved to West Berlin. In the following years he worked as theatre and movie reviewer for \"Deutsche Rundschau\" and other Berlin newspapers.\n\nFrom 1950 Schnurre was an independent writer. He was a founding member of the literary association \"Gruppe 47\" and his short story \"Das Begräbnis\" (The Funeral) was the first piece of literature read at the group's initial meeting. He was also member of PEN in the Federal republic of Germany which he left in 1961 to protest against PEN's silence after the construction of the Berlin Wall. Since 1959 Schnurre was member of the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt.

{"id": "95357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95357", "title": "Wolof language", "text": "Wolof language\n\nWolof () is a language of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, and the native language of the Wolof people. Like the neighbouring languages Serer and Fula, it belongs to the Senegambian branch of the Niger–Congo language family. Unlike most other languages of the Niger-Congo family, Wolof is not a tonal language. \n\nWolof originated as the language of the Lebu people. It is the most widely spoken language in Senegal, spoken natively by the Wolof people (40% of the population) but also by most other Senegalese as a second language.\n\nWolof dialects vary geographically and between rural and urban areas. \"Dakar-Wolof\", for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, French, and Arabic.\n\n\"Wolof\" is the standard spelling and may refer to the Wolof people or to Wolof culture. Variants include the older French \"Ouolof\" and the principally Gambian \"Wollof\", \"Jolof\", \"jollof\", etc., which now typically refers either to the Jolof Empire or to jollof rice, a common West African rice dish. Now-archaic forms include \"Volof\" and \"Olof\".\n\nThe English language is believed to have adopted some Wolof words, such as \"banana\", via Spanish or Portuguese, and \"yum/yummy\", from Wolof \"nyam\" \"to taste\"; \"nyam\" in several Caribbean English Creoles meaning \"to eat\" (compare Seychellois Creole \"nyanmnyanm\", also meaning \"to eat\").\n\nWolof is spoken by more than 10 million people and about 40 percent (approximately 5 million people) of Senegal's population speak Wolof as their native language. Increased mobility, and especially the growth of the capital Dakar, created the need for a common language: today, an additional 40 percent of the population speak Wolof as a second or acquired language. In the whole region from Dakar to Saint-Louis, and also west and southwest of Kaolack, Wolof is spoken by the vast majority of the people. Typically when various ethnic groups in Senegal come together in cities and towns, they speak Wolof. It is therefore spoken in almost every regional and departmental capital in Senegal. Nevertheless, the official language of Senegal is French.\n\nIn The Gambia, although about 20–25 percent of the population speak Wolof as a first language, it has a disproportionate influence because of its prevalence in Banjul, the Gambian capital, where 75 percent of the population use it as a first language. Furthermore, in Serekunda, The Gambia's largest town, although only a tiny minority are ethnic Wolofs, approximately 70 percent of the population speaks and/or understands Wolof. \n\nIn Mauritania, about seven percent of the population (approximately 185,000 people) speak Wolof. Most live near or along the Senegal River that Mauritania shares with Senegal. \n\nWolof is one of the Senegambian languages, which are characterized by consonant mutation. It is often said to be closely related to the Fula language because of a misreading by Wilson (1989) of the data in Sapir (1971) that have long been used to classify the Atlantic languages.\n\nSenegalese/Mauritanian Wolof and Gambian Wolof are distinct national standards: they use different orthographies and use different languages (French vs English) as their source for technical loanwords. However, both the spoken and written languages are mutually intelligible. Lebu Wolof, on the other hand, is unintelligible with standard Wolof, a distinction that has been obscured because all Lebu speakers are bilingual in standard Wolof.\n\n\"Note:\" Phonetic transcriptions are printed between square brackets [] following the rules of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n\nThe Latin orthography of Wolof in Senegal was set by government decrees between 1971 and 1985. The language institute \"Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar\" (CLAD) is widely acknowledged as an authority when it comes to spelling rules for Wolof. The complete alphabet is A, À, B, C, D, E, É, Ë, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, Ŋ, O, Ó, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, X, Y.\n\nWolof is most often written in this orthography, in which phonemes have a clear one-to-one correspondence to graphemes.\n\nAdditionally, two other scripts exist: a traditional Arabic-based transcription of Wolof called Wolofal, which dates back to the pre-colonial period and is still used by many people, and the Garay script, dating to 1961, which has been adopted by a small number of Wolof-speakers\n\nThe first syllable of words is stressed; long vowels are pronounced with more time, but are not automatically stressed, as they are in English.\n\nThe vowels are as follows:\nThere may be an additional low vowel, or this may be confusion with orthographic \"à\".\n\nAll vowels may be long (written double) or short. is written before a long (prenasalized or geminate) consonant. When \"é\" and \"ó\" are written double, the accent mark is often only on the first letter.\n\nVowels fall into two harmonizing sets according to ATR: \"i u é ó ë\" are +ATR, \"e o a\" are the −ATR analogues of \"é ó ë\". For example,\n\nThere are no −ATR analogues of the high vowels \"i u\". They trigger +ATR harmony in suffixes when they occur in a root, but in a suffix they may be transparent to vowel harmony.\n\nThe vowels of some suffixes or enclitics do not harmonize with preceding vowels. In most cases following vowels harmonize with them. That is, they reset the harmony, as if they were a separate word. However, when a suffix/clitic contains a high vowel (+ATR) occurs after a −ATR root, any further suffixes harmonize with the root. That is, the +ATR suffix/clitic is \"transparent\" to vowel harmony. An example is the negative \"-u-\" in,\nwhere harmony would predict \"*door-u-më-léén-fë\".\nThat is, \"i u\" behave as if they are their own −ATR analogues.\n\nAuthors differ in whether they indicate vowel harmony in writing, as well as whether they write clitics as separate words.\n\nConsonants in word-initial position are as follows:\nAll simple nasals, oral stops apart from \"q\" and glottal, and the sonorants \"l r y w\" may be geminated (doubled), though geminate \"r\" only occurs in ideophones. (Geminate consonants are written double.) \"Q\" is inherently geminate and may occur in initial position; otherwise geminate consonants and consonant clusters, including \"nt, nc, nk, nq\" (), are restricted to word-medial and -final position. Of the consonants in the chart above, \"p d c k\" do not occur in medial or final position, being replaced by \"f r s\" and zero, though geminate \"pp dd cc kk\" are common. Phonetic \"p c k\" do occur finally, but only as allophones of \"b j g\" due to final devoicing.\n\nMinimal pairs:\n\nUnlike most sub-Saharan African languages, Wolof has no tone. Other non-tonal languages of Africa include Amharic, Swahili and Fula.\n\nIn Wolof, verbs are unchangeable stems that cannot be conjugated. To express different tenses or aspects of an action, personal pronouns are conjugated – not the verbs. Therefore, the term \"temporal pronoun\" has become established for this part of speech. It is also referred to as a focus form.\n\nExample: The verb dem means \"\"to go\" and cannot be changed; the temporal pronoun maa ngi means \"I/me, here and now\"; the temporal pronoun dinaa means \"I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon\". With that, the following sentences can be built now: Maa ngi dem. \"I am going (here and now).\" – Dinaa dem. \"I will go (soon).\"\n\nIn Wolof, tenses like present tense, past tense, and future tense are just of secondary importance, they play almost no role. Of crucial importance is the aspect of an action from the speaker's point of view. The most important distinction is whether an action is perfective, i.e., finished, or imperfective, i.e., still going on, from the speaker's point of view, regardless whether the action itself takes place in the past, present, or future. Other aspects indicate whether an action takes place regularly, whether an action will take place for sure, and whether an action wants to emphasize the role of the subject, predicate, or object of the sentence. As a result, conjugation is not done by tenses, but by aspects. Nevertheless, the term \"temporal pronoun\" became usual for these conjugated pronouns, although \"aspect pronoun\" might be a better term.\n\nExample: The verb dem means \"to go\"; the temporal pronoun naa means \"I already/definitely\", the temporal pronoun dinaa means \"I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon\"; the temporal pronoun damay means \"I (am) regularly/usually\". Now the following sentences can be constructed: Dem naa. \"I go already / I have already gone.\" – Dinaa dem. \"I will go soon / I am just going to go.\" – Damay dem. \"I usually/regularly/normally/am about to go.\"\n\nIf the speaker absolutely wants to express that an action took place in the past, this is not done by conjugation, but by adding the suffix -(w)oon to the verb (in a sentence, the temporal pronoun is still used in a conjugated form along with the past marker).\n\nExample: Demoon naa Ndakaaru. \"I already went to Dakar.\"\"\n\nWolof does not mark for grammatical gender: there is one pronoun encompassing the English 'he', 'she', and 'it'. The descriptors bu góor (male / masculine) or bu jigéen (female / feminine) are often added to words like \"xarit\", 'friend', and \"rakk\", 'younger sibling' to indicate the person's sex.\n\nMarkers of noun definiteness (usually called \"definite articles\") agree with the noun they modify. There are at least ten articles in Wolof, some of them indicating a singular noun, others a plural noun. In Urban Wolof, spoken in large cities like Dakar, the article -bi is often used as a generic article when the actual article is not known.\n\nAny loan noun from French or English uses -bi: butik-bi, xarit-bi \"the boutique, the friend\"\n\nMost Arabic or religious terms use -ji: jumma-ji, jigéen-ji, \"the mosque, the girl\"\n\nFour nouns referring to persons use \"-ki/-\"ñi:\"\" \"nit-ki, nit-ñi\", 'the person, the people\"\n\nPlural nouns use \"-yi: jigéen-yi, butik-yi\", \"the girls, the boutiques\"\n\nMiscellaneous articles: \"si, gi, wi, mi, li\".\n\nThe Wolof numeral system is based on the numbers \"5\" and \"10\". It is extremely regular in formation, comparable to Chinese. Example: benn \"\"one\", juróom \"five\", juróom-benn \"six\"\" (literally, \"five-one\"), fukk \"\"ten\", fukk ak juróom benn \"sixteen\"\" (literally, \"ten and five one\"), ñent-fukk \"forty\" (literally, \"four-ten\"). Alternatively, \"thirty\" is fanweer, which is roughly the number of days in a lunar month (literally \"fan\" is day and \"weer\" is moon.)\n\nOrdinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) are formed by adding the ending –éél (pronounced ayl) to the cardinal number.\n\nFor example, two is ñaar and second is ñaaréél\n\nThe one exception to this system is \"first\", which is bu njëk (or the adapted French word \"premier\": përëmye)\n\nIn urban Wolof it is common to use the forms of the 3rd person plural also for the 1st person plural.\n\nIt is also important to note that the verb follows certain temporal pronouns and precedes others.\n\nThe New Testament was translated into Wolof and published in 1987, second edition 2004, and in 2008 with some minor typographical corrections.\n\nBoubacar Boris Diop published his novel \"Doomi Golo\" in Wolof in 2002.\n\nThe 1994 song \"7 Seconds\" by Youssou N'Dour and Neneh Cherry is partially sung in Wolof.\n\n\"Okay\" may be Wolof waaw-kay, “yes,” with a suffix of emphasis, becoming “I agree,\" or \"I will comply.” Wolof is reputed to have been a lingua franca among slaves in the USA, and to have had a strong influence on colloquial American English. Significantly, the emergence of “okay” in the vocabulary of Euro-Americans dates from a period when many refugees from Southern slavery were arriving in the North, and this is where the word was first documented. The words banana, jive, dig (meaning \"appreciate\"), yam and sock (meaning \"to hit\") are Wolof. It has been suggested that \"hep cat\" may also be of Wolof origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
