{"id": "18462506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18462506", "title": "Adrenergic storm", "text": "Adrenergic storm\n\nAn adrenergic storm is a sudden and dramatic increase in serum levels of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline (also known as epinephrine and norepinephrine respectively), with a less significant increase in dopamine transmission. It is a life-threatening condition because of extreme tachycardia and hypertension, and is especially dire for those with prior heart problems. If treatment is prompt, prognosis is good; typically large amounts of diazepam or other benzodiazepines are administered alongside beta blockers. Beta blockers are contraindicated in some patients, so other anti-hypertensive medication such as clonidine may be used. It is usually caused by overdose of stimulants, especially cocaine or methamphetamine, or eating foods high in tyramine while taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. A subarachnoid hemorrhage can also cause an adrenergic storm. A catecholamine storm is part of the normal course of Rabies infection, and is responsible for the severe feelings of agitation, terror, and dysautonomia present in the pre-coma stage of the disease.\n\nThe behavioral symptoms are similar to those of an amphetamine, cocaine or caffeine overdose. Overstimulation of the central nervous system results in a state of hyperkinetic movement and unpredictable mental status including mania, rage and suicidal behavior.\n\nPhysical symptoms are more serious and include heart arrhythmias as well as outright heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk of coronary disease. Breathing is rapid and shallow while both pulse and blood pressure are dangerously elevated.\n\nThere are several known causes of adrenergic storms; in the United States, cocaine overdose is the leading cause. Any stimulant drug has the capacity to cause this syndrome if taken in sufficient doses, but even non-psychotropic drugs can very rarely provoke a reaction.\n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down many compounds; basically, anything with a primary amine moiety is likely to be oxidized by monoamine oxidase. An important substrate of the enzyme MAO is tyramine. MAOIs inhibit the enzyme either reversibly, in which MAO is inhibited only until the drug is cleared from the system, or irreversibly, in which the substrate binds permanently to the enzyme, rendering it inactive and effectively destroying it. Irreversible MAOIs are potentially more dangerous, because the body takes about two weeks to regenerate MAO enzymes to functional levels. Two subtypes of MAO exist: MAO-A and MAO-B; this is relevant to adrenergic storms, as there are significant differences between the two types, such as their differential expression throughout the body, and range of substrates. While both MAO-A and MAO-B metabolize tyramine, only MAO-A is present in the gastrointestinal tract and singularly metabolizes the majority of consumed tyramine. (The small portion normally passing into circulation is mostly degraded in the liver where both MAO types act.) Consequently, MAOIs that irreversibly inhibit MAO-A will permit high levels of circulating tyramine able to cause tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis. Aged cheese, beer, red wine, some mushrooms, and fermented products such as pickles are foods containing high levels of tyramine that passed into circulation can such a hypertensive crisis.\n\nAdrenergic storms are not provoked often from MAOI-tyramine interactions; hypertensive crisis alone does not diagnose adrenergic storm, although there will always be hypertension in an adrenergic storm, along with tachycardia and rapid, shallow breathing. However, if a patient on MAOIs uses recreational quantities of any drug with stimulant effects on the CNS, it can provoke an adrenergic crisis (along with the inevitable hypertensive crisis). Deaths have occurred from individuals attempting to combine MAOIs with various entheogens to attain a stronger psychedelic experience, both from adrenergic storms and serotonin syndrome. Combining drugs like MDMA, 2C-B, mescaline, 2C-T-7, etc. with even small quantities of MAOIs - small quantities of both drugs - is still extremely risky. Nevertheless, some users claim to use certain combinations successfully.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage is an extremely serious condition in which a neural membrane is breached and the brain itself is compromised. The onset is sudden, described as \"the worst headache of one's life,\" and many grave symptoms follow. Adrenergic storm is often present among these symptoms, and is responsible for some of the dangers, both long-term and short, of subarachnoid hemhorrhage adrenergic storm, through a complex cascade of processes starting with the movement of subarachnoid blood into the brain. Apparently, as the intracranial pressure increases, the brain is squeezed and catecholamines are forced out of their vesicles into the synapses and extracellular space. An alternative explanation that has been proposed is that this increased in intracranial pressure transduces through the brain parenchyma through to the blood vessels producing a loss in effective cerebral perfusion. This triggers the sympathetic nervous system to secrete more norepinepherine and epinepherine increasing blood pressure and heart rate to dangerous levels to maintain cerebral perfusion.\n\nRarely, a pheochromocytoma (tumor of the medullar tissue of the adrenal glands, which are located anterior to the kidney), may result in an adrenergic storm. This type of tumor is not common to begin with, and furthermore, the subtype that can cause massive adrenaline release is rarer still. Patients with pheochromocytoma can unexpectedly fly into a rage or sink into trembling fear, possibly dangerous to themselves and others as their judgment is impaired, their senses and pain threshold are heightened, and the level of the adrenalin in their bloodstream is more than most people ever experience; pheochromocytoma can, very rarely, kill by internal adrenaline overdose. But overall, adrenergic storm is an uncommon but certainly not rare phenomenon associated with the also uncommon condition of pheochromocytoma.\n\nPorphyria\n\nBecause the adrenergic storm overlaps with so many other similar conditions, such as hypertensive crises, stimulant intoxication or overdose, or even panic attack, and because the treatments for these overlapping conditions are largely alike, it is not necessary to obtain a differential and definitive diagnosis before initiating treatment. However, analysis of the patient's medical history, checked against the possible causes of the adrenergic storm such as those above, should be done, because some adrenergic storms can be caused by serious underlying conditions. If a patient has an adrenergic storm and all or most of the other factors are ruled out, the adrenergic storm could lead to the discovery of a pheochromocytoma, which can become malignant. However, not all cases of adrenergic storm have an identifiable cause. Like a seizure, sometimes a patient has a single one, or perhaps a few, and then does not for the rest of their life. The mechanisms of idiopathic adrenergic storm are very poorly understood.\n\nSerotonin syndrome, in which an excess of serotonin in the synapses causes a similar crisis of hypertension and mental confusion, could be confused with an adrenergic storm. The difference is that serotonin, being a tryptamine (non-catecholamine) involved in higher brain functions, can cause dangerous hypertension and tachycardia from its effects on the sympathetic nervous system, but as there are no serotonin receptors in the heart or blood vessels there are no direct effects on the heart. Thus, the presence of arrythmia, abnormal echocardiograms, or chest pain indicates an adrenergic crisis and rules out serotonin syndrome.\n\nIf there is evidence of overdose or it is suspected, the patient should be given gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or both; this could make the difference between life and death in a close situation. It can however aggravate the patient which should be taken into account.\n\nThe first line treatments are diazepam and a non-selective beta blocker; other antihypertensive drugs may also be used. It is important to note that not all benzodiazepines and beta blockers are safe to use in an adrenergic storm; for instance, alprazolam and propranolol; alprazolam weakly agonizes dopamine receptors and causes catecholamine release while propranolol mildly promotes some catecholamine release - each worsening the condition.\n\nAdrenergic storms are often idiopathic in nature; however if there is an underlying condition, then that must be addressed after bringing the heart rate and blood pressure down.\n"}

It has been thought to be a pidgin, though analysis of the language's features indicates it to be a pre-pidgin or a jargon rather than a stable pidgin.\n\nIt was exported to Korea during the Korean War by American military personnel as a method of communicating with Koreans. Here it acquired some Korean words, but remained largely based on English and Japanese. Recently, it has been most widely used in Okinawa Prefecture, where there is a significant U.S. military presence.\n\nThe Bonin Islands feature a similar form of Japanese Pidgin English referred to as Bonin English. This contact language was developed due to a back-and-forth shift in dominant languages between English and Japanese spanning over one hundred years.\n\nThe name Bamboo English was coined by Arthur M. Z. Norman in an article, where he initially described the language.\n\nWith the differences between Japanese and English in terms of sounds included in each language and the placement of those sounds within words, the combination of the two within Bamboo English shows some differences between English-speaking and Japanese-speaking individuals even for the same words.\n\nThe ending consonants of words are often altered by Japanese speakers for English words that do not end with [n, m,] or [ŋ] (such as can, from, and song, respectively) by adding an /o/ or /u/ to the end of the word. This altering was picked up by English speakers, though applied without the knowledge of why it was done, such as in the case of \"saymo-saymo\" meaning 'same'.\n\nAnother similar alteration demonstrated in Bamboo English was the addition of the \"ee\" sound (as in cheese) to the end of English words. Words such as 'change', 'catch', and 'speak' then became \"changee\", \"ketchee\", and \"speakie\".\n\nAs well, Japanese speakers mimicked some aspects of English speech by removing final vowels from some words, such as the word for 'car' which is normally \"jidōsha\" in Japanese but which is said as \"jidoš\" in Bamboo English.\n\nDocumentation of the morphology of Bamboo English is rather incomplete and so demonstrating the presence or absence of various characteristics is difficult.\n\nCompounding, for example, has little record of existing within Bamboo English due to this. On the other hand, affixation has been better noted. The presence of the suffix \"-san\", taken from Japanese, is often attached to terms of reference and address such as \"mama\", \"papa\", \"boy\", \"girl\", and \"baby\" to produce nouns such as \"mama-san\" or \"baby-san\".\n\nAn additional morphological trait shown in Bamboo English is reduplication, though examples shown from the language indicate that this is not true reduplication as there are no forms of these words with only a single occurrence of the root. Such words are \"chop-chop\" meaning 'food', \"dame-dame\" meaning 'bad', and \"hubba-hubba\" meaning 'to hurry' .\n\nAs Bamboo English does not make significant use of inflection and the vocabulary was limited, words obtained multiple functions. Nouns often served in this as the initial use, with use as a verb, adjective, or adverb then developing. For example, \"chop-chop\" means 'food' but also 'to eat'. Other such dual-use words are \"hayaku\" meaning 'quickly' and also 'to hurry up', \"sayonara\" meaning 'absence' and 'to get rid of', and \"taksan\" meaning 'many, many', 'very', and 'large'.\n\nExamples taken from Duke (1970): p. 170.\n\n"}

From the stamp, the meaning was extended to the stamp impression, Plato using the noun in the sense of \"engraved mark\". In Plutarch, the word could refer to a figure or letter, Lucian uses it of hieroglyphs as opposed to Greek \"grammata\" (\"Herm\". 44)\n\nMetaphorically, it could refer to a distinctive mark, Herodotus (1.57) using it of a particular dialect, or (1.116) of a characteristic mark of an individual. The collective noun \"characteristics\" appears later, in Dionysius Halicarnassensis.\n\nVia Latin ', Old French ', the word passed into Middle English as \"\" in the 14th century. Wycliffe (1382) has \"To haue a [...] in her forhedis\" () for the mark of the beast (translating \"imprinted or branded mark\").\n\nThe word was used in the sense of letter or grapheme by William Caxton, referring to the Phoenician alphabet, \"The Fenyces were the fyrst inuentours of dyfferencing that one fro that other, of whiche were fourmed lettres for to write\" (\"Eneydos\" 6.25). As in Greek, the word was used especially for foreign or mysterious graphemes (such as Chinese, Syriac, or Runic ones) as opposed to the familiar \"letters\"; in particular of shorthand (in \"David Copperfield\" (chapter 38) sarcastically of shorthand, \"a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known\"), and since 1949 in computing (see character (computing).\n\nAs a collective noun, the word can refer to writing or printing in general (Shakespeare's sonnet nr. 59: \"Since minde at first in carrecter was done\", viz. \"since thought was first put in writing\").\n\nThe word in Renaissance magic came to refer to any astrological, cabbalistic or magical sign or symbol. Related is the Sacramental character of Catholic doctrine.\nFamously, John Dee designed his \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" in 1564.\n\nIn the 19th century, this sense of the word appears mainly in Romantic poetry, such as Sir Walter Scott's \"Lay of the last minstrel\" (1805), where \"A hallow'd taper shed a glimmering light / On mystic implements of magic might; On cross, and character, and talisman,\" (6.17).\n\nFrom the esoteric or mystical meanings, Early Modern learned authors abstracted a notion of \"Character\" as a code or hierarchical system that embodied all knowledge or all of reality, or a written representation of a philosophical language that would recover the \"true names\" lost in the confusion of tongues. \n\nThis idea had currency as a kind of epistemological philosophers' stone for about a century, from the mid 17th century, with Francis Lodwick (1642) and John Wilkins's \"Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language\" (1668), to the later 18th century and the \"Encyclopédie\" where in a long entry under the heading \"Charactère\", D'Alembert critically reviewed such projects of the past century.\n\n"}

The film premiered along with Zhang's \"Seventeen Years\" at the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival. It established Zhang's position as a \"legitimate\" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese authorities.\n\nIn contrast to earlier films, like \"East Palace, West Palace\" (1997), \"Crazy English\" was produced with the cooperation of the state-owned Xi'an Film Studio, which enjoys a \"presented by\" billing in the film's credits.\n\nThe film follows one of the People's Republic of China's most popular motivational speakers, Li Yang, the founder of \"Crazy English\". Li is known for his stadium-sized presentations where he exhorts his audiences to engage in mass recitations of English phrases and idioms, often with a strong nationalist bent: \"Conquer English to Make China Stronger!\". Li, however, has also courted controversy. Despite the fact that he teaches a foreign language, Li has never left China, a fact not revealed in the film until the end. Other common criticisms, including accusations that Li Yang is a \"nationalist huckster\" and that his methods do not actually improve English-speaking ability, receive a much more subtle presentation in Zhang's film.\n\nThe film follows Li on his tours throughout China with a few interspersed interviews. Zhang Yuan has described the film as a combination of Leni Riefenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" and Robert Zemeckis' \"Forrest Gump\".\n\nThe seeds for \"Crazy English\" first arose when Li Yang's manager asked to meet with Zhang Yuan at a bar in Beijing's Sanlitun neighborhood. At the time Zhang Yuan had not even heard of Li Yang or his \"Crazy English\" programs. After meeting with the manager, Zhang was sufficiently intrigued by the idea of a documentary about Li to arrange for an actual meeting with the motivational speaker.\n\nOnce the two men met, Zhang Yuan \"immediately\" decided to make the film. Though made with the assent of official authorities, the filmmakers were nevertheless forced to make certain cuts before being allowed a limited release for their documentary. Zhang has noted that his own opinions of Li Yang vary dramatically from admiration to disgust. One critic also noticed Zhang's ambivalence in the film and noted that the film seems to shift from appreciation or amusement at Li Yang's methodologies to one darker in tone, as Li Yang's mass rallies begin to resemble Mao-era Red Guard rallies or even Hitler's Nuremberg Rally.\n\nDespite of its official approval, \"Crazy English\" received only a limited release in select cities within China. Zhang Yuan has stated that the film's reception within China was difficult to read, given the mass adoration (and criticism) that Li Yang often elicits.\n\nWhile China remained ambivalent, the west also responded to \"Crazy English\" with mixed reactions. At least one critic felt that the film was too long and better suited for television than film. On the other hand, the film journal \"Senses of Cinema\" showered praise on \"Crazy English\", saying, \"This is a fascinating film - for China watchers, for educators and for fans of the documentary film - and is an absolute must for festival patrons.\"\n\nAs for the film's subject, Li Yang was reportedly less than pleased by the film's portrayal of him as a demagogue, and he has gone on to say that the film was \"not a real documentary\" accusing Zhang of manipulating the film to appeal to Western audiences.\n\n\n"}

It says:\n\n introduced the problem with a story about seating assignment in committees: suppose that, in a university department, there are committees, each consisting of faculty members, and that all committees meet in the same room, which has chairs. Suppose also that at most one person belongs to the intersection of any two committees. Is it possible to assign the committee members to chairs in such a way that each member sits in the same chair for all the different committees to which he or she belongs? In this model of the problem, the faculty members correspond to graph vertices, committees correspond to complete graphs, and chairs correspond to vertex colors.\n\nA \"linear hypergraph\" (also known as partial linear space) is a hypergraph with the property that every two hyperedges have at most one vertex in common. A hypergraph is said to be uniform if all of its hyperedges have the same number of vertices as each other. The cliques of size in the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be interpreted as the hyperedges of an -uniform linear hypergraph that has the same vertices as the underlying graph. In this language, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture states that, given any -uniform linear hypergraph with hyperedges, one may -color the vertices such that each hyperedge has one vertex of each color.\n\nA \"simple hypergraph\" is a hypergraph in which at most one hyperedge connects any pair of vertices and there are no hyperedges of size at most one. In the graph coloring formulation of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture, it is safe to remove vertices that belong to a single clique, as their coloring presents no difficulty; once this is done, the hypergraph that has a vertex for each clique, and a hyperedge for each graph vertex, forms a simple hypergraph.\nAnd, the hypergraph dual of vertex coloring is edge coloring. Thus, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any simple hypergraph with vertices has chromatic index (edge coloring number) at most .\n\nThe graph of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be represented as an intersection graph of sets: to each vertex of the graph, correspond the set of the cliques containing that vertex, and connect any two vertices by an edge whenever their corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. Using this description of the graph, the conjecture may be restated as follows: if some family of sets has total elements, and any two sets intersect in at most one element, then the intersection graph of the sets may be -colored.\n\nThe intersection number of a graph is the minimum number of elements in a family of sets whose intersection graph is , or equivalently the minimum number of vertices in a hypergraph whose line graph is . define the linear intersection number of a graph, similarly, to be the minimum number of vertices in a linear hypergraph whose line graph is . As they observe, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the chromatic number of any graph is at most equal to its linear intersection number.\n\nPaul Erdős, Vance Faber, and László Lovász formulated the conjecture in 1972.\nPaul Erdős originally offered US$50 for proving the conjecture in the affirmative, and later raised the reward to US$500.\n\nIt is also of interest to consider the chromatic number of graphs formed as the union of cliques of vertices each, without restricting how big the intersections of pairs of cliques can be. In this case, the chromatic number of their union is at most , and some graphs formed in this way require this many colors.\n\nA version of the conjecture that uses the fractional chromatic number in place of the chromatic number is known to be true. That is, if a graph is formed as the union of -cliques that intersect pairwise in at most one vertex, then can be -colored.\n\nIn the framework of edge coloring simple hypergraphs, defines a number from a simple hypergraph as the number of hypergraph vertices that belong to a hyperedge of three or more vertices. He shows that, for any fixed value of , a finite calculation suffices to verify that the conjecture is true for all simple hypergraphs with that value of . Based on this idea, he shows that the conjecture is indeed true for all simple hypergraphs with . In the formulation of coloring graphs formed by unions of cliques, Hindman's result shows that the conjecture is true whenever at most ten of the cliques contain a vertex that belongs to three or more cliques. In particular, it is true for .\n\n\n"}

He was elected superintendent of the Palatine library by Augustus according to Suetonius' \"De Grammaticis\", 20. It is not clear whether Hyginus was a native of the Iberian Peninsula or of Alexandria.\n\nSuetonius remarks that he fell into great poverty in his old age, and was supported by the historian Clodius Licinus. Hyginus was a voluminous author: his works included topographical and biographical treatises, commentaries on Helvius Cinna and the poems of Virgil, and disquisitions on agriculture and bee-keeping. All these are lost.\n\nUnder the name of Hyginus there are extant what are probably two sets of school notes abbreviating his treatises on mythology; one is a collection of \"Fabulae\" (\"stories\"), the other a \"Poetical Astronomy\".\n\n\"Fabulae\" consists of some three hundred very brief and plainly, even crudely told myths and celestial genealogies, made by an author who was characterized by his modern editor, H. J. Rose, as \"adulescentem imperitum, semidoctum, stultum\"—\"an ignorant youth, semi-learned, stupid\"—but valuable for the use made of works of Greek writers of tragedy that are now lost. Arthur L. Keith, reviewing H. J. Rose's edition (1934) of \"Hygini Fabulae\", wondered \"at the caprices of Fortune who has allowed many of the plays of an Aeschylus, the larger portion of Livy's histories, and other priceless treasures to perish, while this school-boy's exercise has survived to become the \"pabulum\" of scholarly effort.\" Hyginus' compilation represents in primitive form what every educated Roman in the age of the Antonines was expected to know of Greek myth, at the simplest level. The \"Fabulae\" are a mine of information today, when so many more nuanced versions of the myths have been lost.\n\nIn fact the text of \"Fabulae\" was all but lost: a single surviving manuscript from the abbey of Freising, in a Beneventan script datable c. 900, formed the material for the first printed edition, negligently and uncritically transcribed by Jacob Micyllus, 1535, who may have supplied it with the title we know it by. In the course of printing, following the usual practice, by which the manuscripts printed in the 15th and 16th centuries have rarely survived their treatment at the printshop, the manuscript was pulled apart: only two small fragments of it have turned up, significantly as stiffening in book bindings. Another fragmentary text, dating from the 5th century is in the Vatican Library. (Major 2002)\n\nAmong Hyginus' sources are the \"scholia\" on Apollonius of Rhodes' \"Argonautica\", which were dated to about the time of Tiberius by Apollonius' editor R. Merkel, in the preface to his edition of Apollonius (Leipzig, 1854).\n\n\"De Astronomica\" was first published, with accompanying figures, by Erhard Ratdolt in Venice, 1482, under the title \"Clarissimi uiri Hyginii Poeticon astronomicon opus utilissimum.\" This \"Poetic astronomy by the most renowned Hyginus, a most useful work,\" chiefly tells us the myths connected with the constellations, in versions that are chiefly based on \"Catasterismi\", a work that was traditionally attributed to Eratosthenes.\n\nLike the \"Fabulae,\" the \"Astronomica\" is a collection of abridgements, and the style and level of Latin competence and the elementary mistakes (especially in the rendering of the Greek originals) were held by the anonymous contributor to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (11th edition, 1911), to prove that they cannot have been the work of \"so distinguished\" a scholar as G. Julius Hyginus. It was further suggested that these treatises are an abridgment made in the latter half of the 2nd century of the \"Genealogiae\" of Hyginus by an unknown adapter, who added a complete treatise on mythology. The star lists in the \"Astronomica\" are in exactly the same order as in Ptolemy's \"Almagest,\" reinforcing the idea of a 2nd-century compilation.\n\nThe lunar crater Hyginus and the minor planet 12155 Hyginus are named after him.\n\nThe English author Sir Thomas Browne opens his discourse \"The Garden of Cyrus\" (1658) with a Creation myth sourced from the \"Fabulae\" of Hyginus. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "4619948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4619948", "title": "Grammatology", "text": "Grammatology\n\nThe linguist Ignace Gelb coined the term \"grammatology\" in 1952 to refer to the scientific study of writing systems or scripts. Grammatology can examine the typology of scripts, the analysis of the structural properties of scripts, and the relationship between written and spoken language. In its broadest sense, some scholars also include the study of literacy in grammatology and, indeed, the impact of writing on philosophy, religion, science, administration and other aspects of the organization of society.\nHistorian Bruce Trigger associates grammatology with cultural evolution.\n\nThe scholars most immediately associated with grammatology, understood as the history and theory of writing, include Eric Havelock (\"The Muse Learns to Write\"), Walter J. Ong (\"Orality and Literacy\"), Jack Goody (\"Domestication of the Savage Mind\"), not to mention Marshall McLuhan (\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\"). Grammatology brings to any topic a consideration of the contribution of technology and the material and social apparatus of language. A more theoretical treatment of the approach may be seen in the works of Friedrich Kittler (\"Discourse Networks: 1800/1900\") and Avital Ronell (\"The Telephone Book\").\n\nIn 1967 the deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida borrowed the term, but put it to different use, in his book \"Of Grammatology\". Derrida aimed to show that writing is not simply a reproduction of speech, but that the way in which thoughts are recorded in writing strongly affects the nature of knowledge. Deconstruction from a grammatological perspective places the history of philosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, in the context of writing as such. In this perspective metaphysics is understood as a category or classification system relative to the invention of alphabetic writing and its institutionalization in School. Plato's Academy, and Aristotle's Lyceum, are as much a part of the invention of literacy as is the introduction of the vowel to create the Classical Greek alphabet. Gregory Ulmer took up this trajectory, from historical to philosophical grammatology, to add applied grammatology (\"Applied Grammatology: Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys\", Johns Hopkins, 1985). Ulmer coined the term \"electracy\" to call attention to the fact that digital technologies and their elaboration in new media forms are part of an apparatus that is to these inventions what literacy is to alphabetic and print technologies. Grammatology studies the invention of an apparatus across the spectrum of its manifestations—technology, institutional practices, and identity behaviors. Marc Wilhelm Küster combines Derrida's approach with Gelbs's study of writing to build a more inclusive view of the interaction between writing and our ways of viewing the world.\n\nMost common forms of literary writing is structuralism and post-structuralism. Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure was considered to be a key figure in structural approaches to language. Saussure writes, 'Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.' Peter Barry explains this well in his book, the \"Beginning Theory\".\n\nIn the 1960s, post-structuralism sprang into existence with Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, two of the major contributors to this movement. Barthes' writing has been described as interesting as one can see the transition of these two literary styles through comparing his earlier works with his later work. His early work is methodical and very structured in its delivery, Barthes' work then morphs into writing that has been described as random in sequence and unfocused, which is a key characteristics of post-structuralistic writing; Jacques Derrida published much work in the subject of literary theory but most were considered to be more philosophical than based on literary itself. However one of the most influential texts on post-structuralism is \"Of Grammatology\", a book that Jacques Derrida wrote. This book had a famous slogan of 'There is nothing outside the text' and is today one of the most quoted lines when discussing grammatology. This opinion of Derrida is quite different from that of Saussure who believes the meaning in words is outside the text.\n\n"}

They have underpinned the majority of statistical machine translation systems for almost twenty years. These models offer principled probabilistic formulation and (mostly) tractable inference.\n\nThe original work on statistical machine translation at IBM proposed five models, and a model 6 was proposed later. The sequence of the six models can be summarized as:\n\n\nIBM Model 1 is weak in terms of conducting reordering or adding and dropping words. In most cases, words that follow each other in one language would have a different order after translation, but IBM Model 1 treats all kinds of reordering as equally possible.\n\nAnother problem while aligning is the fertility (the notion that input words would produce a specific number of output words after translation). In most cases one input word will be translated into one single word, but some words will produce multiple words or even get dropped (produce no words at all). The fertility of word models addresses this aspect of translation. While adding additional components increases the complexity of models, the main principles of IBM Model 1 are constant.\n\nThe IBM Model 2 has an additional model for alignment that is not present in Model 1. For example, using only IBM Model 1 the translation probabilities for these translations would be the same: \n\nThe IBM Model 2 addressed this issue by modeling the translation of a foreign input word in position formula_1 to a native language word in position formula_2 using an alignment probability distribution defined as:\n\nIn the above equation, the length of the input sentence f is denoted as l, and the length of the translated sentence e as l. The translation done by IBM Model 2 can be presented as a process divided into two steps (lexical translation and alignment).\n\nAssuming formula_4 is the translation probability and formula_3 is the alignment probability, IBM Model 2 can be defined as:\n\nIn this equation, the alignment function formula_7 maps each output word formula_2 to a foreign input position formula_9.\n\nThe fertility problem is addressed in IBM Model 3. The fertility is modeled using probability distribution defined as:\n\nFor each foreign word formula_2, such distribution indicates to how many output words formula_12 it usually translates. This model deals with dropping input words because it allows formula_13. But there is still an issue when adding words. For example, the English word \"do\" is often inserted when negating. This issue generates a special \"NULL\" token that can also have its fertility modeled using a conditional distribution defined as:\n\nThe number of inserted words depends on sentence length. This is why the NULL token insertion is modeled as an additional step: the fertility step. It increases the IBM Model 3 translation process to four steps:\n\nThe last step is called distortion instead of alignment because it is possible to produce the same translation with the same alignment in different ways.\n\nIBM Model 3 can be mathematically expressed as:\n\nwhere formula_16 represents the fertility of formula_17, each source word formula_18 is assigned a fertility distribution formula_19, and formula_20 and formula_21 refer to the absolute lengths of the target and source sentences, respectively.\n\nIn IBM Model 4, each word is dependent on the previously aligned word and on the word classes of the surrounding words. Some words tend to get reordered during translation more than others (e.g. adjective–noun inversion when translating Polish to English). Adjectives often get moved before the noun that precedes them. The word classes introduced in Model 4 solve this problem by conditioning the probability distributions of these classes. The result of such distribution is a lexicalized model. Such a distribution can be defined as follows:\n\nFor the initial word in the cept: formula_22\n\nFor additional words: formula_23\n\nwhere formula_24 and formula_25 functions map words to their word classes, and formula_26 and formula_27 are distortion probability distributions of the words. The cept is formed by aligning each input word formula_28 to at least one output word.\n\nBoth Model 3 and Model 4 ignore if an input position was chosen and if the probability mass was reserved for the input positions outside the sentence boundaries. It is the reason for the probabilities of all correct alignments not sum up to unity in these two models (deficient models).\n\nIBM Model 5 reformulates IBM Model 4 by enhancing the alignment model with more training parameters in order to overcome the model deficiency. During the translation in Model 3 and Model 4 there are no heuristics that would prohibit the placement of an output word in a position already taken. In Model 5 it is important to place words only in free positions. It is done by tracking the number of free positions and allowing placement only in such positions. The distortion model is similar to IBM Model 4, but it is based on free positions. If formula_29 denotes the number of free positions in the output, the IBM Model 5 distortion probabilities would be defined as:\n\nFor the initial word in the cept: formula_30\n\nFor additional words: formula_31\n\nThe alignment models that use first-order dependencies like the HMM or IBM Models 4 and 5 produce better results than the other alignment methods. The main idea of HMM is to predict the distance between subsequent source language positions. On the other hand, IBM Model 4 tries to predict the distance between subsequent target language positions. Since it was expected to achieve better alignment quality when using both types of such dependencies, HMM and Model 4 were combined in a log-linear manner in Model 6 as follows:\n\nwhere the interpolation parameter formula_33 is used in order to count the weight of Model 4 relatively to the hidden Markov model. A log-linear combination of several models can be defined as formula_34 with formula_35 as:\n\nThe log-linear combination is used instead of linear combination because the formula_37 values are typically different in terms of their orders of magnitude for HMM and IBM Model 4.\n"}

It is defined as any carrier that provides services across multiple local access and transport areas (interLATA). Calls made on telephone circuits within the local geographic area covered by one local network are handled only by that intraLATA carrier, commonly called a local telephone exchange carrier. Local calls are usually defined by connections made without additional charge whether the connected call is in the same LATA or connects to another LATA with no charge. IntraLATA usually refers to rated or toll calls between LATA within state boundaries, as opposed to interstate, or calls between LATAs in different states.\n\nAn IXC carries traffic, usually voice traffic, between telephone exchanges. Telephone exchanges are usually identified in the United States by the LATA indicated by three-digit area code (NPA) and the first three digits of the phone number (NPA-NXX) within the LATA. Different exchanges generally cover different geographic locations, connected as separate central offices (COs, also called \"wire centers\").\n\nIXCs originally carried voice traffic on analog lines, but voice traffic has since become largely digitized. Therefore, voice traffic is more typically a data stream and can be intermixed with data traffic such as uplinks for DSL. Most commonly, links between IXCs and COs are ATM links carried on optical fiber.\n\nFor voice traffic transfer, IXCs use softswitches and VoIP protocols and error correction. ITSPs can thereby connect between VoIP to POTS, computer to computer, computer to phone, and IP devices to other phone services.\n\nEach carrier (interexchange or local exchange) is assigned a four-digit identification code, the Carrier Identification Code (CIC) which was used with feature groups. The interexchange carrier to which calls from a subscriber line are routed by default is known as the Presubscribed Interexchange Carrier (PIC). To give telephone users the possibility of opting for a different carrier on a call-by-call basis, Carrier Access Codes (CAC) were devised. These consist of the digits 101 followed by the four-digit CIC. The CAC is dialed as a prefix immediately before dialing a long-distance phone number.\n\nIn popular usage, CACs are often referred to as dial-around codes (because they allow dialing around the PIC). Sometimes they are even called \"PIC codes\", though this term is inaccurate, since the code is being used to \"avoid\" the PIC, not to use its services.\n\nWhen CICs were first introduced in 1983, they were only three digits long, and the CAC consisted of the digits 10 followed by the three-digit CIC. In 1998, the CIC had to be extended to four digits. Existing carriers' codes were prefixed with 10. Thus, a pre-1998 CAC of the form 10-XXX became 101-0XXX. Since the CACs starting with 10-10 are generally the oldest and best-known ones, CACs are sometimes referred to as 10-10 codes.\n\nUse of CACs is popular with telephone users who wish to avoid paying a regular monthly fee for access to inexpensive long-distance service. They can also be useful if encountering a \"circuits busy\" condition when all long distance trunks are tied up; a CAC allows selection of an alternate carrier, which may have other open long-distance trunks. This feature gave rise to \"slamming\" and the lesser known \"cramming\" technique of telephone fraud.\n\nAs multiple competitive long-distance carriers have been permitted in countries other than the United States, schemes similar to the CIC/CAC have spread worldwide. They are now used in (among other countries) Canada, Germany, and Japan.\n\nAlthough CACs are no longer widely used, PICs and CICs are still common.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16205", "title": "Jacobin (politics)", "text": "Jacobin (politics)\n\nA Jacobin () was a member of the Jacobin Club, a revolutionary political movement that was the most famous political club during the French Revolution (1789–99). The club was so called from the Dominican convent where they originally met, in the Rue Saint-Jacques (Latin: \"Jacobus\") in Paris. Today, the terms \"Jacobin\" and \"Jacobinism\" are used in a variety of senses. Jacobin is sometimes used in Britain as a pejorative for radical, left-wing revolutionary politics (), especially when it exhibits dogmatism and violent repression. In France, Jacobin now generally indicates a supporter of a centralized republican state and strong central government powers and/or supporters of extensive government intervention to transform society.\n\nThe Jacobin Club was one of several organizations that grew out of the French Revolution and it was distinguished for its left-wing, revolutionary politics. Because of this, the Jacobins, unlike other sects like the Girondins, were closely allied to the sans-culottes, who were a popular force of working-class Parisians that played a pivotal role in the development of the revolution. The Jacobins had a significant presence in the National Convention, and were dubbed 'the Mountain' for their seats in the uppermost part of the chamber. Eventually, the Revolution coalesced around the Mountain's power, with the help of the insurrections of the sans-culottes, and, led by Robespierre, the Jacobins established a revolutionary dictatorship, or the joint domination of the Committee of Public Safety and Committee of General Security. The Jacobin dictatorship was known for enacting the Reign of Terror, which targeted speculators, monarchists, right-wing agitators, Hébertists, and traitors, and led to many beheadings.\n\nThe Jacobins were known for creating a strong government that could deal with the needs of war, economic chaos, and internal rebellion (such as the War in the Vendée). The Jacobins supported the rights of property, but represented a much more middle-class position than the government which succeeded them in Thermidor. Their economic policy established the General maximum, in order to control prices and create stability both for the workers and poor and the revolution. They favored free trade and a liberal economy much like the Girondists, but their relationship to the people made them more willing to adopt interventionist economic policies.\n\nIn England, the word was also popularized in George Canning's newspaper, \"The Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner\", which criticized the English Radicals, of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe English who supported the French Revolution during its early stages (or even throughout) were early known as \"Jacobins\". These included the young Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and others prior to their disillusionment with the outbreak of the Reign of Terror. Others, such as William Hazlitt and Thomas Paine, remained idealistic about the Revolution. Much detail on English Jacobinism can be found in E. P. Thompson's \"The Making of the English Working Class\". Welsh Jacobins include William Jones, a radical patriot who was a keen disciple of Voltaire. Rather than preaching revolution, Jones believed that an exodus from Wales was required and that a new Welsh colony should be founded in the United States.\n\nIn the correspondence of Metternich and other leaders of the repressive policies that followed the second fall of Napoleon in 1815, \"Jacobin\" is the term commonly applied to anyone with liberal tendencies, such as the emperor Alexander I of Russia.\n\nEarly Federalist-leaning American newspapers during the French Revolution referred to the Democratic-Republican party as the \"Jacobin Party\". The most notable examples are the \"Gazette of the United States\", published in Philadelphia, and the \"Delaware and Eastern Shore Advertiser\", published in Wilmington, during the elections of 1798.\n\nIn modern American politics, the term Jacobin is often used to describe extremists of any party who demand ideological purity. For instance, in the lead-up to the 1964 Republican National Convention, the press referred to supporters of the insurgent Arizona conservative Barry Goldwater as \"Cactus Jacobins\" in their effort to unseat the moderate East Coast branch of the party (see Rockefeller Republican). L. Brent Bozell, Jr. has written in Goldwater's seminal \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" (1960) that \"Throughout history, true Conservatism has been at war equally with autocrats and with 'democratic' Jacobins.\" In 2010 a radical American publication, \"Jacobin\", was founded.\n\nIn 2008–2010, the term was employed and started as a movement for presidential hopeful Ron Paul before being taken over by mainstream conservatives. For example, Eve Fairbanks described right-wing opponents of moderate Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest as \"Jacobin conservatives\" in \"The New Republic\". In the 27 May 2010 issue of \"The New York Review of Books\", Columbia professor Mark Lilla analyzed five recent books dealing with American political party discontent in a review titled \"The Tea Party Jacobins\".\n\nThe conventionalized scrawny, French revolutionary \"sans-culottes\" Jacobin, was developed from about 1790 by British satirical artists James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson and George Cruikshank. It was commonly contrasted with the stolid stocky conservative and well-meaning John Bull, dressed like an English country squire. C. L. R. James also used the term to refer to revolutionaries during the Haitian Revolution in his book \"The Black Jacobins\".\n\n"}
{"id": "89586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89586", "title": "Japanese grammar", "text": "Japanese grammar\n\nJapanese is a synthetic language with a regular agglutinative subject-object-verb (SOV) morphology, with both productive and fixed elements. In language typology, it has many features divergent from most European languages. Its phrases are exclusively head-final and compound sentences are exclusively left-branching. There are many such languages, but few in Europe. It is a topic-prominent language.\n\nThe modern theory of constituent order (\"word order\"), usually attributed to Joseph Greenberg, identifies several kinds of phrase. Each one has a head and possibly a modifier. The head of a phrase either precedes its modifier (head initial) or follows it (head final). Some of these phrase types, with the head marked in boldface, are:\n\nSome languages are inconsistent in constituent order, having a mixture of head initial phrase types and head final phrase types. Looking at the preceding list, English for example is mostly head initial, but nouns \"follow\" the adjectives which modify them. Moreover, genitive phrases can be either head initial or head final in English. Japanese, by contrast, is the epitome of a head final language:\n\nHead finality in Japanese sentence structure carries over to the building of sentences using other sentences. In sentences that have other sentences as constituents, the subordinated sentences (relative clauses, for example), always \"precede\" what they refer to, since they are modifiers and what they modify has the syntactic status of phrasal head. Translating the phrase \"the man who was walking down the street\" into Japanese word order would be \"street down walking was man\". (Note that Japanese has no articles, and the different word order obviates any need for the relative pronoun \"who\".)\n\nHead finality prevails also when sentences are coordinated instead of subordinated. In the world's languages, it is common to avoid repetition between coordinated clauses by optionally deleting a constituent common to the two parts, as in \"Bob bought his mother some flowers and his father a tie\", where the second \"bought\" is omitted. In Japanese, such \"gapping\" must precede in the reverse order: \"Bob mother for some flowers and father for tie bought\". The reason for this is that in Japanese, sentences (other than occasional inverted sentences or sentences containing afterthoughts) always end in a verb (or other predicative words like adjectival verbs, adjectival nouns, auxiliary verbs)—the only exceptions being a few particles such as \"ka\", \"ne\", and \"yo\". \"ka\" turns a statement into a question, while the other sentence-final particles express the speaker's attitude towards the statement.\n\nJapanese has five major lexical word classes:\nMore broadly, there are two classes: uninflectable (nouns, including verbal nouns and adjectival nouns) and inflectable (verbs, with adjectives as defective verbs). To be precise, a verbal noun is simply a noun to which can be appended, while an adjectival noun is like a noun but uses instead of when acting attributively. Adjectives (\"i\"-adjectives) inflect identically to the negative form of verbs, which end in . Compare → and → .\n\nSome scholars, such as Eleanor Harz Jorden, refer to adjectives instead as adjectivals, since they are grammatically distinct from adjectives: they can predicate a sentence. That is, is glossed as \"hot\" when modifying a noun phrase, as in , but as \"\"is\" hot\" when predicating, as in .\n\nThe two inflected classes, verb and adjective, are closed classes, meaning they do not readily gain new members. Instead, new and borrowed verbs and adjectives are conjugated periphrastically as verbal noun + \"suru\" (e.g. ) and adjectival noun + \"na\". This differs from Indo-European languages, where verbs and adjectives are open classes, though analogous \"do\" constructions exist, including English \"do a favor\", \"do the twist\" or French \"faire un footing\" (do a \"footing\", go for a jog), and periphrastic constructions are common for other senses, like \"try climbing\" (verbal noun) or \"try parkour\" (noun). Other languages where verbs are a closed class include Basque: new Basque verbs are only formed periphrastically. Conversely, pronouns are closed classes in Western languages but open classes in Japanese and some other East Asian languages.\n\nIn a few cases new verbs are created by appending to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is most often done with borrowed words, and results in a word written in a mixture of katakana (stem) and hiragana (inflectional ending), which is otherwise very rare. This is typically casual, with the most well-established example being (circa 1920), from , with other common examples including , from , and from . In cases where the borrowed word already ends with a , this may be punned to a , as in , from , and , from .\n\nNew adjectives are extremely rare; one example is , from adjectival noun , and a more casual recent example is , by contraction of . By contrast, in Old Japanese adjectives (precursors of present \"i\"-adjectives ending in , formerly a different word class) were open, as reflected in words like , from the adjective , and , from the noun (with sound change). Japanese adjectives are unusual in being closed class but quite numerous – about 700 adjectives – while most languages with closed class adjectives have very few. Some believe this is due to a grammatical change of inflection from an aspect system to a tense system, with adjectives predating the change.\n\nThe conjugation of \"i\"-adjectives has similarities to the conjugation of verbs, unlike Western languages where inflection of adjectives, where it exists, is more likely to have similarities to the declension of nouns. Verbs and adjectives being closely related is unusual from the perspective of English, but is a common case across languages generally, and one may consider Japanese adjectives as a kind of stative verb.\n\nJapanese vocabulary has a large layer of Chinese loanwords, nearly all of which go back more than one thousand years, yet virtually none of them are verbs or \"\"i\"-adjectives\" – they are all nouns, of which some are verbal nouns (\"suru\") and some are adjectival nouns (\"na\"). In addition to the basic verbal noun + \"suru\" form, verbal nouns with a single-character root often experienced sound changes, such as → → , as in , and some cases where the stem underwent sound change, as in , from .\n\nVerbal nouns are uncontroversially nouns, having only minor syntactic differences to distinguish them from pure nouns like 'mountain'. There are some minor distinctions within verbal nouns, most notably that some primarily conjugate as (with a particle), more like nouns, while others primarily conjugate as , and others are common either way. For example, is much more common than , while is much more common than . Nominal adjectives have more syntactic differences versus pure nouns, and traditionally were considered more separate, but they, too, are ultimately a subcategory of nouns.\n\nThere are a few minor word classes that are related to adjectival nouns, namely the \"taru\" adjectives and \"naru\" adjectives. Of these, \"naru\" adjectives are fossils of earlier forms of \"na\" adjectives (the \"nari\" adjectives of Old Japanese), and are typically classed separately, while \"taru\" adjectives are a parallel class (formerly \"tari\" adjectives in Late Old Japanese), but are typically classed with \"na\" adjectives.\n\nIn discourse pragmatics, the term \"topic\" refers to what a section of discourse is about. At the beginning of a section of discourse, the topic is usually unknown, in which case it is usually necessary to explicitly mention it. As the discourse carries on, the topic need not be the grammatical subject of each new sentence.\n\nStarting with Middle Japanese, the grammar evolved so as to explicitly distinguish topics from nontopics. This is done by two distinct particles (short words which do not change form). Consider the following pair of sentences:\nBoth sentences translate as \"the sun rises\". In the first sentence the sun (太陽 \"taiyō\") is not a discourse topic—not yet; in the second sentence it now \"is\" a discourse topic. In linguistics (specifically, in discourse pragmatics) a sentence such as the second one (with \"wa\") is termed a presentational sentence because its function in the discourse is to present \"sun\" as a topic, to \"broach it for discussion\". Once a referent has been established as the topic of the current monolog or dialog, then in (formal) modern Japanese its marking will change from \"ga\" to \"wa\". To better explain the difference, the translation of the second sentence can be enlarged to \"As for the sun, it rises\" or \"Speaking of the sun, it rises\"; these renderings reflect a discourse fragment in which \"the sun\" is being established as the topic of an extended discussion.\n\nThe grammatical subject is commonly omitted in Japanese, as in\nThe sentence literally expresses \"went to Japan\". Subjects are mentioned when a topic is introduced, or in situations where an ambiguity might result from their omission. The preceding example sentence would most likely be uttered in the middle of a discourse, where who it is that \"went to Japan\" will be clear from what has already been said (or written).\n\n\"Text\" (文章 \"bunshō\") is composed of \"sentences\" (文 \"bun\"), which are in turn composed of \"phrases\" (文節 \"bunsetsu\"), which are its smallest coherent components. Like Chinese and classical Korean, written Japanese does not typically demarcate words with spaces; its agglutinative nature further makes the concept of a \"word\" rather different from words in English. The reader identifies word divisions by semantic cues and a knowledge of phrase structure. Phrases have a \"single\" meaning-bearing word, followed by a string of suffixes, auxiliary verbs and particles to modify its meaning and designate its grammatical role. In the following example, phrases are indicated by vertical bars:\n\nSome scholars romanize Japanese sentences by inserting spaces only at phrase boundaries (\"i.e.\", \"taiyō-ga higashi-no sora-ni noboru\"), treating an entire phrase as a single word. This represents an almost purely phonological conception of where one word ends and the next begins. There is some validity in taking this approach: phonologically, the postpositional particles merge with the structural word that precedes them, and within a \"phonological\" phrase, the pitch can have at most one fall. Usually, however, grammarians adopt a more conventional concept of \"word\" (単語 \"tango\"), one which invokes meaning and sentence structure.\n\nIn linguistics generally, words and affixes are often classified into two major word categories: lexical words, those that refer to the world outside of a discourse, and function words—also including fragments of words—which help to build the sentence in accordance with the grammar rules of the language. Lexical words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and sometimes prepositions and postpositions, while grammatical words or word parts include everything else. The native tradition in Japanese grammar scholarship seems to concur in this view of classification. This native Japanese tradition uses the terminology \"jiritsugo\" (自立語), \"independent words\", for words having lexical meaning, and \"fuzokugo\" (付属語), \"ancillary words\", for words having a grammatical function.\n\nClassical Japanese had some auxiliary verbs (i.e., they were independent words) which have become grammaticized in modern Japanese as inflectional suffixes, such as the past tense suffix \"-ta\" (which might have developed as a contraction of \"-te ari\").\n\nTraditional scholarship proposes a system of word classes differing somewhat from the above-mentioned. The \"independent\" words have the following categories.\n\nAncillary words also divide into a nonconjugable class, containing grammatical particles (助詞 \"joshi\") and counter words (助数詞 \"josūshi\"), and a conjugable class consisting of auxiliary verbs (助動詞 \"jodōshi\"). There is not wide agreement among linguists as to the English translations of the above terms.\n\nUehara (1998) observes that Japanese grammarians have disagreed as to the criteria that make some words \"inflectional\", \"katsuyō\", and others not, in particular, the 形容動詞 \"keiyōdōshi\" – \"\"na\"-adjectives\" or \"\"na\"-nominals\". (It is not disputed that nouns like 'book' and 'mountain' are noninflectional and that verbs and \"i\"-adjectives are inflectional.) The claim that \"na\"-adjectives are inflectional rests on the claim that the syllable \"da\" 'is', usually regarded as a \"copula verb\", is really a suffix—an inflection. Thus \"hon\" 'book', generates a one-word sentence, \"honda\" 'it is a book', not a two-word sentence, \"hon da\". However, numerous constructions seem to be incompatible with the suffixal copula claim.\n\nOn the basis of such constructions, Uehara (1998) finds that the copula is indeed an independent word, and that regarding the parameters on which \"i\"-adjectives share the syntactic pattern of verbs, the nominal adjectives pattern with pure nouns instead.\n\nSimilarly, Eleanor Jorden considers this class of words a kind of nominal, not adjective, and refers to them as \"na\"-nominals in her textbook \".\"\n\nJapanese has no grammatical gender, number, or articles (though the demonstrative その, \"sono\", \"that, those\", is often translatable as \"the\"). Thus, specialists have agreed that Japanese nouns are noninflecting: 猫 \"neko\" can be translated as \"cat\", \"cats\", \"a cat\", \"the cat\", \"some cats\" and so forth, depending on context. However, as part of the extensive pair of grammatical systems that Japanese possesses for \"honorification\" (making discourse deferential to the addressee or even to a third party) and politeness, nouns too can be modified. Nouns take politeness prefixes (which have not been regarded as inflections): \"o-\" for native nouns, and \"go-\" for Sino-Japanese nouns. A few examples are given in the following table. In a few cases, there is suppletion, as with the first of the examples given below, 'rice'. (Note that while these prefixes are almost always in \"Hiragana\" — that is, as お \"o-\" or ご \"go\" — the \"kanji\" 御 is used for both \"o\" and \"go\" prefixes in formal writing.)\nLacking number, Japanese does not differentiate between count and mass nouns. (An English speaker learning Japanese would be well advised to treat Japanese nouns as mass nouns.) A small number of nouns have collectives formed by reduplication (possibly accompanied by voicing and related processes (rendaku)); for example: \"hito\" 'person' and \"hitobito\" 'people'. Reduplication is not productive. Words in Japanese referring to more than one of something are collectives, not plurals. \"Hitobito\", for example, means \"a lot of people\" or \"people in general\". It is never used to mean \"two people\". A phrase like \"edo no hitobito\" would be taken to mean \"the people of Edo\", or \"the population of Edo\", not \"two people from Edo\" or even \"a few people from Edo\". Similarly, \"yamayama\" means \"many mountains\".\n\nA limited number of nouns have collective forms that refer to groups of people. Examples include \"watashi-tachi\", 'we'; \"anata-tachi\", 'you (plural)'; \"bokura\", 'we (less formal, more masculine)'. One uncommon personal noun, \"ware\", 'I', or in some cases, 'you', has a much more common reduplicative collective form \"wareware\" 'we'.\n\nThe suffixes \"-tachi\" (達) and \"-ra\" (等) are by far the most common collectivizing suffixes. These are, again, not pluralizing suffixes: \"tarō-tachi\" does not mean \"some number of people named Taro\", but instead indicates the group including Taro. Depending on context, \"tarō-tachi\" might be translated into \"Taro and his friends\", \"Taro and his siblings\", \"Taro and his family\", or any other logical grouping that has Taro as the representative. Some words with collectives have become fixed phrases and (commonly) refer to one person. Specifically, \"kodomo\" 'child' and \"tomodachi\" 'friend' can be singular, even though \"-[t]omo\" and \"-[t]achi\" were originally collectivizing in these words; to unambiguously refer to groups of them, an additional collectivizing suffix is added: \"kodomotachi\" 'children' and \"tomodachitachi\" 'friends', though \"tomodachitachi\" is somewhat uncommon. \"Tachi\" is sometimes applied to inanimate objects, \"kuruma\" 'car' and \"kuruma-tachi\", 'cars', for example, but this usage is colloquial and indicates a high level of anthropomorphisation and childlikeness, and is not more generally accepted as standard.\n\nGrammatical cases in Japanese are marked by particles placed after the nouns. A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the sentence topic, other representing the subject. The most important case markers are the following:\n\n\nAlthough many grammars and textbooks mention pronouns (代名詞 \"daimeishi\"), Japanese lacks true pronouns. (\"Daimeishi\" can be considered a subset of nouns.) Strictly speaking, pronouns do not take modifiers, but Japanese \"daimeishi\" do: 背の高い彼 \"se no takai kare\" (lit. tall he) is valid in Japanese. Also, unlike true pronouns, Japanese \"daimeishi\" are not closed-class: new \"daimeishi\" are introduced and old ones go out of use relatively quickly.\n\nA large number of \"daimeishi\" referring to people are translated as pronouns in their most common uses. Examples: 彼 \"kare\", (he); 彼女 \"kanojo\", (she); 私 \"watashi\", (I); see also the adjoining table or a longer list. Some of these \"personal nouns\" such as 己 \"onore\", I (exceedingly humble), or 僕 \"boku\", I (young male), also have second-person uses: おのれ \"onore\" in second-person is an extremely rude \"you\", and \"boku\" in second-person is a diminutive \"you\" used for young boys. \"Kare\" and \"kanojo\" also mean \"boyfriend\" and \"girlfriend\" respectively, and this usage of the words is possibly more common than the use as pronouns.\n\nLike other subjects, Japanese deemphasizes personal \"daimeishi\", which are seldom used. This is partly because Japanese sentences do not always require explicit subjects, and partly because names or titles are often used where pronouns would appear in a translation:\n\nThe possible referents of \"daimeishi\" are sometimes constrained depending on the order of occurrence. The following pair of examples from Bart Mathias illustrates one such constraint.\n\nEnglish has a reflexive form of each personal pronoun (\"himself\", \"herself\", \"itself\", \"themselves\", etc.); Japanese, in contrast, has one main reflexive \"daimeishi\", namely \"jibun\" (自分), which can also mean 'I'. The uses of the reflexive (pro)nouns in the two languages are very different, as demonstrated by the following literal translations (*=impossible, ??=ambiguous):\n\nIf the sentence has more than one grammatical or semantic subject, then the target of \"jibun\" is the subject of the \"primary\" or \"most prominent action\"; thus in the following sentence \"jibun\" refers unambiguously to Shizuko (even though Makoto is the grammatical subject) because the primary action is Shizuko's reading.\n\nIn practice the main action is not always discernible, in which case such sentences are ambiguous. The use of \"jibun\" in complex sentences follows non-trivial rules.\n\nThere are also equivalents to \"jibun\" such as \"mizukara\". Other uses of the reflexive pronoun in English are covered by adverbs like \"hitorideni\" which is used in the sense of \"by oneself\". For example,\n\nChange in a verb's valency is not accomplished by use of reflexive pronouns (in this Japanese is like English but unlike many other European languages). Instead, separate (but usually related) intransitive verbs and transitive verbs are used. There is no longer any productive morphology to derive transitive verbs from intransitive ones, or vice versa.\n\nDemonstratives occur in the \"ko-\", \"so-\", and \"a-\" series. The \"ko-\" (proximal) series refers to things closer to the speaker than the hearer, the \"so-\" (medial) series for things closer to the hearer, and the \"a-\" (distal) series for things distant to both the speaker and the hearer. With \"do-\", demonstratives turn into the corresponding interrogative form. Demonstratives can also be used to refer to people, for example\n\nDemonstratives limit, and therefore precede, nouns; thus この本 \"kono hon\" for \"this/my book\", and その本 \"sono hon\" for \"that/your book\".\n\nWhen demonstratives are used to refer to things not visible to the speaker or the hearer, or to (abstract) concepts, they fulfill a related but different anaphoric role. The anaphoric distals are used for shared information between the speaker and the listener.\n\n\"Soko\" instead of \"asoko\" would imply that B doesn't share this knowledge about Sapporo, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the sentence. The anaphoric medials are used to refer to experience or knowledge that is not shared between the speaker and listener.\n\nAgain, \"ano\" is inappropriate here because Sato doesn't (didn't) know Tanaka personally. The proximal demonstratives do not have clear anaphoric uses. They can be used in situations where the distal series sound too disconnected:\n\nPrior to discussing the conjugable words, a brief note about \"stem forms\". Conjugative suffixes and auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem forms of the affixee. In modern Japanese there are the following six stem forms.\n\nNote that this order follows from the \"-a, -i, -u, -e, -o\" endings that these forms have in 五段 (5-row) verbs (according to the あ、い、う、え、お collation order of Japanese), where terminal and attributive forms are the same for verbs (hence only 5 surface forms), but differ for nominals, notably \"na\"-nominals.\n\nThe application of conjugative suffixes to stem forms follow certain euphonic principles (音便 \"onbin\"), which are discussed below.\n\nVerbs (動詞 \"dōshi\") in Japanese are rigidly constrained to the ends of clauses in what is known as the \"predicate position\". This means that the verb is always located at the end of a sentence.\n\nThe subject and objects of the verb are indicated by means of \"particles\", and the grammatical functions of the verb — primarily tense and voice — are indicated by means of conjugation. When the subject and the dissertative topic coincide, the subject is often omitted; if the verb is intransitive, the entire sentence may consist of a single verb. Verbs have two tenses indicated by conjugation, past and nonpast. The semantic difference between present and future is not indicated by means of conjugation. Usually there is no ambiguity as context makes it clear whether the speaker is referring to the present or future. Voice and aspect are also indicated by means of conjugation, and possibly agglutinating auxiliary verbs. For example, the continuative aspect is formed by means of the continuative conjugation known as the \"gerundive\" or \"-te form\", and the auxiliary verb \"iru\" \"to be\"; to illustrate, 見る \"miru\" (\"to see\") → 見ている \"mite iru\" (\"to be seeing\").\n\nVerbs can be semantically classified based on certain conjugations.\nThere are other possible classes, and a large amount of overlap between the classes.\n\nLexically, nearly every verb in Japanese is a member of exactly one of the following three regular \"conjugation groups\" (see also Japanese consonant and vowel verbs).\n\nThe \"row\" in the above classification means a row in the gojūon table. \"Upper 1-row\" means the row that is one row above the center row (the u-row) i.e. i-row. \"Lower 1-row\" means the row that is one row below the center row (the u-row) i.e. e-row. \"5-row\" means the conjugation runs though all 5 rows of the gojūon table. A conjugation is fully described by identifying both the row and the column in the gojūon table. For example, 見る (\"miru\", \"to see\") belongs to マ行上一段活用 (ma-column i-row conjugation), 食べる (\"taberu\", \"to eat\") belongs to バ行下一段活用 (ba-column e-row conjugation), and 帰る (\"kaeru\", \"to return\") belongs to ラ行五段活用(ra-column 5-row conjugation).\n\nOne should avoid confusing verbs in ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation) with verbs in 上一段活用 (i-row conjugation) or 下一段活用 (e-row conjugation). For example, 切る (\"kiru\", \"to cut\") belongs to ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone 着る (\"kiru\", \"to wear\") belongs to カ行上一段活用 (ka-column i-row conjugation). Likewise, 練る (\"neru\", \"to knead\") belongs to ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone 寝る (\"neru\", \"to sleep\") belongs to ナ行下一段活用 (na-column e-row conjugation).\n\nHistorical note: classical Japanese had upper and lower 1- and 2-row groups and a 4-row group (上／下一段 \"kami/shimo ichidan\", 上／下二段 \"kami/shimo nidan\", and 四段 \"yodan\", the \"nidan\" verbs becoming most of today's \"ichidan\" verbs (there were only a handful of \"kami ichidan\" verbs and only one single \"shimo ichidan\" verb in classical Japanese), and the \"yodan\" group, due to the writing reform in 1946 to write Japanese as it is pronounced, naturally became the modern \"godan\" verbs. Since verbs have migrated across groups in the history of the language, conjugation of classical verbs is not predictable from a knowledge of modern Japanese alone.\n\nOf the irregular classes, there are two:\nClassical Japanese had two further irregular classes, the \"na\"-group, which contained 死ぬ (\"shinu\", \"to die\") and 往ぬ (\"inu\", \"to go\", \"to die\"), the \"ra\"-group, which included such verbs as あり \"ari\", the equivalent of modern \"aru\", as well as quite a number of extremely irregular verbs that cannot be classified.\n\nThe following table illustrates the stem forms of the above conjugation groups, with the root indicated with dots. For example, to find the hypothetical form of the group 1 verb 書く \"kaku\", look in the second row to find its root, \"kak\", then in the hypothetical row to get the ending \"-e\", giving the stem form \"kake\". When there are multiple possibilities, they are listed in the order of increasing rarity.\n\n\nThe above are only the stem forms of the verbs; to these one must add various verb endings in order to get the fully conjugated verb. The following table lists the most common conjugations. Note that in some cases the form is different depending on the conjugation group of the verb. See Japanese verb conjugations for a full list.\n\nThe polite ending \"-masu\" conjugates as a group 1 verb, except that the negative imperfective and perfective forms are \"-masen\" and \"-masen deshita\" respectively, and certain conjugations are in practice rarely if ever used. The passive and potential endings \"-reru\" and \"-rareru\", and the causative endings \"-seru\" and \"-saseru\" all conjugate as group 2b verbs. Multiple verbal endings can therefore agglutinate. For example, a common formation is the \"causative-passive\" ending, \"-sase-rareru\".\nAs should be expected, the vast majority of theoretically possible combinations of conjugative endings are not semantically meaningful.\n\nJapanese has a large variety of related pairs of transitive verbs (that take a direct object) and intransitive verbs (that do not \"usually\" take a direct object), such as the transitive \"hajimeru\" (始める, someone or something begins an activity), and the intransitive \"hajimaru\" (始まる, an activity begins).\n\nNote: Some intransitive verbs (usually verbs of motion) take what it looks like a direct object, but it is not. For example, \"hanareru\" (離れる, to leave):\n\nSemantically speaking, words that denote attributes or properties are primarily distributed between two morphological classes (there are also a few other classes):\n\nUnlike adjectives in languages like English, \"i\"-adjectives in Japanese inflect for aspect and mood, like verbs. Japanese adjectives do not have comparative or superlative inflections; comparatives and superlatives have to be marked periphrastically using adverbs like \"motto\" 'more' and \"ichiban\" 'most'.\n\nEvery adjective in Japanese can be used in an attributive position. Nearly every Japanese adjective can be used in a predicative position; this differs from English where there are many common adjectives such as \"major\", as in \"a major question\", that cannot be used in the predicate position (that is, *\"The question is major\" is not grammatical English). There are a few Japanese adjectives that cannot predicate, known as 連体詞 (\"rentaishi,\" attributives), which are derived from other word classes; examples include 大きな \"ōkina\" \"big\", 小さな \"chiisana\" \"small\", and おかしな \"okashina\" \"strange\" which are all stylistic \"na\"-type variants of normal \"i\"-type adjectives.\n\nAll \"i\"-adjectives except for いい (\"ii\", good) have regular conjugations, and \"ii\" is irregular only in the fact that it is a changed form of the regular adjective 良い \"yoi\" permissible in the terminal and attributive forms. For all other forms it reverts to \"yoi\".\n\nCommon conjugations of adjectives are enumerated below. \"ii\" is not treated separately, because all conjugation forms are identical to those of \"yoi\".\n\nAdjectives too are governed by euphonic rules in certain cases, as noted in the section on it below. For the polite negatives of \"na\"-type adjectives, see also the section below on the copula だ \"da\".\n\nThe copula \"da\" behaves very much like a verb or an adjective in terms of conjugation.\n\nModern pronunciation is a result of a long history of phonemic drift that can be traced back to written records of the thirteenth century, and possibly earlier. However, it was only in 1946 that the Japanese ministry of education modified existing kana usage to conform to the standard dialect (共通語 \"kyōtsūgo\"). All earlier texts used the archaic orthography, now referred to as historical kana usage. The adjoining table is a nearly exhaustive list of these spelling changes.\n\nNote that palatalized morae combine with the initial consonant, if present, yielding a palatalized syllable. The most basic example of this is modern , which historically developed as → , via the → rule.\n\nA few sound changes are not reflected in the spelling. Firstly, \"ou\" merged with \"oo,\" both being pronounced as a long \"ō.\" Secondly, the particles は and を are still written using historical kana usage, though these are pronounced as \"wa\" and \"o,\" rather than \"ha\" and \"wo,\" with the rare exception of 〜んを, which is pronounced as \"-n wo,\" as in .\n\nAmong Japanese speakers, it is not generally understood that the historical \"kana\" spellings were, at one point, reflective of pronunciation. For example, the modern \"on'yomi\" reading for arose from historical . The latter was pronounced something like by the Japanese at the time it was borrowed (compare Middle Chinese ). However, a modern reader of a classical text would still read this as , the modern pronunciation.\n\nAs mentioned above, conjugations of some verbs and adjectives differ from the prescribed formation rules because of euphonic changes. Nearly all of these euphonic changes are themselves regular. For verbs the exceptions are all in the ending of the continuative form of group when the following auxiliary starts with a \"t\"-sound, \"i.e.\", た \"ta\", て \"te\", たり \"tari\", etc.\n\nThere is one other irregular change: 行く \"iku\" (to go), for which there is an exceptional continuative form: 行き \"iki\" + て \"te\" → 行って \"itte\", 行き \"iki\" + た \"ta\" → 行った \"itta\", etc.\n\nThere are dialectical differences, which are also regular and generally occur in similar situations. For example, in Kansai dialect the \"-i\" + \"t-\" conjugations are instead changed to \"-ut-,\" as in instead of , as perfective of . In this example, this can combine with the preceding vowel via historical sound changes, as in (\"au\" → \"ō\") instead of standard .\n\nThe continuative form of proper adjectives, when followed by polite forms such as or , undergoes a transformation; this may be followed by historical sound changes, yielding a one-step or two-step sound change. Note that these verbs are almost invariably conjugated to polite form, as and (note the irregular conjugation of \"gozaru,\" discussed below), and that these verbs are preceded by the \"continuative\" form – – of adjectives, rather than the terminal form – – which is used before the more everyday .\n\nThe rule is → (dropping the \"-k-\"), possibly also combining with the previous syllable according to the spelling reform chart, which may also undergo palatalization in the case of .\n\nHistorically there were two classes of proper Old Japanese adjectives, and (\"\"-ku\" adjective\" means \"not preceded by \"shi\"\"). This distinction collapsed during the evolution of Late Middle Japanese adjectives, and both are now considered adjectives. The sound change for \"-shii\" adjectives follows the same rule as for other \"-ii\" adjectives, notably that the preceding vowel also changes and the preceding mora undergoes palatalization, yielding → , though historically this was considered a separate but parallel rule.\n\nRespectful verbs such as くださる \"kudasaru\" 'to get', なさる \"nasaru\" 'to do', ござる \"gozaru\" 'to be', いらっしゃる \"irassharu\" 'to be/come/go', おっしゃる \"ossharu\" 'to say', etc. behave like group 1 verbs, except in the continuative and imperative forms.\n\nIn speech, common combinations of conjugation and auxiliary verbs are contracted in a fairly regular manner.\nThere are occasional others, such as \"-aranai\" → \"-annai\" as in → and → – these are considered quite casual and are more common among the younger generation.\n\nContractions differ by dialect, but behave similarly to the standard ones given above. For example, in Kansai dialect → .\n\nAdverbs in Japanese are not as tightly integrated into the morphology as in many other languages. Indeed, adverbs are not an independent class of words, but rather a role played by other words. For example, every adjective in the continuative form can be used as an adverb; thus, 弱い \"yowai\" 'weak' (adj) → 弱く \"yowaku\" 'weakly' (adv). The primary distinguishing characteristic of adverbs is that they cannot occur in a predicate position, just as it is in English. The following classification of adverbs is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.\n\nOften, especially for sound symbolism, the particle \"to\" \"as if\" is used. See the article on Japanese sound symbolism.\n\nExamples of conjunctions: そして \"soshite\" 'and then', また \"mata\" 'and then/again', etc.\nAlthough called \"conjunctions\", these words are, as English translations show, actually a kind of adverbs.\n\nExamples of interjections: はい (\"hai\", yes/OK/uh), へえ (\"hee\", wow!), いいえ (\"iie\", no/no way), おい (\"oi\", hey!), etc.\nThis part of speech is not very different from that of English.\n\nParticles in Japanese are postpositional, as they immediately follow the modified component. A full listing of particles is beyond the scope of this article, so only a few prominent particles are listed here. Keep in mind that the pronunciation and spelling differ for the particles \"wa\" (は), \"e\" (へ) and \"o\" (を): This article follows the Hepburn-style of romanizing them according to the \"pronunciation\" rather than spelling.\n\nThe complex distinction between the so-called topic (は \"wa\") and subject (が \"ga\") particles has been the theme of many doctoral dissertations and scholarly disputes. The clause 象は鼻が長い \"zō-wa hana-ga nagai\" is well known for appearing to contain two subjects. It does not simply mean \"the elephant's nose is long\", as that can be translated as 象の鼻は長い \"zō-no hana-wa nagai\". Rather, a more literal translation would be \"(speaking of) the elephant, its nose is long\".\n\nTwo major scholarly surveys of Japanese linguistics in English, (Shibatani 1990) and (Kuno 1973), clarify the distinction. To simplify matters, the referents of \"wa\" and \"ga\" in this section are called the \"topic\" and \"subject\" respectively, with the understanding that if either is absent, the grammatical topic and subject may coincide.\n\nAs an abstract and rough approximation, the difference between \"wa\" and \"ga\" is a matter of focus: \"wa\" gives focus to the \"action\" of the sentence, i.e., to the verb or adjective, whereas \"ga\" gives focus to the \"subject\" of the action. However, a more useful description must proceed by enumerating uses of these particles.\n\nHowever, when first being introduced to the topic and subject markers \"wa\" and \"ga\" most are told that the difference between the two is simpler. The topic marker, \"wa\", is used to declare or to make a statement. The subject marker, \"ga\", is used for new information, or asking for new information.\n\n\"See .\n\nThe use of \"wa\" to introduce a new theme of discourse is directly linked to the notion of grammatical theme. Opinions differ on the structure of discourse theme, though it seems fairly uncontroversial to imagine a first-in-first-out hierarchy of themes that is threaded through the discourse. Of course, human limitations restrict the scope and depth of themes, and later themes may cause earlier themes to expire. In these sorts of sentences, the steadfast translation into English uses constructs like \"\"speaking of X\" or \"on the topic of X\", though such translations tend to be bulky as they fail to use the thematic mechanisms of English. For lack of a comprehensive strategy, many teachers of Japanese emphasize the \"speaking of X\" pattern without sufficient warning.\n\nA common linguistic joke shows the insufficiency of rote translation with the sentence 僕はウナギだ \"boku wa unagi da\", which per the pattern would translate as \"I am an eel.\"\" (or \"(As of) me is eel\"). Yet, in a restaurant this sentence can reasonably be used to say \"My order is eel\" (or \"I would like to order an eel\"), with no intended humour. This is because the sentence should be literally read, \"As for me, it is an eel,\" with \"it\" referring to the speaker's order. The topic of the sentence is clearly not its subject.\n\nRelated to the role of \"wa\" in introducing themes is its use in contrasting the current topic and its aspects from other possible topics and their aspects. The suggestive pattern is \"\"X, but...\" or \"as for X, ...\"\".\n\nBecause of its contrastive nature, the topic cannot be undefined.\n\nIn this use, \"wa\" is required.\n\nIn practice, the distinction between thematic and contrastive \"wa\" is not that useful. Suffice it to say that there can be at most one thematic \"wa\" in a sentence, and it has to be the first \"wa\" if one exists, and the remaining \"wa\"s are contrastive. For completeness, the following sentence (due to Kuno) illustrates the difference.\n\nThe first interpretation is the thematic \"wa\", treating \"the people I know\" (\"boku ga shitte iru hito\") as the theme of the predicate \"none came\" (\"dare mo konakatta\"). That is, if I know A, B, ..., Z, then none of the people who came were A, B, ..., Z. The second interpretation is the contrastive \"wa\". If the likely attendees were A, B, ..., Z, and of them I know P, Q and R, then the sentence says that P, Q and R did not come. The sentence says \"nothing\" about A', B', ..., Z', all of whom I know, but none of whom were likely to come. (In practice the first interpretation is the likely one.)\n\nUnlike \"wa\", the subject particle \"ga\" nominates its referent as the sole satisfier of the predicate. This distinction is famously illustrated by the following pair of sentences.\n\nIt may be useful to think of the distinction in terms of the question each statement could answer, e.g.:\nfor the first statement, versus\nfor the second.\n\nSimilarly, in a restaurant, if the waitress asks who has ordered the eels, the customer who ordered it can say\n\nFor certain verbs, typically \"ga\" instead of \"o\" is used to mark what would be the direct object in English: \n\nThese notions that would be thought of as actions, or \"verbs\" in English, e.g. 出来る (to be able to), ほしい (is/are desirable), 好きだ (is/are liked), 嫌いだ (is/are disliked), etc., are in fact simply adjectives and intransitive verbs whose subject is what would be a direct object in the English translation. The equivalent of the English subject is instead the topic in Japanese and thus marked by \"wa\", reflecting the topic-prominent nature of Japanese grammar.\n\nThe direct object of transitive verbs is indicated by the object particle を \"o\".\n\nThis particle can also mean \"through\" or \"along\" or \"out of\" when used with motion verbs.\n\nThe general instrumental particle is で \"de\", which can be translated as \"using\" or \"by\":\n\nThis particle also has other uses: \"at\" (temporary location):\n\n\"In\":\n\n\"With\" or \"in (the span of)\":\n\nThe general locative particle is に \"ni\".\n\nIn this function it is interchangeable with へ \"e\". However, \"ni\" has additional uses: \"at (prolonged)\":\n\n\"On\":\n\n\"In (some year)\", \"at (some point in time)\":\n\nTo conjoin nouns, と \"to\" is used.\n\nThe additive particle も \"mo\" can be used to conjoin larger nominals and clauses.\n\nFor an incomplete list of conjuncts, や \"ya\" is used.\n\nWhen only one of the conjuncts is necessary, the disjunctive particle か \"ka\" is used.\n\nQuantities are listed between から \"kara\" 'from' and まで \"made\" 'to'.\n\nThis pair can also be used to indicate time or space.\n\nBecause \"kara\" indicates starting point or origin, it has a related use as \"because\", analogously to English \"since\" (in the sense of both \"from\" and \"because\"):\n\nThe particle \"kara\" and a related particle \"yori\" are used to indicate lowest extents: prices, business hours, etc.\n\n\"Yori\" is also used in the sense of \"than\".\n\nThe particle と \"to\" is used to set off quotations.\n\nIt is also used to indicate a manner of similarity, \"as if\", \"like\" or \"the way\".\n\nIn a related conditional use, it functions like \"after/when\", or \"upon\".\n\nFinally it is used with verbs like \"to meet (with)\" (会う \"au\") or \"to speak (with)\" (話す \"hanasu\").\n\nThis last use is also a function of the particle に \"ni\", but \"to\" indicates reciprocation which \"ni\" does not.\n\nFinally, the particle よ \"yo\" is used in a hortative or vocative sense.\n\nThe sentence-final particle か \"ka\" turns a declarative sentence into a question.\n\nOther sentence-final particles add emotional or emphatic impact to the sentence. The particle ね \"ne\" softens a declarative sentence, similar to English \"you know?\", \"eh?\", \"I tell you!\", \"isn't it?\", \"aren't you?\", etc.\n\nA final よ \"yo\" is used in order to soften insistence, warning or command, which would sound very strong without any final particles.\n\nThere are many such emphatic particles; some examples: ぜ \"ze\" and ぞ \"zo\" usually used by males; な \"na\" a less formal form of \"ne\"; わ \"wa\" used by females (and males in the Kansai region) like \"yo\", etc. They are essentially limited to speech or transcribed dialogue.\n\nCompound particles are formed with at least one particle together with other words, including other particles. The commonly seen forms are:\n\nOther structures are rarer, though possible. A few examples:\n\nAll auxiliary verbs attach to a verbal or adjectival stem form and conjugate as verbs. In modern Japanese there are two distinct classes of auxiliary verbs:\n\nIn classical Japanese, which was more heavily agglutinating than modern Japanese, the category of \"auxiliary verb\" included every verbal ending after the stem form, and most of these endings were themselves inflected. In modern Japanese, however, some of them have stopped being productive. The prime example is the classical auxiliary たり \"-tari\", whose modern forms た \"-ta\" and て \"-te\" are no longer viewed as inflections of the same suffix, and can take no further affixes.\n\nMuch of the agglutinative flavour of Japanese stems from helper auxiliaries, however. The following table contains a small selection of many such auxiliary verbs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "84566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84566", "title": "Killer application", "text": "Killer application\n\nIn marketing terminology, a killer application (commonly shortened to killer app) is any computer program that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as computer hardware, a gaming console, software, a programming language, a software platform, or an operating system. In other words, consumers would buy the (usually expensive) hardware just to run that application. A killer app can substantially increase sales of the platform on which it runs.\n\nOne of the first recognized examples of a killer application is generally agreed to be the VisiCalc spreadsheet for the Apple II series. Because it was not available on other computers for 12 months, people spent $100 for the software first, then $2,000 to $10,000 on the Apple computer they needed to run it. \"BYTE\" wrote in 1980, \"VisiCalc is the first program available on a microcomputer that has been responsible for sales of entire systems\", while \"Creative Computing\"s VisiCalc review was subtitled \"reason enough for owning a computer\". Others also chose to develop software, such as EasyWriter, for the Apple II first because of its higher sales, helping Apple defeat rivals Commodore International and Tandy Corporation.\n\nLotus 1-2-3 similarly benefited sales of the IBM PC and compatibles, just as VisiCalc did for Apple sales. Noting that computer purchasers did not want PC compatibility as much as compatibility with certain PC software, \"InfoWorld\" suggested \"let's tell it like it is. Let's not say 'PC compatible,' or even 'MS-DOS compatible.' Instead, let's say '1-2-3 compatible.'\" Another killer app is WordStar, the most popular word processor during much of the 1980s. Once the Internet became more widely available to consumers, email was seen as a killer app that drove people to purchase computers, even though email is a genre of applications rather than a single \"app.\"\n\nThe UNIX Operating System served as a killer application for the DEC PDP-11 minicomputer and VAX-11 minicomputer during roughly 1975–1985. Many of the PDP-11 and VAX-11 processors never ran DEC's operating systems (RSTS or VAX/VMS), but instead, they ran UNIX, which was first licensed in 1975. To get a virtual-memory UNIX (BSD 3.0) you had to purchase a VAX-11 computer. Many universities wanted a general-purpose timesharing system that would meet the needs of students and researchers (early versions of UNIX included free compilers for C, Fortran, and Pascal; at the time, offering even one free compiler was unprecedented). From its inception UNIX could drive high-quality typesetting equipment and later PostScript printers using the nroff/troff typesetting language, and this was also unprecedented for its time. UNIX was the first operating system offered in source-license form (a university license cost only $10,000, less than a PDP-11), allowing it to run on an unlimited number of machines, and allowing the machines to interface to any type of hardware because the UNIX I/O system was extensible.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term in print was 1988, in \"PC Week\" 24 May. 39/1. \"Everybody has only one killer application. The secretary has a word processor. The manager has a spreadsheet.\"\n\nThe definition of \"killer app\" came up during Bill Gates's questioning in the \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\" antitrust case. Bill Gates had written an email in which he described Internet Explorer as a killer app. In the questioning, he said that the term meant \"a popular application\", and did not connote an application that would fuel sales of a larger product or one that would supplant its competition, as the Microsoft Computer Dictionary defined it.\n\n\nThe term has also been applied to computer and video games that cause consumers to buy a particular video game console or gaming hardware over a competing one, by virtue of being exclusive to that platform. Such a game is also known in gaming parlance as a \"system seller\". Examples of a video game killer applications are:\n\n\n"}

The Kuikuro are a group of Indigenous people living in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Upper Xingu Language is part of the Southern branch of the Cariban language family. Although bilingualism in Brazilian Portuguese is prevalent among the men of the community, Kuikuro is not as immediately endangered as many of Brazilian Indigenous languages. As of 2006, there are an estimated 1,106 native speakers of Kuikuro worldwide, yielding the language a \"Threatened\" classification by The Endangered Languages Project. In collaboration with linguist Bruna Franchetto, the Kuikuro have created a library of recordings that feature Kuikuro stories in the language that is archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America\n\nVowels\nConsonants\nKuikuro is a dialect of the Upper Xingu Carib Language, which is a member of the Southern branch of the Carib family. Like most of the Carib family, Kuikuro is an agglutinative language with a highly complex morphology that effects both verbs and nouns. It is head-final and dependent marking. Its case system is ergative. A sample sentence shows the S/O V structure, the morphological richness, and the ergativity of Kuikuro:\n\nkatsogo-ko heke kangamuke-ko kagine-nügü \ndog-PL ERG child-PL frighten-PNCT \n‘(the) dogs frightened (the) children’\n\nKuikuro nouns can occur bare, with both number and definiteness being unmarked. Like many other neutral number languages (Korean, for example) there is a morpheme which - when affixed to a noun - denotes it as plural and marked. In Kuikuro this is the morpheme /-ko/. The following is demonstrative of one of the morpheme’s regular usages.\n\n ‘(the/a/some) fish/es’\n ‘(the/some) fishes’\n ‘(the/some) canoes’\n\nIt is important to note here that the morpheme /-ko/ is only used on nouns that are [+animate] as in (2) but not (3).\n\nIn addition to the bound morpheme /-ko/, there is a quantifier which also serves to pluralize nouns; /tuguhu/. This quantifier is used to indicate that its entire constituent is pluralized. Unlike /-ko/ it can be used to mark plurality on nouns that are [-animate]. The following data is a minimal pair of readings that show the scope of /tuguhu/ and its usage as a pluralizer of [-animate] nouns.\n\n Canoe many.together paddle canoe many.together \n canoe paddle-REL many.together \n\nThe preceding two morphemes are pluralizers of non-collective nouns. There is another set of morphemes which collectivize and pluralize nouns into sets that are – generally – based on the Kuikuro understanding of inter-personal relationships and kinship. Below is demonstrative of the collectivization concept, but not necessarily of the phono-morphological reality of its creation.\n\n 1-younger.brother-REL 1- younger.brother-REL.COLL \n‘my younger brother’ ‘all those whom I call ‘my younger brother’’\n\nThese collective plurals and the collective plural morphemes are rich and complex and warrant further study.\n\nPronouns and pronominal expressions in Kuikuro are bound morphemes that can be prefixed onto nouns, verbs, and certain particles. A partial set is listed below, allomorphs are not included.\n\nThese pronouns - when affixed to a VP - have an absolutive reading.\n\n 2-cry-CONT(-REL)-PL \n\nTo affect an ergative reading of a pronoun, it is prefixed to the ergative particle /heke/. The data below also shows that /-ko/ - as a pronominal pluralizer – is placed at the end of the verb construction.\n\n 2-see-CONT(-REL)-PL 1-ERG\n\nApart from their use as arguments for VPs, pronouns are also used to denote possession on NPs. These possessive prefixes are generally the same as their pronominal counter-parts. The data below also shows how the possessive pronouns are also split if they are in the plural.\n\n 3-bow-REL-PL \n\nPronouns surface in Kuikuro as pronominal prefixes. They can act as arguments when attached to VPs or certain morphemes like /heke/, and they can act as possessives. They also display a number of phonologically conditioned allomorphs. Unlike its treatment of plurality, Kuikuro’s use of pronouns is largely unremarkable.\n\nKuikuro from a typological prospective is ergative. There is no obvious absolutive case marker. The morpheme /heke/ is used with some variety of nominal or pronominal argument to denote the ergativity of the argument. Below is an example of a basic sentence.\n\n 1abs-help-cont 3-erg \n\nHowever, there is also data that suggests that there is an accusative element to the Kuikuro case system. This is shown in clefting situations, where /heke/ is not used and the language must find other strategies for showing case. In these scenarios, the verb takes on additional morphology to show for a non-agentive reading on the initial argument. Below is a pair of sentences that show the changes in their canonical form.\n\n 1-sister-af 3d-cop turtle eat-agnr-subs \n turtle-af ddist-cop 1-sister om-eat-cont \n\nThe ‘ng-‘ in the second example above is an object marker which blocks the reading of the sentence from being “it was a turtle that was eating my sister.” This is some evidence towards an accusative reading. But, there is no morphology on the argument itself and so it would be difficult to announce this as an accusative case rather than a different focus of the verb.\n\nOther than the possible issues presented above, Kuikuro is a rather straightforward example of an ergative case system.\n\nNumerals function quite differently in Kuikuro than the typical Indo-European system. First, there are morphemes for 1-5 and 10 only. The rest of the numerals are phrasal.\n\n takeko ‘Two’ \n\nThe rest of the numbers from 6-9 and 11-20 are expressed through phrase-level constructions such as the following.\n\n three cross-INSTNR on.foot\n\nIn NP-modifying constructions, numerals can occur either before the NP to be modified or at the end of the sentence.\n\n yesterday three macaw see-PNCT 1- ERG \n yesterday macaw see-PNCT 1- ERG three \n\nNeither of the above examples can be read as having been counting the VP. To achieve this, the numeral must occur immediately preceding the VP it is quantifying.\n\n DPROX moon-TEMP three 1-walk unit \n\nCritically, the above cannot be read as ‘three months’ but has to be a verb-numeral construction.\n\nThe counting of mass nouns hinges on the fact that Kuikuro is a number neutral language. In this system nouns can occur as either plural or singular and can occur bare. The Kuikuro grammar allows mass nouns to be counted using an assumed container. The following is a typical form.\n\n three pequi.oil \n three 1-have pequi.oil container \n\nNote that the morpheme /ingü/ is non-obligatory and that the container is assumed. This structure follows for all kinds of mass nouns.\n"}

She made her literary debut in 1997 when the journal \"La Plume\" published her short story “\"Kkumkkuneun marionetteu\"” (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) and novella \"Sangja sogeui pureun kal\" (상자 속의 푸른 칼 Blue Knife in the Box). She won the 26th Yi Sang Literary Award in 2002 for her short story \"Baemjangeo styu\" (뱀장어 스튜 Eel Stew) and the 6th Dongin Literary Award in 2005 for \"Kkotgemudeom\" (꽃게무덤 Crab Grave).\n\nKwon Ji-ye was born in Gyeongju, South Korea in 1960. She studied English literature at Ewha Womans University. In her time at Ewha, she was part of the literary society Darakbang (“Attic”) and won a writing contest run by the school. After graduating, however, her full-time job kept her from writing for nearly a decade. Her first job was at the publisher Minumsa and she went on to teach at a middle school. Then in 1991, she left for France and enrolled in the Asian studies program at Paris Diderot University. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on women in modern Korean literature.\n\nThe reason Kwon decided to continue her studies was that she believed a writing career would make her unhappy, even though she had wanted to become a writer since she was a student. Yet her stay in Paris turned out to spur her literary ambitions. She began writing to cope with the loneliness of living abroad. She made her literary debut in 1997 while she was still in Paris. In 1999, she returned to South Korea to focus on her literary career. She taught creative writing at Hanzhong University, but quit in 2003 to write full-time.\n\nA central theme in Kwon Ji-ye’s works is love. Her novels often feature the voices of women who yearn for passion in their lives. They explore the psychology of women in love and portray how love breaks down and disappears in our everyday lives. Kwon’s female protagonists often find romance through steamy affairs. They tend to have marriage troubles and attempt to fight their romantic fantasies or desire for an exciting life.\n\nKwon’s first short story collection \"Kkumkkuneun marionetteu\" (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) depicts protagonists cheating on their partners driven by lust. \"Yuhok\" (유혹 Seduction) is about a divorced college lecturer named Oh Yumi who flouts traditional sexual ethics and has multiple lovers.\n\nNot all of Kwon’s works focus on desires that deviate from social norms. Her 2010 novel \"Sawoleui mulgogi\" (4월의 물고기 April Fish) is about a pair of destined lovers in a monogamous relationship. Kwon mentioned in an interview that her views on love have changed as she grew older.\n\n1. 사임당의 붉은 비단보(2016)\n\n\"Saimdang’s Red Silk Cloth\" (2016)\n\n2. 유혹(2011)\n\n\"Seduction\" (2011)\n\n3. 4월의 물고기(2010)\n\n\"April Fish\" (2010)\n\n4. 퍼즐(2009)\n\n\"Puzzle\" (2009)\n\n5. 붉은 비단보(2008)\n\n\"Red Silk Cloth\" (2008)\n\n6. 반고흐 서른일곱에 별이 된 남자(2007)\n\n\"Van Gogh, the Man Who Became a Star at Thirty-Seven\" (2007)\n\n7. 해피 홀릭(2007)\n\n\"Happy-holic\" (2007)\n\n8. 사랑하거나 미치거나(2005)\n\n\"Love or Go Crazy\" (2005)\n\n9. 꽃게 무덤(2005)\n\n\"Crab Grave\" (2005)\n\n10. 권지예의 빠리 빠리 빠리(2004)\n\n\"Kwon Ji-ye’s Paris Paris Paris\" (2004)\n\n11. 아름다운 지옥(2004)\n\n\"A Beautiful Hell\" (2004)\n\n12. 폭소(2003)\n\n\"Fit of Laughter\" (2003)\n\n13. 꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨(2002)\n\n\"The Dreaming Marionette\" (2002)\n\n1.

Shortly afterwards, the Livemocha website required users' computers to have proprietary operating system Windows or Mac OS, blocking access from free software operating systems.\nOn January 8, 2014, Livemocha closed access to its legacy website.\n\nIn 2016, Livemocha's website posted an announcement saying \nAs early as December 2017 a new (self-employed) developer decided to recreate Livemocha to continue the primary concept of the network that was to help globalization by teaching new languages easily, now Livemocha has been recreated as livemocha.co, social network for language learning completely free, as well as an Android app Livemocha\n\nLivemocha supported 38 languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Esperanto, which was the most recent addition.\n\nThe site could be viewed in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish.\n\nFree basic courses were offered in all the above languages, consisting of roughly 30–50 hours of coursework. Several languages, like Lithuanian and Brazilian Portuguese, were first added to Livemocha through the process of \"Member Translation\": members fluent in two or more languages could translate already available course materials into their native tongue and publish the results on the site, with other users rating and improving the translations.\n\nMore advanced courses—called \"Active Courses\"—were available in five languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. These courses required a monthly or annual fee and were intended to achieve conversational fluency. Instead of signing up for one particular course, users could opt to purchase the \"Gold Key\" which granted unlimited access to premium or paid content. The active courses proceeded through four levels of proficiency, and included reading, writing, speaking, and listening exercises.\n\nEach reviewer earned 20 tokens for reviewing a user's submission. The reviewer could earn an extra 10 tokens for the first review of the passage or conversation. The writing was rated using three criteria: spelling, proficiency, and grammar. The speaking was rated using two criteria: pronunciation and proficiency. Each submission from a basic course for peer review cost 120 tokens.\n\nCompleted exercises from both basic and active courses could be sent out for review by other members (native or fluent speakers), who provided feedback and tips. Members could also pay for \"Expert Reviews\" from language teachers that had been certified by Livemocha for 120 tokens. The user could rate the quality of these reviews, and choose to work with a particular expert reviewer. Private instruction sessions, conducted via video chat with a selected tutor, were also available for purchase.\n\nMembers earned \"Mochapoints\" by completing exercises and reviewing other people's submissions. These points are not to be confused with the tokens. The tokens were earned for rating other people's submissions, or from paying a set fee in real life currency for a certain number of tokens. Mochapoints were a way to keep track of one's progress and to compare the amount of time a user has put into the website compared to others. A user gained Mochapoints for entering submissions, grading other people's submissions, chatting with other users, etc. They could not be spent for content access in the same way that the tokens could be.\n\nLivemocha called itself the largest language learning community in the world. In many ways it operated like a social networking site, and the basic ethos of the system was peer-to-peer: registered members could engage in synchronous and asynchronous communication, make a personal profile, connect with a circle of friends, upload content (there was a page dedicated to cultural exchange), contribute translations and help expand the base of available languages, and review other members’ work, such as recorded dialogues from lessons. It was referred to as \"the Facebook of foreign languages,\" and its potential impact on conventional language teaching compared to that of Wikipedia on the traditional encyclopedia. One reviewer of the site observed, \"With its unparalleled ability to connect people throughout the world, [the Internet] is changing the way that many people learn languages. There is still no way to avoid the hard slog through vocabulary lists and grammar rules, but the books, tapes and even CDs of yesteryear are being replaced by e-mail, video chats and social networks.\"\n\nIn September 2011, Livemocha announced a partnership with the Brazilian education company Abril Educação, part of the media conglomerate Grupo Abril, which purchased a 5.9% stake in the company. Abril Educação promoted Livemocha to consumers and organizations throughout Brazil, with the aim of catering to the rising demand for language education and helping the country prepare to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. In January 2011, Livemocha announced an agreement with Telefônica Brasil to offer its Internet customers discounted pricing on Livemocha's English courses.\n\nAccess to Livemocha's courses was available for free through a number of public libraries in the US that subscribe to the site, including the Seattle Public Library.\n\nLivemocha was a privately held company. In 2011, it raised 5 million dollars in venture capital. In previous years it raised 14 million dollars from investors August Capital and Maveron.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "203680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203680", "title": "Moore's paradox", "text": "Moore's paradox\n\nMoore's paradox concerns the apparent absurdity involved in asserting a first-person present-tense sentence such as, \"It's raining, but I don't believe that it is raining\" or \"It's raining but I believe that it is not raining.\" The first author to note this apparent absurdity was G. E. Moore. These 'Moorean' sentences, as they have become known, are paradoxical in that while they appear absurd, they nevertheless:\nThe term 'Moore's paradox' is attributed to Ludwig Wittgenstein, who considered the paradox Moore's most important contribution to philosophy. Wittgenstein wrote about the paradox extensively in his later writings, which brought Moore's paradox the attention it would not have otherwise received.\n\nMoore's paradox has also been connected to many other of the well-known logical paradoxes including, though not limited to, the liar paradox, the knower paradox, the unexpected hanging paradox, and the preface paradox.\n\nThere is currently no generally accepted explanation of Moore's paradox in the philosophical literature. However, while Moore's paradox remains a philosophical curiosity, Moorean-type sentences are used by logicians, computer scientists, and those working in the artificial intelligence community as examples of cases in which a knowledge, belief, or information system is unsuccessful in updating its knowledge/belief/information store in light of new or novel information.\n\nSince Jaakko Hintikka's seminal treatment of the problem, it has become standard to present Moore's paradox by explaining why it is absurd to assert sentences that have the logical form:\n\"P and NOT(I believe that P)\" or \"P and I believe that NOT-P.\"\nPhilosophers nowadays refer to these, respectively, as the omissive and commissive versions of Moore's paradox.\n\nMoore himself presented the problem in two ways.\n\nThe first more fundamental way of setting the problem up starts from the following three premises:\n\nI can assert that it is raining at a particular time. I can assert that I don't believe that it is raining at a particular time. If I say both at the same time, I am saying or doing something absurd. But the content of what I say—the proposition the sentence expresses—is perfectly consistent: it may well be raining, and I may not believe it. So why cannot I assert that it is so?\n\nMoore presents the problem in a second, distinct, way:\n\nI can assert that I \"was\" a certain way, e.g. believing it was raining when it wasn't, and that you, he, or they, \"are\" that way but not that I \"am\" that way.\n\nSubsequent philosophers have further noted that there is also an apparent absurdity in asserting a first-person \"future-tense\" sentence such as \"It will be raining, and I will believe that it is not raining.\" However, when it does not specify an exact time for when the belief is mistaken, the proposition will tend to be true at some point in the future - its negation would imply that \"Every time I believe it's not raining, it will not be raining\", which is unlikely since human beliefs are often mistaken.\n\nMany philosophers—though by no means all—also hold that Moore's paradox arises not only at the level of assertion but also at the level of belief. One who believes an instance of a Moorean sentence is tantamount to one who is subject to or engaging in self-deception, at least on one standard way of describing it.\n\nPhilosophical interest in Moore's paradox, since Moore and Wittgenstein, has undergone a resurgence, starting with, though not limited to, Jaakko Hintikka, continuing with Roy Sorensen, David Rosenthal, Sydney Shoemaker and the first publication, in 2007, of a collection of articles devoted to the problem.\n\nThere have been several proposed constraints on a satisfactory explanation in the literature, including (though not limited to):\n\nThe first two conditions have generally been the most challenged, while the third appears to be the \"least\" controversial. Some philosophers have claimed that there is, in fact, no problem in believing the content of Moore's sentences (e.g. David Rosenthal). Others (e.g. Sydney Shoemaker) hold that an explanation of the problem at the level of belief will automatically provide us with an explanation of the absurdity at the level of assertion via the linking principle that what can reasonably be asserted is determined by what can reasonably be believed. Some have also denied (e.g. Rosenthal) that a satisfactory explanation to the problem need be uniform in explaining both the omissive AND commissive versions. Most of the explanations offered of Moore's paradox are united in holding that contradiction is at the heart of the absurdity.\n\nOne type of explanation at the level of assertion exploits the view that assertion implies or expresses belief in some way so that if someone asserts that \"p\" they imply or express the belief that \"p\". Several versions of this view exploit elements of speech act theory, which can be distinguished according to the particular explanation given of the link between assertion and belief. Whatever version of this view is preferred, whether cast in terms of the Gricean intentions (see Paul Grice) or in terms of the structure of Searlean illocutionary acts (see speech act), it does not obviously apply to explaining the absurdity of the commissive version of Moore's paradox. To take one version of this type of explanation, if someone asserts \"p\" and conjoins it with the assertion (or denial) that he does not believe that \"p\", then he has in that very act contradicted himself, for in effect what the speaker says is: I believe that \"p\" and I do not believe that \"p\". The absurdity of asserting p\" & I do not believe that \"p is thus revealed as being of a more familiar kind. Depending on one's view of the nature of contradiction, one might thus interpret a speaker of the omissive Moorean sentence as asserting everything (that is, asserting \"too\" much) or asserting nothing (that is, not asserting \"enough\").\n\nAn alternative view is that the assertion \"I believe that \"p\" often (though not always) functions as an alternative way of asserting \"p\"\", so that the semantic content of the assertion \"I believe that \"p\" is just \"p\": it functions as a statement about the world and not about anyone's state of mind. Accordingly, what someone asserts when they assert \"p\" and I believe that not-\"p\" is just \"p\" and not-\"p\"\" Asserting the commissive version of Moore's sentences is again assimilated to the more familiar (putative) impropriety of asserting a contradiction.\n\nAt the level of belief, there are two main kinds of explanation. The first, much more popular one, agrees with those at the level of assertion that contradiction is at the heart of the absurdity. The contradiction is revealed in various ways, some using the resources of doxastic logic (e.g. Hintikka), others (e.g. Sorensen) principles of rational belief maintenance and formation, while still others appeal to our putative capacity for self-knowledge and the first-person authority (e.g. Shoemaker) we have over our states of mind.\n\nAnother alternative view, due to Richard Moran, views the existence of Moore's paradox as symptomatic of creatures who are capable of self-knowledge, capable of thinking \"for\" themselves from a deliberative point of view, as well as \"about\" themselves from a theoretical point of view. On this view, anyone who asserted or believed one of Moore's sentences would be subject to a loss of self-knowledge—in particular, would be one who, with respect to a particular 'object', broadly construed, e.g. person, apple, the way of the world, would be in a situation which violates, what Moran calls, the Transparency Condition: if I want to know what I think about X, then I consider/think about nothing but X itself. Moran's view seems to be that what makes Moore's paradox so distinctive is not some contradictory-like phenomenon (or at least not in the sense that most commentators on the problem have construed it), whether it be located at the level of belief or that of assertion. Rather, that the very possibility of Moore's paradox is a consequence of our status as agents (albeit finite and resource-limited ones) who are capable of knowing (and changing) their own minds.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1645681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1645681", "title": "Phla–Pherá languages", "text": "Phla–Pherá languages\n\nThe Phla–Pherá (\"Xwla–Xwela\") languages form a possible group of Gbe languages spoken mainly in southeastern and southwestern Benin; some communities are found in southeastern Togo and southwestern Nigeria. The group, comprising about ten varieties, was introduced by H.B. Capo in his 1988 classification of Gbe languages as one of the five main branches of Gbe. Additional research carried out by SIL International in the nineties corroborated many of Capo's findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings; in particular, Phla–Pherá was divided in an eastern and a western cluster. Phla–Pherá is one of the smaller Gbe branches in terms of number of speakers. It is also the most linguistically diverse branch of Gbe, due partly to the existence of several geographically separated communities, but mainly because of considerable influence by several non-Gbe languages in the past. Some of the Phla–Pherá peoples are thought to be the original inhabitants of the region having intermingled with Gbe immigrants.\n\nThe term \"Phla–Pherá\" is a conjunction of the names of two major dialects of this grouping. There exist many spelling variants of both names. Phla, pronounced , has been previously spelt \"Pla\", \"Kpla\", \"Xwla\", \"Hwla\", and \"Fla\" . Pherá, pronounced or , has been previously spelt \"Peda\", \"Fida\", \"Péda\", and \"Houéda\". For simplicity's sake, this article will use the unified standard orthography of Gbe set forth by Capo.\n\nMost Phla–Pherá languages are spoken in the Mono, Atlantique, and Oueme (Weme) provinces of Benin. Alada, a lect that is sometimes included in the Phla–Pherá group, is spoken in southwestern Nigeria just southeast of Benin's administrative capital Porto-Novo. One Phla–Pherá language, Xwla (pronounced ), is spoken west of the Mono river, along the coast between Anexo (Togo) and Grand Popo (Benin); this language has been called Popo in the past . Fon in its various shapes, representing another branch of Gbe, is the dominant language in this area and communities of Phla–Pherá speakers are scattered across the Fon area.\n\nThe Phla–Pherá languages are among the least investigated of the Gbe languages. In some cases, barely more is known than the name of a dialect and the village where it is spoken. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Phla–Pherá languages. A tentative approximation, based on the scanty demographic data available in the Ethnologue, is 400 000 speakers excluding Alada, or 600 000 to 700 000 including Alada.\n\nMuch of the comparative research for Hounkpati B.C. Capo's influential classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the seventies, and partial results trickled down in the late seventies and early eighties in the form of articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of Gbe. In his 1988 work \"Renaissance du Gbe\", the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time (part of the introduction in his 1991 \"A Comparative Phonology of Gbe\" is an English translation of this). In this classification, Phla–Pherá is considered one of the five branches of Gbe, the others being Ewe, Gen, Fon, and Ajá. According to Capo (1988:15), the Phla–Pherá group consists of the following lects:\n\nAyizɔ, Gbesi (\"gbesiin\") and Kotafɔn (\"kógbè\") are the same basic language.\n\nCapo grouped the Phla–Pherá lects mainly on the basis of a number of shared phonological and morphological features, including the development of proto-Gbe and into and , the retained distinction between and , and the occurrence of various nominal prefixes.\n\nCapo noted that ‘the name Phla–Pherá is not used by speakers of the various lects which it comprises’ and that ‘in fact, the Phla–Pherá section is less unified than the others’ . However, according to Capo, their speakers ‘recognise a closer link between the lects listed here than between any of those listed in other [branches]’. He marked the Alada variety as an exception, as some people 'consider Alada and the Fon language \"Gun\" to be one and the same language'.\n\nIn the early nineties, the Summer Institute of Linguistics initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing literacy efforts and whether additional development programs in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Linguistic research carried out in the course of this study was to shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe. Some of the results of this study were presented in Kluge (2000, 2005, 2006).\n\nBased on a synchronic analysis of lexical and grammatical features elicited among 49 Gbe varieties, Kluge divided the Gbe languages into three major groupings: western, central, and eastern . The eastern grouping consists of three clusters: Fon (roughly equivalent to Capo's 'Fon' branch), western Phla–Phera, and eastern Phla–Phera (together roughly equivalent to Capo's Phla–Pherá languages). Among other things, this part of Kluge's analysis confirmed the uncertainty of the classification of the Alada dialect: some possible results point to inclusion in the Fon group, while others suggest membership of one of the Phla–Pherá clusters . Likewise, Kluge's results indicate uncertainty regarding the classification of Ayizo and Kotafon .\n\nA number of lects considered by Kluge were not included in Capo's research (cf. Capo 1991:14ff), namely Ajra, Daxe, Gbesi, Gbokpa, Movolo, Se, and Seto, all of which Kluge (2000:32, 2005:41ff,47, 2006:74ff,79) classified as Phla–Phera.\n\nJust like Capo readily admitted the considerable diversity of the Phla–Pherá branch, Kluge's analysis did not result in conclusive evidence regarding the exact make-up of the western and eastern Phla–Pherá branches – various modes of computation yielded different configurations of the respective dialects (cf. 2000:62–3, 2005:45ff). The diversity in this subfamily is probably due in part to the fact that the various Phla–Pherá communities do not occupy one specific geographical area but are scattered along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\n\nHowever, a more substantial reason for the noted diversity is one of historical nature. In a 1979 work on the history of the Gbe peoples (called \"Adjatado\" back then), the Catholic missionary Roberto Pazzi pointed out that 'three dialects emerged from the half-breeding between immigrant groups and the indigenes from Tádó: they are Gɛ̀n, Sáhwè and Xweɖá.' . The latter two dialects are part of Capo's Phla–Pherá branch, and Capo adds that Tsáphɛ and Phelá have Cábɛ (Yoruboid) and E̟do respectively as substrata. This contact and intermingling of non-Gbe peoples with Gbe peoples and the influence of this processes on language inevitably diffuses the picture presented by comparative linguistic research. Further research into the historical origins of the Phla and Pherá peoples has yet to take place .\n\nDue to the uncertainty about the internal structure of the eastern Gbe major grouping, the Ethnologue has omitted Phla–Pherá altogether from its subclassification of Gbe languages. Some of the lects of Capo's and Kluge's Phla–Pherá are included in other branches (for example, Xwla is found under Aja) while others are not included in any subgroup of Gbe (e.g. Xwela).\n\n"}

Pocket parks are frequently created on a single vacant building lot or on small, irregular pieces of land. They also may be created as a component of the public space requirement of large building projects.\n\nPocket parks can be urban, suburban or rural, and can be on public or private land. Although they are too small for physical activities, pocket parks provide greenery, a place to sit outdoors, and sometimes a children's playground.

In inner-city areas, pocket parks are often part of urban regeneration plans and provide areas where wildlife such as birds can establish a foothold. Unlike larger parks, pocket parks are sometimes designed to be fenced and locked when not in use.\n\nSmall parks can increase the value of nearby homes. One study conducted in Greenville, South Carolina, found that \"attractively maintained small and medium parks have a positive influence on neighboring property values.\"\n\nPocket parks, such as the Balfour Street Park, can be created from small unused areas of public land.\n\nIn Santiago, Chile, the first pocket park (\"plaza de bolsillo\") was created beside of Palacio La Moneda at Morandé Street.

Some do not understand his work, but he too is firmly established now in a traditional Punjabi upbringing. He is equally well known in West Punjab. Of the three, Dhillon represents a totally new breed. His style is very anglicised, reflecting his upbringing in the west. In some eyes this has meant his Punjabi is not \"proper\". However, it is true reflection of the way English-bred second-generation Punjabis use it. But it is not only his grammar that irks traditionalists. His writing can be heavy and surreal, and hard to comprehend by those used to stories about village life. He is urban and better known in the Greater Punjab (Europe and America) then in the east.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3648169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3648169", "title": "Quasi-quotation", "text": "Quasi-quotation\n\nQuasi-quotation or Quine quotation is a linguistic device in formal languages that facilitates rigorous and terse formulation of general rules about linguistic expressions while properly observing the use–mention distinction. It was introduced by the philosopher and logician Willard van Orman Quine in his book \"Mathematical Logic\", originally published in 1940. Put simply, quasi-quotation enables one to introduce symbols that \"stand for\" a linguistic expression in a given instance and are \"used as\" that linguistic expression in a different instance.\n\nFor example, one can use quasi-quotation to illustrate an instance of substitutional quantification, like the following:\n\nQuasi-quotation is used to indicate (usually in more complex formulas) that the φ and \"φ\" in this sentence are \"related\" things, that one is the iteration of the other in a metalanguage. Quine introduced quasiquotes because he wished to avoid the use of variables, and work only with closed sentences (expressions not containing any variables). However, he still needed to be able to talk about sentences with arbitrary predicates in them, and thus, the quasiquotes provided the mechanism to make such statements. Quine had hoped that, by avoiding variables and schemata, he would minimize confusion for the readers, as well as staying closer to the language that mathematicians actually use.\n\nQuasi-quotation is sometimes denoted using the symbols ⌜ and ⌝ (unicode U+231C, U+231D), or double square brackets, ⟦ ⟧, (\"Oxford brackets\") instead of ordinary quotation marks.\n\nQuasi-quotation is particularly useful for stating formation rules for formal languages. Suppose, for example, that one wants to define the well-formed formulas (wffs) of a new formal language, \"L\", with only a single logical operation, negation, via the following recursive definition:\n\n\nInterpreted literally, rule 2 does not express what is apparently intended. For '~φ' (that is, the result of concatenating '~' and 'φ', in that order, from left to right) is not a wff of \"L\", because no Greek letter can occur in wffs, according to the apparently intended meaning of the rules. In other words, our second rule says \"If some sequence of symbols φ (for example, the sequence of 2 symbols φ = '~~\"p\"') is a wff of \"L\", then the sequence of 2 symbols '~φ' is a wff of \"L\"\". Rule 2 needs to be changed so that the second occurrence of 'φ' (in quotes) be not taken literally.\n\nQuasi-quotation is introduced as shorthand to capture the fact that what the formula expresses isn't precisely quotation, but instead something about the concatenation of symbols. Our replacement for rule 2 using quasi-quotation looks like this:\n\nThe quasi-quotation marks '⌜' and '⌝' are interpreted as follows. Where 'φ' denotes a wff of \"L\", '⌜~φ⌝' denotes the result of concatenating '~' and \"the wff denoted by\" 'φ' (in that order, from left to right). Thus rule 2' (unlike rule 2) entails, e.g., that if <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"p\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> is a wff of \"L\", then '~\"p\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> is a wff of \"L\".\n\nSimilarly, we could not define a language with disjunction by adding this rule:\n\nBut instead:\n\nThe quasi-quotation marks here are interpreted just the same. Where 'φ' and 'ψ' denote wffs of \"L\", '⌜(φ v ψ)⌝' denotes the result of concatenating left parenthesis, the wff denoted by 'φ', space, 'v', space, the wff denoted by 'ψ', and right parenthesis (in that order, from left to right). Just as before, rule 2.5' (unlike rule 2.5) entails, e.g., that if <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"p\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> and <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"q\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> are wffs of \"L\", then '(\"p\" v \"q\")' is a wff of \"L\".\n\nIt does not make sense to quantify into quasi-quoted contexts using variables that range over things other than character strings (e.g. numbers, people, electrons). Suppose, for example, that one wants to express the idea that <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"s\"(0)' denotes the successor of 0, \"'s\"(1)' denotes the successor of 1, etc. One might be tempted to say:\n\n\nSuppose, for example, \"φ\" = 7. What is ⌜\"s\"(\"φ\")⌝ in this case? The following tentative interpretations would all be equally absurd:\n\n\nOn the other hand, if \"φ\" = '7', then ⌜\"s\"(\"φ\")⌝ = 's(7)', and if \"φ\" = 'seven', then ⌜\"s\"(\"φ\")⌝ = 's(seven)'.\n\nThe expanded version of this statement reads as follows:\n\n\nThis is a category mistake, because a number is not the sort of thing that can be concatenated (though a numeral is).\n\nThe proper way to state the principle is:\n\n\nIt is tempting to characterize quasi-quotation as a device that allows quantification into quoted contexts, but this is incorrect: quantifying into quoted contexts is \"always\" illegitimate. Rather, quasi-quotation is just a convenient shortcut for formulating ordinary quantified expressions—the kind that can be expressed in first-order logic.\n\nAs long as these considerations are taken into account, it is perfectly harmless to \"abuse\" the corner quote notation and simply use it whenever something like quotation is necessary but ordinary quotation is clearly not appropriate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2491221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2491221", "title": "Quebec English", "text": "Quebec English\n\nQuebec English encompasses the English dialects (both native and non-native) of the predominantly French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec. There are few distinctive phonological features and very few restricted lexical features common among English-speaking Quebecers. The English spoken in Quebec generally belongs to Standard Canadian English, whose speech region comprises one of the largest and most relatively homogeneous dialect areas in North America, arguably even classifiable under General American. This standard native-English accent is common in Montreal, where the vast majority of native English speakers in Quebec live. English-speaking Montrealers have, however, established ethnic groups that retain certain lexical features: Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities that all speak discernible varieties of English. Isolated fishing villages on the Basse-Côte-Nord of Quebec speak Newfoundland English, and many Gaspesian English-speakers use Maritime English. Francophone speakers of Quebec (including Montreal) also have their own second-language English that incorporates French accent features, vocabulary, etc. Finally, the Kahnawake Mohawks of south shore Montreal and the Cree and Inuit of Northern Quebec speak English with their own distinctive accents, usage, and expressions from their indigenous languages.\n\nThe following are native-English (anglophone) phenomena unique to Quebec, particularly studied in Montreal English and spoken by the minority of Quebec Anglophone speakers in the Montreal area. Anglophone English was originally the dominant dialect of Quebec and the Montreal area. However, by the 1970s the Quebec Government imposed new legislation to protect and enforce French as the main language of the people of Quebec. This legislation also change English from its official language status in Quebec to a minority status. This legislation stopped English from being the language taught at school or spoken at work and the main purpose of this legislation was to keep French an active language in Quebec.:\n\nAnglophone Montreal speaks Standard Canadian English, which has the Canadian Vowel Shift and Canadian raising, with some additional features:\n\nQuebec English is heavily influenced by English and French the phrases / words below shows the variation of meaning among the Quebec English dialect.\n\nDelay: an amount of time given before a deadline. \" I was given a delay of 2 weeks before my project was due\"\n\nAn Animator: is not an artist but is someone who meets and entertains children.\n\nIn most of Canada, a sweet carbonated beverage is commonly referred to as a \"pop,\" but in Montreal, it is a \"soda\" or \"soft drink.\" The phrase \"in hospital\" is often replaced by \"in the hospital.\"\n\nA Formation - this word in English would normally mean a routine stance used in a professional formation. (I.E. The men stood in formation ) in Quebec a Formation is reference to an education.\n\nA Pass - this phrase originates from Italian speakers, the phrase \" Pass\" is often used in phrase such as I am going to pass by a friend on the way to the movies. The phrase is comparatively used when already your already completing one action but can squeeze in another action on the way to your destination.\n\nIn standard English this phrase \"Your Bus will pass in 2 minutes \" would mean that your are about to miss your bus or that you have already missed your bus. Alternatively in Montreal the Phrase \" Pass \" can also mean to arrive or stop as a way to show that the action will happen in a relatively short time frame. Example : \" Your bus will pass in 2 minutes\"\n\nAnother Phrase is the word \"Corner peel\" this phrase is used in conjunction with media outlets and advertising agency in the Montreal area. In English when giving directions to a store you would normally say this store is at the corner of 1st ave and 2nd ave. However, in Montreal the phrase is changed to this store is located at the corner peel of 1st ave and 2nd ave.\n\nEnglish-speakers commonly use French-language toponyms and official names for local institutions and organizations with no official English names. The names are pronounced as in French, especially in broadcast media. Examples include the Régie du logement, the Collège de Maisonneuve, Québec Solidaire, the Parti québécois, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and Trois-Rivières.\n\n\"Pie-IX\" (as in the boulevard, bridge and subway station) is pronounced or . On the other hand, a final written consonant may be included or added in pronunciation if a historic English-language name and pronunciation exists among Anglophone or English-dominant Allophone communities that are associated with particularly neighbourhoods. Examples are \"Bernar\"d\" Street,\" which in French is known as \"rue Bernard\". \"Montreal\" is always pronounced [ˌmɐntʃɹiˈɒl], following its historic official English-language name, but \"Quebec\" is pronounced or sometimes . English-speakers generally pronounce the French \"Saint-\" (m.) and \"Sainte-\" (f.) in street and place names as the English word \"saint\"; however, Saint-Laurent (the former city, now a borough of Montreal) can be pronounced as in Quebec French , but Saint Lawrence Boulevard can be said as \"Saint-Laurent\" (silent \"t\") or as the original English name, \"Saint Lawrence\". Sainte-Foy is pronounced . \"Saint-Denis\" is often pronounced , or . Verdun, as a place name, has the expected English-language pronunciation, , but English-speakers from Verdun traditionally pronounce the eponymous street name as . Saint-Léonard, a borough of Montreal, is pronounced \"Saint-Lee-o-nard\" , which is neither English nor French. Some French-language place names are very difficult for English speakers to say without adopting a French accent, such as Vaudreuil, Belœil, and Longueuil in which pronunciation of the segment (spelled \"euil\" or \"œil\") is a challenge and so most often pronounced as , and or less often . Used by both Quebec-born and outside English-speakers, acronyms with the letters pronounced in English, not French, rather than the full name for Quebec institutions and some areas on Montreal Island are common, particularly if the English-language names are or were official. For instance, \"SQ\" → Sûreté du Québec (pre-Bill 101: \"QPP\" → \"Quebec Provincial Police\", as it once was); \"NDG\" → Notre-Dame-de-Grâce; \"DDO\" → Dollard-des-Ormeaux; \"TMR\" → Town of Mount Royal, the bilingual town's official English name.\n\n\nThe use of a limited number of Quebec French terms for everyday place nouns (and occasional items) that have English equivalents; all of them are pronounced with English pronunciations or have undergone English clippings or abbreviations and so are regarded as ordinary English terms by Quebecers. Some of them tend sometimes to be preceded by \"the\" in contexts for which they could normally take \"a/an\".\n\nThe pronunciation of French-language first and last names uses mostly-French sounds may be mispronounced by speakers of other languages. For example, the pronounced \"r\" sound and the silent \"d\" of \"Bouchar\"d\"\" may be both pronounced: . French-speakers and Quebec English-speakers are more likely to vary such pronunciations, depending on the manner in which they adopt an English phonological framework. That includes names like \"Mario Lemieux\", \"Marie-Claire Blais\", \"Jean Charest\", \"Jean Chrétien\", \"Robert Charlebois\", and \"Céline Dion\".\n\nFrancophone second-language speakers of English use an interlanguage with varying degrees, ranging from French-accented pronunciation to Quebec Anglophone English pronunciation. High-frequency second-language phenomena by francophones, allophones, and other non-native-speakers occur in the most basic structures of English, both in and outside of Quebec. Commonly called \"Frenglish\" or \"franglais\", such phenomena are a product of interlanguage, calques, or mistranslation and thus may not constitute so-called \"Quebec English\" to the extent that they can be conceived of separately, particularly since such phenomena are similar for Francophone-speakers of English throughout the world, which leaves little to be specific to Quebec.\n\nFrancophones speaking English often pronounce / instead of /, and some also pronounce for the phoneme , and some mispronounce some words, some pronounce a full vowel instead of a schwi, such as for \"message\". Since French-speakers greatly outnumber English-speakers in most regions of Quebec, it is more common to hear French in public. Some Anglophones in overwhelmingly-Francophone areas use some of the features (especially the replacement of and by [t] and [d]), but their English is remarkably similar to that of other varieties of English in Canada (Poplack, Walker, & Malcolmson 2006 ).\n\nThere is also a pronunciation (\"NP\") of the phoneme as /n/ + /ɡ/ (among some Italian Montrealers) or /n/ + /k/ (among some Jewish Montrealers, especially those who grew up speaking Yiddish), such as by high degrees of ethnic connectivity within, for instance, municipalities, boroughs, or neighbourhoods on Montreal Island, such as Saint-Léonard and Outremont/Côte-des-Neiges/Côte Saint-Luc. Such phenomena occur as well in other diaspora areas such as New York City.\n\n\n\n\nFew anglophone Quebeckers use many such false cognates, but most understand such high-frequency words and expressions. Some of these cognates are used by many francophones, and others by many allophones and anglophone accultured in allophone environments, of varying English proficiencies, from the bare-minimum level to native-speaker level.\n\n\n"}

Spiritually inclined from the young age, he became a follower of Shrimad Rajchandra, a Jain spiritual teacher. He completed doctoral studies on Shrimad's work \"Atmasiddhi\". He founded Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, Dharampur to support his spiritual and social activities.\n\nRakeshbhai Jhaveri was born in Mumbai, India on 26 September 1966 to Shri Dilip and Rekha Jhaveri, who followed the Shwetambara Murtipujaka tradition of Jainism. In 1968, Sahaj Anandji, a monk from Rajasthan who had established Shrimad Rajchandra Ashram at Hampi, was at Palitana. Rakeshbhai's parents were influenced by Sahaj Anandji who passed away in 1970 and was succeeded by Mataji. \n\nIn 1972, Rakeshbhai began his academic studies at Activity High School in Mumbai. From an early age, he was spiritually inclined. His mother and others have recounted miracles prior to and after his birth. From the age of four he began speaking about Jain philosophy. He first encountered Shrimad Rajchandraji when a copy of fell and he saw the photograph of Shrimad Rajchandra. He recounted that he went into deep meditation for 72 hours after this incident, which led to (recounting of previous lives). \n\nIn 1978, Rakeshbhai visited Hampi and stayed for eighteen months. A \"satsang-mandal\" (devotional group) was formed by 1978 and some followers had already started to call him Guru by 1980. During his visit to his aunt in Jaipur, he decided to devote rest of his life to spiritual activities. In 1983, he visited Hampi again and stayed there for two years. There he was nominated as Mataji's successor. In 1985, he returned to Mumbai upon his parents' request and started studying religious texts, practicing yoga and learning Indian classical music. He observed silence for twelve hours a day and traveled extensively between 1985 and 1990. During this period, the number of followers around him continued to grow. During his holidays in Nepal, he decided to pursue the college studies.\n\nHe completed B. A. from Osmania University, Hyderabad, in 1988. In 1989, he visited Antwerp for his father's treatment where his discourses were attended by increasing number of followers. He completed M. A. in Philosophy in 1991 from the University of Mumbai. He started his doctoral studies on \"Atmasiddhiji\", a spiritual work composed by Shrimad Rajchandraji, in January 1994 under Ramanlal Shah. He was awarded PhD on 2 December 1998 by the University of Mumbai. He had vowed not to give a public discourse until his PhD was completed. He gave his first public discourse in Rajkot on 13 April 2001.\n\nRakesh Jhaveri established Shrimad Rajchandra Adhyatmik Satsang Sadhana Kendra in 1994 to organise his followers which was later succeeded by the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur. On 13 May 1999, the construction of an ashram spread across 223 acres at Dharampur was started and was opened in April 2001. The ashram is located on the hillock of Mohangadh which was an estate of the last ruler of the erstwhile Dharampur State. In 2002, he started initiating followers, s, who give up worldly possessions and commit to celibacy. He gives the series of discourses to his followers at the ashram throughout the year. He gives discourses in Mumbai once a month on , a compilation of Shrimad Rajchandra's letters, personal diaries and transcriptions of his spiritual discourses. He also prescribes an annual scriptural study schedule to his followers.\n\nIn November 2016, the Mission produced a play, \"Yugpurush: Mahatma na Mahatma\" depicting spiritual relationship between Shrimad Rajchandra and Mahatma Gandhi. The Mission opened a science college in Dharampur, Shrimad Rajchandra Vidyapeeth, the same month. In November 2017, the 34-feet tall statue of Shrimad Rajchandra was unveiled at the ashram. By 2017, the Mission had 102 Satsang centres, 39 Youth Group Centres and 227 Divine Touch Centres worldwide.\n\nHe established Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care (SRLC); a non-governmental organisation that provides medical, educational and humanitarian services; in 2003.\n\nThough he follows several principles of Jain monasticism, such as observing \"mahavrata\"s (major vows), he does not consider himself a monk. He resides with his followers at the ashram in Dharampur and with his family when in Mumbai.\n\nHe was awarded the Gandhi Seva Medal by the Gandhi Global Family, an NGO, in 2017.\n\n\n"}

The two dialects are, according to Garber (1987), ‘quite mutually intelligible’. Sometimes speakers of Sucite will even refer to themselves as speaking Supyire. Another closely related lect is Mamara (also known as Minyanka).\n\nSome other Senufo groups refers to the Sùcìté people as Tagba, because they live on the Tagouara plateau. There are various ways to spell the dialect names. Variants of Sùcìté include Sìcìté, Sìpììté, and Sicire. The SIL language code is SEP.\n\nAll vowels can be lengthened and nasalized. The schwa /ə/ is included in brackets because it is found only in two specific environments, where it appears to be in complementary distribution with some other vowel.\n\nGeminate voiced stops/affricates are cognate to prenasalized voiceless stops in Supyire, and are indicated orthographically as in Garber (1987).\n\nSucite is a tonal language with three surface tone levels: High, Mid, and Low.

Ukrainian grammar still allows for to alternate with either or in the regular inflection of certain words. The absence of consonant palatalization before has become rare, however, but is still allowed.\n\nWhile the labial consonants cannot be phonemically palatalized, they can still precede one of the iotating vowels , when many speakers replace the would-be sequences with the consonant clusters , a habit also common in nearby Polish. The separation of labial consonant from is already hard-coded in many Ukrainian words (and written as such with an apostrophe), such as in \"Vyacheslav\", \"name\" and \"five\".\n\nDental sibilant consonants become palatalized before any of the labial consonants followed by one of the iotating vowels , but the labial consonants themselves cannot retain phonemic palatalization. Thus, words like \"holiday\" and \"matchmaker\" retain their separate pronunciations (whether or not an actual is articulated).\n\nSibilant consonants (including affricates) in clusters assimilate with the place of articulation and palatalization state of the last segment in a cluster. The most common case of such assimilation is the verbal ending in which assimilates into .\n\nDental plosives assimilate to affricate articulations before coronal affricates or fricatives and assume the latter consonant's place of articulation and palatalization. If the sequences regressively assimilate to , they gain geminate articulations .\n\nThere are some typical deviations which may appear in spoken language (often under the influence of Russian); usually they are considered as phonetic errors by linguists.\n\nModern standard Ukrainian descends from Common Slavic and is characterized by a number of sound changes and morphological developments, many of which are shared with other East Slavic languages.
