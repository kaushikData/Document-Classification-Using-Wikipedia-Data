{"id": "50321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50321", "title": "Amy Tan", "text": "Amy Tan\n\nAmy Tan (born February 19, 1952) is an American writer whose works explore mother-daughter relationships and the Chinese American experience. Her novel \"The Joy Luck Club\" was adapted into a film in 1993 by director Wayne Wang.\n\nTan has written several other novels, including \"The Kitchen God's Wife\", \"The Hundred Secret Senses\", \"The Bonesetter's Daughter\", \"Saving Fish from Drowning\", and \"The Valley of Amazement\". Tan's latest book is a memoir entitled \"Where The Past Begins: A Writer's Memoir\" (2017). In addition to these, Tan has written two children's books: \"The Moon Lady\" (1992) and \"Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat\" (1994), which was turned into an animated series that aired on PBS.\n\nDespite her success, Tan has also received substantial criticism for her depictions of Chinese culture and apparent adherence to stereotypes.\n\nTan was born in Oakland, California. She is the second of three children born to Chinese immigrants John and Daisy Tan. Her father was an electrical engineer and Baptist minister who traveled to the United States in order to escape the chaos of the Chinese Civil War. Tan attended Marian A. Peterson High School in Sunnyvale for one year. When she was fifteen years old, her father and older brother Peter both died of brain tumors within six months of each other.\n\nDaisy subsequently moved Amy and her younger brother, John Jr., to Switzerland, where Amy finished high school at the Institut Monte Rosa, Montreux. During this period, Amy learned about her mother's previous marriage to another man in China, of their four children (a son who died as a toddler and three daughters), and how her mother left these children behind in Shanghai. This incident was the basis for Tan's first novel \"The Joy Luck Club\". In 1987, Amy traveled with Daisy to China. There, Amy met her three half-sisters.\n\nTan had a difficult relationship with her mother. At one point, Daisy held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her while the two were arguing over Amy's new boyfriend. Her mother wanted Tan to be independent, stressing that Tan needed to make sure she was self-sufficient. Tan later found out that her mother had three abortions while in China. Daisy often threatened to kill herself, saying that she wanted to join her mother (Tan's grandmother, who also committed suicide). She attempted suicide but never succeeded. Daisy died in 1999.\n\nTan and her mother did not speak for six months after Tan dropped out of the Baptist college her mother had selected for her, Linfield College in Oregon, to follow her boyfriend to San Jose City College in California. Tan met him on a blind date and married him in 1974. Tan later received bachelor's and master's degrees in English and linguistics from San Jose State University. She also participated in doctoral studies in linguistics at UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley, but abandoned her doctoral studies in 1976.\n\nWhile in school, Tan worked odd jobs—serving as a switchboard operator, carhop, bartender, and pizza maker—before starting a writing career. As a freelance business writer, she worked on projects for AT&T, IBM, Bank of America, and Pacific Bell, writing under non-Chinese-sounding pseudonyms.\n\nWhile Tan was studying at Berkeley, her roommate was murdered, and Tan had to identify the body. The incident left her temporarily mute. She claimed that every year for ten years, on the day she identified the body, she lost her voice.\n\nIn 1998, Tan contracted Lyme disease, which went misdiagnosed for a few years. As a result, she suffers complications like epileptic seizures. Tan co-founded LymeAid 4 Kids, which helps uninsured children pay for treatment. She wrote about her life with Lyme disease in \"The New York Times\".\n\nTan also suffers from depression, for which she takes antidepressants. Part of the reason that Tan chose not to have children was a fear that she would pass on a genetic legacy of mental instability - her maternal grandmother committed suicide, her mother threatened suicide often, and she herself has struggled with suicidal ideation.\n\nTan resides in San Francisco, California, with her husband in a house they designed \"to feel open and airy, like a tree house, but also to be a place where we could live comfortably into old age\" with accessibility features. Tan has recently taken up drawing and has shared her art on social media.\n\nTan sang with the Rock Bottom Remainders before they retired from touring.\n\nTan's first novel, \"The Joy Luck Club\", consists of sixteen related stories about the experiences of four Chinese American mother-daughter pairs. Tan's second novel, \"The Kitchen God's Wife\", also focuses on the relationship between an immigrant Chinese mother and her American-born daughter. Tan's third novel, \"The Hundred Secret Senses\", was a departure from the first two novels, in focusing on the relationships between sisters. Tan's fourth novel, \"The Bonesetter's Daughter\", returns to the theme of an immigrant Chinese woman and her American-born daughter.\n\nTan's work has been adapted into several different forms of media. \"The Joy Luck Club\" was adapted into a play in 1993; that same year, director Wayne Wang adapted the book into a film. \"The Bonesetter's Daughter\" was adapted into an opera in 2008. Tan's children's book \"Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat\" was adapted into a PBS animated television show.\n\nThough she has won several awards for her work, Tan has also received substantial criticism for her \"complicity in perpetuating racial stereotypes and misrepresentations as well as gross inaccuracies in recalling details of the Chinese cultural heritage\". Sau-ling Cynthia Wong, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that Tan's novels \"appear to possess the authority of authenticity but are often products of the American-born writer's own heavily mediated understanding of things Chinese\". Another writer stated that the popularity of Tan's work can mostly be attributed to Western consumers \"who find her work comforting in its reproduction of stereotypical images\".\n\nThe often negative depiction of Chinese culture and Chinese men in Tan's work has raised eyebrows, with one scholar going so far as to say that the storylines of her novels \"demonstrate a vested interest in casting Chinese men in the worst possible light\". This, in addition to the lack of cultural and historical accuracy in Tan's work, has led several writers and scholars to accuse Tan of \"pandering to the popular imagination\" of Westerners regarding Chinese people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "663693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=663693", "title": "Artistic language", "text": "Artistic language\n\nAn artistic language, or artlang, is a constructed language designed for aesthetic pleasure. Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use it as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world.\n\nUnlike engineered languages or auxiliary languages, artistic languages often have irregular grammar systems, much like natural languages. Many are designed within the context of fictional worlds, such as J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Others can represent fictional languages in a world not patently different from the real world, or have no particular fictional background attached.\n\nThere are several different schools of artlang construction. The most prominent is the naturalist school, which seeks to imitate the complexity and historicity of natural languages. Others typically follow a more abstract style, as the intent behind their construction differs. \n\nSeveral different genres of constructed languages are classified as 'artistic'. An artistic language may fall into any one of the following groups, depending on the aim of its use.\nSimilarly to philosophical languages, artlangs are created in accordance with an initially defined principle in mind.\n\nBy far the largest group of artlangs are fictional languages (sometimes also referred to as \"professional artlangs\"). Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world, and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. By analogy with the word \"conlang\", the term \"conworld\" is used to describe these worlds, inhabited by fictional constructed cultures.\n\nThere are two major categories of fictional languages.\n\nProfessional fictional languages are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and songs. Prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the Middle-earth and \"Star Trek\" universes, the game Ico and the songs of the French band Magma, singing in Kobaïan.\n\nInternet-based fictional languages are hosted along with their \"conworlds\" on the Internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites. An example is Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder's Verduria on the planet of Almea.\n\nAlternative languages, or \"altlangs\", speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different: e.g., What if Greek civilization had gone on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving Greek and not Latin to develop several modern descendants? The language that \"would have\" evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its modern form. An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another. The best-known language of this category is Brithenig, which initiated the interest among Internet conlangers in devising such alternate-historical languages, like Wenedyk. Brithenig attempts to determine how Romance languages would have evolved had Roman influence in Britain been sufficient to replace Celtic languages with Vulgar Latin, and bases its phonology on that of Welsh. An earlier instance is Philip José Farmer's Winkie language, a relative of the Germanic languages spoken by the Winkies of Oz in \"A Barnstormer in Oz\". Another example is Anglish, which tries to reconstruct how English could have looked without Latin influence.\n\nMicronational languages are the languages created for use in micronations. Having the citizens learn the language is as much a part of participating in the micronation as minting coins and stamps or participating in government. The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets. They coin new words and grammatical constructions when needed. Talossan, from R. Ben Madison's Kingdom of Talossa, is by far the best-known example of a micronational language.\n\nPersonal languages are ultimately created for one's own edification. The creator does not expect anyone to speak it; the language exists as a work of art. A personal language may be invented for the purpose of having a beautiful language, for self-expression, as an exercise in understanding linguistic principles, or perhaps as an attempt to create a language with an extreme phonemic inventory or system of verbs. Personal languages tend to have short lifespans, and are often displayed on the Internet and discussed on message boards much like Internet-based fictional languages. They are often invented in large numbers by the people who design these languages. However, a few personal languages are used extensively and long-term by their creators (e.g., for writing diaries). Javant Biarujia, the creator of Taneraic, described his personal language (which he terms a hermetic language) thus: \"a private pact negotiated between the world at large and the world within me; public words simply could not guarantee me the private expression I sought.\" The author Robert Dessaix describes the origins of his personal language K: \"I wanted words that described reality. So I made them up.\"\n\nThe aim of some languages is to express deep meaning with very few parts. For instance, Toki Pona is based on just 123 words and 14 'sounds'. The creator, Sonja Lang, says that the principles are built on Taoism. Another language composed along the same lines is Papisa-samama which utilises just six consonants and two vowels, has just 12 syllables, making just a 120 word lexicon. It can be read in its own Chinese-like written form or in a pinyin-like, romanised form. Unlike Toki Pona, it has a complex number system based on Roman numerals. Both Toki Pona and Papisa-samama have a small root-word vocabulary and rely heavily on compound nouns, for instance, in Papisa-samama, \"enlightenment\" might be translated as \"patima-tasama-simi\", that is, \"deep-thought-light.\"\n\nThe term jokelang is sometimes applied to conlangs created as jokes. These may be languages intended primarily to sound funny, such as DiLingo, or for some type of satire, often as satire on some aspect of constructed languages.\n\nSome typical jokelangs are:\n\nAn experimental language is a constructed language designed for the purpose of exploring some theory of linguistics. Most such languages are concerned with the relation between language and thought; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In science fiction, much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. Artlangs of this type overlap with engineered languages.\n\nSee list of constructed languages for a list.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "407292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407292", "title": "Biophotonics", "text": "Biophotonics\n\nThe term biophotonics denotes a combination of biology and photonics, with photonics being the science and technology of generation, manipulation, and detection of photons, quantum units of light. Photonics is related to electronics and photons. Photons play a central role in information technologies such as fiber optics the way electrons do in electronics.\n\nBiophotonics can also be described as the \"development and application of optical techniques, particularly imaging, to the study of biological molecules, cells and tissue\". One of the main benefits of using optical techniques which make up biophotonics is that they preserve the integrity of the biological cells being examined.\n\nBiophotonics has therefore become the established general term for all techniques that deal with the interaction between biological items and photons. This refers to emission, detection, absorption, reflection, modification, and creation of radiation from biomolecular, cells, tissues, organisms and biomaterials. Areas of application are life science, medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.\nSimilar to the differentiation between \"electric\" and \"electronics\" a difference can be made between applications such as Therapy and surgery, which use light mainly to transfer energy, and applications such as diagnostics, which use light to excite matter and to transfer information back to the operator. In most cases the term biophotonics refers to the latter type of application.\n\nApplications\n\nBiophotonics is an interdisciplinary field involving the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological materials including: tissues, cells, sub-cellular structures, and molecules in living organisms.\n\nRecent biophotonics research has created new applications for clinical diagnostics and therapies involving fluids, cells and tissues. These advances are allowing scientists and physicians opportunities for superior, non-invasive diagnostics for vascular and blood flow, as well as tools for better examination of skin lesions. In addition to new diagnostic tools, the advancements in biophotonics research has provided new photothermal, photodynamic, and tissue therapies.\n\n\"Dermatology\" By observing the numerous and complex interactions between light and biological materials, the field of biophotonics presents a unique set of diagnostic techniques that medical practitioners can utilize. Biophotonic imaging provides the field of dermatology with the only non-invasive technique available for diagnosing skin cancers. Traditional diagnostic procedures for skin cancers involve visual assessment and biopsy, but a new Laser Induced Fluorescence spectroscopy technique allow dermatologists to compare spectrographs of a patient's skin with spectrographs known to correspond with malignant tissue. This provides doctors with earlier diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n“Among optical techniques, an emerging imaging technology based on laser scanning, the optical coherence tomography or OCT imaging is considered to be a useful tool to differentiate healthy from malignant skin tissue.” The information is immediately accessible and eliminates the need for skin excision. This also eliminates the need for the skin samples to be processed in a lab which reduces labor costs and processing time.\n\nFurthermore, these optical imaging technologies can be used during traditional surgical procedures to determine the boundaries of lesions to ensure that the entirety of the diseased tissue is removed. This is accomplished by exposing nanoparticles that have been dyed with a fluorescing substance to the acceptable light photons. Nanoparticles that are functionalized with fluorescent dyes and marker proteins will congregate in a chosen tissue type. When the particles are exposed to wavelengths of light that correspond to the fluorescent dye, the unhealthy tissue glows. This allows for the attending surgeon to quickly visually identify boundaries between healthy and unhealthy tissue, resulting in less time on the operating table and higher patient recovery. “Using dielectrophoretic microarray devices, nanoparticles and DNA biomarkers were rapidly isolated and concentrated onto specific microscopic locations where they were easily detected by epifluorescent microscopy”\n\n\"Optical Tweezers\"\n\nOptical tweezers (or traps) are scientific tools employed to maneuver microscopic particles such as atoms, DNA, bacteria, viruses, and other types of nanoparticles. It uses the lights momentum to exert small forces on a sample. This technique allows for the organizing and sorting of cells, the tracking of the movement of bacteria, and the changing of cell structure\n\n\"Laser Micro-scalpels\" are a combination of fluorescence microscopy and a femtosecond laser “can penetrate up to 250 micrometers into tissue and target single cells in 3-D space.” The technology, which was patented by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, means that surgeons can excise diseased or damaged cells without disturbing or damaging healthy surrounding cells in delicate surgeries involving areas such as the eyes and vocal chords.\n\n\"Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM)\" is an imaging technology that utilizes both laser technology and ultrasound technology. This dual imaging modality is far superior at imaging deep tissue and vascular tissues than previous imaging technologies. The improvement in resolution provides higher quality images of deep tissues and vascular systems, allowing non-invasive differentiation of cancerous tissues vs healthy tissue by observing such things as “water content, oxygen saturation level, and hemoglobin concentration.” Researchers have also been able to use PAM to diagnose endometriosis in rats.\n\n\"Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)\", although somewhat controversial as to it efficacy, can be used to treat wounds by repairing tissue and preventing tissue death. However, more recent studies indicate that LLLT is more useful for reducing inflammation and assuaging chronic joint pain. In addition, it is believed that LLLT could possibly prove to be useful in the treatment of severe brain injury or trauma, stroke, and degenerative neurological diseases.\n\n\"Photodyanamic Therapy (PT)\" uses photosynthesizing chemicals and oxygen to induce a cellular reaction to light. It can be used to kill cancer cells, treat acne, and reduce scarring. PT can also kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The technology provides treatment with little to no long-term side effects, is less invasive than surgery and can be repeated more often than radiation. Treatment is limited, however, to surfaces and organs that can be exposed to light, which eliminates deep tissue cancer treatments.\n\"Photothermal therapy\" most commonly uses nanoparticles made of a noble metal to convert light into heat. The nanoparticles are engineered to absorb light in the 700-1000 nm range, where the human body is optically transparent. When the particles are hit by light they heat up, disrupting or destroying the surrounding cells via hyperthermia. Because the light used does not interact with tissue directly, photothermal therapy has few long term side effects and it can be used to treat cancers deep within the body.\n\nFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, also known as Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET in both cases) is the term given to the process where two excited \"fluorophores\" pass energy one to the other non-radiatively (i.e., without exchanging a photon). By carefully selecting the excitation of these flurophores and detecting the emission, FRET has become one of the most widely used techniques in the field of Biophotonics, giving scientists the chance to investigate sub-cellular environments. See the full article on FRET\n\nBiofluorescence describes the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light and the sub sequential emission of photons at a lower energy level (S_1 excited state relaxes to S_0 ground state) by intrinsically fluorescent proteins or by synthetic fluorescent molecules covalently attached to a biomarker of interest. Biomarkers are molecules indicative or disease or distress and are a typically monitored systemically in a living organism, or by using an \"ex vivo\" tissue sample for microscopy, or \"in vitro\": in the blood, urine, sweat, saliva, interstitial fluid, aqueous humor, or sputum. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable.The time delay between excitation and re-emission that occurs when returning to the stable ground state causes the photon that is re-emitted to be a different color (i.e. it relaxes to a lower energy and thus the photon emitted is at a shorter wavelength, as governed by the Plank-Einstein relationformula_1) than the excitation light that was absorbed. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable whilst the exciation light is still providing photons to the fluorescent molecule and is typically excited by blue or green light and emits purple, yellow, orange, green, cyan, or red. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light: bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.\n\nBioluminescence differs from biofluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas biofluorescence and biophosphorescence are the absorption and reemission of light from the natural environment.\n\nBiophosphorescence is similar to biofluorescence in its requirement of light at specified wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with biofluorescence, here the electron retains stability in the forbidden triplet state (unpaired spins), with a longer delay in emitting light resulting in the effect that it continues to “glow-in-the-dark” even long after the stimulating light source has been removed.\nA biolaser is when laser light is generated by or from within a living cell. Imaging in biophotonics often relies on laser light, and integration with biological systems is seen as a promising route to enhancing sensing and imaging techniques. Biolasers, like any laser system, requires three components gain medium, optical feedback structure and pump source. For the gain medium, a variety of naturally produced fluorescent proteins can be used in different laser structure. Enclosing an optical feedback structure in a cell has been demonstrated using cell vacuoles, as well as using fully enclosed laser systems such as dye doped polymer microspheres, or semiconductor nanodisks lasers. \n\nThe predominantly used light sources are beam lights. LEDs and superluminescent diodes also play an important role. Typical wavelengths used in biophotonics are between 600 nm (Visible) and 3000 nm (near IR).\n\nLasers play an increasingly important role in biophotonics. Their unique intrinsic properties like precise wavelength selection, widest wavelength coverage, highest focusability and thus best spectral resolution, strong power densities and broad spectrum of excitation periods make them the most universal light tool for a wide spectrum of applications. As a consequence a variety of different laser technologies from a broad number of suppliers can be found in the market today.\n\nMajor gas lasers used for biophotonics applications, and their most important wavelengths, are:\n\n- Argon Ion laser: 457.8 nm, 476.5 nm, 488.0 nm, 496.5 nm, 501.7 nm, 514.5 nm (multi-line operation possible)\n\n- Krypton Ion laser: 350.7 nm, 356.4 nm, 476.2 nm, 482.5 nm, 520.6 nm, 530.9 nm, 568.2 nm, 647.1 nm, 676.4 nm, 752.5 nm, 799.3 nm\n\n- Helium–neon laser: 632.8 nm (543.5 nm, 594.1 nm, 611.9 nm)\n\n- HeCd lasers: 325 nm, 442 nm\n\nOther commercial gas lasers like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, xenon-ion, excimer or metal vapor lasers have no or only very minor importance in biophotonics.\nMajor advantage of gas lasers in biophotonics is their fixed wavelength, their perfect beam quality and their low linewidth/high coherence. Argon ion lasers can also operate in multi-line mode. Major disadvantage are high power consumption, generation of mechanical noise due to fan cooling and limited laser powers. Key suppliers are Coherent, CVI/Melles Griot, JDSU, Lasos, LTB and Newport/Spectra Physics.\n\nThe most commonly integrated laser diodes, which are used for diode lasers in biophotonics are based either on GaN or GaAs semiconductor material. GaN covers a wavelength spectrum from 375 to 488 nm (commercial products at 515 have been announced recently) whereas GaAs covers a wavelength spectrum starting from 635 nm.\n\nMost commonly used wavelengths from diode lasers in biophotonics are: 375, 405, 445, 473, 488, 515, 640, 643, 660, 675, 785 nm.\n\nLaser Diodes are available in 4 classes:\n\n- Single edge emitter/broad stripe/broad area\n\n- Surface emitter/VCSEL\n\n- Edge emitter/Ridge waveguide\n\n- Grating stabilized (FDB, DBR, ECDL)\n\nFor biophotonic applications, the most commonly used laser diodes are edge emitting/ridge waveguide diodes, which are single transverse mode and can be optimized to an almost perfect TEM00 beam quality. Due to the small size of the resonator, digital modulation can be very fast (up to 500 MHz). Coherence length is low (typically < 1 mm) and the typical linewidth is in the nm-range. Typical power levels are around 100 mW (depending on wavelength and supplier).\nKey suppliers are: Coherent, Melles Griot, Omicron, Toptica, JDSU, Newport, Oxxius, Power Technology.\nGrating stabilized diode lasers either have an lithographical incorporated grating (DFB, DBR) or an external grating (ECDL). As a result, the coherence length will raise into the range of several meters, whereas the linewidth will drop well below picometers (pm). Biophotonic applications, which make use of this characteristics are Raman spectroscopy (requires linewidth below cm-1) and spectroscopic gas sensing.\n\nSolid-state lasers are lasers based on solid-state gain media such as crystals or glasses doped with rare earth or transition metal ions, or semiconductor lasers. (Although semiconductor lasers are of course also solid-state devices, they are often not included in the term solid-state lasers.) Ion-doped solid-state lasers (also sometimes called doped insulator lasers) can be made in the form of bulk lasers, fiber lasers, or other types of waveguide lasers. Solid-state lasers may generate output powers between a few milliwatts and (in high-power versions) many kilowatts.\n\nMany advanced applications in biophotonics require individually selectable light at multiple wavelengths. As a consequence a series of new laser technologies has been introduced, which currently looks for precise wording.\n\nThe most commonly used terminology are supercontinuum lasers, which emit visible light over a wide spectrum simultaneously. This light is then filtered e.g. via acousto-optic modulators (AOM, AOTF) into 1 or up to 8 different wavelengths. Typical suppliers for this technology was NKT Photonics or Fianium. Recently NKT Photonics bought Fianium, remaining the major supplier of the supercontinuum technology on the market.\n\nIn another approach (Toptica/iChrome) the supercontinuum is generated in the infra-red and then converted at a single selectable wavelength into the visible regime. This approach does not require AOTF's and has a background-free spectral purity.\n\nSince both concepts have major importance for biophotonics the umbrella term \"ultrachrome lasers\" is often used.\n\nSwept sources are designed to continuously change ('sweep') emitted light frequency in time. They typically continuously circle through a pre-defined range of frequencies (e.g., 800 +/- 50 nm). Swept sources in the terahertz regime have been demonstrated. A typical application of swept sources in biophotonics is Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging.\n\nSingle photon sources are novel types of light sources distinct from coherent light sources (lasers) and thermal light sources (such as incandescent light bulbs and mercury-vapor lamps) that emit light as single particles or photons.\n"}

Most botches are harmless, such as a wrestler simply flubbing a line or missing a cue, or falling before his or her opponent's move actually connects. At times, however, a poorly timed or executed move has resulted in serious injury or even death.\n\nA common cause of botches is inexperience. Jackie Gayda, winner of the \"Tough Enough 2\" competition, in one of her first TV matches (a tag team match with Christopher Nowinski against Trish Stratus and Bradshaw on the July 8, 2002 edition of \"Raw\" from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), botched nearly every move that she tried or attempted to sell, the most infamous of which was a second-rope-bulldog by Stratus, which Gayda sold two seconds too late.\n\nOn April 26, 1976, Bruno Sammartino suffered a neck fracture in a match against the relatively inexperienced Stan Hansen at Madison Square Garden, when Hansen improperly executed a body slam. Bruno came back eight weeks later for a rematch.\n\nSometimes botches can be extremely dangerous and can end a wrestler's career or life. For example, WWE wrestler D'Lo Brown once botched a running sitout powerbomb on his opponent Droz, resulting in Droz being rendered quadriplegic (although he later regained some use of his upper body). This botch was mainly caused by D'Lo not being able to get a grip on the baggy clothing worn by Droz while holding him in the powerbomb position. Droz also did not cinch himself up at the waist as is the safety measure for powerbomb receivers. In other cases, the wrestler performing the move could be injured. Japanese wrestler Hayabusa botched a springboard moonsault in a match against Mammoth Sasaki when his foot slipped on the second rope and he landed on his head, causing damage to his spine and neck and paralyzing him, although he regained feeling in his legs before his death in 2016.\n\nIn May 2001, Brian Ong was training with Dalip Singh (better known as the Great Khali) and took a flapjack from Singh. The move was botched, reportedly because Ong had grabbed Singh's shirt instead of pushing off Singh's back as he was instructed. Although he had made the mistake several times before without incident, this time Ong landed tailbone first and his head was violently whipped back against the mat. The resulting impact caused catastrophic damage to his spine and brainstem. Coupled with a previous concussion, the move resulted in Ong's death a few days later.\n\nIn most cases, minor botches are simply glossed over and the match is continued. One example was the ending of the Hulk Hogan-Sid Justice match at WrestleMania VIII. The planned ending was to involve Papa Shango running into the ring to break up Hogan's pin attempt. However, Shango missed his cue, forcing Sid to kick out of the pin attempt and manager Harvey Whippleman to jump onto the ring apron to interfere and prompt the disqualification, just as Shango ran into the ring to assist Sid with the intended double-team beating of Hogan.\n\nSerious botches resulting in injuries often result in improvised endings to matches, or the remainder of a match will be canceled if a wrestler cannot continue or requires immediate medical attention. During the match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Owen Hart at Summerslam 1997, Hart botched a piledriver, breaking Austin's neck. Hart was forced to improvise an extended taunt sequence until Austin was able regain his composure and roll him up in a schoolboy pin, ending the match earlier than planned but with the desired winner. If a wrestler is seriously injured, the referee normally signals the need for immediate help by doing an \"X\" formation with his arms over his head. In recent years, as some wrestling fans have noticed this, the referee may sometimes perform the symbol in an attempt to indicate a kayfabe injury to another performer, which will lead to the match being called off.\n\nBotches can also involve scripted lines. During the airing of WrestleMania XXX, Hulk Hogan—serving as the host of WrestleMania—mistakenly referred to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome to the live audience as the Silverdome, the home of WrestleMania III and where Hogan had his infamous showdown with André the Giant. After Hogan corrected himself, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock would rib Hogan for calling the Superdome the Silverdome, and it ended up being a running gag for the rest of WrestleMania XXX and into the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\" the next night.\n\nBotches can sometimes have a positive impact on a career. One (in)famous example is when Mick Foley, under his ring name Mankind, wrestled The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring (1998). After Foley was tossed off of the top of the cell through the announcers' table, the match was going to be stopped. However, as he was being stretchered out of the arena, Foley got off the stretcher, climbed back on top of the cell, and continued the match. The Undertaker then delivered a chokeslam to Foley on the roof of the cell, which caused one of the roof panels to give way. Foley plummeted to the mat below, dislocating his shoulder. A chair fell with him and landed on his face, knocking a tooth out through his upper lip. Foley still finished the match and gained a legendary status among wrestling fans, and has since been dubbed \"The Hardcore Legend\". Some people even claim that he is the toughest man alive. \n\nIn ECW, Chris Benoit injured Sabu's neck with a suplex. Benoit was subsequently nicknamed The Crippler.\n\nSometimes botches can lead to the accidental invention of new moves. For example, the diving headbutt was invented when Harley Race botched a splash from the top rope, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts claims to have invented the DDT when he was accidentally tripped by his opponent while applying a front facelock, and Toshiaki Kawada inadvertently invented the Ganso bomb, one of the most dangerous moves in wrestling, after he failed to execute a powerbomb on Mitsuharu Misawa and instead dropped his head.\n\n"}

In the series of novels which begins with \"Dune\", the language is said to be based on another fictitious language, the \"Bhotani Jib\" (likely derived from Bhutan and referring to a dialect derived from there). Herbert presumably took the name from Chakobsa, the \"hunting language\" of the Caucasus (cf. Lesley Blanch, \"The Sabres of Paradise\" (1960), p. 21), an anglicized form of Adyghe \"щакIуэбзэ\" /šak'e-bze/ \"hunter's language\" (\"щакIуэ\" 'hunter,' \"бзэ\" 'language').\n\nExamples of the language from the books are actually a mixture of Roma (or Gypsy) language, from a Gypsy magic textbook Herbert used for reference, one sentence in Serbo-Croat and various Arabic terms, with definitions altered slightly to suggest the passage of time.\n\nThe non-canon \"Dune Encyclopedia\" (1984) by Willis E. McNelly includes extensive descriptions of the Fremen language. The \"Encyclopedia\" was approved by Herbert but rendered erroneous in some areas through Herbert's later works in the \"Dune\" series.\n\nThe 2003 Sci Fi Channel TV miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\" includes a song by Brian Tyler entitled \"Inama Nushif\", which is claimed to contain lyrics sung in Fremen. According to miniseries director Greg Yaitanes, Tyler claimed that he \"searched through Herbert's books and deciphered enough of the fictional Fremen language to write this powerful song.\" However, in reality the song is an alteration of a speech by Muad'dib published in \"The Dune Encyclopedia\", expanded with some repetitions, and a different 'translation' attached to it. The original text's first lines are \"Innama nishuf\".\n\nAn example of Chakobsa is seen in the ancient funeral ritual of the Fremen in which the water of a dead tribesman is magically blessed:\n\"\"Ekkeri-akairi, fillissin-follas. Kivi a-kavi, nakalas! Nakalas! Ukair-an ... jan, jan, jan ...\" .\n\nThe game Fury of the Furries can be played in Chakobsa.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15890", "title": "Jack Kerouac", "text": "Jack Kerouac\n\nJack Kerouac (; born Jean-Louis Kérouac (though he called himself Jean-Louis Lebris de Kérouac); March 12, 1922 – October 21, 1969) was an American novelist and poet of French-Canadian descent.\n\nHe is considered a literary iconoclast and, alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation. Kerouac is recognized for his method of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as Catholic spirituality, jazz, promiscuity, Buddhism, drugs, poverty, and travel. He became an underground celebrity and, with other beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.\n\nIn 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking. Since his death, Kerouac's literary prestige has grown, and several previously unseen works have been published. All of his books are in print today, including \"The Town and the City\", \"On the Road\", \"Doctor Sax\", \"The Dharma Bums\", \"Mexico City Blues\", \"The Subterraneans\", \"Desolation Angels\", \"Visions of Cody\", \"The Sea Is My Brother\", and \"Big Sur\".\n\nJack Kerouac was born on March 12, 1922 in Lowell, Massachusetts to French Canadian parents, Léo-Alcide Kéroack (1899–1946) and Gabrielle-Ange Lévesque (1895–1973).\n\nThere is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of Kerouac, and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac. His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac. Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as Jean Louis Kirouac, the most common spelling of the name in Quebec. Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in Brittany, and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de Kervoac, whose sons married French Canadians.\n\nKerouac's father Leo had been born into a family of potato farmers in the village of Saint-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec. Jack also had various stories on the etymology of his surname, usually tracing it to Irish, Breton, Cornish or other Celtic roots.\n\nIn one interview he claimed it was from the name of the Cornish language (\"Kernewek\") and that the Kerouacs had fled from Cornwall to Brittany. Another version was that the Kerouacs had come to Cornwall from Ireland before the time of Christ and the name meant \"language of the house\". In still another interview he said it was an Irish word for \"language of the water\" and related to \"Kerwick\". Kerouac, derived from \"Kervoach\", is the name of a town in Brittany in Lanmeur, near Morlaix.\n\nJack Kerouac later referred to 34 Beaulieu Street as \"sad Beaulieu\". The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of rheumatic fever, aged nine. This deeply affected four-year-old Jack, who would later say that Gerard followed him in life as a guardian angel. This is the Gerard of Kerouac's novel \"Visions of Gerard\". He had one other sibling, an older sister named Caroline. Kerouac was referred to as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.\n\nKerouac spoke French until he learned English at age six; he did not speak English confidently until his late teens. He was a serious child who was devoted to his mother, who played an important role in his life. She was a devout Catholic, who instilled this deep faith into both her sons. Kerouac would later say that his mother was the only woman he ever loved. After Gerard died, his mother sought solace in her faith, while his father abandoned it, wallowing in drinking, gambling, and smoking.\n\nSome of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend Allen Ginsberg towards the end of his life, he expressed a desire to speak his parents' native tongue again. In 2016, a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in French by Kerouac was published as \"La vie est d'hommage\", edited by Professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier.\n\nOn May 17, 1928, while six years old, Kerouac had his first Confession. For penance he was told to say a rosary, during which he heard God tell him that he had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and die in pain and horror, but would in the end receive salvation. This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the Virgin Mary (as the nuns fawned over him, convinced he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.\n\nKerouac once told Ted Berrigan, in an interview for \"The Paris Review\", of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of New York. He recalled \"a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm ... teedah- teedah – teedah ... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so my father went POOM! and knocked a rabbi right in the gutter.\" Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.\n\nKerouac's athletic skills as a running back in football for Lowell High School earned him scholarship offers from Boston College, Notre Dame, and Columbia University. He entered Columbia University after spending a year at Horace Mann School, where he earned the requisite grades for entry to Columbia. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach Lou Little, who kept him benched. While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the \"Columbia Daily Spectator\", and joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He also studied at The New School.\n\nWhen his football career at Columbia ended, Kerouac dropped out of the university. He continued to live for a time in New York's Upper West Side with his girlfriend and future first wife, Edie Parker. It was during this time that he met the Beat Generation people—now famous—with whom he would always be associated, and who as characters formed the basis of many of his novels, including: Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, John Clellon Holmes, Herbert Huncke, Lucien Carr and William S. Burroughs.\n\nKerouac joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1942 and in 1943 joined the United States Navy, but served only eight days of active duty before arriving on the sick list. According to his medical report, Kerouac said he \"asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me dementia praecox and sent me here.\" The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: \"I just can't stand it; I like to be by myself.\" Two days later he was honorably discharged on psychiatric grounds (he was of \"indifferent character\" with a diagnosis of \"schizoid personality\").\n\nWhile serving in the United States Merchant Marine, Kerouac wrote his first novel, \"The Sea Is My Brother\". Although written in 1942, the book was not published until 2011, some 42 years after Kerouac's death and 70 years after it was written. Kerouac described the work as being about \"man's simple revolt from society as it is, with the inequalities, frustration, and self-inflicted agonies.\" He viewed the work as a failure, calling it a \"crock as literature\", and he never actively sought to publish it.\n\nIn 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a material witness in the murder of David Kammerer, who had been stalking Kerouac's friend Lucien Carr since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis. William Burroughs was also a native of St. Louis, and it was through Carr that Kerouac came to know both Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. According to Carr, Kammerer's homosexual obsession turned aggressive, finally provoking Carr to stab him to death in self-defense. Carr dumped the body in the Hudson River. Afterwards, Carr sought help from Kerouac. Kerouac disposed of the murder weapon and buried Kammerer's eyeglasses. Carr, encouraged by Burroughs, turned himself in to the police. Kerouac and Burroughs were later arrested as material witnesses. Kerouac's father refused to pay his bail. Kerouac then agreed to marry Edie Parker if her parents would pay the bail. (Their marriage was annulled in 1948.) Kerouac and Burroughs collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer killing entitled \"And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks\". Though the book was not published during their lifetimes, an excerpt eventually appeared in \"Word Virus: A William S. Burroughs Reader\" (and as noted below, the novel was finally published late 2008). Kerouac also later wrote about the killing in his novel \"Vanity of Duluoz\".\n\nLater, Kerouac lived with his parents in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, after they had also moved to New York. He wrote his first published novel, \"The Town and the City\", and began the famous \"On the Road\" around 1949 while living there. His friends jokingly called him \"The Wizard of Ozone Park\", alluding to Thomas Edison's nickname, \"the Wizard of Menlo Park\", and to the film \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\n\"The Town and the City\" was published in 1950 under the name \"John Kerouac\" and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly. Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of Thomas Wolfe, it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger life of the city. The book was heavily edited by Robert Giroux, with around 400 pages taken out.\nFor the next six years, Kerouac continued to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled \"The Beat Generation\" and \"Gone on the Road,\" Kerouac completed what is now known as \"On the Road\" in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty. The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with Neal Cassady in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends. He completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup and mugs of coffee to keep him going. Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published. Though \"spontaneous,\" Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write. In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.\n\nThough the work was completed quickly, Kerouac had a long and difficult time finding a publisher. Before \"On the Road\" was accepted by Viking Press, Kerouac got a job as a \"railroad brakeman and fire lookout\" (see Desolation Peak (Washington)) traveling between the East and West coasts of the United States to earn money, frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother. While employed in this way he met and befriended Abe Green, a young freight train jumper who later introduced Kerouac to Herbert Huncke, a Times Square street hustler and favorite of many Beat Generation writers. During this period of travel, Kerouac wrote what he considered to be \"his life's work\": \"Vanity of Duluoz\". Between 1955-1956, he lived on and off with his sister, whom he called \"Nin,\" and her husband, Paul Blake, at their home outside of Rocky Mount, N.C. (\"Testament, Va.\" in his works) where he meditated on, and studied, Buddhism. He wrote \"Some of the Dharma\", an imaginative treatise on Buddhism, while living there.\n\nPublishers rejected \"On the Road\" because of its experimental writing style and its sexual content. Many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were, for the era, graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior—a move that could result in obscenity charges being filed, a fate that later befell Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\" and Ginsberg's \"Howl\".\n\nAccording to Kerouac, \"On the Road\" \"was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God sweating out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about.\" According to his biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, \"On the Road\" has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but the most important thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.\n\nIn the spring of 1951, while pregnant, Joan Haverty left and divorced Kerouac. In February 1952, she gave birth to Kerouac's only child, Jan Kerouac, though he refused to acknowledge her as his daughter until a blood test confirmed it 9 years later. For the next several years Kerouac continued writing and traveling, taking long trips through the U.S. and Mexico. He often experienced episodes of heavy drinking and depression. During this period, he finished drafts of what would become ten more novels, including \"The Subterraneans\", \"Doctor Sax\", \"Tristessa\", and \"Desolation Angels\", which chronicle many of the events of these years.\n\nIn 1953, he lived mostly in New York City, having a brief but passionate affair with an African-American woman. This woman was the basis for the character named \"Mardou\" in the novel \"The Subterraneans\". At the request of his editors, Kerouac changed the setting of the novel from New York to San Francisco.\nIn 1954, Kerouac discovered Dwight Goddard's \"A Buddhist Bible\" at the San Jose Library, which marked the beginning of his study of Buddhism. However, Kerouac had earlier taken an interest in Eastern thought. In 1946 he read Heinrich Zimmer's \"Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization\". In 1955, Kerouac wrote a biography of Siddhartha Gautama, titled \"Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha\", which was unpublished during his lifetime, but eventually serialized in \"\", 1993–95. It was published by Viking in September 2008.\n\nKerouac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum, the right disdaining his association with drugs and sexual libertinism and the left contemptuous of his anti-communism and Catholicism; characteristically, he watched the 1954 Senate McCarthy hearings smoking marijuana and rooting for the anti-communist crusader, Senator Joseph McCarthy. In \"Desolation Angels\" he wrote, \"when I went to Columbia all they tried to teach us was Marx, as if I cared\" (considering Marxism, like Freudianism, to be an illusory tangent).\n\nIn 1957, after being rejected by several other publishers, \"On the Road\" was finally purchased by Viking Press, which demanded major revisions prior to publication. Many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and, fearing libel suits, pseudonyms were used for the book's \"characters.\" These revisions have often led to criticisms of the alleged spontaneity of Kerouac's style.\n\nIn July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house at 1418½ Clouser Avenue in the College Park section of Orlando, Florida, to await the release of \"On the Road\". Weeks later, a review of the book by Gilbert Millstein appeared in \"The New York Times\" proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation. Kerouac was hailed as a major American writer. His friendship with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso, among others, became a notorious representation of the Beat Generation. The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac during a conversation held with fellow novelist Herbert Huncke. Huncke used the term \"beat\" to describe a person with little money and few prospects. \"I'm beat to my socks\", he had said. Kerouac's fame came as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing.\n\nKerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II Beat Generation and Kerouac came to be called \"the king of the beat generation,\" a term with which he never felt comfortable. He once observed, \"I'm not a beatnik. I'm a Catholic\", showing the reporter a painting of Pope Paul VI and saying, \"You know who painted that? Me.\"\n\nThe success of \"On the Road\" brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought publishers desiring unwanted manuscripts that were previously rejected before its publication. After nine months, he no longer felt safe in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the San Remo Cafe at 189 Bleecker Street in New York City one night. Neal Cassady, possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.\n\nIn response, Kerouac chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with Gary Snyder and other San Francisco-area poets, in \"The Dharma Bums\", set in California and Washington and published in 1958. It was written in Orlando between November 26 and December 7, 1957. To begin writing \"Dharma Bums\", Kerouac typed onto a ten-foot length of teleprinter paper, to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes, as he had done six years previously for \"On the Road\".\n\nKerouac was demoralized by criticism of \"Dharma Bums\" from such respected figures in the American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D. T. Suzuki, that \"even Suzuki was looking at me through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter.\" He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen, \"I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. I'm not a Buddhist any more.\" In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's café recitation, \"Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul\": \"A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light.\" Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.\n\nKerouac also wrote and narrated a beat movie titled \"Pull My Daisy\" (1959), directed by Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie. It starred poets Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso, musician David Amram and painter Larry Rivers among others. Originally to be called \"The Beat Generation\", the title was changed at the last moment when MGM released a film by the same name in July 1959 that sensationalized beatnik culture.\n\nThe CBS Television series \"Route 66\" (1960–1964), featuring two untethered young men \"on the road\" in a Corvette seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary jobs in the various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, gave the impression of being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for \"On the Road\". Even the leads, Buz and Todd, bore a resemblance to the dark, athletic Kerouac and the blonde Cassady/Moriarty, respectively. Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by \"Route 66\" creator Stirling Silliphant and sought to sue him, CBS, the Screen Gems TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action.\n\nJohn Antonelli's 1985 documentary \"Kerouac, the Movie\" begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from \"On the Road\" and \"Visions of Cody\" on \"The Steve Allen Plymouth Show\" in November 1959. Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. \"Are you nervous?\" asks Steve Allen. \"Naw,\" says Kerouac, sweating and fidgeting.\n\nIn 1965, he met the poet Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends. Gwernig used to translate his Breton language poems in English in order to make Kerouac read and understand them : \"Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really like to read them ! ... ' So I wrote an Diri Dir – Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English.\"\n\nIn the following years, Kerouac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1966. In 1968, Neal Cassady also died while in Mexico.\n\nAlso in 1968, he appeared on the television show \"Firing Line\" produced and hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. (a friend of Kerouac's from his college years). Kerouac talked about the counterculture of the 1960s in what would be his last appearance on television.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, on the morning of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his favorite chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, working on a book about his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts. He suddenly felt nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an abdominal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse. A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier. He is buried at Edson Cemetery, Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was living with his third wife, Stella Sampas Kerouac, and his mother Gabrielle. Kerouac's mother inherited most of his estate.\n\nHe was honored posthumously with a Doctor of Letters degree from his hometown University of Massachusetts Lowell on June 2, 2007.\n\nKerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although he actively disliked such labels. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of\nJazz, especially the Bebop genre established by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and others. Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his Buddhist studies that began with Gary Snyder. He often referred to his style as \"spontaneous prose.\" Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or \"roman à clef\") based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted.\nMany of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including \"On the Road\", \"Visions of Cody\", \"Visions of Gerard\", \"Big Sur\", and \"The Subterraneans\". The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of breath was the elimination of the period, substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble improvisational jazz licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.\n\nKerouac greatly admired and was influenced by Gary Snyder. \"The Dharma Bums\" contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder. While living with Snyder outside Mill Valley, California in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling \"Visions of Gary\". (This eventually became \"Dharma Bums\", which Kerouac described as \"mostly about [Snyder].\") That summer, Kerouac took a job as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascades in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters. On Desolation Peak he'd hoped to \"come face to face with God or Tathagata and find out once and for all what is the meaning of all this existence. But instead I'd come face to face with myself ... and many's the time I thought I'd die of boredom or jump off the mountain.\" Kerouac described the experience in \"Desolation Angels\" and later in \"The Dharma Bums\".\n\nKerouac would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method. Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\". It was at about the time of \"The Subterraneans\" that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style. Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was \"Belief and Technique for Modern Prose\", a list of 30 \"essentials\".\n\nSome believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. Truman Capote famously said about Kerouac's work, \"That's not writing, it's typing\". According to Carolyn Cassady and others, he constantly rewrote and revised his work.\n\nAlthough the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has shown that, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. All these works, including \"La nuit est ma femme\", \"Sur le chemin\", and large sections of \"Maggie Cassidy\" (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled \"La vie est d'hommage\" (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the \"Nouvelle Revue Française\" published excerpts and an article on \"La nuit est ma femme\", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography \"Kerouac: His Life and Work', \" discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French. Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become \"Old Bull in the Bowery\" (now published in \"The Unknown Kerouac\" from the Library of America). \"The Unknown Kerouac,\" edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of \"La nuit est ma femme\" and the completed translation of \"Sur le Chemin\" under the title \"Old Bull in the Bowery\". \"La nuit est ma femme\" was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of \"On the Road\", as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Yannis Livadas have pointed out.\n\nKerouac's early writing, particularly his first novel \"The Town and the City\", was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of Thomas Wolfe. The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by Jazz, especially Bebop, and later, Buddhism, as well as the famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady. The Diamond Sutra was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and \"probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read\". In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six Pāramitās, and the seventh to the concluding passage on Samādhi. This was his sole reading on Desolation Peak, and he hoped by this means to condition his mind to emptiness, and possibly to have a vision.\n\nAn often overlooked literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes to more than any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding \"On the Road\", he wrote in a letter to Ginsberg, \"I can tell you now as I look back on the flood of language. It is like \"Ulysses\" and should be treated with the same gravity.\" Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel \"Visions of Cody\", which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.\n\nJack Kerouac and his literary works had a major impact on the popular rock music of the 1960s. Artists including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, the Grateful Dead, and The Doors all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles. This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel \"On the Road\" as one of the band's greatest influences. In his book \"Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors\", Ray Manzarek (keyboard player of The Doors) wrote \"I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written \"On the Road\", The Doors would never have existed.\" The alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs wrote a song bearing his name, \"Hey Jack Kerouac\" on their 1987 album \"In My Tribe\".\n\nIn 1974, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at Naropa University, a private Buddhist university in Boulder, Colorado. The school offers a BA in Writing and Literature, MFAs in Writing & Poetics and Creative Writing, and a summer writing program.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1992, Joy Walsh published 28 issues of a magazine devoted to Kerouac, \"Moody Street Irregulars\".\n\nKerouac's French-Canadian origins inspired a 1987 National Film Board of Canada docudrama \"Jack Kerouac's Road: A Franco-American Odyssey\", directed by Acadian poet Herménégilde Chiasson.\n\nA street, \"rue de Jack Kérouac\", is named after him in Quebec City, as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, Lanmeur, Brittany. An annual Kerouac festival was established in Lanmeur in 2010. In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco named a one-way street, Jack Kerouac Alley, in his honor in Chinatown.\n\nIn 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where \"The Dharma Bums\" was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc. This group provides opportunities for aspiring writers to live in the same house in which Kerouac was inspired, with room and board covered for three months. In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist Oscar J. Corral that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia. The article, citing legal documents, showed that Kerouac's estate, worth only $91 at the time of his death, was worth $10 million in 1998.\n\nIn 2007, Kerouac was awarded a posthumous honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nIn 2009, the movie \"One Fast Move or I'm Gone – Kerouac's Big Sur\" was released. It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel \"Big Sur\", with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book. The movie also describes the people and places on which Kerouac based his characters and settings, including the cabin in Bixby Canyon. An album released to accompany the movie, \"One Fast Move or I'm Gone\", features Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jay Farrar (Son Volt) performing songs based on Kerouac's \"Big Sur\".\n\nIn 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival \"Lowell Celebrates Kerouac\" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of Lowell, Massachusetts. It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.\n\nIn the 2010s, there has been a surge in films based on the Beat Generation. Kerouac has been depicted in the films \"Howl\" and \"Kill Your Darlings\". A feature film version of \"On the Road\" was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by Walter Salles and produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Independent filmmaker Michael Polish directed \"Big Sur\", based on the novel, with Jean-Marc Barr cast as Kerouac. The film was released in 2013.\n\nA species of Indian platygastrid wasp that is phoretic (hitch-hiking) on grasshoppers is named after him as \"Mantibaria kerouaci\".\n\nWhile he is best known for his novels, Kerouac is also noted for his poetry. Kerouac said that he wanted \"to be considered as a jazz poet blowing a long blues in an afternoon jazz session on Sunday.\". Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism. \"Mexico City Blues,\" a collection of poems published in 1959, is made up of 242 choruses following the rhythms of jazz. In much of his poetry, to achieve a jazz-like rhythm, Kerouac made use of the long dash in place of a period. Several examples of this can be seen in \"Mexico City Blues\":\n\nOther well-known poems by Kerouac, such as \"Bowery Blues,\" incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of Saṃsāra, the cycle of life and death, and Samadhi, the concentration of composing the mind. Also, following the jazz / blues tradition, Kerouac's poetry features repetition and themes of the troubles and sense of loss experienced in life.\n\nIn 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of \"On the Road\"'s publishing, Viking issued two new editions: \"On the Road: The Original Scroll,\" and \"On the Road: 50th Anniversary Edition\". By far the more significant is \"Scroll,\" a transcription of the original draft typed as one long paragraph on sheets of tracing paper which Kerouac taped together to form a scroll. The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay paid $2.43 million for the original scroll and allowed an exhibition tour that concluded at the end of 2009. The other new issue, \"50th Anniversary Edition,\" is a reissue of the 40th anniversary issue under an updated title.\n\nThe Kerouac/Burroughs manuscript, \"And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks\" was published for the first time on November 1, 2008 by Grove Press. Previously, a fragment of the manuscript had been published in the Burroughs compendium, \"Word Virus\".\n\nLes Éditions du Boréal, a Montreal-based publishing house, obtained rights from Kerouac's estate to publish a collection of works titled \"La vie est d'hommage\" (it was released in April 2016). It includes 16 previously unpublished works, in French, including a novella, \"Sur le chemin\", \"La nuit est ma femme,\" and large sections of \"Maggie Cassidy\" originally written in French. Both \"Sur le chemin\" and \"La nuit est ma femme\" have also been translated to English by Jean-Christophe Cloutier, in collaboration with Kerouac, and were published in 2016 by the Library of America in \"The Unknown Kerouac\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Linguist Jim Kakumasu observed in 1968 that the number of deaf people in the community was 7 out of a population of about 500. This relatively high ratio of deafness (1 in 75) led to both hearing and deaf members of the community using the language, and most hearing children grow up bilingual in the spoken and signed languages. The current state of the language is unknown. Other Indigenous tribes in the region have also been reported to use sign languages, and to communicate between themselves using sign language pidgins.\n\nNotable features of Ka'apor Sign Language are its object–subject–verb word order, and its locating of the past in front of the signer and the future behind, in contrast to sign languages of European origin, including American Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. This may represent a world view of the past as something visible, and the future as unknowable.\n\nKakumasu noted several features which sign language linguists today recognise as common to other sign languages, such as the use of name signs. Conditional and imperative grammatical moods are marked by non-manual features such as a widening of the eyes and tensing of facial muscles. Questions are marked with a question sign either before or after the clause, described as \"a motion of the index finger towards the referent (addressee) with a slight wrist twist.\"\n\n\n"}

Han unification has been met with some criticism.\n\nOn a Korean computer keyboard, text is typically entered by simply pressing a key for the appropriate jamo; the operating system creates each composite character on the fly. Depending on the IME and keyboard layout, double consonants can be entered by holding the shift button. When all jamo making up a syllabic block have been entered, the user may initiate a conversion to hanja or other special characters using a keyboard shortcut or interface button; South Korean keyboards have a separate key for this. Subsequent semi-automated hanja conversion is supported to varying degrees in word processors.\n\nWhen using a keyboard from another language, most operating systems require the user to type using an original Korean keyboard layout, the most common of which is \"2(du)-beolsik\". This is in contrast to some other languages, like Japanese, where text can be entered using a Romanization system on non-native keyboards.\n\nApart from the conversion issues mentioned above, some Korean fonts do not include hanja to start with. At the same time, current word processors do not allow the user to specify which font to use as a fallback for any hanja that may occur in a text. In that case, each sequence of hanja must be manually formatted to appear in the desired font.\n\nHaving text run in vertical lines is supported poorly or not at all by HTML and most word processors, although this is not an issue for modern Korean, as it is usually written horizontally. Until the second half of the 20th century, however, Korean was often written vertically. 15th century texts written in hangul had pitch marks to the left of syllables, which are included in Unicode, although most current fonts do not adequately support them, either.\n\nSee the section on character encodings above for obsolete jamo.\n\nNotable programs specifically designed for Korean language-related use include:\n\nHangul letters are detailed in several separate parts of the Unicode specification:\n\nThe precomposed hangul syllables in the Hangul Syllables block in Unicode are algorithmically defined, using the following formula:\n\nFor example, if one wants to find the code point of \"한\" in Unicode:\n\n\nSubstituting these values to the formula above, one gets [(18 × 588) + (0 × 28) + 4] + 44032 = 54620. This means that the Unicode value of 한 is 54620 in decimal, codice_1 by the numeric character reference, and U+D55C in hexadecimal Unicode notation.\n\nHangul Compatibility Jamo block is part of Unicode which has been allocated for compatibility with the KS X 1001 character set. It is usually used for representing some hangul jamo by itself, without distinguishing \"initial\" and \"final\".\n\nHangul Jamo, Hangul Jamo Extended-A and Hangul Jamo Extended-B blocks contain \"initial jamo\", \"medial jamo\" and \"final jamo\", including obsolete jamo.\n\nHangul (word processor) ships with fonts from Hanyang Information and Communication. Their fonts map obsolete hangul characters to the Private Use Area of Unicode. Despite the use of the Private Use Area instead of dedicated codepoints, Hanyang’s mapping is currently the most popular way to represent obsolete hangul in South Korea.\n\nStarting from Hangul 2010, Hancom deprecated Hanyang PUA code and chose to represent obsolete hangul characters using hangul jamo in Unicode.\n\n\n"}

There are also some major distinctions. For example, Kyirong has a three-tone system whereas Yolmo and Kagate have a two-tone system. The Gyalsumdo language variety spoken in the Manage district of Nepal shows strong similarities to Kyirong, as well as Nubri, and would therefore likely be classed in the \"Kyirong–Kagate\" group.\n\nThe language family is best considered to really be Kyirong–Yolmo. This is for a number of reasons; firstly, there are only around 1000 people who identify as Kagate, and many of these also consider themselves to be Yolmo. Secondly, Kagate is only regularly used to identify the community in Ramechhap, while Yolmo can be found in Melamchi, Helambu, Ilam, Lamjung and other places. Thirdly, the name Kagate is considered negative by many speakers, as it refers to the low-caste occupation of papermaking.\n\nThese varieties are all clearly historically related, but some are more similar than others. Kagate and Yolmo share many common features, and can be considered mutually intelligible dialects. Nubri and Gyalsumdo also appear to be closely related, based on initial research.

Thomas Mann, Gustav Stresemann, Rudolf Breitscheid and Aristide Briand were among her co-authors on the paper. Louise Weiss described those who paved the way for the closening of the German-French relationship between the World Wars as \"peace pilgrims\", and they called their important co-worker \"my good Louise\". Europe dreamed of unification and in 1930, she founded the \"Ecole de la Paix\" (School of Peace), a private institute for international relations. With the takeover by the National Socialists in Germany, the possibility of a unification was over.\n\nIn 1979, Louise Weiss stood as a candidate of the Gaullist Party in the first European election in 1979. On 17 July 1979 she was elected as a French Member of the European Parliament (MEP), sitting with the European People's Party. At the time of the first election, aged 86, she was the oldest member in Parliament and thus the EP's first 'oldest member'. She remained MEP and oldest member until her death on 26 May 1983, aged 90.\n\nThe main parliament building in Strasbourg bears her name.\n\nIn 1934, she founded the association, \"La femme nouvelle\" (The New Woman) with Cécile Brunsvicg, and she strove for a stronger role of women in public life. She participated in campaigns for the right of women to vote in France, organised suffragette commands, demonstrated and had herself chained to a street light in Paris with other women. In 1935, she unsuccessfully sued against the \"inability of women to vote\" before the French Conseil d'État.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, the Louise Weiss Foundation awards a prize to the author or the institution which has contributed the most to the advancement of the science of peace, the improvement of human relations and efforts of benefit to Europe.\n\nFlorence Hervé: \"Frauengeschichten - Frauengesichter\", Vol. 4, trafo verlag 2003, 150 pp., illustrated, \n\n"}

{"id": "4138268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4138268", "title": "Modern Greek grammar", "text": "Modern Greek grammar\n\nThe grammar of Modern Greek, as spoken in present-day Greece and Cyprus, is essentially that of Demotic Greek, but it has also assimilated certain elements of Katharevousa, the archaic, learned variety of Greek imitating Classical Greek forms, which used to be the official language of Greece through much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Modern Greek grammar has preserved many features of Ancient Greek, but has also undergone changes in a similar direction as many other modern Indo-European languages, from more synthetic to more analytic structures.\n\nThe predominant word order in Greek is SVO (subject–verb–object), but word order is quite freely variable, with VSO and other orders as frequent alternatives. Within the noun phrase, adjectives precede the noun (for example, , , 'the big house'), while possessors follow it (for example, , , 'my house'; 'Nick's house'). Alternative constructions involving the opposite order of constituents are possible as a marked option (e.g. 'the big house'; 'Nick's house')\n\nGreek is a pro-drop language, i.e. subjects are typically not overtly expressed whenever they are inferable from context. Whereas the word order of the major elements within the clause is fairly free, certain grammatical elements attach to the verb as clitics and form a rigidly ordered group together with it. This applies particularly to unstressed object pronouns, negation particles, the tense particle , and the subjunctive particle . Likewise, possessive pronouns are enclitic to the nouns they modify.\n\nGreek is a largely synthetic (inflectional) language. Although the complexity of the inflectional system has been somewhat reduced in comparison to Ancient Greek, there is also a considerable degree of continuity in the morphological system, and Greek still has a somewhat archaic character compared with other Indo-European languages of Europe. Nouns, adjectives and verbs are each divided into several inflectional classes (declension classes and conjugation classes), which have different sets of endings. In the nominals, the ancient inflectional system is well preserved, with the exception of the loss of one case, the dative, and the restructuring of several of the inflectional classes. In the verbal system, the loss of synthetic inflectional categories is somewhat greater, and several new analytic (periphrastic) constructions have evolved instead.\n\nModern Greek shares several syntactic characteristics with its geographical neighbours, with which it forms the so-called Balkan language area (\"Sprachbund\"). Among these characteristics are:\nOn the other hand, one prominent feature of the Balkan language area that Greek does not share is the use of a postposed definite article. The Greek article (like the Ancient Greek one) stands before the noun.\n\nModern Greek has a stress accent, similar to English. The accent is notated with a stroke (΄) over the accented vowel and is called (\"oxeia\", \"acute\") or (\"tonos\", \"accent\") in Greek. The former term is taken from one of the accents used in polytonic orthography which officially became obsolete in 1982.\n\nMost monosyllabic words take no accent such as in (, \"the\") and (, \"who\"). Exceptions include the conjunction (, \"or\"), the interrogative adverbs (, \"how\") and (, \"where\") in both direct and indirect questions and some fixed expressions such as (, \"occasionally\") and (, \"cravingly\"). Moreover, weak personal pronouns are accented in cases where they may be mistaken for enclitics (see below). For example, (, \"the dog barked at me\") instead of (, \"my dog barked\").\n\nEnclitics are pronounced very closely to the previous word. Most enclitics are weak personal pronouns. Enclitics do not modify the accent of the previous word when this word is accented on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, for example (, \"our driver\") and (, \"your book\"). However, when the previous word is accented on the antepenultimate syllable, the enclitic causes the ultimate syllable to be accented too. For example, (, \"teacher\") but (, \"my teacher\") and (, \"wear \") but (, \"wear it\"). Finally, enclitics are accented only when they precede another enclitic and these two determine an imperative accented on the penultimate syllable. For example, (, \"bring it to me\").\n\nIn digraphs which are pronounced as simple phonemes such as , and and in the case of ( or ) and ( or ), the accent is written on the second letter as in , , etc. When the accent is written on the first letter, the sequence is pronounced as an accented diphthong, for example as in (, \"donkey\"). When the second letter takes a diaeresis, the sequence is often pronounced as a diphthong, for example as in (, \"ribs\"). Finally, when the accent is placed on the second letter together with diaeresis, the vowels are pronounced separately and the second vowel is accented, for example as in (, \"paper airplane\").\n\nAs in Ancient Greek, in Modern Greek the accent cannot be placed before the antepenultimate syllable (Greek: , law of limitation, historically called \"Dreimorengesetz\"). As a result, in many imparisyllabic nouns, i.e. nouns that do not have the same number of syllables in all their inflections, an antepenultimate accent moves to the next syllable when a syllable is added. For example, (, \"lesson\") but and etc. In some words, the accent moves forward even without the addition of a syllable. For example, (, \"human\") but , and . This is due to historical reasons: long vowels and diphthongs occupied two morae which had the same effect as the addition of a syllable.\n\nGreek verb morphology is structured around a basic 2-by-2 contrast of two aspects, namely imperfective and perfective, and two tenses, namely past and non-past (or present). The aspects are expressed by two separate verb stems, while the tenses are marked mainly by different sets of endings. Of the four possible combinations, only three can be used in indicative function: the present (i.e. imperfective non-past), the imperfect (i.e. imperfective past) and the aorist (i.e. perfective past). All four combinations can be used in subjunctive function, where they are typically preceded by the particle or by one of a set of subordinating conjunctions. There are also two imperatives, one for each aspect.\n\nIn addition to these basic forms, Greek also has several periphrastic verb constructions. All the basic forms can be combined with the future particle (historically a contraction of , 'want to'). Combined with the non-past forms, this creates an imperfective and a perfective future. Combined with the imperfective past it is used as a conditional, and with the perfective past as an inferential. There is also a perfect, which is expressed with an inflected form of the auxiliary verb ('have'). It occurs both as a past perfect (pluperfect) and as a present perfect.\n\nModern Greek verbs additionally have three non-finite forms. There is a form traditionally called \"απαρέμφατο\" (i.e. 'infinitive', literally the 'invariant form'), which is historically derived from the perfective (aorist) infinitive, but has today lost all syntactical functions typically associated with that category. It is used only to form the periphrastic perfect and pluperfect, and is always formally identical to the 3rd person singular of the perfective non-past. There is also a passive participle, typically ending in \"-menos (-meni, -meno)\", which is inflected as a regular adjective. Its use is either as a canonical adjective, or as a part of a second, alternative perfect periphrasis with transitive verbs. Finally, there is another invariant form, formed from the present tense and typically ending in \"-ontas\", which is variably called either a participle or a gerund by modern authors. It is historically derived from an old present participle, and its sole use today is to form non-finite adjunct adverbial clauses of time or manner, roughly corresponding to an \"-ing\" participle in English.\n\n\nThe tables below exemplify the range of forms with those of one large inflectional class of verbs, the 1st Conjugation.\n\nBelow are the corresponding forms of two subtypes of another class, the 2nd conjugation. Only the basic forms are shown here; the periphrastic combinations are formed as shown above. While the person-number endings are quite regular across all verbs within each of these classes, the formation of the two basic stems for each verb displays a lot of irregularity and can follow any of a large number of idiosyncratic patterns.\n\nThe use of the past tense prefix (\"e-\"), the so-called augment, shows some variation and irregularity between verb classes. In regular (demotic) verbs in standard modern Greek, the prefix is used depending on a stress rule, which specifies that each past tense verb form has its stress on the third syllable from the last (the \"antepenultimate\"); the prefix is only inserted whenever the verb would otherwise have fewer than three syllables. In these verbs, the augment always appears as . A number of frequent verbs have irregular forms involving other vowels, mostly (\"i-\"), for example, → ('want'). In addition, verbs from the learned tradition partly preserve more complex patterns inherited from ancient Greek. In learned compound verbs with adverbial prefixes such as (\"peri-\") or (\"ipo-\"), the augment is inserted between the prefix and the verb stem (for example, → ('describe'). Where the prefix itself ends in a vowel, the vowels in this position may be subject to further assimilation rules, such as in → ('sign'). In addition, verbs whose stem begins in a vowel may also display vocalic changes instead of a syllabic augment, as in → ('hope'). The table below presents some further examples of these patterns:\n\nGreek is one of the few modern Indo-European languages that still retains a morphological contrast between the two inherited Proto-Indo-European grammatical voices: active and mediopassive. The mediopassive has several functions: \n\nThere also two other categories of verbs, which historically correspond to the ancient contracted verbs. \n\nThe verbs ('be') and ('have') are irregular and defective, because they both lack the aspectual contrast. The forms of both are given below.\nThe first and second person plural forms ήμαστε and ήσαστε appear very rarely in the spoken language.\n\nThe Greek nominal system displays inflection for two numbers (singular and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and four cases (nominative, genitive, accusative and vocative). As in many other Indo-European languages, the distribution of grammatical gender across nouns is largely arbitrary and need not coincide with natural sex. Case, number and gender are marked on the noun as well as on articles and adjectives modifying it. While there are four cases, there is a great degree of syncretism between case forms within most paradigms. Only one sub-group of the masculine nouns actually has four distinct forms in the four cases.\n\nThere are two articles in Modern Greek, the definite and the indefinite. They are both inflected for gender and case, and the definite article also for number. The article agrees with the noun it modifies.\n\nThe definite article is used frequently in Greek, such as before proper names and nouns used in an abstract sense. For example,\n\nThe indefinite article is identical with the numeral one and has only singular. The use of the indefinite article is not dictated by rules and the speaker can use it according to the circumstances of their speech. Indefiniteness in plural nouns is expressed by the bare noun without an article. For example,\n\nHowever, the indefinite article is not used in Greek as often as in English because it specifically expresses the concept of \"one\". For example,\n\nGreek nouns are inflected by case and number. In addition each noun belongs to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Within each of the three genders, there are several sub-groups (declension classes) with different sets of inflectional endings.\n\nThe main groups of masculine nouns have the nominative singular end in -ος [-os], -ης [-is], -ας [-as], -εας [-ˈeas]. Nouns in \"-os\" are identical to the Ancient Greek second declension, except for the final \"-n\" of the accusative singular. However, in other parts of speech that follow the same declension and where clarity is necessary, such as in pronouns, the \"-n\" is added. When the word has more than two syllables and the antepenult is accented, the accent fluctuates between the antepenult and the penult according to whether the last syllable has one of the ancient long diphthongs, -ου, -ων or -ους. Nouns in \"-is\" correspond to the ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural, and so do some nouns ending in -ίας [-ˈias]. Nouns in \"-as\" stem from the ancient third declension. They formed their nominative singular from the accusative singular and retain the original accent in genitive plural. Nouns in \"-eas\" stem from the ancient third declension and form their plural respectively.\n\nMoreover, there are other categories and forms too that have to do with either Demotic or Katharevousa. For example, through Demotic, many nouns, especially oxytones (those that are accented on the last syllable) in -άς (\"-as\") or -ής (\"-is\") form their plural by adding the stem extension -άδ- (\"-ad-\") and -ήδ- (\"-id-\") respectively. Although this declension group is an element of Demotic, it has its roots in Ionic Greek that influenced later Koine. On the other hand, from Katharevousa, nouns such as μυς (\"mys\", \"muscle\") follow the ancient declension in all cases except for the dative.\n\nMost feminine nouns end in -η [-i], -α [-a] and -ος [-os]. Those that end in \"-i\" and many that end in \"-a\" stem from the ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural. The rest of those that end in \"-a\" originate from the ancient third declension and have formed their nominative singular from the ancient accusative singular; those nouns keep the accent unchanged in genitive plural. The nouns that end in -ος (\"-os\") are identical to the respective masculine nouns. Finally, many feminine nouns that end in -η (\"-i\") correspond to Ancient Greek nouns in -ις (\"-is\"), which are still used as learned forms in formal contexts. Their singular forms have been adapted to the rest of the feminine nouns, while their plural forms have retained the ancient pattern in -εις (\"-eis\"). The forms of the genitive singular -εως (\"-eos\") are also found as a stylistic variant and they are fully acceptable, and in fact are more commonly used than the old-style nominative singular form.\n\nMost neuter nouns end either in -ο [-o] (plural: -α [-a]) or -ι [-i] (plural: -ιά [-ia]). Indeed, most of them that end in \"-i\" initially ended in \"-io\", an ending for diminutives that many nouns acquired already since Koine Greek. As a result, the endings of the plural and of the genitive singular are reminiscent of those older forms. For example, the diminutive of the ancient Greek word παῖς (\"pais\", \"child\") is παιδίον (\"paidion\") and hence the modern noun παιδί (\"paidi\"). Other neuter nouns end in -α (\"-a\") and -ος (\"-os\") and their declension is similar to the ancient one. Moreover, some nouns in -ιμο (\"-imo\"), which are usually derivatives of verbs, are declined similarly to those that end in \"-a\". Also note that most borrowings are indeclinable neuter, and can have just about any ending, such as γουίντ-σέρφινγκ \"windsurfing\". Finally, all neuter nouns have identical forms across the nominative, accusative and vocative.\n\nFor other neuter nouns, the ancient declension is used. For example, το φως (\"fos\", \"light\") becomes του φωτός, τα φώτα and των φώτων and το οξύ (\"oxy\", \"acid\") becomes του οξέος, τα οξέα and των οξέων.\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in gender, case and number. Therefore, each adjective has a threefold declension paradigm for the three genders. Adjectives show agreement both when they are used as attributes, e.g. η όμορφη γυναίκα (\"i omorfi gynaika\", \"the beautiful woman\") and when they are used as predicates e.g. η γυναίκα είναι όμορφη (\"i gynaika einai omorfi\", \"the woman is beautiful\").\n\nMost adjectives take forms in -ος (\"-os\") in the masculine, -ο (\"-o\") in the neuter and either -η (\"-i\"), -α (\"-a\") or -ια (\"-ia\") in the feminine. All those adjectives are declined similarly with the nouns that have the same endings. However they keep the accent stable where nouns change it. Adjectives with a consonant before the ending usually form the feminine with -η, those with a vowel before the ending in -α and some adjectives that end in -κός ([-ˈkos], \"-kos\") or -χός ([-ˈxos], \"-chos\") usually form it in -ια although the ending -η is applicable for those too.\n\nOther classes of adjectives include those that take forms in -ης (\"-is\") in both masculine and feminine and in -ες (\"-es\") in neuter. They are declined similarly with the ancient declension. Those that are not accented on the ultima usually raise the accent in the neuter. Another group includes adjectives that end in -υς ([-is], \"-ys\"). Although some are declined somewhat archaically such as οξύς (\"oxys\", \"acute\"), most of them are declined according to the rules of Demotic Greek and in many cases and persons they acquire other endings, such as in the case of πλατύς (\"platys\", \"wide\").\n\nThe adjective πολύς (\"polys\", \"many, much\") is irregular:\n\nAdjectives in Modern Greek can form a comparative for expressing comparisons. Similar to English, it can be formed in two ways, as a periphrastic form (as in English beautiful, more beautiful) and as a synthetic form using suffixes, as in English tall tall-er. The periphrastic comparative is formed by the particle πιο ([pço], \"pio\", originally \"more\") preceding the adjective. The synthetic forms of the regular adjectives in -ος, -η and -o is created with the suffix -οτερος (\"-oteros\"), -οτερη (\"-oteri\") and -οτερο (\"-otero\"). For those adjectives that end in -ης and -ες or -υς, -εια and -υ the corresponding suffixes are -εστερος (\"-esteros\") etc. and -υτερος (\"-yteros\") etc. respectively.\n\nA superlative is expressed by combining the comparative, in either its periphrastic or synthetic form, with a preceding definite article. Thus, Modern Greek does not distinguish between \"the largest house\" and \"the larger house\"; both are το μεγαλύτερο σπίτι.\n\nBesides the superlative proper, sometimes called \"relative superlative\", there is also an \"absolute superlative\" or elative, expressing the meaning \"very...\", for example ωραιότατος means \"very beautiful\". Elatives are formed with the suffixes -οτατος, -οτατη and -οτατο for the regular adjectives, -εστατος etc. for those in -ης and -υτατος for those in -υς.\n\nThe numerals \"one\", \"three\" and \"four\" are declined irregularly. Other numerals such as διακόσιοι (\"diakosioi\", \"two hundred\"), τριακόσιοι (\"triakosioi\", \"three hundred\") etc. and χίλιοι (\"chilioi\", \"thousand\") are declined regularly like adjectives. Other numerals including \"two\" are not declined.\n\nGreek pronouns include personal pronouns, reflexive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, possessive pronouns, intensive pronouns, relative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.\n\nThere are strong personal pronouns (stressed, free) and weak personal pronouns (unstressed, clitic). Nominative pronouns only have the strong form (except in some minor environments) and are used as subjects only when special emphasis is intended, since unstressed subjects recoverable from context are not overtly expressed anyway. Genitive (possessive) pronouns are used in their weak forms as pre-verbal clitics to express indirect objects (for example, του μίλησα, , 'I talked to him'), and as a post-nominal clitic to express possession (for example, οι φίλοι του, , 'his friends'). The strong genitive forms are relatively rare and used only for special emphasis (for example, αυτού οι φίλοι, , \"'his\" friends'); often they are doubled by the weak forms (for example, αυτού του μίλησα, , ' \"him\" I talked to'). An alternative way of giving emphasis to a possessive pronoun is propping it up with the stressed adjective δικός (, 'own'), for example, οι δικοί του φίλοι (, '\"his\" friends').\n\nAccusative pronouns exist both in a weak and a strong form. The weak form in the oblique cases is used as a pre-verbal clitic (for example, τον είδα, , 'I saw him'); the strong form is used elsewhere in the clause (for example, είδα αυτόν, , 'I saw \"him\"'). The weak form in the nominative is found only in few idiomatic deictic expressions, such as να τος 'there he [is]', πού 'ν' τος; 'where is he?'. Third-person pronouns have separate forms for the three genders; those of the first and second person do not. The weak third-person forms are similar to the corresponding forms of the definite article. The strong third-person forms function simultaneously as generic demonstratives ('this, that').\n\nThe strong forms of the third person in the genitive (αυτού, αυτής, αυτών, αυτούς) have optional alternative forms extended by an additional syllable or (αυτουνού, αυτηνής, αυτωνών). In the plural, there exists the alternative accusative form αυτουνούς.\n\nBesides αυτός as a generic demonstrative, there are also the more specific spatial demonstrative pronouns τούτος, -η, -ο (, 'this here') and εκείνος, -η, -ο (, 'that there').\n\nIn Demotic Greek, prepositions normally require the accusative case: από (from), για (for), με (with), μετά (after), χωρίς (without), ως (as) and σε (to, in or at). The preposition σε, when followed by a definite article, fuses with it into forms like στο (σε + το) and στη (σε + τη). While there is only a relatively small number of simple prepositions native to Demotic, the two most basic prepositions σε and από can enter into a large number of combinations with preceding adverbs to form new compound prepositions, for example, πάνω σε (on), κάτω από (underneath), πλάι σε (beside) etc.\n\nA few prepositions that take cases other than the accusative have been borrowed into Standard Modern Greek from the learned tradition of Katharevousa: κατά (against), υπέρ (in favor of, for), αντί (instead of). Other prepositions live on in a fossilised form in certain fixed expressions (for example, εν τω μεταξύ 'in the meantime', dative).\n\nThe preposition από (\"apó\", 'from') is also used to express the agent in passive sentences, like English \"by\".\n\nCoordinating and subordinating conjunctions in Greek include:\nThe word να () serves as a generic subordinator corresponding roughly to English \"to\" (+ infinitive) or \"that\" in sentences like προτιμώ να πάω (, 'I prefer to go', literally 'I prefer that I go') or προτιμώ να πάει ο Γιάννης (, 'I prefer that John go'). It marks the following verb as being in the subjunctive mood. Somewhat similar to the English \"to\"-infinitive its use is often associated with meanings of non-factuality, i.e. events that have not (yet) come true, that are expected, wished for etc. In this, it contrasts with ότι and πως , which correspond to English \"that\" when used with a meaning of factuality. The difference can be seen in the contrast between μας είπε να πάμε βόλτα (, 'he told us to go for a walk') vs. μας είπε πως πήγε βόλτα (, 'he told us that he went for a walk'). When used on its own with a following verb, να may express a wish or order, as in να πάει! (, 'let him go' or 'may he go'). Unlike the other subordinating conjunctions, να is always immediately followed by the verb it governs, separated from it only by any clitics that might be attached to the verb, but not by a subject or other clause-initial material.\n\nFor sentence negation, Greek has two distinct negation particles, δεν ([ˈðen], \"den\") and μη(ν) ([ˈmi(n)], \"mi(n)\"). Δεν is used in clauses with indicative mood, while μην is used primarily in subjunctive contexts, either after subjunctive-inducing να or as a negative replacement for να. Both particles are syntactically part of the proclitic group in front of the verb, and can be separated from the verb only by intervening clitic pronouns. The distinction between δεν and μην is a particularly archaic feature in Greek, continuing an old prohibitive negation marker inherited from Indo-European. As such, μην is often associated with the expression of a wish for an event not to come true:\n\n\nWhen used alone with a subjunctive verb in the second person, prohibitive μην serves as the functional equivalent to a negative imperative, which itself cannot be negated. Thus, the negation of the positive imperative τρέξε (, 'run!') is μην τρέξεις (, 'don't run!').\n\nThe particle όχι serves as the stand-alone utterance of negation ('no'), and also for negation of elliptical, verbless sentences and for contrastive negation of individual constituents:\n\n\nFor constituent negation, Greek employs negative concord. The negated constituent is marked with a negative-polarity item (e.g. κανένας 'any, anybody/nobody', τίποτα 'anything/nothing', πουθενά 'anywhere/nowhere'), and the verb is additionally marked with the sentence negator δεν (or μην). In verbless, elliptical contexts the negative-polarity items can also serve to express negation alone.\nThe negative pronoun κανείς ([kaˈnis], \"kaneis\"), i.e. \"nobody\" or \"anybody\" is declined in all three genders and three cases and can be used as the English determiner \"no\".\n\n\nOn the other hand, the negative pronoun ουδείς ([uˈðis], \"oudeis\"), from the learned tradition of Ancient Greek, is used without negative concord:\n\nGreek has two different ways of forming relative clauses. The simpler and by far the more frequent uses the invariable relativizer που (, 'that', literally 'where'), as in: η γυναίκα που είδα χτες (, 'the woman that I saw yesterday'). When the relativized element is a subject, object or adverbial within the relative clause, then – as in English – it has no other overt expression within the relative clause apart from the relativizer. Some other types of relativized elements, however, such as possessors, are represented within the clause by a resumptive pronoun, as in: η γυναίκα που βρήκα την τσάντα της (, 'the woman whose handbag I found', literally 'the woman that I found her handbag').\n\nThe second and more formal form of relative clauses employs complex inflected relative pronouns. They are composite elements consisting of the definite article and a following pronominal element that is inflected like an adjective: ο οποίος, η οποία, το οποίο ( etc., literally 'the which'). Both elements are inflected for case, number and gender according to the grammatical properties of the relativized item within the relative clause, as in: η γυναίκα την οποία είδα χτες (, 'the woman whom I saw yesterday'); η γυναίκα της οποίας βρήκα την τσάντα (, 'the woman whose handbag I found').\n\n\n"}

His works were primarily about recent Swiss history. His texts are used as exemplars in Swiss journalism schools.\n\nMeienberg's best works were compiled in the book \"St. Fiden Paris Oerlikon\". This book was republished in 2005/06 as part of the series \"Schweizer Bibliothek\" (a series of 20 of the most important Swiss books).\n\nMeienberg was born 1940 in St. Gallen. After five years in the convent school in Disentis, the 20-year-old went to the U.S. for one year. In New York City he worked as a clerk for the \"Federation of Migros Cooperatives\" and in Vancouver, Canada, as a bulldozer driver.\n\nOn his return to Switzerland, he was ready to study. As a main subject, he chose history (at the University of Fribourg, then at the ETH Zurich and later thanks to a stipend, in Paris). During his years of study he reportedly was a member of a reactionary secret society. In Paris he experienced the riots of May 1968.\n\nHe finished his studies in Fribourg with the title of a „lic. phil.“ and the licentiate work\n\"De Gaulle und die USA von 1940 bis 42\" (\"De Gaulle and the USA from 1940 to 42\").\n\nFrom 1966 on, he was a Paris correspondent for the \"Weltwoche\", for five years. Starting in 1971, he reported for the Swiss national television’s culture show \"Perspektiven\" (“Perspectives”) and lots of productions for the Swiss national radio’s transmissions, such as the satirical transmission \"Faktenordner\" („Facts Folder“). Meanwhile, he became a freelancer for the Zurich newspaper \"Tages-Anzeiger\" and the Tages-Anzeiger's magazine \"Magazin\" (today named \"Das Magazin\".)\n\nAfter 1976, he was banned from writing for the Tages-Anzeiger because of his criticisms of both Swiss history and contemporary Switzerland. The longtime ban was imposed by publisher Otto Coning against the editorial staff's wishes.\n\nIn 1977 had to go to court because of scenes of his movie \"Die Erschiessung des Landesverräters Ernst S.\" (English meaning: “The execution of the national betrayer Ernst S.”) and because of a planned theatre play about Ulrich Wille. Meienberg, who was represented by leftist Moritz Leuenberger, a later member of the Bundesrat (Swiss Federal Council), won the process against the two sons of Wille.\n\nFrom 1982 to 83, Niklaus Meienberg was head of the Paris Bureau of the German magazine \"Stern\". Afterwards, he was a freelancer for the weekly newspaper \"WOZ\" and acted as a writer.\n\nIn spring 1987, he wrote a critical and heavy discussed biography of Ulrich Wille and his family for the \"Weltwoche\". During fall of the same year, it was published as a book with the title \"Die Welt als Wille und Wahn\" (literally: “The World as Will and Delusion”). The German title is a play on words: “Wille” is not only a German word for “will”/”intention”, but means the surname of Ulrich Wille, too. The title in turn seems to be a reference to German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s (1788–1860) main work “Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung” (“The World as Will and Representation”, sometimes also known in English as “The World as Will and Idea”)\n\nMeienberg's penmanship found a lot few other sophisticated word-plays, too: In \"Die Erschiessung des Landesverräters Ernst S.\" he calls the traitor's execution \"Tells Geschoss\" (Tell's projectile\"), because the executor shot through the betrayer's eye, like Tell shot through an apple, and the macabre punchline is as follows: in German, the \"eyeball\" is literally called \"eye apple\".\nEven Meienberg's book's titles attest a liking for word jokes (e.g. \"The make-believing of true facts\" that inverts \"Die Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen\", which is a set phrase in the world of German-speaking courts and jurisdiction.)\n\nThe above-mentioned report is partially based on photographs of unpublished letters that Wille wrote to his wife. The exclusive photographs were taken by Meienberg without permission - they were exposed as pieces of scenery in an exhibition. In the Afterword, Meienberg, admitted this fact as follows:\n\n\"The guard commanding supervisor of the local museum Meilen never had flipped open the book, but was happy that its content pleased me and photographer Roland Gretler that much, and didn’t mind me excerpting any passages of the text or Roland Gretler integrally photographing a few dozens of pages.\"\n\nMeienberg committed suicide on 22 September 1993.\n\nIn the media, the suicide of Meienberg caused a big echo. The Austrian writer Erich Hackl thinks, Meienberg killed himself, because he was no longer able to cope with the direction of the world. A doctor would trace this back to untreated depression. In his last letters Meienberg called himself an “expiring model” (of a journalist?), original text: “auslaufendes Modell”.\n\nNiklaus Meienberg's literary remains are conserved in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern, that amongst others also conserves the literary remains of famous names like Albert Einstein, Hermann Hesse, Patricia Highsmith and Adolf Muschg.\n\nIn 1998, Meienberg's former lover, Aline Graf, published a book with the title \"Der andere Niklaus Meienberg\" (\"The other Niklaus Meienberg\"), in which she describes the eight years she was his lover. She writes rather negatively about him, says that he had held her too tight and his body had looked like a cockchafer grub. Graf was invited to talk shows, gave interviews, had a big media presence. Her book received rather bad reviews in Switzerland's papers and magazines, only in Germany were some positive voices. Her style was found dirty and polluting, she was supposed to being keen on media presence.\n\nThe Swiss, that defended Meienberg, were disgusted and angry. Graf wanted to leave the country to recover in the Netherlands for a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15210881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15210881", "title": "Nukak language", "text": "Nukak language\n\nThe Nukak language is a language of uncertain classification, perhaps part of the small Nadahup (Makú) language family. It is mutually intelligible with Kakwa.\n\nThere are six oral and six nasal vowels.\n\nThe vowel becomes the labial semivowel in several environments: in postnuclear position (when it appears immediately after the nuclear vowel of a morpheme), before another vowel, and at the beginning of the word or syllable. The semivowel is devoiced (IPA symbol ) if the tone rises and the following vowel is , , . \n\nThe vowel becomes the palatal semivowel in postnuclear position.\n\nThere are eleven consonant phonemes: ; (realized as with a nasal vowel, otherwise as at the start of a word, and as at the end of a word); ; (realized as with a nasal vowel, otherwise as at the start of a word, and as at the end of a word); (realized as or in free variation); (realized as in a nasal environment); ; (realized as in a nasal environment); (lateral sonorant, alternating with the approximant , the tap , and the lateral approximant ); ; (the glottal stop). \n\nThe following table of consonant phonemes shows each phoneme followed by the corresponding letter in the Nukak alphabet, where different. \n\nThe voiced palatal allophones ~ can be considered variants of the vowel when they precede a vowel in the initial position of a root or of an affix, or when they lie between two vowels.\n\nThe nuclear vowels of nouns, verbs, and adjectives bear tone. Nukak has two tonemes (minimal pairs exist between them): high and rising. In the surface phonology there are also a low tone and a falling tone. The rising and falling tones are accompanied by lengthening of the vowel. However, the falling tone has been analyzed as actually being the allomorph of the high tone in closed syllables ending in an occlusive consonant or or in morpheme final open syllables. Unaccented syllables always bear the low tone. \n\nThe high and rising tones occur only in monosyllabic, monomorphemic lexemes. Multisyllabic morphemes are stressed on the first syllable.\n\nThe default word order in sentences is subject–object–verb (SOV). In any case, the subject always precedes the object. Verbs are conjugated for person. The language is agglutinative. The grammatical and lexical meanings expressed by prepositions in the Indo-European languages are expressed by suffixes in Nukak. Adjectives, which are not inflected for grammatical gender, usually follow their head noun.\n\nThe Nukak nouns are marked for gender, number, and case. There are two grammatical genders. The plural of animate nouns is indicated with the suffix -\"wɨn\". Case markers include the following:\n\nDepending on the noun lexeme, the vocative case is expressed by a tone change; by the suffix -\"a\"; or by duplicating the nuclear vowel after the root final consonant. \n\nNouns can take tense suffixes, e.g., -\"hîpî' \", \"that [masculine] which came before\", and a question suffix, -\"má' \". The connective formative -\"tɨ\" expresses either coordination with another noun, i.e., \"also\", or the clause conjunction, \"and\". \n\nNoun classifying suffixes are common: -\"na' \" (long and slender), -\"da' \" \"small and round\", -\"dub\" \"small, slender, and pointed\", -\"nɨi\" \"flat and thin\", -\"ne\" \"long-haired\", -\"yi\" \"abundant, profuse\".\n\nPossessive pronouns are free forms: \"wî' \" \"mine\", \"mí' \" \"yours singular\", \"aî' \" \"his\", \"mi'î' \" \"hers\", \"wîi' \" \"our\", \"ñí' \" \"yours plural, \"i'î' \" \"theirs\". The relations \"my, your, her\", etc. are expressed with prefixes on the possessed noun: \"wa\" \"my\", \"ma\" \"your singular\", \"a\", \"his\", \"mi\" \"her\", \"hi\" \"our\", \"ñi\" \"your plural\", \"i\" \"their\". In conjugation, the same prefixes are agent (subject) markers. They occur either with or without personal pronouns.\n\n\"déi\" (\"what?\" \"which\" referring to things), \"de pán\" \"what?\" referring to actions, \"háu'ka\", \"de'e\" \"who?\", \"déimɨnɨ\" \"when?\", \"ded\" \"where?\", \"jáu' \" why?\". They combine with various other markers, e.g., case suffixes: the allative \"de' yúkú\" \"towards where?\", the instrumental \"de'e hin\" \"with whom?\", the genitive \"de'e î' \" \"whose?\". Interrogatives combine with tense markers as in \"jáu' ra' \" (\"due to what?\" + recent past).\n\nVerbs are conjugated with a subject prefix and with suffixes and infixes expressing aspect (continuous, immediate); tense (past, present, future) and mood (imperative, desiderative, interrogative). For example:\n\nThe imperative mood is formed by duplicating the last vowel of the verb stem, after the root final consonant or semivowel. The vowels [u] and [i] are pronounced as semivowels [w], [j] when duplicated after the final consonant. \n\nThe past imperfect is formed by suffixing to the stem the duplicate of the last vowel in the stem plus [p]: (-VC-Vp). The combination of the past imperfect suffix with the marker -\"tí´ \" marks a past subjunctive: \"jɨm\" \"to be\"; \"jɨmɨ\" \"may have been\",; past imperfect \"jɨmɨp\" \"was\"; subjunctive preterite \"jɨmɨptí´ \" \"if it were\".\n\nVerbal negation is expressed in different ways: with the suffix -\"ka\", which comes between the verb root and the tense, mood, and aspect markers; with certain prefixes to the verb stem; with the words \"yab´ \", \"no\", \"dɨi´ \", \"refuse\", \"îí´ \", \"without effect\" . Negative commands have a specific marker, -\"kê´ \".\n\nThere are many compound verbs. The elements may be two or more verb roots or they may be a verb root plus a noun, adjective, or adverb. The marker -\"a\" converts an intransitive verb root into a transitive verb. \n\nVerbs are nominalized with the suffixes -\"hát\", the abstract idea of the action, -\"pe' \", the affected object, participle. The agent of the action is indicated with the agentive (\"actance\") prefix and a suffix expressing person and number. The agentive suffixes are -\"ni' \" for the first person, second person, and third person singular feminine; -\"ni\" for the third person singular masculine; and -\"nit\" for the third person plural. To these may be added the marker for imminence, currently in progress, or emphasis, -\"yé' \".\n\nAll verb roots end in a consonant or semivowel. The meaning \"to be\" can be expressed in two ways: explicitly with the verb \"jɨm\" or tacitly through the various interrogative markers along with the personal pronouns, and occasionally with another verb, \"yit\", which has the emphatic form \"yittí' \", \"I am\".\n\nThe Nukak language has many adverb forms. Various adverbs are important in the construction of sentences. For example, they frequently use \"hébáká\" \"indeed\", and for even greater insistence, -\"yé' is suffixed. The verbal link \"tɨtíma'hî\" \"after\" can occur between the subject and the object and verb. Morphologically, some adverbs are independent words; these can follow nouns, like \"hattí' \" \"also\", \"neither\", \"yet\". There are some adverbial suffixes, e.g., -\"hê' \" \"only\", \"precisely\".\n\n\"Kútu' \" \"Hey!\", \"Attention!\" is an exclamation said in order to begin to speak. Other exclamatory words or phrases are \"hâré\" \"Be careful!\" or \"dɨpí hâré\" \"Be very careful!\"; \"waá'yé' \" \"Enough!; \"be'bét yé' \" \"Hurry up!\"; \"ni'kábá'í' \" \"That's it!\".\n\n"}
{"id": "24220547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24220547", "title": "Null allomorph", "text": "Null allomorph\n\nIn morpheme-based morphology, the term null allomorph or zero allomorph is sometimes used to refer to some kind of null morpheme for which there are also contexts in which the underlying morpheme is manifested in the surface structure. It is therefore also an allomorph. The phenomenon itself is known as \"null allomorphy\", \"morphological blocking\" or \"total morpheme blocking\".\n\nAn example of null allomorphy in English is the phrase \"two fish-∅\" which cannot be \"two fish-es\". In addition, according to some linguists such as Radford, in children's language the forms of many auxiliary verbs such as \"do\" have null allomorphs in tenseless clauses such as \"Teddy not go\".\n\nMain article: Liaison (French)\n\nFrench has many words ending in a \"silent consonant\", which is written but not pronounced before a pause or a word beginning with a consonant. It reappears in the case of liaison, e.g. between an article and a nominal syntagm, an epithet adjective and the noun, an adverb and the adjective it modifies, etc. If the following word begins with a vowel (or an \"h muet\"). Maybe the most common case is that of the articles \"les, un, des, aux\", etc.: e.g. \"les hommes\" [lezɔm] (the men) where the -s of the article is realized as [z], vs. \"les femmes\" [lefam] (the women) where it is silent.\n\nNull allomorphy occurs a lot in the grammar of the German language. The singular form of the dative case of masculine and neuter nouns such as \"der Mann\" (the man) has an optional grammatical suffix \"-e\": \"dem Mann-e\". However, this suffix is somewhat archaic today and is mainly used in written language. In other cases, its null allomorph occurs: \"dem Mann-∅\".\n\nTo some extent, null allomorphs also occur in the Dutch language. Many Dutch compound words have an interfix \"-s\" which is completely optional: both \"doodkist\" and \"doodskist\" (\"coffin\") are possible, as it is the case with \"spellingprobleem\" and \"spellingsprobleem\" (\"spelling problem\").\n\n"}

Speakers live primarily between the Tang Chuu to the east and Mangde Chhu to the west, from the town of Trongsa in Trongsa District; along Black River passes in the Trongsa District villages of Taktse and Usar; to in Ridha and Tashiding villages, and Phobji, Dangchu, and Sephu Gewogs and surrounding villages in southeast Wangdue Phodrang District.\n\nNyenkha is related to the East Bodish Bumthangkha and Kurtöpkha, with 75–77% and 69% lexical similarity, respectively, however they are not mutually intelligible. Dialects within Nyenkha show variation in tone and vocabulary. Dialects are generally named for their villages, such that names for the overall language are largely confined to academia.\n\nThe 1991 census revealed 11,472 Nyenkha speakers in six gewogs of Bhutan. In 1993, the number of speakers was around 10,000 according to van Driem. A 2010 study showed about 8700 speakers in 10 gewogs, which had been redrawn several times since 1991. The decline in numbers may be attributed to population shifts as landless families and former slash-and-burn agriculturalists relocate to areas opened for settlement. In addition to migration and movement, modernization trends have served to limit the practicality of Nyenkha as a fully functional language. Despite the decline in numbers and a shift toward bilingualism, the majority of young people remain fluent in the language.\n\nMany speakers of Nyen have extensive contact with other languages of Bhutan, often through trade. Traditionally, Nyen speakers raised sheep and other livestock for Labi speakers in exchange for cereals from lower altitudes. The communities also traditionally shared Bonpo orators.\n\nNyenkha basic vocabulary shows significant difference to Kurtöp (Zhake), a sister East Bodish language, and to Dzongkha, the national language.\n\nNyenkha has no grammatical gender. Nouns and pronouns may be singular or plural.\n\nUnlike Dzongkha and most other languages of Bhutan, Nyenkha verbs inflect according to subject number: སྔ་ལཱེག་དོ་ \"nga laeg-do\", \"I am going;\" ནེ་ལཱ་ཆུག་དོ་ \"ney laachhug-do\", \"We are going;\" ཁི་ལས་ཤི་ \"khi las-shi\", \"He/she has gone\"; བོས་ལཱ་ཆུག་ཤི་ \"boe laachhug-shi\", \"They have gone.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47398", "title": "Orchestration", "text": "Orchestration\n\nOrchestration is the study or practice of writing music for an orchestra (or, more loosely, for any musical ensemble, such as a concert band) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called \"instrumentation\", orchestration is the selection of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., melody, bassline, etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.\n\nOnly gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In classical music, most composers write the melodies, chord progression and musical form for a piece and, then, if they want the piece to be played by an orchestra, they orchestrate the piece themselves. In musical theatre, however, the composer typically writes the melodies and then hires a professional arranger or orchestrator to devise the parts for the pit orchestra to play.\n\nSimilarly, when a film company is making a film score, a composer thinks up the main melodies and themes for the score, and then one or more orchestrators are hired to \"flesh out\" these basic melodies by adding accompaniment parts, basslines, backing chords, and so on. In jazz big bands, the composer or songwriter writes the lead sheet, which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers \"flesh out\" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the rhythm section (bass, piano/jazz guitar/Hammond organ, drums).\n\nAn orchestrator is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments from an orchestra or other musical ensemble to a piece of music written by a composer, or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for musical theatre productions, film production companies or recording studios. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.), Master of Music (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding terminal degrees and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.\n\nThe term \"orchestration\" in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as melody, harmony or rhythm. For example, a C major chord is made up of the notes C, E, and G. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a measure, the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what register. Some instruments, including woodwinds and brass are monophonic and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of clarinets or trumpets (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the strings, piano, harp, and pitched percussion are polyphonic and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, she could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second violins and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, she could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a double stop of the notes G (an open string) and E.\n\nAdditionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the basses), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics. The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall tone color. If the C major chord was orchestrated for the trumpets and trombones playing fortissimo in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the celli and string basses playing sul tasto, doubled by the bassoons and bass clarinet, it might sound heavy and dark.\n\nNote that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, \"orchestration\" is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may \"orchestrate\" this same C major chord for, say, a woodwind quintet, a string quartet or a concert band. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone \"colours\" and timbres.\n\nA melody is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in her head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once she has thought of a melody, she has to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.\n\nAs well, the woodwinds and brass instruments can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The trumpets can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the cellos are often given an accompaniment role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in Prokofiev's \"Lieutenant Kije Suite\").\n\nWhile assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the glockenspiel, which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the celesta, which would add a bright tone to the sound.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st century, contemporary composers began to incorporate electric and electronic instruments into the orchestra, such as the electric guitar played through a guitar amplifier, the electric bass played through a bass amplifier, the Theremin and the synthesizer. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal \"colours\" in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding synthesizer or a theremin to create an unusual effect.\n\nOrchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention, as follows: flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon- horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling.

While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or concertmaster, there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s \"Magnificat\", BWV243 (1723) features muted strings doubled by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental timbres.]\n\nThe orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s epiphany Cantata \"Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen\" BWV65, which John Eliot Gardiner (2013, p. 328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft. Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, oboes da caccia, horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string pedal point in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:\n\nIgor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the \noboes.”\n\nJean Philippe Rameau was famous for \"the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether 'modern'.\" In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera \"Les Boréades\" (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:\n\nAnother important technique of orchestration was antiphony, the \"call and response\" exchange of musical motifs or \"ideas\" between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds \"answer\" by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line doubled at the octave by the first oboe: Charles Rosen (1971, p. 240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the Concerto in E flat major, K482, a work that introduced clarinets into the mix. “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing. One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.” \nThe orchestral tutti in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6. This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: “Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets. The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there. The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.” \n\nA demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The second subject of the sonata form is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p. 41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it music have been specially designed.” This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of mode (major to minor), dynamics (forte to pianissimo) and a blending of instrumental colour that ranges from boldly stated tutti passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:\n\nThe theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using staccato articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings. The theme is now played legato by the horns, accompanied by a sustained pedal point in the bassoons. The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme. (See also heterophony.) The timpani and pizzicato lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a triplet rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats:This is followed by a bold \"tutti\" statement of the theme, \"with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-staccato. :The minor version of the theme also appears in the cadenza, played staccato by the solo piano:This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato , accompanied by pizzicato strings and filigree arpeggio figuration in the solo piano: Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows “a superb flood of invention” through these varied treatments. “The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit” .”\n\nThe most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector Berlioz. (The composer was also the author of a \"Treatise on Instrumentation\".) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and timbres of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.” Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his \"Symphonie fantastique\". The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds. The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: ]\n\n“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” \nBerlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing. A particularly spectacular instance is the “Queen Mab” scherzo from the \"Romeo et Juliette\" symphony, which Hugh Macdonald (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause: \n\nBoulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.” \nMacdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” ] The New Grove Dictionary says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands timbre became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”\n\nAfter Berlioz, Richard Wagner was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century. Pierre Boulez speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.” Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera \"Lohengrin\", where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.” ]\n\nAs he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing \"The Ring\" Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed colours, bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.” In the first act of his final opera \"Parsifal\", Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:]\n\nOn the other hand, the prelude to the opera \"Tristan and Isolde\" exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different orchestral families with his precise markings of dynamics and articulation. In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: ]\n\nWhen this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the instrumental colors are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the cor anglais and the bass clarinet. These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: ]\n\n“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works. He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.” Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.” According to Roger Scruton, \"Seldom since Bach's inspired use of obbligato parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas.\" \n\nWilliam Austin (1966) says “Mahler expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by Beethoven, Berlioz and Wagner… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud. Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.” Adorno (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”. The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this: Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble. The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments. Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics. For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked \"forte\", the clarinets, \"mezzo-forte\" and the horns \"piano\". Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”\n\nMahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what Walter Piston (1969, p. 140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”\n\nApart from Mahler and Richard Strauss, the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude Debussy. According to Pierre Boulez (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.” Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.” Apart from the early impact of Wagner, Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.\n\nBoth influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, \"Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune\" (1894). Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of silence, the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking half-diminished seventh chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a glissando on the harp. Austin (1966, p. 16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the Tristan chord could have conceived the beginning of the \"Faune\".”\n\nLater in the \"Faune\", Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “Polyphony and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of Mozart, Weber, Berlioz and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the heterophonic music of the Far East... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a Javanese gamelan vary the slower basic melody.”\n\nDebussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet \"Jeux\" (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the \"Faune\". The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like celesta in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the whole tone chords in the woodwind:]\n\nJensen (2014, p. 228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of \"Jeux\" is its orchestration. While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in \"Parsifal\"’ The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.” \n\nIn a more general sense, \"orchestration\" also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: transcription, which closely follows the original piece, and arrangement, which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, \"orchestration\" applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term \"instrumentation\" applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration – in contradistinction to the practice – the term \"instrumentation\" may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.\n\nIn commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as \"Camelot\" or \"Fiddler on the Roof\", the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as \"Evita\", they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.\n\nMost orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or short score, that is, a score written on limited number of independent musical staves. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the opera or music theatres, prefer to work from a piano vocal score up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of Jules Massenet. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when Jonathan Tunick orchestrates Stephen Sondheim's songs, or when orchestration is done from a lead sheet (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the chord progression). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.\n\nDue to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some film composers have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975), Georges Delerue (1925-1992), Ennio Morricone (1928-), John Williams (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), Howard Shore (1946-), James Horner (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), Bruno Coulais (1954-), Rachel Portman (1960-), Philippe Rombi (1968-) and Abel Korzeniowski (1972-).\n\nAlthough there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were Jack Hayes, Herbert W. Spencer, Edward Powell (who worked almost exclusively with Alfred Newman), Arthur Morton, Greig McRitchie, and Alexander Courage. Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include Jeff Atmajian, Pete Anthony, Brad Dechter (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), Conrad Pope (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), Eddie Karam (John Williams, James Horner), Bruce Fowler (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mothersbaugh, John Powell), John Ashton Thomas (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano), Robert Elhai (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and J.A.C. Redford (James Horner, Thomas Newman). \n\nConrad Salinger was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as \"Singin' in the Rain\", \"An American in Paris\", and \"Gigi\". In the 1950s, film composer John Williams frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. Robert Russell Bennett (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.\n\nMost films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a \"cue\". There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. Digital Performer, Logic Pro, or Cubase). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a MIDI file which is then imported into a music notation program such as Finale or Sibelius. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.\n\nEvery composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized \"mockup\" recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in). He or she then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer (synthestration) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.\n\nThe sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to \"speak\" louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He or she may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.\n\nThe orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he or she has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a Romantic music era-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget independent film may only be able to afford a 20 performer chamber orchestra or a jazz quartet. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.\n\nThe major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator conducting and the composer producing from the booth.\n\n\n\n - full, searchable text with music images, mp3 files, and MusicXML files\n"}

The idea is not accepted, as plants lack nervous systems. Paranormal claims in regard to plant perception are considered to be pseudoscience by many in the scientific community.\n\nThe idea is distinct from measured plant perception and chemical communication.\n\nThe notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions was first recorded in 1848, when Gustav Fechner, a German experimental psychologist, suggested that plants are capable of emotions and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, attitude, and affection.\n\nIndian scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, began to conduct experiments on plants in the year 1900. Bose invented various devices and instruments to measure electrical responses in plants. He stated from his experiments that an electrical spasm occurs during the end of life for a plant.\n\nAccording to biologist Patrick Geddes \"In his investigations on response in general Bose had found that even ordinary plants and their different organs were sensitive— exhibiting, under mechanical or other stimuli, an electric response, indicative of excitation.\" One visitor to his laboratory, the vegetarian playwright George Bernard Shaw, was intensely disturbed upon witnessing a demonstration in which a cabbage had \"convulsions\" as it boiled to death.\n\nIn the 1960s Cleve Backster, an interrogation specialist with the CIA, conducted research that led him to believe that plants can communicate with other lifeforms. Backster's interest in the subject began in February 1966 when he tried to measure the rate at which water rises from a philodendron's root into its leaves. Because a polygraph or 'lie detector' can measure electrical resistance, which would alter when the plant was watered, he attached a polygraph to one of the plant's leaves. Backster stated that, to his immense surprise, \"the tracing began to show a pattern typical of the response you get when you subject a human to emotional stimulation of short duration\".\n\nIn 1975, K. A. Horowitz, D. C. Lewis and E. L. Gasteiger published an article in \"Science\" giving their results when repeating one of Backster's effects - plant response to the killing of brine shrimp in boiling water. The researchers grounded the plants to reduce electrical interference and rinsed them to remove dust particles. As a control three of five pipettes contained brine shrimp while the remaining two only had water: the pipettes were delivered to the boiling water at random. This investigation used a total of 60 brine shrimp deliveries to boiling water while Backster's had used 13. Positive correlations did not occur at a rate great enough to be considered statistically significant. Other controlled experiments that attempted to replicate Backster's findings have also produced negative results.\n\nBotanist Arthur Galston and physiologist Clifford L. Slayman who investigated Backster's claims wrote:\n\nThere is no objective scientific evidence for the existence of such complex behaviour in plants. The recent spate of popular literature on \"plant consciousness\" appears to have been triggered by \"experiments\" with a lie detector, subsequently reported and embellished in a book called \"The Secret Life of Plants\". Unfortunately, when scientists in the discipline of plant physiology attempted to repeat the experiments, using either identical or improved equipment, the results were uniformly negative. Further investigation has shown that the original observations probably arose from defective measuring procedures.\n\nJohn M. Kmetz noted that Backster had not used proper controls in his experiments. When controls were used, no plant reactions to thoughts or threats were observed.\n\nThe television show \"MythBusters\" performed experiments (Season 4, Episode 18, 2006) to verify or disprove the concept. The tests involved connecting plants to a polygraph galvanometer and employing actual and imagined harm upon the plants or upon others in the plants' vicinity. The galvanometer showed some kind of reaction about one third of the time. The experimenters, who were in the room with the plant, posited that the vibrations of their actions or the room itself could have affected the polygraph. After isolating the plant, the polygraph showed a response slightly less than one third of the time. Later experiments with an EEG failed to detect anything. The show concluded that the results were not repeatable, and that the theory was not true.\n\n\n\n"}

The biased use of enforcement discretion, such as that based on racial prejudice or corruption, is usually considered a legal abuse and a threat to the rule of law.\n\nIn some cases, selective enforcement may be desirable. For example, a verbal warning to a teenager may effectively alter their behavior without resorting to legal punishment and with the added benefit of reducing governmental legal costs. In other cases, selective enforcement may be inevitable. For example, it may be impractical for police officers to issue traffic tickets to every driver they observe exceeding the speed limit, so they may have no choice but to limit action to the most flagrant examples of reckless driving.\n\nIn the United States federal system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when, who, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of federal criminal law. The prosecutor's broad discretion in such areas as initiating or forgoing prosecutions, selecting or recommending specific charges, and terminating prosecutions by accepting guilty pleas has been recognized on numerous occasions by the courts.\n\nWayte v. United States 470 U.S. 598 (1985) said:In our criminal justice system, the Government retains \"broad discretion\" as to whom to prosecute. [...] This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake.\"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886) was the first case where the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMore recently this has become a topic of great discussion in the illegal immigration debate in the United States. The 2011 \"Morton Memo\" laid out enforcement priorities for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and was intended to channel limited resources into prioritized pursuit of cases involving criminals and felons. It was interpreted as the waiver of active prosecution of non-criminal illegal aliens and the exclusive focus on criminal illegal aliens. Enforcement priorities were further defined by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which started in 2012. This uses the executive branch's discretionary authority to grant certain people who were illegally brought to the United States as minors the temporary authorization to live and work in the United States.\n"}

The term applies both to the mental processes used by humans, and to artificial processes of natural language processing.\n\nSpeech segmentation is a subfield of general speech perception and an important subproblem of the technologically focused field of speech recognition, and cannot be adequately solved in isolation. As in most natural language processing problems, one must take into account context, grammar, and semantics, and even so the result is often a probabilistic division (statistically based on likelihood) rather than a categorical one. Though it seems that coarticulation—a phenomenon which may happen between adjacent words just as easily as within a single word—presents the main challenge in speech segmentation across languages, some other problems and strategies employed in solving those problems can be seen in the following sections.\n\nThis problem overlaps to some extent with the problem of text segmentation that occurs in some languages which are traditionally written without inter-word spaces, like Chinese and Japanese, compared to writing systems which indicate speech segmentation between words by a word divider, such as the space. However, even for those languages, text segmentation is often much easier than speech segmentation, because the written language usually has little interference between adjacent words, and often contains additional clues not present in speech (such as the use of Chinese characters for word stems in Japanese). Word Boundary Identification can be overcome by NLU approaches such as Patom theory integrated with Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) for languages without spaces between words such as Japanese and Chinese.\n\nIn natural languages, the meaning of a complex spoken sentence can be understood by decomposing it into smaller lexical segments (roughly, the words of the language), associating a meaning to each segment, and combining those meanings according to the grammar rules of the language.\n\nThough lexical recognition is not thought to be used by infants in their first year, due to their highly limited vocabularies, it is one of the major processes involved in speech segmentation for adults. Three main models of lexical recognition exist in current research: first, whole-word access, which argues that words have a whole-word representation in the lexicon; second, decomposition, which argues that morphologically complex words are broken down into their morphemes (roots, stems, inflections, etc.) and then interpreted and; third, the view that whole-word and decomposition models are both used, but that the whole-word model provides some computational advantages and is therefore dominant in lexical recognition.\n\nTo give an example, in a whole-word model, the word \"cats\" might be stored and searched for by letter, first \"c\", then \"ca\", \"cat\", and finally \"cats\". The same word, in a decompositional model, would likely be stored under the root word \"cat\" and could be searched for after removing the \"s\" suffix. \"Falling\", similarly, would be stored as \"fall\" and suffixed with the \"ing\" inflection.\n\nThough proponents of the decompositional model recognize that a morpheme-by-morpheme analysis may require significantly more computation, they argue that the unpacking of morphological information is necessary for other processes (such as syntactic structure) which may occur parallel to lexical searches.\n\nAs a whole, research into systems of human lexical recognition is limited due to little experimental evidence that fully discriminates between the three main models.\n\nIn any case, lexical recognition likely contributes significantly to speech segmentation through the contextual clues it provides, given that it is a heavily probabilistic system—based on the statistical likelihood of certain words or constituents occurring together. For example, one can imagine a situation where a person might say \"I bought my dog at a ____ shop\" and the missing word's vowel is pronounced as in \"net\", \"sweat\", or \"pet\". While the probability of \"netshop\" is extremely low, since \"netshop\" isn't currently a compound or phrase in English, and \"sweatshop\" also seems contextually improbable, \"pet shop\" is a good fit because it is a common phrase and is also related to the word \"dog\".\n\nMoreover, an utterance can have different meanings depending on how it is split into words. A popular example, often quoted in the field, is the phrase \"How to wreck a nice beach\", which sounds very similar to \"How to recognize speech\". As this example shows, proper lexical segmentation depends on context and semantics which draws on the whole of human knowledge and experience, and would thus require advanced pattern recognition and artificial intelligence technologies to be implemented on a computer.\n\nLexical recognition is of particular value in the field of computer speech recognition, since the ability to build and search a network of semantically connected ideas would greatly increase the effectiveness of speech-recognition software. Statistical models can be used to segment and align recorded speech to words or phones. Applications include automatic lip-synch timing for cartoon animation, follow-the-bouncing-ball video sub-titling, and linguistic research. Automatic segmentation and alignment software is commercially available.\n\nFor most spoken languages, the boundaries between lexical units are difficult to identify; phonotactics are one answer to this issue. One might expect that the inter-word spaces used by many written languages like English or Spanish would correspond to pauses in their spoken version, but that is true only in very slow speech, when the speaker deliberately inserts those pauses. In normal speech, one typically finds many consecutive words being said with no pauses between them, and often the final sounds of one word blend smoothly or fuse with the initial sounds of the next word.\n\nThe notion that speech is produced like writing, as a sequence of distinct vowels and consonants, may be a relic of alphabetic heritage for some language communities. In fact, the way vowels are produced depends on the surrounding consonants just as consonants are affected by surrounding vowels; this is called coarticulation. For example, in the word \"kit\", the [k] is farther forward than when we say 'caught'. But also, the vowel in \"kick\" is phonetically different from the vowel in \"kit\", though we normally do not hear this. In addition, there are language-specific changes which occur in casual speech which makes it quite different from spelling. For example, in English, the phrase \"hit you\" could often be more appropriately spelled \"hitcha\".\n\nFrom a decompositional perspective, in many cases, phonotactics play a part in letting speakers know where to draw word boundaries. In English, the word \"strawberry\" is perceived by speakers as consisting (phonetically) of two parts: \"straw\" and \"berry\". Other interpretations such as \"stra\" and \"wberry\" are inhibited by English phonotactics, which does not allow the cluster \"wb\" word-initially. Other such examples are \"day/dream\" and \"mile/stone\" which are unlikely to be interpreted as \"da/ydream\" or \"mil/estone\" due to the phonotactic probability or improbability of certain clusters. The sentence \"Five women left\", which could be phonetically transcribed as [faɪvwɪmɘnlɛft], is marked since neither /vw/ in /faɪvwɪmɘn/ or /nl/ in /wɪmɘnlɛft/ are allowed as syllable onsets or codas in English phonotactics. These phonotactic cues often allow speakers to easily distinguish the boundaries in words.\n\nVowel harmony in languages like Finnish can also serve to provide phonotactic cues. While the system does not allow front vowels and back vowels to exist together within one morpheme, compounds allow two morphemes to maintain their own vowel harmony while coexisting in a word. Therefore, in compounds such as \"selkä/ongelma\" ('back problem') where vowel harmony is distinct between two constituents in a compound, the boundary will be wherever the switch in harmony takes place—between the \"ä\" and the \"ö\" in this case. Still, there are instances where phonotactics may not aid in segmentation. Words with unclear clusters or uncontrasted vowel harmony as in \"opinto/uudistus\" ('student reform') do not offer phonotactic clues as to how they are segmented.\n\nFrom the perspective of the whole-word model, however, these words are thought be stored as full words, so the constituent parts wouldn't necessarily be relevant to lexical recognition.\n\nInfants are one major focus of research in speech segmentation. Since infants have not yet acquired a lexicon capable of providing extensive contextual clues or probability-based word searches within their first year, as mentioned above, they must often rely primarily upon phonotactic and rhythmic cues (with prosody being the dominant cue), all of which are language-specific. Between 6 and 9 months, infants begin to lose the ability to discriminate between sounds not present in their native language and grow sensitive to the sound structure of their native language, with the word segmentation abilities appearing around 7.5 months.\n\nThough much more research needs to be done on the exact processes that infants use to begin speech segmentation, current and past studies suggest that English-native infants approach stressed syllables as the beginning of words. At 7.5 months, infants appear to be able to segment bisyllabic words with strong-weak stress patterns, though weak-strong stress patterns are often misinterpreted, e.g. interpreting \"guiTAR is\" as \"GUI TARis\". It seems that infants also show some complexity in tracking frequency and probability of words, for instance, recognizing that although the syllables \"the\" and \"dog\" occur together frequently, \"the\" also commonly occurs with other syllables, which may lead to the analysis that \"dog\" is an individual word or concept instead of the interpretation \"thedog\".\n\nLanguage learners are another set of individuals being researched within speech segmentation. In some ways, learning to segment speech may be more difficult for a second-language learner than for an infant, not only in the lack of familiarity with sound probabilities and restrictions but particularly in the overapplication of the native language's patterns. While some patterns may occur between languages, as in the syllabic segmentation of French and English, they may not work well with languages such as Japanese, which has a mora-based segmentation system. Further, phonotactic restrictions like the boundary-marking cluster /ld/ in German or Dutch are permitted (without necessarily marking boundaries) in English. Even the relationship between stress and vowel length, which may seem intuitive to speakers of English, may not exist in other languages, so second-language learners face an especially great challenge when learning a language and its segmentation cues.\n\n\n"}

The most common \"tussenvoegsels\" are \"van\" (as in Vincent van Gogh; see also van (Dutch)) meaning \"from\" and \"de\" (as in Greg de Vries), meaning \"the\". If a \"tussenvoegsel\" is present it forms an integral part of a surname, to separate it from similar Dutch surnames that include no \"tussenvoegsel\" (e.g. as in Jan de Boer versus Albert Boer and Frits de Kok versus Wim Kok). \n\nThe use of \"tussenvoegsels\" differs between the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nIn the Netherlands, these \"tussenvoegsels\" are not included when sorting alphabetically. For example, in the Dutch telephone directory the surname \"De Vries\" is listed under \"V\", not \"D\". Therefore, in Dutch databases \"tussenvoegsels\" are recorded separately. This often simplifies finding a Dutch surname in a Dutch database, because including the \"tussenvoegsel\" would result in many surnames being listed under \"D\" and \"V\".\n\nAccording to Dutch language rules in the Netherlands, the \"tussenvoegsel\" in a surname is written with a capital letter only when it starts a sentence or is not preceded by a first name or initial. So referring to a Peter whose surname is \"de Vries\" we write \"meneer De Vries\" (Mr De Vries), but \"Peter de Vries\" and \"P. de Vries\".\n\nIn Belgium, surnames are collated with the full surname including \"tussenvoegsels\". \"De Smet\" comes before \"DeSmet\" in a telephone book.\nAlthough Francophone surnames commonly also have \"tussenvoegsels\", those are frequently contracted into the last name, turning e.g. Le Roc into Leroc or La Roche into LaRoche, thus explaining the collation preference.\n\nIn contrast to Dutch orthographic rules, in Belgium \"tussenvoegsels\" always keep their original orthography, as in \"meneer Van Der Velde\", \"meneer P. Van Der Velde\" or \"Peter Van Der Velde\".\n\n\"Tussenvoegsels\" originate from the time that Dutch last names officially came into use. Many of the names are place names, which refer to cities (Van Coevorden, for example) or geographical locations (such as Van den Velde, or \"of the fields\"). The following list of \"tussenvoegsels\" includes approximate translations, some of which have maintained their earlier meaning more than others.\n\n\nCombinations of these words are also common.
