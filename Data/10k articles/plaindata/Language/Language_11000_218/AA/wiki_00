{"id": "9155562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9155562", "title": "Archduke Wilhelm of Austria", "text": "Archduke Wilhelm of Austria\n\nArchduke Wilhelm Franz of Austria, later Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen (10 February 1895 – 18 August 1948), also known as Basil the Embroidered (), was an Austrian archduke, a colonel of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, and a poet.\n\nArchduke Wilhelm was the youngest son of Archduke Karl Stephan and Archduchess Maria Theresia, Princess of Tuscany. He was born in a family estate on the Lošinj island, Austrian Littoral (present day Croatia).\n\nAccommodating the 19th-century rise of nationalism, Archduke Karl Stephan decided that his branch of the Habsburg family would adopt a Polish identity and would combine a loyalty to their Habsburg family with a loyalty to Poland. Accordingly, he had his children learn Polish from an early age and tried to instill in them a sense of Polish patriotism. His oldest son, Karl-Albrecht, would become a Polish officer who refused to renounce his Polish loyalty even under torture by the Gestapo. Karl Stefan's two younger daughters would marry into the Polish noble families of Radziwill and Czartoryski. Wilhelm, the youngest child, rebelled, and came to identify with the Poles' rivals, the Ukrainians. He developed a fascination with Ukrainian culture, and as a youth escaped from his family's estate, travelling incognito to Hutsul villages in the nearby Carpathian mountains and Bukovyna (the Land of Cheremosh and Prut). This interest in the relatively impoverished Ukrainian people earned him the nickname of the \"Red Prince\". Eventually the Habsburgs came to accept and encourage this interest, and he was groomed by them to take a leadership role amongst the Ukrainian people in a manner similar to the one in which his father and older brother were to take amongst the Habsburgs' Polish subjects.\n\nEventually approved by his father, his as well as his father's ambition became for Wilhelm to become the king of Ukraine. Despite his youth, he played an important historical role. As a member of the Habsburg imperial house he came to work closely with Ukrainian deputies to the parliament of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in an effort to gain more rights for the Ukrainian minority, serving as a liaison between the Ukrainian community leaders and Austria's emperor Charles I. During the First World War he commanded a detachment of Ukrainians from Halychyna, serving as a lieutenant with the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. During the German and Austrian occupation of Ukraine in 1918, he commanded a separate Sich Riflemen regiment that fought against Bolsheviks in Southern Ukraine.\n\nDuring the time of his stay in Southern Ukraine, Wilhelm became the focal point of a quiet struggle between the two allies, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire, for the future of Ukraine which they both occupied. The Habsburgs hoped for Ukraine to be a politically self-sufficient ally in order to counter German power. Accordingly, they planned for Wilhelm to eventually become Ukraine's king and supported his efforts to gain popularity among Ukraine's people as well as to promote Ukrainian patriotism. The Germans, on the other hand, were primarily concerned with obtaining grain, and supported Pavlo Skoropadskyi's rule.\n\nPromoted to the rank of captain, Wilhelm was made commander of \"Battle Group Archduke Wilhelm,\" created by the Emperor Charles I, and provided with approximately 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and officers under his command. His troops occupied a small area near the site of the old Zaporozhian Sich, and were tasked with supporting the Ukrainian national cause in any way possible. This was done by screening officials by ethnicity, creating a newspaper, and engaging in cultural work with local peasants. Wilhelm mixed easily with the local peasants, who admired his ability to live simply like his soldiers. Within Wilhelm's personal occupation zone, peasants were allowed to keep the lands that they had taken from the landlords in 1917, and Wilhelm prevented the Habsburg armed forces from requisitioning grain. Ukrainians who had resisted requisitioning elsewhere - including those who had killed German or Austrian soldiers - were given refuge within Wilhelm's territory. These actions outraged Germany and Austrian officials in Kiev, but increased his popularity among local Ukrainians, who referred to him as affectionately as \"Prince Vasyl.\" The Germans feared that Wilhelm would create a coup and overthrow the Hetmanate. Indeed, several attempts by Ukrainians were made to make Archduke Wilhelm a sovereign of Ukraine, transforming the country into a monarchy. Each time he deferred to the opinion of the Austrian Emperor, who at the time denied Wilhelm's requests for diplomatic reasons. Nevertheless, Charles I resisted German pressure to have Wilhelm removed from Ukraine. Wilhelm and his soldiers were finally ordered out of Ukraine in October 1918 due to the revolutionary conditions there, moving to Bukovina. Through his intervention, in October 1918 two regiments of mostly Ukrainian troops were garrisoned in Lemberg (modern Lviv). This would set the stage for the declaration of the West Ukrainian National Republic on November 1.\n\nFollowing Austria's dissolution, Wilhelm ordered his men to travel from Bukovina to Lviv to fight for the Ukrainian cause. He himself fled to that city after Romanian forces captured Bukovina, but was told by the president of the West Ukrainian National Republic that his services were not needed, and retired to a nearby monastery. As a Habsburg, he had become a liability to the Ukrainian cause, which was being portrayed to the Allies by its Polish enemies as an Austrian plot. After pledging loyalty to the Ukrainian People's Republic, in 1919 he was made a colonel of its army and worked for the Ministry of Defense of the country. In protest at Petlura's peace treaty with Poland in 1920, which he considered to be a betrayal of Western Ukraine, he resigned and lived in exile in Vienna and Paris.\n\nIn an interview in a Viennese newspaper in January 1921, Wilhelm publicly rebuked Poland, condemning the pogroms in Lwow as something that would never happen in a civilized country, and referring to Poland and Poles as dishonorable. This caused a permanent, public estrangement between Wilhelm and his father Stephan. In 1921 Wilhelm published a book of poetry in Ukrainian, \"Mynayut Dni\" (Минають дні - The days pass).\n\nThat same year, he became involved in various plots by monarchists and other wishing to overthrow the new order following the first world war. He founded a Ukrainian veterans' organization in Vienna, briefly reconciled with his one-time rival Pavlo Skoropadskyi, and established contact with German counter-revolutionaries and monarchists such as Max Bauer and Erich Ludendorff, who helped fund a Ukrainian paramilitary organization in Vienna known as the Free Cossacks (estimated by Austrian police as numbering 40,000). Wilhelm's uncompromising attitude towards Poland made him popular among Ukrainian exiles, and he spent much of 1921 recruiting an invasion army of Ukraine. At this time, he was viewed by French and Polish intelligence as the Ukrainians' unquestioned leader and a viable candidate for the Ukrainian throne, respectively. Such plans aroused the anger of the exiled Ukrainian People's Republic, which had been discredited by its alliance with Poland (and continued to receive subsidies from the Polish government) and saw in Wilhelm a rival for Ukrainian allegiance. Seeking to upstage Wilhelm's planned invasion, the Ukrainian People's Republic invaded Soviet Ukraine on its own in November 1921 with several thousand soldiers. Its quick defeat discredited the idea of an invasion of Ukraine, and caused Wilhelm's German financial supporters to cease their subsidization of his project, which then collapsed. Under his Ukrainian name Vasyl Vyshyvani, he left Austria for Spain in 1922 from which he hoped in vain to obtain financial support for his Ukrainian adventure from his cousin, King Alfonso XIII.\n\nWhen all of his attempts to gain power in Ukraine failed to produce results, Wilhelm moved to Paris where he led a bisexual and increasingly hedonistic lifestyle. He spent part of his time in salons among other aristocrats, but the remainder in gay bars - favouring black rent-boys and sailors. An informant for the French police claimed that Wilhelm carried on a sexual relationship with two of his male assistants. In 1935 he became enmeshed in a legal situation caused by his lover Paulette Couyba, who had used Wilhelm without his knowledge to swindle investors of hundreds of thousands of Francs. During the sensationalistic and well-publicized trial, Wilhelm fled Paris for Vienna.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1930s, Wilhelm resumed his nationalistic Ukrainian activities. He established contact with old comrades-in-arms from the Galician Sich Rifles Yevhen Konovalets and Andriy Melnyk, who now headed the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Although as a young man he had been pro-Jewish, Wilhelm began to espouse anti-Semitism and grew close to a circle within the Nazi party, led by Alfred Rosenberg, who advocated an allied Ukrainian state.\n\nWhen by 1941 it became clear to Wilhelm that the Nazis would not support Ukrainian independence, however, he turned against the Nazis, spying for the British during much of the Second World War. His last years were as a spy for the French against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1947 he was arrested by Soviet military counter-intelligence SMERSH in Vienna and brought to Lukyanivka Prison in Kiev. During his imprisonment he insisted on speaking the Ukrainian language at interrogations. On 12 August 1948 the decision was made to transport him to the western Ukraine in order to serve a 25-year prison sentence. Before this could be carried out, on 18 August he died of untreated tuberculosis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1724342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1724342", "title": "BYOB", "text": "BYOB\n\nBYOB or BYO is an initialism concerning alcohol that is usually meant to stand for \"bring your own bottle”, though it expanded to also stand for similar phrases such as “bring your own beverage”, \"bring your own booze\", or, when relevant, “bring your own beer\".\n\nBYOB is sometimes placed on an invitation to indicate that the host will not be providing alcohol and that guests are welcome to bring their own. Some restaurants and business establishments (especially in areas where liquor licenses are difficult to obtain) allow patrons to bring their own bottle, sometimes subject to fees or membership conditions, or because the establishment itself does not have license to sell alcohol.\n\nThe term is cited by some online sources to have been used first in the early 1970s to mean \"bring your own bottle (of wine)\", although in present-day it is just as likely to mean \"bring your own booze\" or \"bring your own beer\". It was used by small restaurants that did not have liquor licenses, but which were responding to the new popularity of wine among Americans by advising customers that they could BYOB and drink it with their meal.\n\nSome establishments that sell alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption, such as bars or restaurants, may also allow patrons to bring their own alcohol purchased from elsewhere. That alcohol is usually subject to an \"opening fee\". Often the rule is limited to bottles of wine, where the fee is known as \"corkage\" or a \"corking fee\". Such policies are greatly regulated by local liquor control laws and licensing restrictions.\n\nAs an alternative to the traditional full-service liquor license, some jurisdictions offer a similar license known as a \"bottle club\" license. It allows the business establishment to serve alcohol on the premises, but only if patrons brought the alcohol from elsewhere. The license generally prohibits the business from selling its own stock of alcoholic beverages. The license may require that patrons be members of the establishment. Such licenses may be preferred in situations where fees or zoning conditions imposed by a full-service liquor license are unwanted or impractical. They may also be the only license available, as some jurisdictions impose full-service liquor license quotas or business class restrictions.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the term \"BYO\" (Bring Your Own) emerged to describe business establishments that offered corkage. It is believed that restaurants in Melbourne, in the state of Victoria, were advertising as \"BYO\" establishments by the 1960s with the concept becoming popular in New Zealand in the late 1970s.\n\nLegally, using New Zealand as an example, if your premises only holds an on-licence-endorsed (BYOB license), you as an owner and duty manager with a General Manager's Certificate are forbidden to have a wine list and sell alcohol on the premises. You must have both On-License & On-License-Endorsed to have a wine list and allow BYOB, thus calling your restaurant 'fully licensed'.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62247", "title": "Backus–Naur form", "text": "Backus–Naur form\n\nIn computer science, Backus–Naur form or Backus normal form (BNF) is a notation technique for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols. They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.\n\nMany extensions and variants of the original Backus–Naur notation are used; some are exactly defined, including extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) and augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF).\n\nThe idea of describing the structure of language using rewriting rules can be traced back to at least the work of Pāṇini (ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian and a revered scholar in Hinduism who lived sometime between the 7th and 4th century BCE).\nHis notation to describe Sanskrit word structure notation is equivalent in power to that of Backus and has many similar properties.\n\nIn Western society, grammar was long regarded as a subject for teaching, rather than scientific study; descriptions were informal and targeted at practical usage. In the first half of the 20th century, linguists such as Leonard Bloomfield and Zellig Harris started attempts to formalize the description of language, including phrase structure.\n\nMeanwhile, string rewriting rules as formal, abstract systems were introduced and studied by mathematicians such as Axel Thue (in 1914), Emil Post (1920s–40s) and Alan Turing (1936). Noam Chomsky, teaching linguistics to students of information theory at MIT, combined linguistics and mathematics by taking what is essentially Thue's formalism as the basis for the description of the syntax of natural language. He also introduced a clear distinction between generative rules (those of context-free grammars) and transformation rules (1956).\n\nJohn Backus, a programming language designer at IBM, proposed a metalanguage of \"metalinguistic formulas\"\nto describe the syntax of the new programming language IAL, known today as ALGOL 58 (1959). His notation was first used in the ALGOL 60 report.\n\nBNF is a notation for Chomsky's context-free grammars. Apparently, Backus was familiar with Chomsky's work.\n\nAs proposed by Backus, the formula defined \"classes\" whose names are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, codice_1. Each of these names denotes a class of basic symbols.\n\nFurther development of ALGOL led to ALGOL 60. In the committee's 1963 report, Peter Naur called Backus's notation \"Backus normal form\". Donald Knuth argued that BNF should rather be read as \"Backus–Naur form\", as it is \"not a normal form in the conventional sense\",\nunlike, for instance, Chomsky normal form. The name \"Pāṇini Backus form\" was also once suggested in view of the fact that the expansion \"Backus normal form\" may not be accurate, and that Pāṇini had independently developed a similar notation earlier.\nBNF, as described by Peter Naur in the ALGOL 60 report is \"metalinguistic formula\". \"\"Sequences of characters enclosed in the brackets <> represent metalinguistic variables whose values are sequences of symbols. The marks \"::=\" and \"|\" (the latter with the meaning of \"or\") are metalinguistic connectives. Any mark in a formula, which is not a variable or a connective, denotes itself. Juxtaposition of marks or variables in a formula signifies juxtaposition of the sequence denoted.\"\"\n\nAnother example from the ALGOL 60 report illustrates a major difference between the BNF metalanguage and a Chomsky context-free grammar. Metalingustic variables do not require a rule defining their formation. Their formation may simply be described in natural language within the <> brackets. The following ALGOL 60 report section 2.3 comments specification, exemplifies how this works:\n\nFor the purpose of including text among the symbols of a program the following \"comment\" conventions hold:\n\nBy equivalence is here meant that any of the three structures shown in the left column may be replaced, in any occurrence outside of strings, by the symbol shown in the same line in the right column without any effect on the action of the program.\nNaur changed two of Backus's symbols to commonly available characters. The \"::=\" symbol was originally a \":≡\". The \"|\" symbol was originally the word \"\" (with a bar over it).\n\n<expr> ::= <term>|<expr><addop><term>\nThe first symbol of an alternative may be the class being defined, the repetition, as explained by Naur, having the function of specifying that the alternative sequence can recursively begin with a previous alternative and can be repeated any number of times. For example, above codice_3 is defined as a codice_4 followed by any number of codice_5.\n\nIn some later metalanguages such as Schorre's META II the BNF recursive repeat construct is replaced by a sequence operator and target language symbols defined using quoted strings. The codice_6 and codice_7 bracket removed. Mathematical grouping codice_8 were added. The codice_3 rule would appear in META II as\nEXPR = TERM $('+' TERM .OUT('ADD') | '-' TERM .OUT('SUB'));\nThese changes made that META II and its derivative programming languages able to define and extend their own metalanguage. In so doing the ability to use a natural language description, metalinguistic variable, language construct description was lost. Many spin-off metalanguages were inspired by BNF. See META II, TREE-META, and Metacompiler.\n\nA BNF class describes a language construct formation, with formation defined as a pattern or the action of forming the pattern. The class name expr is described in a natural language as a codice_4 followed by a sequence codice_5. A class is an abstraction, we can talk about it independent of its formation. We can talk about term, independent of its definition, as being added or subtracted in expr. We can talk about a term being a specific data type and how an expr is to be evaluated having specific combinations of data types. Or even reordering an expression to group data types and evaluation results of mixed types. The natural-language supplement provided specific details of the language class semantics to be used by a compiler implementation and a programmer writing an ALGOL program. Natural-language description further supplemented the syntax as well. The integer rule is a good example of natural and metalanguage used to describe syntax:\n<integer> ::= <digit>|<integer><digit>\nThere are no specifics on white space in the above. As far as the rule states, we could have space between the digits. In the natural language we complement the BNF metalanguage by explaining that the digit sequence can have no white space between the digits. English is only one of the possible natural languages. Translations of the ALGOL reports were available in many natural languages.\n\nThe origin of BNF is not as important as its impact on programming language development. During the period immediately following the publication of the ALGOL 60 report BNF was the basis of many compiler-compiler systems. Some directly used BNF like \"A Syntax Directed Compiler for ALGOL 60\" developed by Edgar T. Irons and \"A Compiler Building System\" Developed by Brooker and Morris. Others changed it to a programming language. The Schorre Metacompilers made it a programming language with only a few changes. codice_12 became symbol identifiers dropping the enclosing <,> and using quoted strings for symbols of the target language. Arithmetic like grouping provided simplification that removed using classes where grouping was its only value. The META II arithmetic expression rule shows grouping use. Output expressions placed in a META II rule are used to output code and labels in an assembly language. Rules in META II are equivalent to a class definitions in BNF. The Unix utility yacc is based on BNF with code production similar to META II. Though yacc is most commonly used as a parser generator, its roots are obviously BNF. BNF today is one of the oldest computer-related languages still in use.\n\nA BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as\n\nwhere <symbol> is a \"nonterminal\", and the __expression__ consists of one or more sequences of symbols; more sequences are separated by the vertical bar \"|\", indicating a choice, the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left. Symbols that never appear on a left side are \"terminals\". On the other hand, symbols that appear on a left side are \"non-terminals\" and are always enclosed between the pair <>.\n\nThe \"::=\" means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right.\n\nAs an example, consider this possible BNF for a U.S. postal address:\n\n<opt-suffix-part> ::= \"Sr.\" | \"Jr.\" | <roman-numeral> | \"\nThis translates into English as: \n\nNote that many things (such as the format of a first-name, apartment specifier, ZIP-code, and Roman numeral) are left unspecified here. If necessary, they may be described using additional BNF rules.\n\nBNF's syntax itself may be represented with a BNF like the following:\n\nNote that \"\" is the empty string.\n\nThe original BNF did not use quotes as shown in codice_13 rule. This assumes that no whitespace is necessary for proper interpretation of the rule.\n\ncodice_14 represents the appropriate line-end specifier (in ASCII, carriage-return, line-feed or both depending on the operating system). codice_15 and codice_16 are to be substituted with a declared rule's name/label or literal text, respectively.\n\nIn the U.S. postal address example above, the entire block-quote is a syntax. Each line or unbroken grouping of lines is a rule; for example one rule begins with codice_17. The other part of that rule (aside from a line-end) is an expression, which consists of two lists separated by a pipe codice_18. These two lists consists of some terms (three terms and two terms, respectively). Each term in this particular rule is a rule-name.\n\nThere are many variants and extensions of BNF, generally either for the sake of simplicity and succinctness, or to adapt it to a specific application. One common feature of many variants is the use of regular expression repetition operators such as codice_19 and codice_20. The extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) is a common one.\n\nAnother common extension is the use of square brackets around optional items. Although not present in the original ALGOL 60 report (instead introduced a few years later in IBM's PL/I definition), the notation is now universally recognised.\n\nAugmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF) and Routing Backus–Naur form (RBNF) are extensions commonly used to describe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols.\n\nParsing expression grammars build on the BNF and regular expression notations to form an alternative class of formal grammar, which is essentially analytic rather than generative in character.\n\nMany BNF specifications found online today are intended to be human-readable and are non-formal. These often include many of the following syntax rules and extensions:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13659091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13659091", "title": "Biomusic", "text": "Biomusic\n\nBiomusic is a form of experimental music which deals with sounds created or performed by non-humans. The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body (singing or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition).\n\nBiomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer. Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example new-age music uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical soundscapes, and ambient music sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience.\n\nThe incorporation of bird song in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer Olivier Messiaen who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his \"Catalogue d'oiseaux\" (\"Birds catalogue\"), piano (1956–58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, \"Chronochromie\".\n\nIn Western music, recordings of bird songs have also been used in numerous works. The first one is \"Pines of Rome\" (1924) by Ottorino Respighi (the third movement includes the sound of a nightingale recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This was something that had never been done before, and created discussion). A famous one is \"Cantus Arcticus\" (1972) by the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. Subtitled \"Concerto for Birds and Orchestra\" this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland.\n\nA nightingale can be heard on Pink Floyd's \"Cirrus Minor\" (\"More\", 1969) or \"Grantchester Meadows\" (\"Ummagumma\", 1969), a sample of tweeting birds on Laurie Anderson's \"O Superman\" (1981), seagulls within concept album \"L'Opéra du pauvre\" (1983) by French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré. The entire biophony of a soundscape can be heard on the Beaver & Krause 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), \"\"In a Wild Sanctuary\", the first album on the theme of ecology and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration. This work anticipated by 44 years, the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK) premier of \"The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes\",\" composed by Bernie Krause and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, Richard Blackford, performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This, too, features the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time.\n\nCommissioned by the Alonzo King LINES Ballet, an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for \"Biophony,\" composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has been performed worldwide, since.\n\nIt is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or .007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms of the Academy – those considered to be \"musical\" at any given time.\n\nRecorded whale song also frequently inspired 20th century experimental music. One example is in George Crumb’s \"Vox Balaenae\" (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano. However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is \"And God Created Great Whales\", a piece written in 1970 by American composer Alan Hovhaness. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of humpback, bowhead, and killer whales directly into the concert hall. The song \"Il n'y a plus rien\", from French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré's eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the \"Earth Mass (Missa Gaia)\" by Paul Winter (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work.\n\nMusic created by neurofeedback relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An Electroencephalophone (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by Erkki Kurenniemi in the 1960s. American composer David Rosenboom further pioneered work with neurofeedback music as has Brazilian composer Eduardo Reck Miranda. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed.\n\nIn 1975, Grateful Dead associate Ned Lagin released an album of experimental space music entitled \"Seastones\" on Round Records; he described the recording as \"cybernetic biomusic\", emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings. The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the Buchla digital-polyphonic synthesizer.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Pete Townshend collaborated with composer Lawrence Ball and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called The Lifehouse Method, an Internet site where applicants could \"sit\" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website. On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on iTunes called \"Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies\" which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project.\n\nBiomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: music scores created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance).\n\n\"Music from The Body\" is the biomusic soundtrack album to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film \"The Body\", about human biology, narrated by Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Finlay. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between Pink Floyd member Roger Waters and Ron Geesin, and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments.\n\nThe experimental ambient/noise group Tribes of Neurot released an album titled \"Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project\" in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized.\n\nA collaboration album between Breakcore artists Venetian Snares and Hecate entitled Nymphomatriarch was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time-stretched to resemble typical Breakcore samples.\n\nThe Lake, by artist Julie Freeman tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation.\n\nMusicians Caninus, Hatebeak and Lil B have used animals as lead or backing vocalists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9641960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9641960", "title": "Hajong language", "text": "Hajong language\n\nHajong, originally a Tibeto-Burman language, is now considered an Indo-Aryan language with Tibeto-Burman roots. It is spoken by more than 175,000 ethnic Hajongs in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal in India and the Mymensingh District in Bangladesh. It is written in the Eastern Nagari script and the Latin script. It has many Sanskrit loanwords. The Hajongs originally spoke a Tibeto-Burman language, but it was largely mixed with Assamese and other eastern Bengali-Assamese languages.\n\nThe language spoken by the Hajong people, now, may be considered an Indo-Aryan language, this is due to language shift from a Tibeto-Burman language. Old Hajong or Khati Hajong may have been related to Garo or Bodo languages. Words in Hajong like Mao/A'ya'(mother), Bap/Baba (father), Abu (grandmother), Ajo (grandfather), dada (elder brother), ba'i (elder sister), nunu (younger siblings), bunu (brother-in-law), bhuji (sister-in-law), gang (river), gap (colour), dang'o (big), buwai (to plough), khar (soda), dyao (Spirit or deity), jiu (Spirit or life), bato (parrot), etc. are of Tibeto-Burman origin.\nThe Hajong Language varies within the clans because of regional variations. There are five notable clans of the Hajong people.\n\nThe Hajong language is written using both the Latin and the Assamese scripts. Although both of these scripts are in use in India, the Hajongs in Bangladesh expect to use the Bengali script since most education is in Bengali medium. Often, for writing Hajong, the Assamese script is used. In each script, there is one added unique symbol for the close, back, unrounded vowel /ɯ/. In Latin script, it is written with \"â\" or simply \"a' \"or \"e\"'. In Eastern Nagari script with \"\" when it is syllable final.\n\nHajong has 23 consonant phonemes, 8 vowel phonemes, and 2 approximants which have some characteristics of consonants namely /w/ and /j/ which act as diphthongs. The vowel phonemes are /a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, /ɛ/, /o/, /ɔ/ and /ɯ/ (close, back, unrounded). Unlike other Indo-Aryan languages, Hajong language has only one 'i' and 'u'. It is somewhat t ambiguous whether the final vowel is a phoneme or an allophone of [a] in the environment of other close vowels. The extra vowel /ɯ/ is not present in other Indo-Aryan languages, but is typical for the Tibeto-Burman family. Codas \"j\" and \"ch\" in the final position of a syllable turns into an \"s\" sound. The phonology of Hajong includes some vowel harmony and the devoicing of final consonants.For separating syllables the apostrophe sign (') or hyphen (-) is used.\n\nVowels play an important role in changing the meaning of words and the grammatical structure of sentences. Unlike other Indo-Aryan languages like Assamese and Bengali, there is no distinction between longer and shorter /i/ and /u/. Assamese and Bengali distinguish between longer and shorter /i/ and /u/ in writing, but not in pronunciation. The Assamese script lacks some vowels unique to Hajong phonology, which is gradually leading to a vowel shift. And since vowels play an important role in the grammar of this language, the grammatical structure of the language is also changing.\n\nHajong phonology has diphthongs which are iotized vowels with j(y) and w. Diphthongs are usually combinations of i or u with other vowel phonemes. Common examples of diphthongs are ya, as in Dyao which is the combined form of i and a; wa, as in khawa which is the combination of u and a; yuh, as in muh'yuh, combination of i and uh, and wuh, as in tuhwuhi, combination of u and uh.\n\nHajong language primarily has a canonical word order of Subject–object–verb. A subject–object–verb (SOV) language is one in which the subject, object, and verb of a sentence appear or usually appear in that order. Hajong language has a strong tendency to use postpositions rather than prepositions, to place auxiliary verbs after the action verb, to place genitive noun phrases before the possessed noun and to have subordinators appear at the end of subordinate clauses. Hajong is an agglutinative language. Words are often combined and compressed, often there is no pauses between words until the sentence ends. Even though it is considered an Eastern Indo-Aryan language, Hajong does not conjugate verbs in the same way Bengali or Asamiya do, but rather has a simplified system. The case endings in Hajong are also unique compared to other Indo-Aryan languages and may represent affinity with Tibeto Burman languages. The following table is taken from Phillips:\n\nThe genitive and unmarked or accusative cases have two forms; re'/ra and le'/la. For words ending with the vowels /a/, /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ it becomes ra and la and for /i/, /u/, /e/, /o/ and /ɯ/ it becomes re' and le'. The vowels /ɛ/(e) and /ɔ/(o) are used to end interogative sentences, like 'Bhat khase?'(have you taken your food?) and 'Bhat khabo?'(Do you want to eat?); and the vowels /e/(ei) and /o/(ou) are used at the end of declarative sentences, as in 'Bhat khasei.'([I] have taken my food.) and 'Bhat Khabou'([I] will eat.). Adding the suffix be' or ba to interrogative words turn them into indefinite pronouns; for example, kibe' means something, kei'be' means someone, kumaba means somewhere and also ke'ibe', kageba, kunde'be' and kalaba means 'I don't know who/whom/which/who's' respectively in english. Similarly adding the suffix ha and ga to verbs means 'come and (verb)' and 'go and (verd)' respectively; for example, khaha means come and eat, niha means come and take; khaga means go and eat and niga means go and take.\n\nA unique feature of Hajong language is the use of honorifics. When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Unlike Assamese, Bengali, Sylheti and other Indo-Aryan languages, there is no word like আপুনি/আপনি/ꠀꠙꠘꠦ(\"apuni/apni/afne\") to substitute \"you\". Instead Hajong has a different way to indicate supremacy of the other person. For elders and other higher ranking people second person and third person pronouns are never used. One always has to refer an elder with their name or their honorary title. Ending words with 'ge' and 'ha' is also a form of showing respect to the other person.\n\n"}
{"id": "35715338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35715338", "title": "Henry Heusken", "text": "Henry Heusken\n\nHendrick Conrad Joannes Heusken (January 20, 1832 – January 15, 1861) was a Dutch-American interpreter for the first American consulate in Japan, established at Gyokusen-ji in Shimoda, Shizuoka in the late Bakumatsu period. He played an important role in the negotiations for the \"Harris Treaty\" which opened commercial relations between Japan and America, and his assassination caused a minor diplomatic crisis between Japan and the various Western powers. \nHeusken was born in Amsterdam to Joannes Franciscus Heusken, who worked for a soap manufacturer, and Johanna Smit. \nThe death of his father jeopardized his chances of a successful career, so he immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen, changing his name to Henry Conrad Joannes Heusken. However, he found that life in New York City was difficult as well, and was forced to move from job to job based on his contacts with the local Dutch community. In 1855, these same contacts introduced him to Townsend Harris, who had been appointed for the first United States Consul General to Japan, and who was looking for a personal assistant and interpreter in the only European language the Japanese were familiar with.\n\nHeusken departed New York in October 1855 on the , and worked closely with Harris during the negotiations for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. Harris reported to Washington in his official reports that Heusken was kind and amiable in temper, never showing violence to the Japanese, and a universal favorite. However, in his personal diary, Harris complained that Heusken was lackadaisical, stating \"I believe that Mr Heusken only remembers when to eat, drink and sleep – any other affairs rest lightly on his memory\" On other occasions, Harris sought to warn Heusken about his late hours.\n\nAfter the American consulate was relocated to Zenpuku-ji in Edo, Heusken quickly became one of the most publicly visible foreigners among the multiple western delegations in Edo. He frequently rode about the town and castle on horseback, a privilege that was traditionally reserved for the samurai caste. Count Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, head of the Eulenburg Expedition which was the Japan for the purpose of negotiating a commercial treaty between Prussia and Japan similar to treaties secured by the other European powers, requested that Harris loan Heusken to serve as interpreter during the negotiations.\n\nAfter having dinner with Count Eulenburg on the night of 14 January 1861, Heusken was returning to his quarters at Zenpuku-ji accompanied by three mounted officers and four footmen bearing lanterns. The party was suddenly ambushed by seven \"shishi\" from Satsuma Domain, including . Despite his escort, Heusken suffered mortal wounds to both sides of his body in the fight. He mounted a horse and galloped about 200 yards to the American Legation, where he was taken inside and treated. Early in the following morning, he died of his wounds. Harris insisted on an ostentatiously large funeral procession, with the participation of all the foreign missions in Japan, and Heusken was buried at the cemetery at Korin-ji in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nImmediately after the funeral, most western diplomats retreated from Edo to Yokohama and brought ashore greater numbers of French and British soldiers for protection as trade dwindled. The \"yet unpunished and unatoned homicide of Mr. Heusken\" was cited by William H. Seward as a hindering factor in relations between the U.S. and Japan during this period. No one was ever convicted of the murder, and the only reparations made by the government of Japan was a $10,000 payment to Heusken's mother.\n\nHeusken wrote a detailed diary of his time in Japan, which was published in 1964 as \"Japan Journal 1855-1861\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1368349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1368349", "title": "Hiri Motu", "text": "Hiri Motu\n\nHiri Motu, also known as Police Motu, Pidgin Motu, or just Hiri, is an official language of Papua New Guinea. \n\nIt is a simplified version of Motu, of the Austronesian language family. Although it is strictly neither a pidgin nor a creole, it possesses some features of both language types. Phonological and grammatical differences mean that Hiri Motu is not mutually intelligible with Motu. The languages are lexically very similar, and retain a common, albeit simplified, Austronesian syntactical basis.\n\nEven in the areas where it was once well established as a \"lingua franca\", the use of Hiri Motu has been declining in favour of Tok Pisin and English for many years.\n\nThe term Hiri is the name for the traditional trade voyages created an important culture and style of living for the Motu people.\n\n\"Hiri Motu\" became a common language for a police force known as \"Police Motu\".\n\nThe name Hiri Motu came to be during the early 1970s during a conference held by the Department of Information and Extension Services. During this conference, the committee recommended the name \"Hiri Motu\" for several reasons.\n\n\nMotu people are native inhabitants of Papua New Guinea. They live along the southern coastal line of their country. Motu people typically live in dry areas, on the leewardside of the mountain. Where dry seasons are harsh on the people who live there. Traditional Hiri voyages carried prized treasures to the people of the Gulf of Papua.\n\nHiri Motu has two dialects, called \"Austronesian\" and \"Papuan\". Both dialects are in fact Austronesian in both grammar and vocabulary, due to their derivation from Motu; the dialect names refer to the first languages spoken by users of this lingua franca. The \"Papuan\" dialect (also called \"Non-central\") was much more widely spoken in the language's heyday, and was, at least from about 1964, used as the standard for official publications. The \"Austronesian\" (or \"Central\") dialect is closer to Motu in grammar and phonology, and its vocabulary is both more extensive and closer to the original language. For these reasons, it was the prestige dialect, regarded by speakers as more correct.\n\nThe distinction between Motu and its \"Pidgin\" dialects has been described as blurred – forming a continuum from the original \"pure\" language, through the established creoles, to what some writers have suggested constitutes a form of \"Hiri Motu–based pidgin\" used as a contact languages with people who had not fully acquired Hiri Motu.\n\nHiri Motu language consists of now 19 letters in their alphabet: a, e, i, o, u, b, d, g, g, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v.\n\nThe letter \"g\" is meant for two different sounds. One of the sound is similar to the \"g\" in the word go. On the other hand, it is pronounced differently through Point of articulation. This point is located in the throat area and sounds like \"ch\".\n\nThere are 14 consonants in Hiri Motu: b, d, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w. You would pronounce these consonants as you would in English.\n\nThe five vowels are: a, e, i, o, u. All of these are pronounced normally except \"O\" This is an exception to the regular pronunciation, but it's similar to the sound of \"hot\" and the sound of ou in \"fought.\"\n\nDouble vowels: Also known as, Diphthong. Pronounce each vowel with little stress on each syllable, meaning; be smooth when pronouncing double vowels. If you listen to fluent Hiri Motu speakers, they will combine these vowels and it'll sound like one long vowel instead.\n\nOne thing to take note of is when double vowel ai is followed by another vowel, then you would get a small y sound in your pronunciation. For example, the word kaia (knife) is pronounced kai-ya. Another double vowel that can be tricky to pronounce when followed by another vowel is au. In this example, we will use the word maua, meaning box. Maua is pronounced mau-wa. You will hear a slight w when saying words with au, preceding another vowel.\n\nVowel sounds are /i ɛ a ɔ u/.\n\nIn Hiri Motu language, the distinction between \"inclusive\" and \"exclusive\" forms of \"we\" is very important.\n\nTo further explain this, think of a time when you and your friend were thirsty. You would go up to him and say \"We have no water\". When talking to your friend, you are including you and your friend. This \"we\" is inclusive, which is the person you are speaking to. In Hiri Motu this would be \"Ita\" (we, inclusive)\n\nNow explaining \"we\" exclusive using the same example. Now say you and your friend approach a different person and tell him \"we have no water\" this excludes the person who is not thirsty. The word for this is Ai (we, exclusive)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the table above, the 'lau-egu' is placed before the noun, lau-egu boroma (my pig)\n\nTake note that the first half of the word (lau, oi) may be taken out of the word. For example, 'lau-egu' can be shortened to 'egu boroma.\n\nPreposition is a word placed beofre a noun to create a phrase, this is similar to an adjective or adverb. But, in Hiri Motu, such words are placed after the noun, not before it, and can be called postposition.\n\nSome standard postposition in hiri Motu is 'ai' which can meaan in, on, or at.\n\nMaua ai - in the box\n\npata ai - on the table\n\nKonedobu ai - at Konedobu (referring to a location)\n\nTake note: 'maua ai' is merged to 'mauai' and 'pata ai' to 'patai', here are some examples:\n\n\nWord Order\n\nIn Hiri Motu, the word order can be interchangeable with Subject–object–verb (SOV) and Object-subject-verb (OSV). These sentence structure will start with a subject followed by an object, and then ending with a verb and vice versa, object, followed by a subject, and ending with a verb. Notice that the sentence will always end with a verb no matter the word order.\n\nOSV is more common in Hiri Motu.\n\nWith the option of having a SOV and OSV word order, some ambiguity may come about in some cases.\n\nFor example, \"Inai mero boroma badana ia alaia\" can either mean, \"This boy killed a big pig\" or \"A big pig killed this boy\"\n\nTo solve this, a subject marker can be used. In Hiri Motu, the subject marker is \"ese\", and is placed right after the subject of the sentence.\n\nNow it will look like this: \"Inai mero ese boroma badana ia alaia\" (Literally, This boy, a big pig killed him.) - \"A big pig killed this boy\"\n\nHowever, don't over-use this subject marker. Use it only when the sentence would be ambiguous without it. You will never use subject marker in a sentence in which the verb is an Intransitive verb.\n\nTake note that 'hida' always follows the noun it is referring to, while 'edana' always follows it.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnai mero daika? Who is that boy?\n\nInai gau dahaka? What is this thing?\n\nDahaka oi karaia? What are you doing?\n\nStay away from question in the negative form, some of the replies/answers you receive can be confusing.\n\nFor example, If you ask \"la mai lasi?\" (Hasn't he come?) and get a reply \"Oibe\" (yes), that can mean \"Yes, he hasn't come yet\". If the person has arrived, they will answer, \"Lasi, ia mai\" meaning (No, he has come). This can be a little tricky at times, so it's best to stray away from negative form questions.\n\neiava - or\n\nbona - and\n\nbema - if\n\nbena, vadeani - then\n\na, to - but\n\nbadina - because\n\nExamples:\n\n\nWhen \"to be\" is used as a connecting word, the parts \"na\" and \"be\" can be used, but it is not needed for this case.\n\nFor example: 'Ia be mero namona' or 'la na mero namona (He is a good boy)\n\nNote that there is no Hiri Motu verb form of \"to have\" in the sense of possession, like in the sentence 'I have a dog'\n\nIn true Hiri Motu, a local would say \"Lau na mai egu sisia\" for \"I have a dog\", (literally, 'I with my dog'.) There are no standards for these expression forms in Hiri Motu.\n\nta=one\n\nrua=two\n\ntoi=three\n\nhani=four\n\nima=five\n\nThe number system in Hiri Motu language goes all they way to 100,000. Many of the numbers in Hiri Motu are Polysyllabic, meaning they have many syllables. Which means that larger numbers are long words.\n\nFor example, 99 in Hiri Motu is, taurahanita ahui taurahanita. Most Papuans know the English number system and can use that instead.\n\nThe language has a history long pre-dating European contact; it developed among members of the Hiri trade cycle (mainly in sago and clay pots) between the Motu people and their neighbours on the southeast coast of the island of New Guinea. In early European colonial days, the use of Hiri Motu was spread due to its adoption by the Royal Papuan Constabulary (hence the name \"Police Motu\"). By the early 1960s, Hiri Motu had probably reached its widest use, being the normal lingua franca of a large part of the country. It was the first language for many people whose parents came from different language groups (typically the children of policemen and other public servants).\n\nSince the early 1970s, if not earlier, the use of Hiri Motu as a day-to-day lingua franca in its old \"range\" has been gradually declining in favour of English and Tok Pisin. Today its speakers tend to be elderly, and concentrated in Central and Gulf provinces. Reflecting this situation, younger speakers of the \"parent language\" (Motu proper) tend to be unfamiliar with Hiri Motu, and few of them understand or speak it well, which was certainly not the case a generation or two ago.\n\n(1968) Chatterton, Percy.

{"id": "182013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182013", "title": "Mayan languages", "text": "Mayan languages\n\nThe Mayan languages form a language family spoken in Mesoamerica and northern Central America. Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million Maya peoples, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognizes eight more within its territory.\n\nThe Mayan language family is one of the best-documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from the Proto-Mayan language, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Ch'olan-Tzeltalan branches.\n\nMayan languages form part of the Mesoamerican language area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use relational nouns instead of prepositions to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess grammatical and typological features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of ergativity in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special word class of \"positionals\" which is typical of all Mayan languages.\n\nDuring the pre-Columbian era of Mesoamerican history, some Mayan languages were written in the logo-syllabic Maya script. Its use was particularly widespread during the Classic period of Maya civilization (c. 250–900). The surviving corpus of over 10,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper codices, combined with the rich postcolonial literature in Mayan languages written in the Latin script, provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas.\n\nMayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called Proto-Mayan or, in K'iche' Maya, \"Nab'ee Maya' Tzij\" (\"the old Maya Language\"). The Proto-Mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of central Guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where Q'anjobalan is spoken today. The earliest proposal was that of which identified the Chiapas-Guatemalan highlands as the likely \"cradle\" of Mayan languages was published by the German antiquarian and scholar Karl Sapper. Terrence Kaufman and John Justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-Mayan language.\n\nAccording to the prevailing classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the Yucatán Peninsula. Speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and moved south into the Chiapas highlands, they came into contact with speakers of Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.\n\nIn the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), a number of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In the case of the Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).\n\nDuring the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages. The split between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, that is, the Yucatán Peninsula) and Proto-Ch'olan (in the south, that is, the Chiapas highlands and Petén Basin) had already occurred by the Classic period, when most extant Maya inscriptions were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the Maya sites of the time, and both are commonly referred to as \"Classic Maya language\". Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence for at least five different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an Eastern Ch'olan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a Western Ch'olan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on, a Yukatekan variety found in the texts from the Yucatán Peninsula, a Tzeltalan variety found in the Western Lowlands (i.e. Toniná, Pomona), and possibly a highland Maya language belonging to K'ichean major within texts painted on Nebaj ceramics. The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite.\n\nStephen Houston, John Robertson and David Stuart have suggested that the specific variety of Ch'olan found in the majority of Southern Lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub \"Classic Ch'olti'an\", the ancestor language of the modern Ch'orti' and Ch’olti’ languages. They propose that it originated in western and south-central Petén Basin, and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests. However, Mora-Marín has argued that traits shared by Classic Lowland Maya and the Ch'olti'an languages are retentions rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Ch'olan in fact post-dates the classic period. The language of the classical lowland inscriptions then would have been proto-Ch'olan.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization of Central America, all indigenous languages were eclipsed by Spanish, which became the new prestige language. The use of Mayan languages in many important domains of society, including administration, religion and literature, came to an end. Yet the Maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others, and perhaps for this reason, many Maya communities still retain a high proportion of monolingual speakers. The Maya area is now dominated by the Spanish language. While a number of Mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered, others remain quite viable, with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society.\n\nAs Maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread, the Mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as Maya, the heirs of the Maya civilization.\n\nThe word \"Maya\" was likely derived from the postclassical Yucatán city of Mayapan; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the Yucatán Peninsula. The broader meaning of \"Maya\" now current, while defined by linguistic relationships, is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits. Most Mayans identify first and foremost with a particular ethnic group, e.g. as \"Yucatec\" or \"K'iche'\"; but they also recognize a shared Maya kinship. Language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship. Fabri writes: \"The term Maya is problematic because Maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity. Maya, rather, has become a strategy of self-representation for the Maya movements and its followers. The Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG) finds twenty-one distinct Mayan languages.\" This pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different Mayan languages, some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language. But, given that the term \"dialect\" has been used by some with racialist overtones in the past, as scholars made a spurious distinction between Amerindian \"dialects\" and European \"languages\", the preferred usage in Mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages.\n\nIn Guatemala, matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the Mayan languages are governed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 peace accords, it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.\n\nThe Mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.\n\nA wide range of proposals have tried to link the Mayan family to other language families or isolates, but none is generally supported by linguists. Examples include linking Mayan with the Uru–Chipaya languages, Mapuche, the Lencan languages, Purépecha and Huave. Mayan has also been included in various Hokan and Penutian hypotheses. The linguist Joseph Greenberg included Mayan in his highly controversial Amerind hypothesis, which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence.\n\nWriting in 1997, Lyle Campbell, an expert in Mayan languages and historical linguistics, argued that the most promising proposal is the \"Macro-Mayan\" hypothesis, which posits links between Mayan, the Mixe–Zoque languages and the Totonacan languages, but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis. In 2015, Campbell noted that recent, yet unpublished, evidence uncovered by David Mora-Marin strengthened the case for a relationship between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages, although he did not yet consider it conclusive.\n\nThe Mayan family consists of thirty languages. Typically, these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups (Yucatean, Huastecan, Ch'olan-Tseltalan, Q'anjob'alan, Mamean, and K'ichean).\nThe Mayan language family is extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established, except for some minor unresolved differences.\n\nOne point still at issue is the position of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.\n\nStudies estimate that Mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people. Most of them live in Guatemala where depending on estimates 40%-60% of the population speaks a Mayan language. In Mexico the Mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010, whereas the Belizean speaker population figures around 30,000.\n\nThe Ch'olan languages were formerly widespread throughout the Maya area, but today the language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 in the state of Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in the extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.\n\nThe closest relatives of the Ch'olan languages are the languages of the Tzeltalan branch, Tzotzil and Tzeltal, both spoken in Chiapas by large and stable or growing populations (265,000 for Tzotzil and 215,000 for Tzeltal). Tzeltal has tens of thousands of monolingual speakers.\n\nQ'anjob'al is spoken by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan speakers in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its close proximity to the Mexican border, was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.\n\nChuj is spoken by 40,000 people in Huehuetenango, and by 9,500 people, primarily refugees, over the border in Mexico, in the municipality of La Trinitaria, Chiapas, and the villages of Tziscau and Cuauhtémoc. Tojolab'al is spoken in eastern Chiapas by 36,000 people.\n\nThe Quichean–Mamean languages and dialects, with two sub-branches and three subfamilies, are spoken in the Guatemalan highlands.\n\nQ'eqchi' (sometimes spelled Kekchi), which constitutes its own sub-branch within Quichean–Mamean, is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern Petén, Izabal and Alta Verapaz departments of Guatemala, and also in Belize by 9,000 speakers. In El Salvador it is spoken by 12,000 as a result of recent migrations.\n\nThe Uspantek language, which also springs directly from the Quichean–Mamean node, is native only to the Uspantán \"municipio\" in the department of El Quiché, and has 3,000 speakers.\n\nWithin the Quichean sub-branch K'iche' (Quiché), the Mayan language with the largest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, \"Popol Vuh\", is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called Classical K'iche' (or Quiché). The K'iche' culture was at its pinnacle at the time of the Spanish conquest. Q'umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del Quiché, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two \"municipios\" of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tz'utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the K'ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El Quiché department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.\n\nThe largest language in the Mamean sub-branch is Mam, spoken by 478,000 people in the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango. Awakatek is the language of 20,000 inhabitants of central Aguacatán, another municipality of Huehuetenango. Ixil (possibly three different languages) is spoken by 70,000 in the \"Ixil Triangle\" region of the department of El Quiché. Tektitek (or Teko) is spoken by over 6,000 people in the municipality of Tectitán, and 1,000 refugees in Mexico. According to the Ethnologue the number of speakers of Tektitek is growing.\n\nThe Poqom languages are closely related to Core Quichean, with which they constitute a Poqom-K'ichean sub-branch on the Quichean–Mamean node. Poqomchi' is spoken by 90,000 people in Purulhá, Baja Verapaz, and in the following municipalities of Alta Verapaz: Santa Cruz Verapaz, San Cristóbal Verapaz, Tactic, Tamahú and Tucurú. Poqomam is spoken by around 49,000 people in several small pockets in Guatemala.\n\nYucatec Maya (known simply as \"Maya\" to its speakers) is the most commonly spoken Mayan language in Mexico. It is currently spoken by approximately 800,000 people, the vast majority of whom are to be found on the Yucatán Peninsula. It remains common in Yucatán and in the adjacent states of Quintana Roo and Campeche.\n\nThe other three Yucatecan languages are Mopan, spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in Belize; Itza', an extinct or moribund language from Guatemala's Petén Basin; and Lacandón or Lakantum, also severely endangered with about 1,000 speakers in a few villages on the outskirts of the Selva Lacandona, in Chiapas.\n\nWastek (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) is spoken in the Mexican states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí by around 110,000 people. It is the most divergent of modern Mayan languages. Chicomuceltec was a language related to Wastek and spoken in Chiapas that became extinct some time before 1982.\n\nProto-Mayan (the common ancestor of the Mayan languages as reconstructed using the comparative method) has a predominant CVC syllable structure, only allowing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries. Most Proto-Mayan roots were \"monosyllabic\" except for a few disyllabic nominal roots.\nDue to subsequent vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at both ends of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a \"tonal language\", based on the fact that four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.\n\nThe classification of Mayan languages is based on changes shared between groups of languages. For example, languages of the western group (such as Huastecan, Yucatecan and Ch'olan) all changed the Proto-Mayan phoneme * into , some languages of the eastern branch retained (K'ichean), and others changed it into or, word-finally, (Mamean). The shared innovations between Huastecan, Yucatecan and Ch'olan show that they separated from the other Mayan languages before the changes found in other branches had taken place.\n\nThe palatalized plosives and are not found in any of the modern families. Instead they are reflected differently in different branches, allowing a reconstruction of these phonemes as palatalized plosives. In the eastern branch (Chujean-Q'anjobalan and Ch'olan) they are reflected as and . In Mamean they are reflected as and and in Quichean as and . Yucatec stands out from other western languages in that its palatalized plosives are sometimes changed into and sometimes .\n\nThe Proto-Mayan velar nasal * is reflected as in the eastern branches (Quichean–Mamean), in Q'anjobalan, Ch'olan and Yucatecan, in Huastecan, and only conserved as in Chuj and Jakaltek.\n\nVowel quality is typically classified as having monophthongal vowels. In traditionally diphthongized contexts, Mayan languages will realize the V-V sequence by inserting a hiatus-breaking glottal stop or glide insertion between the vowels. Some K'ichean-branch languages have exhibited developed diphthongs from historical long vowels, by breaking /e:/ and /o:/.\n\nThe morphology of Mayan languages is simpler than that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, the person of the subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.\n\nProto-Mayan is thought to have had a basic verb–object–subject word order with possibilities of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.\n\nIn many Mayan languages, counting requires the use of numeral classifiers, which specify the class of items being counted; the numeral cannot appear without an accompanying classifier. Some Mayan languages, such as Kaqchikel, do not use numeral classifiers. Class is usually assigned according to whether the object is animate or inanimate or according to an object's general shape. Thus when counting \"flat\" objects, a different form of numeral classifier is used than when counting round things, oblong items or people. In some Mayan languages such as Chontal, classifiers take the form of affixes attached to the numeral; in others such as Tzeltal, they are free forms. Jakaltek has both numeral classifiers and noun classifiers, and the noun classifiers can also be used as pronouns.\n\nThe meaning denoted by a noun may be altered significantly by changing the accompanying classifier. In Chontal, for example, when the classifier \"-tek\" is used with names of plants it is understood that the objects being enumerated are whole trees. If in this expression a different classifier, \"-ts'it\" (for counting long, slender objects) is substituted for \"-tek\", this conveys the meaning that only sticks or branches of the tree are being counted:\n\nThe morphology of Mayan nouns is fairly simple: they inflect for number (plural or singular), and, when possessed, for person and number of their possessor. Pronominal possession is expressed by a set of possessive prefixes attached to the noun, as in Kaqchikel \"ru-kej\" \"his/her horse\". Nouns may furthermore adopt a special form marking them as possessed. For nominal possessors, the possessed noun is inflected as possessed by a third-person possessor, and followed by the possessor noun, e.g. Kaqchikel \"ru-kej ri achin\" \"the man's horse\" (literally \"his horse the man\"). This type of formation is a main diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area and recurs throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nMayan languages often contrast alienable and inalienable possession by varying the way the noun is (or is not) marked as possessed. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts inalienably possessed ' \"my photo (in which I am depicted)\" with alienably possessed ' \"my photo (taken by me)\". The prefix \"we-\" marks the first person singular possessor in both, but the absence of the \"-e\" possessive suffix in the first form marks inalienable possession.\n\nMayan languages which have prepositions at all normally have only one. To express location and other relations between entities, use is made of a special class of \"relational nouns\". This pattern is also recurrent throughout Mesoamerica and is another diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Mayan most relational nouns are metaphorically derived from body parts so that \"on top of\", for example, is expressed by the word for \"head\".\n\nRelational nouns are possessed by the constituent that is the reference point of the relation, and the relational noun names the relation. Thus in Mayan one would say \"the mountain's head\" (literally \"its head the mountain\") to mean \"on (top of) the mountain\". Thus in the Classical Quiché of the \"Popol Vuh\" we read \"u-wach ulew\" \"on the earth\" (literally \"its face the earth\").\n\nMayan languages are ergative in their alignment. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.\n\nMayan languages have two sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set B) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They can also be used with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.\nAnother set (set A) is used to indicate the person of subjects of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, but only in the incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).\nIn addition to subject and object (agent and patient), the Mayan verb has affixes signalling aspect, tense, and mood as in the following example:\n\nTense systems in Mayan languages are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. Aspect systems are normally more prominent. Mood does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead intertwined with the tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.\n\nMayan languages tend to have a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had at least one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).\n\nIn Mayan languages, words are usually viewed as belonging to one of four classes: verbs, statives, adjectives, and nouns.\n\nStatives are a class of predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose syntactic properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.\n\nPositionals, a class of roots characteristic of, if not unique to, the Mayan languages, form stative adjectives and verbs (usually with the help of suffixes) with meanings related to the position or shape of an object or person. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots:\n\nIn these three Q'anjob'al sentences,the positionals are \"telan\" (\"something large or cylindrical lying down as if having fallen\"), \"woqan\" (\"person sitting on a chairlike object\"), and \"xoyan\" (\"curled up like a rope or snake\").\n\nCompounding of noun roots to form new nouns is commonplace; there are also many morphological processes to derive nouns from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive derivational affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.\n\nSome Mayan languages allow incorporation of noun stems into verbs, either as direct objects or in other functions. However, there are few affixes with adverbial or modal meanings.\n\nAs in other Mesoamerican languages, there is widespread metaphorical use of roots denoting body parts, particularly to form locatives and relational nouns such as Tzeltal/Tzotzil \"ti' na\" \"door\" (lit. \"mouth of house\"), or Kaqchikel \"chi ru-pam\" \"inside\" (lit. \"mouth its-stomach\").\n\nA number of loanwords of Mayan or potentially Mayan origins are found in other languages, principally Spanish, English, and some neighboring Mesoamerican languages. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from Spanish.\n\nA Mayan loanword is \"cigar\". is Mayan for \"tobacco\" and means \"to smoke tobacco leaves\". This is the most likely origin for cigar and thus cigarette.\n\nThe English word \"hurricane\", which is a borrowing from the Spanish word is considered to be related to the name of Maya storm deity Jun Raqan. However, it is probable that the word passed into European languages from a Cariban language or Taíno.\n\n The complex script used to write Mayan languages in pre-Columbian times and known today from engravings at several Maya archaeological sites has been deciphered almost completely. The script is a mix between a logographic and a syllabic system.\n\nIn colonial times Mayan languages came to be written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).\n\nThe pre-Columbian Maya civilization developed and used an intricate and fully functional writing system, which is the only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from one or more of these earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.\n\nIn the course of the deciphering of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or \"graphemes\") can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe would have been able to write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.\n\nAt least two major Mayan languages have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, with at least one other language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as Classic Maya predominates in these texts, particularly in the Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. This language is most closely related to the Ch'olan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Ch'ol, Ch'orti' and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving Yucatec language) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the Yucatán Peninsula region and from a later period. Three of the four extant Maya codices are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the Chiapas highlands region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil. Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.\n\nUse and knowledge of the Maya script continued until the 16th century Spanish conquest at least. Bishop Diego de Landa Calderón of the Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to convert the locals to Christianity and away from what he perceived as pagan idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his \"Relación de las cosas de Yucatán\".\n\nColonial orthography is marked by the use of \"c\" for /k/ (always hard, as in \"cic\" /kiik/), \"k\" for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, \"h\" for /x/, and \"tz\" for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart sometimes for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in \"uuc\" /u’uk/), the use of \"u\" for /w/, as in \"uac\" /wak/, and the variable use of \"z, ç, s\" for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.\n\nIn ca. 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented distinctive letters for ejectives in the Mayan languages of Guatemala, the \"tresillo\" and \"cuatrillo\" (and derivatives). These were used in all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in Otomi (\"pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu\"), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only the stem of 𝕡 is doubled, but that is not supported by Unicode.\n\nA ligature ꜩ for \"tz\" is used alongside ꜭ and ꜫ. The Yucatec convention of \"dz\" for is retained in Maya family names such as Dzib.\n\nSince the colonial period, practically all Maya writing has used a Latin alphabet. Formerly these were based largely on the Spanish alphabet and varied between authors, and it is only recently that standardized alphabets have been established. The first widely accepted alphabet was created for Yucatec Maya by the authors and contributors of the \"Diccionario Maya Cordemex\", a project directed by Alfredo Barrera Vásquez and first published in 1980. Subsequently, the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (known by its Spanish acronym ALMG), founded in 1986, adapted these standards to 22 Mayan languages (primarily in Guatemala). The script is largely phonemic, but abandoned the distinction between the apostrophe for ejective consonants and the glottal stop, so that ejective and the non-ejective sequence (previously \"t' \"and \"t7\") are both written \"t'.\" Other major Maya languages, primarily in the Mexican state of Chiapas, such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Ch'ol, and Tojolab'al, are not generally included in this reformation, and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the Chiapan \"State Center for Indigenous Language, Art, and Literature\" (CELALI), which for instance writes \"ts\" rather than \"tz\" (thus Tseltal and Tsotsil). In Mexico, names of archaeological sites and other items of historical record retain the colonial spellings, rather than the revised orthography.\n\nOne element of the revised orthographies that is not widely accepted, especially outside the Guatemalan context, is the conversion of proper nouns (such as names of archaeological sites, modern settlements, and cultures). Thus, the \"Cordemex\" continues to use the term \"Yucatán\" (rather than \"Yukatan\") in its preface, despite the fact that its orthography does not utilize a \"c\", and most scholarly archaeological texts continue to print the original spellings for archaeological sites and cultures that have been canonized in the literature over the centuries.\n\nFrom the classic language to the present day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages of time and the campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.\n\nShortly after the Spanish conquest, the Mayan languages began to be written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous \"Popol Vuh\", a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical Quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The \"Título de Totonicapán\" and the 17th century theatrical work the \"Rabinal Achí\" are other notable early works in K'iche', the latter in the Achí dialect. The \"Annals of the Cakchiquels\" from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the \"Popol Vuh\". The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of Chilam Balam are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions. The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the Songs of Dzitbalche by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.\n\nIn addition to these singular works, many early grammars of indigenous languages, called \"artes\", were written by priests and friars. Languages covered by these early grammars include Kaqchikel, Classical Quiché, Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Yucatec. Some of these came with indigenous-language translations of the Catholic catechism.\n\nWhile Mayan peoples continued to produce a rich oral literature in the postcolonial period (after 1821), very little written literature was produced in this period.\n\nBecause indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of Mexico and Guatemala after independence, Mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages, learning to read and write in Spanish, if at all. However, since the establishment of the Cordemex and the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (1986), native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in Mayan languages. Notable among this new generation is the K'iche' poet Humberto Ak'ab'al, whose works are often published in dual-language Spanish/K'iche' editions, as well as K'iche' scholar Luis Enrique Sam Colop (1955–2011) whose translations of the Popol Vuh into both Spanish and modern K'iche' achieved high acclaim.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4516742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4516742", "title": "Media Lengua", "text": "Media Lengua\n\nMedia Lengua, also known as \"Chaupi-shimi\", \"Chaupi-lengua\", \"Chaupi-Quichua\", \"Quichuañol\", \"Chapu-shimi\" or \"llanga-shimi\", (roughly translated to \"\"half language\" or \"in-between language\"\") is a mixed language with Spanish vocabulary and Kichwa grammar, most conspicuously in its morphology. In terms of vocabulary, almost all lexemes (89%), including core vocabulary, are of Spanish origin and appear to conform to Kichwa phonotactics. Media Lengua is one of the few widely acknowledged examples of a \"bilingual mixed language\" in both the conventional and narrow linguistic sense because of its split between roots and suffixes. Such extreme and systematic borrowing is only rarely attested, and Media Lengua is not typically described as a variety of either Kichwa or Spanish. Arends et al., list two languages subsumed under the name \"Media Lengua\": Salcedo Media Lengua and Media Lengua of Saraguro. The northern variety of Media Lengua, found in the province of Imbabura, is commonly referred to as Imbabura Media Lengua and more specifically, the dialect varieties within the province are known as Pijal Media Lengua and Angla Media Lengua.\n\nMedia Lengua was first documented in Salcedo, Cotopaxi about 100 km south of Quito, Ecuador, by Dutch linguist Pieter Muysken during fieldwork on Ecuadorian Kichwa. During Muysken's surveys of the language, he also described other highly relexified varieties of Kichwa, including Amazonian Pidgin, Kichwa-Spanish interlanguage, Saraguro Media Lengua, and Catalangu. A 2011 investigation of Salcedo Media Lengua, however, suggests that the language is no longer spoken by the locals in and around Salcedo Canton. Little is known about the current status of the other relexified varieties of Kichwa described by Muysken. Several investigations from 2005, 2008, and 2011, however, show that a variety of Media Lengua is currently being spoken in the northern province of Imbabura. The investigations estimate that Imbabura Media Lengua is spoken by 2,600 people, 600 in the community of Pijal aged 35 and roughly 2,000 in and around the community of Angla, typically 25–45 years of age, making Media Lengua an endangered language and moribund in Pijal. The variety of Media Lengua that is spoken in Pijal appears to have emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and had its first generation of native speakers in the 1910s. Pijal Media Lengua then spread to the nearby community of Angla in the 1950s and the 1960s through intercommunity marriages and commerce. The current status of Media Lengua in Angla appears to be slightly healthier than in Pijal with the Angla variety having been passed on, to an extent, to the 2008 generation of schoolaged children.\n\nSeveral theories exist concerning the origins of Media Lengua. According to Muysken, Salcedo Media Lengua emerged through ethnic self-identification for indigenous populations, who no longer identified with either the rural Kichwa or the urban Spanish cultures. Gómez-Rendón claims Angla Media Lengua arose through prolonged contact between the Kichwa-speaking indigenous populations with the Mestizo Spanish speaking populations. Dikker believes Media Lengua was created by men who left their native communities to work in urban Spanish speaking areas. When the men returned to the communities, they had acquired a fluent level of Spanish and had been using Kichwa infrequently. Media Lengua then served as a link between the older monolingual Kichwa-speaking generation and younger monolingual Spanish speaking generations. Finally, Stewart claims that Media Lengua was either brought to Pijal from Salcedo or vice versa. He bases these claims on the \"striking resemblance\" between the Pijal and Salcedo varieties at both the phonological and the morphological level. The claim also includes testimonies of a large migration from Cotopaxi to Pijal at the beginning of the 20th century, which can be seen in the many Cotopaxi surnames in community.\nMost researchers agree, however, that Media Lengua developed linguistically through various processes of lexification (relexification, adlexification and translexification) in a relatively short period of time.\n\nJarrín (2014) investigated sociolinguistic aspects of Media Lengua in the communities of Angla, Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo in the Province of Imbabura. With a series of surveys and interviews regarding language attitude and language usage, a complex linguistic environment emerged which changes from community to community. In the more urban communities of Angla and Casco-Valenzuela, Media Lengua is preferred and Quichua appears to be losing ground. In the more rural communities of Uscha and El Topo, Kichwa is still preferred and the usage of Media Lengua is frowned upon. Jarrín (2014) also reports that there are also cases of children acquiring Media Lengua from their parents and grandparents, which is not the case in Pijal. In Pijal speakers of Media Lengua are typically aged 35 and above, those aged 20–35 typically have a passive knowledge of the language, and speakers aged 20 and younger are often monolingual in Spanish. Estimates of the number of speakers vary widely. In Pijal, there is an estimated 300 to 500 speakers while in the communities of Angla, Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo, there may be as many 2000+ speakers.\n\nWords of Spanish origin often appear to conform to Kichwa phonotactics. However, voiced obstruents, which exist phonologically only as stops in a post-sonorant environment in Kichwa, appear phonemically as minimal pairs or near minimal pairs in Media Lengua through Spanish borrowings:\n\nKichwa [-sonorant] → [+voice]/[+sonorant]___\n\nAnother phonological difference between Media Lengua and Kichwa is that Media Lengua often does not take into account the voicing rule.\nHowever, in certain instances, especially regarding verbal inflections, the Kichwa voicing rule is preserved.\n\nOther Spanish borrowings\n\nKichwa influences\n\n\nA number of lexical items in both the Salcedo and Imbabura varieties maintain Spanish preservations from the Colonial period; most notably word initial /x/. \nArchaic Spanish preservation of \n\n(*)=reconstruction\n\nIPA Chart (Imbabura Media Lengua) \nCommon allophones are marked in brackets([]) and affricates are presented under the place of final articulation.\nThere are several competing views regarding the number and types of vowels in Media Lengua. One theory suggests Salcedo Media Lengua, like Kichwa, maintains three vowels [i], [u] and [a], with the occasional Spanish preservation of [e] and [o] in names, interjections and in stressed positions. Under that theory, all other Spanish borrowings assimilate to the Kichwa system. Another theory suggests that Imbabura Media Lengua passes through a three-step process of assimilation and words can maintain Spanish phonotactics [kabeza] \"cabeza\" 'head', undergo partial assimilation [kabisa] \"cabeza\" or (3) undergo complete assimilation [kabiza] \"cabeza\". This theory also suggests that high-frequency words also tend to undergo complete assimilation, but low-frequency do not. Finally, acoustic evidence supports the claim that Media Lengua could be dealing with as many as eight vowels: Spanish-derived [i, a, u], which exist as extreme mergers with Kichwa-derived [i, a, u], and Spanish-derived [e] and [o], which exist as partial mergers with Kichwa [i] and [u], respectively.\n\nSpanish diphthongs also exist with various degrees of assimilation in both Media Lengua dialects. The diphthong /ue/ is sometimes pronounced as /u/, /wi/ or /i/; Spanish /ui/ is pronounced /u/; Spanish /ie/ is pronounced as /i/; and Spanish /ai/, is maintained from Kichwa.\n\nThere is also evidence of sonorant devoicing between voiceless obstruents, which affects the realization of pitch accents that fall on devoiced syllables (see the following section).\n\n[+sonorant]→[-voice]/[-sonorant] ___ [-sonorant]<br>\n[-voice][-voice]\n\n(1) \"Vosteka tuyu casapika\".<br>\n[bos.te.ka tu.ju ka.za.pika]→[bos.te̥.ka tu.ju ka.za.pi̥ka]<br> \n\"[What do] you [have planted] at your house?\"\n\nAccording to Muysken (1997), like Kichwa, stress is penultimate in Media Lengua. Stewart (2015), referring to stress as \"pitch accent\" (PA), provides a similar analysis pointing towards the realization of a low-high pitch accent (L+H*) taking place at the prosodic word level on, leading up to, or just after the penultimate syllable of a word. In the majority of a cases, an L+H* pitch accent on the penultimate syllable describes word level prosody (see example 1).\n\n(1)<br>\n\"Papasuka wawakunawanmi colerahurka\".<br>\n\"Father was angry with the children.\"\n\nIn certain cases, however, a simple high (H*) may appear when the PA follows the penultimate syllable of a disyllabic word or when a voiceless onset appears in the penultimate syllable (see example 2). In both cases, Stewart (2015) suggests that is caused since there is no material to bear the preaccental rise, which would otherwise be realized as a typical L+H* PA.\n\n(2)<br>\n\"Bela quemajun\".<br>\n\"The candle is burning.\"\n\nMedia Lengua also appears to mark emphasis at the prosodic word level with a substantial increase in pitch frequency on one or more words in an utterance (L+^H*) (see example 3). Pitch accents may also appear in a stair step-like pattern in utterances containing reduplication where the low (L) on the second instance of the reduplicated pair is often undershot. In the first instance of the reduplicated pair, a standard L+H* appears while in the second instances an emphatic L+^H% PA takes place where the L may be undershot (see example 4).\n\n(3)<br>\n\"Y alotro diaka vuelta otro bastanteta llevashpa, escondidito mio mamamanta llevashpa inkarkachi\".<br>\n\"And on the following day, we would go bringing another bunch [of beans] hidden from my mom.\"\n\n(4)<br>\n\"Diaymanta wachu wachu buscashka dezin uno cañata\".<br>\n\"So, they say she looked all over the plot of land, for a stick that is.\"\n\nStewart (2015) also describes instances of intermediate boundaries appearing as a single low tone (L-). These are often observed in standard content questions (wh-questions) following the utterance-initial question constituent or in some cases after words containing an emphatic PA (see example 5). There is also evidence of intermediate boundary tones in the form of pitch restart which take place in listing intonation just before the listing of items begins.\n\n(5)<br>\n\"Quienpatak ese pelota?\"<br>\n\"Whose ball is that?\"\n\nThe intonational phrase in Media Lengua (the highest level unit within the autosegmental-metrical framework ) is marked by a low boundary tone (L%) at the end of nearly every utterance (see examples 1, 2, 3, and 5). An exception to the configuration can be found in what Stewart (2015) refers to as \"clarifying\" utterances, which are marked with a high boundary tone (H%) (see example 4). Clarifying utterances in Media Lengua are used in three typical scenarios: (1) to clarify that a topic within a conversation is shared by those speaking, (2) to provide information which was accidentally left out of the main clause, and (3) provide the listener with additional information.\n\nMedia Lengua, like Kichwa, is a highly agglutinative language. Its normal sentence order is SOV (subject–object–verb). There are a large number of suffix changes both in the overall significance of words and their meanings. Of the 63 particles in Kichwa, Imbabura Media Lengua makes use of 49; an estimated 80% of the original Kichwa morphemes. The derivation and infectional particles appear to be in complete functioning order in the same way they are found in Ecuadorian Kichwa.\n\n\"Jilana\" in Media Lengua, Spanish, and English: \n\n\n"}

The ideal here is bliss experienced in absolute withdrawal from the object and from the outside world. Narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness. Narcissistic elation is characteristic of an object relationship that is played out, in its negative version, as a state of splendid isolation, and, in its positive version, as a desperate quest for fusion with the other, for a mirror-image relationship. It involves a return to paradise lost and all that is attached to this idea: fusion, self-love, megalomania, omnipotence, immortality, and invulnerability. After birth, the infant continues to enjoy the protonarcissistic existence as before, and this is reinforced by the fact that people around it, in particular the mother, meet all its needs and wishes. This state of illusion is soon compromised, however, as inevitable frustrations begin to occur. The traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence, nevertheless provide a source of psychic energy that will remain active throughout life. The child, and later the adult, will seek to preserve and return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy. Perhaps, after all, what fascinated Narcissus was the sight—beyond his own reflection—of the amniotic water, and the deep, regressive promise of happiness that it held out. Following an initial period of elation known as the \"honeymoon\", psychoanalytic treatment must succeed in bringing together the narcissistic elements of the self by integrating them into interpretations of reality: ego-libido and object-libido must arrive at a satisfactory compromise.\n\nFreud had used the term oceanic feeling to describe 'an early phase of ego-feeling...the oceanic feeling, which might seek something like the restoration of limitless narcissism'.\n\nGrunberger and André Green have subsequently 'traced narcissism to pre-natal states of elation, making it biological and drive-driven'. Building on 'the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus', Grunberger therefore considered that 'narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness'.\n\nFreud also explored how 'in cases of mania the ego and ego ideal have fused together...in a mood of triumph and self-satisfaction'. Grunberger considered such states as reaching back to the primal narcissistic elation, and as drawing on 'traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence'.\n\nBuilding on his work, Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel claims that 'it is indeed therefore narcissistic elation, the meeting of ego and ideal, that dissolves the superego'. One may consider in general that 'the feeling of triumph...brings with it \"oceanic\" feelings, because it represents reunion with the omnipotent one'.\n\nWith respect to a slightly later phase of early development, Margaret Mahler 'describes the practising junior toddler's omnipotent exhilaration (excitement) and narcissistic elation (joy)' at learning to walk—the 'tremendously exhilarating, truly dramatic effect that upright locomotion had'—noting however that 'it is precisely at the point where the child is at the peak of his delusion of omnipotence...that his narcissism is particularly vulnerable to deflation'.\n\nIn the wake of the toddler's new achievement, 'from dawn to dusk he marches around in an ecstatic, drunken dance...quite in love with himself for being so clever'.\n\nNarcissistic elation may subsequently be reactivated within a therapeutic context. Edmund Bergler wrote of 'the narcissistic elation that comes from self-understanding'; while Herbert Rosenfeld described what he called the re-emergence of '\"narcissistic omnipotent object relations\"...in the clinical situation'.\n\nSomewhat similarly, Lacan spoke of 'the megalomaniac ebriety which...[i]s the index of the termination of the analysis in present practice'.\n\nIn later life, the adult may seek to 'return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy'. For some, the whole 'purpose of love...[is] equal exchange in an atmosphere of shared narcissistic elation'. \n\nOthers may consider as ultimately futile this 'search for a pure narcissistic exaltation, the elation procured by the imaginary contemplation of the object'; and yet still recognise the power of 'the enchantment of love...as the exaltation of the other...this breathlessness which, with the other, has created the most false of demands, that of narcissistic satisfaction'.\n\nIn \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", a 'cold intellectual arrogance and narcissistic elation' have been identified in 'the highly ambitious speculations attributed to Stephen—the central protagonist—with respect to aesthetics. \n\n"}

All regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursive languages are recursively enumerable.\n\nThe class of all recursively enumerable languages is called RE.\n\nThere are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:\n\n\nAll regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursive languages are recursively enumerable.\n\nPost's theorem shows that RE, together with its complement co-RE, correspond to the first level of the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\nThe set of halting turing machines is recursively enumerable but not recursive. Indeed one can run the Turing Machine and accept if the machine halts, hence it is recursively enumerable. On the other hand the problem is undecidable. \n\nSome other recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive include:\n\n\nRecursively enumerable languages (REL) are closed under the following operations.

{"id": "344492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344492", "title": "Ro (artificial language)", "text": "Ro (artificial language)\n\nRo is an a priori constructed language created by Rev. Edward Powell Foster beginning in 1904. \n\nRev. Edward Powell Foster lived from 1853 through 1937; in Marietta, Ohio. He was buried along with his wife in Riverview Cemetery in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nIn Ro, words are constructed using a category system. For example, all words starting with \"bofo-\" signify colors; the word for \"red\" is \"bofoc\", and \"yellow\" is \"bofof\". Foster did not simply try to design a better language in general, but to optimize his language for one design criterion: recognizability of unknown words. Foster wrote about Ro:\n\nAfter working on the language for about two years, Foster published the first booklet about Ro in 1906. The publication of Ro periodicals was supported by several American sponsors, especially from the Marietta, Ohio area, including Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal Classification (another attempt to categorize human knowledge), Vice President Charles G. Dawes, George White, who mentioned Ro in the Congressional Record, and Alice Vanderbilt Morris of IALA. Several more books about Ro by Foster and his wife appeared over the years, as late as 1932.\n\nA common criticism of Ro is that it can be difficult to hear the difference between two words; usually one consonant makes the word different in meaning, but still similar enough that the intended meaning often cannot be guessed from context. This characteristic is common among philosophical languages, which are characterized by vocabulary developed taxonomically, independently of natural languages. \"A posteriori\" languages, such as Esperanto and Interlingua, are more popular than the \"a priori\" type, perhaps partly because their familiar vocabulary makes them easy to learn and recognize. Conversely, a priori languages are seen as being more neutral because there are so many languages and root words used in different languages may be completely different. \n\nSolresol was an earlier classificatory language that by using a smaller symbol set achieved easier distinctness. There have been a few more recent attempts to design a language along similar lines, such as Ygyde and the Japanese-made Babm, but most subsequent constructed language makers have avoided this taxonomic or hierarchic design for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nRo's alphabet is (orthographically speaking) just like the English Alphabet. The pronunciation of the letters: C, J, Q and X are pronounced as: /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ŋ/ and /χ/ respectively. The vowels (A, E, I, O and U) are pronounced as they are in the Spanish language.\n\nThe following sample is from \"Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages\". It is the last stanza of William Cullen Bryant's \"Thanatopsis\" translated into Ro by Foster himself:\n\n"}
{"id": "6435232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6435232", "title": "Sentiment analysis", "text": "Sentiment analysis\n\nOpinion mining (sometimes known as sentiment analysis or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.\n\nGenerally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).\n\nThe objective and challenges of sentiment analysis can be shown through some simple examples.\n\n\n\nDatasets for sentiment analysis are available online.\n\nThe following is a list of a few open source sentiment analysis tools.\n\n\nOpen Source Dictionary or resources:\n\n\nA basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the \"polarity\" of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level—whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, \"beyond polarity\" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as \"angry\", \"sad\", and \"happy\".\n\nPrecursors to sentimental analysis include the General Inquirer, which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and, separately, psychological research that examined a person's psychological state based on analysis of their verbal behavior.\n\nSubsequently, the method described in a patent by Volcani and Fogel, looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales. A current system based on their work, called EffectCheck, presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale.\n\nMany other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated, using a mere polar view of sentiment, from positive to negative, such as work by Turney, and Pang who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of product reviews and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang and Snyder among others: Pang and Lee expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).\n\nFirst steps to bringing together various approaches—learning, lexical, knowledge-based, etc.—were taken in the 2004 AAAI Spring Symposium where linguists, computer scientists, and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect, appeal, subjectivity, and sentiment in text.\n\nEven though in most statistical classification methods, the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy and SVMs can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification. There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class. Either, the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language, filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments, or it builds a three-way classification in one step. This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories (e.g. naive Bayes classifiers as implemented by the NLTK). Whether and how to use a neutral class depends on the nature of the data: if the data is clearly clustered into neutral, negative and positive language, it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments. If, in contrast, the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect, this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles.\n\nA different method for determining sentiment is the use of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.\n\nThis task is commonly defined as classifying a given text (usually a sentence) into one of two classes: objective or subjective. This problem can sometimes be more difficult than polarity classification. The subjectivity of words and phrases may depend on their context and an objective document may contain subjective sentences (e.g., a news article quoting people's opinions). Moreover, as mentioned by Su, results are largely dependent on the definition of subjectivity used when annotating texts. However, Pang showed that removing objective sentences from a document before classifying its polarity helped improve performance.\n\nIt refers to determining the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., of a cell phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis can be found in Liu's work.\n\nExisting approaches to sentiment analysis can be grouped into three main categories: knowledge-based techniques, statistical methods, and hybrid approaches. Knowledge-based techniques classify text by affect categories based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy, sad, afraid, and bored. Some knowledge bases not only list obvious affect words, but also assign arbitrary words a probable \"affinity\" to particular emotions. Statistical methods leverage on elements from machine learning such as latent semantic analysis, support vector machines, \"bag of words\" and \"Semantic Orientation—Pointwise Mutual Information\". More sophisticated methods try to detect the holder of a sentiment (i.e., the person who maintains that affective state) and the target (i.e., the entity about which the affect is felt). To mine the opinion in context and get the feature about which the speaker has opined, the grammatical relationships of words are used. Grammatical dependency relations are obtained by deep parsing of the text. Hybrid approaches leverage on both machine learning and elements from knowledge representation such as ontologies and semantic networks in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner, e.g., through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey relevant information, but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so.\n\nOpen source software tools deploy machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media. Knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, make use of publicly available resources, to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts. Sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content, i.e., images and videos (see Multimodal sentiment analysis). One of the first approaches in this direction is SentiBank utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, the vast majority of sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, grammar and even word order. Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result, but they incur an additional annotation overhead.\n\nA human analysis component is required in sentiment analysis, as automated systems are not able to analyze historical tendencies of the individual commenter, or the platform and are often classified incorrectly in their expressed sentiment. Automation impacts approximately 23% of comments that are correctly classified by humans. However, humans often disagree, and it is argued that the inter-human agreement provides an upper bound that automated sentiment classifiers can eventually reach.\n\nSometimes, the structure of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare \"THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel\" vs \"I would not let my dog stay in this hotel\"). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.\n\nThe accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, how well it agrees with human judgments. This is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts. However, according to research human raters typically only agree about 80% of the time (see Inter-rater reliability). Thus, a program which achieves 70% accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans, even though such accuracy may not sound impressive. If a program were \"right\" 100% of the time, humans would still disagree with it about 20% of the time, since they disagree that much about \"any\" answer. On the other hand, computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors, and thus the figures are not entirely comparable. For instance, a computer system will have trouble with negations, exaggerations, jokes, or sarcasm, which typically are easy to handle for a human reader: some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human. In general, the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question, mostly since the simple one-dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying about the effect of public discourse on e.g. brand or corporate reputation.\n\nTo better fit market needs, evaluation of sentiment analysis has moved to more task-based measures, formulated together with representatives from PR agencies and market research professionals. The focus in e.g. the RepLab evaluation data set is less on the content of the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on brand reputation.\n\nThe rise of social media such as blogs and social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis. With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations. As businesses look to automate the process of filtering out the noise, understanding the conversations, identifying the relevant content and actioning it appropriately, many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis. Further complicating the matter, is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as 4chan and Reddit. If web 2.0 was all about democratizing publishing, then the next stage of the web may well be based on democratizing data mining of all the content that is getting published.\n\nOne step towards this aim is accomplished in research. Several research teams in universities around the world currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in e-communities through sentiment analysis. The CyberEmotions project, for instance, recently identified the role of negative emotions in driving social networks discussions.\n\nThe problem is that most sentiment analysis algorithms use simple terms to express sentiment about a product or service. However, cultural factors, linguistic nuances and differing contexts make it extremely difficult to turn a string of written text into a simple pro or con sentiment. The fact that humans often disagree on the sentiment of text illustrates how big a task it is for computers to get this right. The shorter the string of text, the harder it becomes.\n\nEven though short text strings might be a problem, sentiment analysis within microblogging has shown that Twitter can be seen as a valid online indicator of political sentiment. Tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to parties' and politicians' political positions, indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. Furthermore, sentiment analysis on Twitter has also been shown to capture the public mood behind human reproduction cycles on a planetary scale, as well as other problems of public-health relevance such as adverse drug reactions.\n\nFor a recommender system, sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique. A recommender system aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and content-based filtering works on the meta-data of the items.\n\nIn many social networking services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or feedback to the items. These user-generated text provide a rich source of user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in content-based filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.\n\nBased on the feature/aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed. There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item.\n\nExcept the difficulty of the sentiment analysis itself, applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also face the challenge of spam and biased reviews. One direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review. Review or feedback poorly written are hardly helpful for recommender system. Besides, a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product, thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written.\n\nResearchers also found that long and short form of user-generated text should be treated differently. An interesting result shows that short form reviews are sometimes more helpful than long form, because it is easier to filter out the noise in a short form text. For the long form text, the growing length of the text does not always bring a proportionate increase of the number of features or sentiments in the text.\n\n"}

Little is known about his youth or his family. He did, however, receive a comprehensive education, despite the Penal Laws. Either in the home or in a hedge school, he learned Latin, Ancient Greek and English as well as Irish, his native tongue. \n\nMac Domhnaill was one of the Maigue Poets, a circle of 18th century Gaelic poets in County Limerick. Under his chairmanship, they met in the ancient ringfort Lios Ollium, in Bruree. His own house in Charleville was also sometimes a meeting place. Seán \"Clárach\" Mac Domhnaill soon won the admiration of the other Munster poets, who gave him the title Príomh-Éigeas na Mumhan or Chief Poet of Munster.\n\nIn Croom, County Limerick, he frequented the public house of Seán Ó Tuama, a good friend and another Maigue poet. He could not, however, make a living out of his poetry, as previous poets had done, but had to work as a farm labourer and teacher from time to time.\n\nIn 1754, Mac Domhnaill died and was laid to rest in Holy Cross Cemetery, Charleville. His grave is situated in the center of the graveyard, on the site of the medieval parish church.\n\n\"Mo Ghile Mear\" is Mac Domhnaill's most famous poem. It is a lament or \"caoineadh\" that was written after the defeat of the Bonnie Prince Charles at the Battle of Culloden, Scotland, in 1746. The Irish poets had pinned their hopes on this revolutionary prince and his flight was a crushing blow to the long-suffering Gaels of both Éire and Scotland. Their exasperation and despair is vividly portrayed in this poem. Like all other Gaelic poems of the time, \"Mo Ghile Mear\" would have been sung rather than recited; indeed, the melody is well-known today. This is the chorus:\nIn 1723, on the death of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Mac Domhnaill wrote a poem reproaching him for his indifference towards Ireland. His other works include: \"De Bharr na gCnoc\" and \"Gráinne Mhaol\".\n\nWhile not a true bardic poet like Dáibhí Ó Bruadair, Mac Domhnaill did keep to a complex rhyming scheme. His language can be ornate but it is certainly not the Classical Irish of the bards. By the 18th century this literary language had been abandoned in favour of the modern dialect – disused after the strict bardic schools closed down and a literary standard became impossible to maintain across the country.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24848339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24848339", "title": "Syed Mahmood", "text": "Syed Mahmood\n\nJustice Syed Mahmood (also spelled Sayyid Mahmud) (24 May 1850 – 8 May 1903) was Puisne Judge of the High Court, North-Western Provinces from 1887 to 1893, after having served in the High Court in a temporary capacity as officiating judge on four previous periods since 1882. He was the first Indian jurist to be appointed to High Court at Allahabad, and the first Muslim to serve as a High Court judge in the British Raj. Syed Mahmood also had a major role in assisting his father, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in establishing the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, which later developed into Aligarh Muslim University. As a jurist, his judgments dominate the Indian Law Reports: Allahabad Series for the years he was on the bench. He also participated actively in the formation of laws through writing lengthy notes on proposed laws to the legislative councils of both the Governor-General of India and the Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces. Syed Mahmood was appointed to the N.-W.P. and Oudh Legislative Council from 1896 to 1898.\n\nSyed Mahmood was born in Delhi in 1850, the second son of Syed Ahmad Khan. He subsequently studied in Moradabad, and Aligarh, all cities to which his father had been posted as a member of the Indian Civil Service. He also studied at the Government College in Delhi and at Queen's College in Benares before passing his Matriculation Examination at the University of Calcutta in 1868. He then received a scholarship from the British government in India to study in England.\n\nIn 1869, Mahmood was admitted to Lincoln's Inn and in April 1872 he was called to the Bar. Around the same time, from 1870, he studied Latin, Greek and oriental languages for two years at Christ's College, Cambridge but without graduating.\n\nAfter returning to India, Mahmood enrolled as a barrister in the High Court in Allahabad in 1872, the first Indian to achieve that distinction in that court. He worked as a barrister in Allahabad until 1878. The following year he was appointed as a District and Sessions Judge in Oudh by the Viceroy of India, Lord Lytton. This was his substantive appointment in the Indian Civil Service until 1887 when he was appointed Puisne Judge of the High Court at Allahabad, though this service was interrupted several times with temporary appointments as officiating judge at the High Court. He also was seconded briefly to the Nizam in Hyderabad State, where he assisted with the judicial administration in 1881.\n\nIn 1882, Syed Mahmood received his first officiating appointment as a judge to the High Court of the North-Western Provinces in Allahabad, with active lobbying on his behalf by the Viceroy who had replaced Lytton, Lord Ripon. He served as an officiating judge three more times before he received his full appointment as Puisne Judge in 1887. His contemporaries generally considered him to have an exceptional ability, assisted by a knowledge of the Arabic language that he had gained while studying in Cambridge and which was invaluable for assessing Muslim law. His judgements, says Kozlowski, were \"written with a clarify and vivacity rare in a rather dense literary genre.\" Throughout his time on the bench, Mahmood was known for his lengthy, detailed written judgments, many of which were published in the Law Reports for those years. Whitley Stokes, Law Member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council in India during the years 1877 to 1882, later praised Mahmood's judgments in his \"Anglo-Indian Codes\". Likewise, in an obituary he wrote, Tej Bahadur Sapru, a younger contemporary of Mahmood's, commented that his long and detailed judgments were necessary because of the spate of new legislation being enacted that needed to be clarified in a court of law. Nevertheless, his opinions were very often rejected by the full bench, which mostly consisted of British judges; Kozlowski notes that \"broad learning and clever argument based on Muslim sources were not ultimately decisive in the system of justice the British administered in India.\" His prolixity and frequent dissenting opinions were a couple of the factors that led to conflicts with his fellow judges, and eventually to an early retirement in 1893. Kozlowski says that the retirement came about because of pressure being put on him due to his severe drunkenness. Mahmood denied that he was an alcoholic and blamed the jealousy of John Edge, the Chief Justice, but even his friends acknowledged it was a problem.\n\nAfter his retirement from the judiciary, he returned to his legal practice as a barrister, working in Lucknow as well as serving on the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Legislative Council from 1896 to 1898.\n\nShortly after returning to India after his studies in England in 1872, Syed Mahmood wrote a proposal for the establishment of a self-supporting Muslim college in India based on the model he had experienced at Cambridge University. He then assisted his father, Sir Syed, in founding the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, and continued to play a vital role in its administration even while working as a lawyer and judge in Allahabad. In 1883, he returned to England to recruit Theodore Beck to serve as the school's principal. He took an active part in teaching English classes and establishing a law program at the school, donating a major portion of his own collection of legal texts to form a legal library. In 1889, his father nominated Mahmood as Joint Secretary of the board of trustees for the school. After his father's death in 1898, he took up his responsibilities as Life Honorary Joint Secretary. The following year he was replaced in this position by Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk, and was elevated to the post of Honorary President instead.\n\nSyed Mahmood was active in educational ventures outside of the MAOC as well. During the Ripon administration, he was appointed as one of the commissioners of the 1882 Education Commission, investigating the state of education in India. He was also an active participant in the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference, delivering a series of lectures on the history of English education in India during the annual meetings of 1893 and 1894.\n\nIn 1888, Syed Mahmood married Musharraf Jahan, the daughter of Nawab Khwajah Sharfuddin Ahmad, his father's maternal cousin. They had one son Ross Masood. Mahmood purchased a home in Allahabad which was subsequently sold to Motilal Nehru who was also serving as a barrister in the Allahabad court at that time, and which was eventually renamed Swaraj Bhavan. Earlier in 1876, Syed Mahmood had established another residence in the city of Aligarh; this currently houses the Sir Syed Academy. In 1900, after becoming estranged from both his family and the college at Aligarh, Mahmood moved to Sitapur where he lived with his cousin, Syed Muhammad Ahmad, until his death in 1903.\n\nSyed Mahmood's first contribution to the legal literature of British India was an Urdu translation of the 1872 Law of Evidence and subsequent amendments, published in 1876. He revised his lectures to the Muhammadan Educational Conference and published them in English as \"A History of English Education in India\" in 1895. He also contributed articles to the \"Aligarh Institute Gazette\" and the \"Calcutta Review.\" But his major written contribution consisted of the approximately 300 legal judgments recorded in the \"Indian Law Reports: Allahabad Series\" between the years 1882 and 1892, a considerable number of which were over twenty pages in length. Contemporaries note that he was preparing a multi-volume work on Muslim law after his retirement from the bench, but this remained uncompleted at the time of his death.\n\n\n"}

One of the country's most widely spoken languages, it is spoken by 30% of the country’s population. It also serves as a lingua franca for an additional 1,500,000 people living in areas near the Temne people. It is closely related to the neighboring Kissi language.\n\nIt is related to the Baga languages spoken in Guinea and to Sherbro spoken in Sierra Leone. Temne speakers live mostly in the Northern Province and Western Area (Freetown and its environs) of Sierra Leone. Temne speakers can also be found in all 12 districts of Sierra Leone. Temne people can be found in a number of other West African countries as well, including Guinea and The Gambia. Some Temnes have also migrated beyond West Africa seeking educational and professional opportunities, especially in Great Britain, the United States, and Egypt.\n\nTemne is a tonal language, with four tones. Among consonants, Temne distinguishes dental and alveolar, but, unusually, the dental consonants are apical and the alveolar consonants are laminal (and slightly affricated), the opposite of the general pattern, though one found also in the nearby language Limba. \n\nThe alphabet of Temne includes the following characters and digraphs:\n\nEarlier, Ȧȧ was used instead of Ʌʌ\n\n"}
{"id": "916083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=916083", "title": "Tolkāppiyam", "text": "Tolkāppiyam\n\nThe Tholkāppiyam (, literally \"Paleo-literature\") is a work on the grammar of the Tamil language and the earliest extant work of Tamil literature and linguistics. It is written in the form of \"noorpaa\" or short formulaic compositions and comprises three books – the \"Ezhuttadikaram\", the \"Solladikaram\" and the \"Poruladikaram\". Each of these books is further divided into nine chapters each. While the exact date of the work is not known, based on linguistic and other evidence, it has been dated variously between the 5th century BCE and the 2nd century CE. Some modern scholars prefer to date it not as a single entity but in parts or layers. There is also no firm evidence to assign the authorship of this treatise to any one author.\n\n\"Tholkappiyam\" deals with orthography, phonology, morphology, semantics, prosody and the subject matter of literature. The Tholkāppiyam classifies the Tamil language into \"sentamil\" and \"koduntamil\". The former refers to the classical Tamil used almost exclusively in literary works and the latter refers to the dialectal Tamil, spoken by the people in the various regions of ancient Tamilagam.\n\nTholkappiyam categorises alphabet into consonants and vowels by analysing the syllables. It grammatises the use of words and syntaxes and moves into higher modes of language analysis. The Tholkāppiyam formulated thirty phonemes and three dependent sounds for Tamil.\n\n\"Tolkāppiyam\" derived from the combination of two words: \"Tonmai\" (\"ancientness\") and \"kāppiyam\" (\"literature\").\n\nThe derivation of \"Tolkāppiyam\" from the root words is as per the rules defined in \"Nannūl\" verse 136.\n\nThe dating of the Tolkappiyam has been debated much, and it is still imprecise and uncertain and has seen wide disagreements amongst scholars in the field. The work has been dated variously between the 5th century BCE and the 3rd century CE.\n\nThe antediluvian datings stemmed mostly from a descriptive commentary in an 8th-century work called \"Iraiyanar AgapporuL\", about the existence of three Tamil Academies; they have now been rejected as being devoid of any archeological/linguistic evidence. The disagreements now center around divergent dates from the 3rd century BCE or later, with one estimate (by a botanist-author) being as late as the 10th century CE. Some scholars prefer to date it not as a single entity but in parts or layers which are estimated as written between the 3rd century BCE and the 5th century CE.\n\n\nTholkapiyam was written by Tholkappiyar, a disciple of Vedic sage Agastya. Since Agathiam, the grammar compiled by Agastya, went missing after a great deluge, Tholkappiyar was asked to compile Tamil grammar.\n\nStarting in the 11th or 12th century CE, several commentaries came to light. Of these, the one by Ilampuranar dated to the 11th or 12th century CE is considered one of the best and most comprehensive. This was followed by a commentary dateable to 1275 CE by Senavaraiyar which, however, dealt only with the \"Sollathikaram\". A commentary by \"Perasiriyar\" which is heavily indebted to the \"Nannūl\" followed. This commentary which can be dated to the 12th or 13th century CE, if not later, frequently quotes from the \"Dandiyalankaram\" and \"Yapparunkalam\", the former being a standard medieval rhetorica and the latter being a detailed treatise on Tamil prosody. Naccinarkiniyar's commentary, which can be dated to the 14th if not the 15th or 16th century follows. Naccinarkiniyar, himself being a scholar of both Tamil and Sanskrit quotes from Parimelalakar's works. Teyvaccilaiyar's commentary follows in the 16th or 17th century. Finally, the latest available commentary, that of Kallatar comes to light. Of these commentaries, those of \"Ilampooranar\", \"Deivachilaiyaaar\" and \"Natchinaarkiniyar\" is regarded highly and the triumvarate are also called \"Urai-asiriyargal\".\n\nThe Tolkāppiyam consists of three books each of which is divided into 9 chapters. The books are called \"athikaarams\". The three books are\n\nI. Ezhuththathigaaram – Formation of words and combination of words. \nII. Sollathigaaram – Syntax. \nIII. Porulathigaaram – Conveying thoughts.\n\nEzhuththathigaaram is further subdivided into the following 9 sections – \"Nuul Marabu, Mozhi Marabu, PiRappiyal, PuNaRiyal, Thokai Marabu, Urupiyal, Uyir Mayangiyal, PuLLi Mayangiyal and the Kutriyalukara PunaRiyal.\"\n\n\nSollathigaaram deals with words and parts of speech. It classifies Tamil words into four categories – \"iyar chol\" (words in common usage), \"thiri chol\" (words used in Tamil literature), \"vada chol\" (words borrowed from Sanskrit), \"thisai chol\" (words borrowed from other languages. There are certain rules to be adhered to in borrowing words from Sanskrit. The borrowed words need to strictly conform to the Tamil phonetic system and be written in the Tamil script.\n\nThe chapter Sollathigaaram is subdivided into the following 9 sections – \n\n\", VEtRumaiyiyal, VEtrumaimayangial, ViLimaRabu, Peyariyal, Vinaiyiyal, Idaiyiyal, Uriyiyal and the Echchaviyal\".\n\n\"KiLaviyaakkam\"– KiLaviyaakkam literally translates to \"word formation\". This section deals with syntax correlation between subject and predicate in gender, number, person etc.\n\n\nThe Porulathigaaram gives the classification of land types, and seasons and defines modes of life for each of the combinations of land types and seasons for different kinds of people. This chapter is subdivided into the following 9 sections – \"AkaththiNaiyiyal, PuRaththiNaiyiyal, KaLaviyal, KaRpiyal, PoruLiyal, Meyppaattiyal, Uvamayiyal, SeyyuLiyal\" and the \"Marabiyal.\"\n\n\nThere are two verses given in support of Tholkappiar's religious outlook. Some made controversial and unconfirmed observation in Sangam poems that there is relatively meager reference given to religion in general. In the akam songs, Tholkappiar has made reference to deities in the different land divisions: Thirumal for mullai, Murugan for kurinji, Indhiran for marutham, Varunan, for neithal and Korravai for palai.\n\nAlexander Dubyanskiy, veteran Tamil scholar from Moscow State University stated “I am sure that Tolkappiyam is a work which demanded not only vast knowledge and a lot of thinking but a considerable creative skill from its composer.” Dr. Dubyanskiy also said that the authority of the text was undeniable. “It is a literary and cultural monument of great importance.”\n\n\n"}
