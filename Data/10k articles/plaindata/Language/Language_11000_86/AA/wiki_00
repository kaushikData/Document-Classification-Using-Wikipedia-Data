His debut novel, \"The White Tiger\", won the 2008 Man Booker Prize.\n\nAravind Adiga was born in Madras (now Chennai) on 23 October 1974 to Dr. K. Madhava Adiga and Usha Adiga, both of whom hailed from Mangalore. His paternal grandfather was the late K. Suryanarayana Adiga, former chairman of Karnataka Bank, and a maternal great-grandfather, U. Rama Rao, a popular medical practitioner and Congress politician from Madras.\n\nAdiga grew up in Mangalore and studied at Canara High School, then at St. Aloysius College, where he completed his SSLC in 1990 and secured the first place in his state in SSLC (his elder brother, Anand, had placed second in SSLC and first in PUC in the state).\n\nAfter emigrating to Sydney, Australia, with his family, Aravind studied at James Ruse Agricultural High School. He later studied English literature at Columbia College of Columbia University, in New York city, under Simon Schama and graduated as salutatorian in 1997. He also studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where one of his tutors was Hermione Lee.\n\nAdiga began his journalistic career as a financial journalist, interning at the \"Financial Times\". With pieces published in the \"Financial Times\" and \"Money\", he covered the stock market and investment, interviewing, amongst others, Donald Trump. His review of previous Booker Prize winner Peter Carey's book, \"Oscar and Lucinda\", appeared in \"The Second Circle\", an online literary review.\n\nHe was subsequently hired by \"TIME\", where he remained a South Asia correspondent for three years before going freelance. During this freelance period, he wrote \"The White Tiger\". Aravind Adiga now lives in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\n\nAravind Adiga's debut novel, \"The White Tiger\", won the 2008 Booker Prize. He is the fourth Indian-born author to win the prize, after Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, and Kiran Desai. (V. S. Naipaul, another winner, is ethnically Indian but was born on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.) The five other authors on the shortlist included one other Indian writer (Amitav Ghosh) and another first-time writer (Steve Toltz). The novel studies the contrast between India's rise as a modern global economy and the lead character, Balram, who comes from crushing rural poverty.\n\nAdiga explained that \"criticism by writers like Flaubert, Balzac and Dickens of the 19th century helped England and France become better societies\".\n\nShortly after he won the prize, it was alleged that Adiga had, the previous year, sacked the agent who had secured his contract with Atlantic Books at the 2007 London Book Fair. In April 2009, it was announced that the novel would be adapted into a feature film. Propelled mainly by the Booker Prize win, The White Tiger's Indian hardcover edition sold more than 200,000 copies.\n\nAccording to Ana Cristina Mendes (2010), \"The White Tiger\" falls prey to “inauthenticity”: Adiga – a well-read Indian author who writes in English, having been educated at Oxford and Columbia – errs on the side of an unconvincing colloquialism by making his characters speak a language of the Indian underground, which he himself masters only to a certain extent. The novel is described as a first-person \"bildungsroman\" and placed within the wider context of contemporary Indian writing in English, as a novel about “the Darkness” (which reminds us of Dickens’s London) and a fascinating success story about the overnight rise of one character from rags to riches, but also about India’s development as a global market economy. Mendes (2010) notices in this a certain artificiality, cleverly masked by irony, and remarks the “‘cardboard cut-out’ title character equipped with an inauthentic voice that ultimately undermines issues of class politics” (p. 277).\n\nAdiga's second book, \"Between the Assassinations\", was released in India in November 2008 and in the US and UK in mid-2009; twelve interlinked short stories comprise this book. His second novel and third published book, \"Last Man in Tower\", was published in the UK in 2011. His third novel, \"Selection Day\", was published on 8 September 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "355539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355539", "title": "Christmas seal", "text": "Christmas seal\n\nChristmas seals are labels placed on mail during the Christmas season to raise funds and awareness for charitable programs. They have become particularly associated with lung diseases such as tuberculosis, and with child welfare. Christmas seals are regarded as a form of cinderella stamp in contrast with Christmas stamps used for postage.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1900s tuberculosis was a greatly feared disease, and its harmful effects on children seemed particularly cruel.\nIn 1904, Einar Holbøll, a Danish postal clerk developed the idea of adding an extra charitable stamp on mailed holiday greetings during Christmas. The money raised could be used to help children sick with tuberculosis. The plan was approved by the Postmaster and the King of Denmark (Christian IX).\n\nIn 1904 the world’s first Christmas seal was issued, bearing the likeness of the Danish Queen (Louise of Hesse-Kassel) and the word \"Julen\" (Christmas). Over 4 million were sold in the first year at DKK 0.02 per seal.\nDuring the first six years, enough funds were raised to build the Christmas Seal Sanatorium in Kolding, which was opened in 1911.\nThe same year the sanatorium was transferred to the administration of the Danish National Association to Combat Tuberculosis as it was considered a waste of resources to have two organisations working towards the same purpose.\nThe Danish Christmas Seal Committee – today known as Julemærkefonden (the Christmas Seal Fund) - decided at that time to put all future collected funds to use in building and operating convalescent homes for children.\n\nSoon after Denmark issued the first Christmas seal, Sweden and Iceland followed. Seals then spread throughout Scandinavia and every major country in Europe, and are still popular today. Christmas seals have been issued by hundreds of different societies, nationally, and locally in Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Australia. The majority of all TB seals since then were issued at Christmas time and included the international symbol against TB, the double barred Cross of Lorraine.\n\nThey were introduced to the United States by Emily Bissell in 1907, after she had read about the 1904 Danish Christmas seal in an article by Danish-born Jacob Riis, a muckraking journalist and photographer. Bissell hoped to raise money for a sanitarium on the Brandywine Creek in Delaware. Bissell went on to design a Delaware local Christmas seal in 1908. Local Christmas seals have existed alongside national issues in the US since 1907, and are catalogued by the Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society.\n\nBy 1908, Bissell's idea grew to a national program administered by the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT) and the American National Red Cross. The seals were sold in post office lobbies, initially in Delaware at 1 cent each. Net proceeds from the sales would be divided equally between the two organizations. By 1920, the Red Cross withdrew from the arrangement and sales were conducted exclusively by the NASPT, then known as the National Tuberculosis Association (NTA). Various promotional schemes were tried: in 1954 the small town of Saranac Lake, New York (home of the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium) won a nationwide competition selling Christmas seals, the reward for which was hosting the world premiere of the Paul Newman film \"The Silver Chalice\"; the cast participated in a parade in the town's annual winter carnival.\n\nAfter World War II with the development of the antibiotic streptomycin TB became a curable disease, although it would be decades before it could be considered under control in developed countries. To reflect the expanding scope of the organization's goals, the name was changed to the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association in the late 1960s. The NTRDA became the American Lung Association in 1973, though the 1974 seals continue to show the NTRDA inscription on the sheet margin.\n\nToday the Christmas seals benefit the American Lung Association and other lung related issues. Tuberculosis was declining, but recently has been on the rise. TB is still one of the most common major infectious diseases in the world.\n\nIn 1987 the American Lung Association acquired a trademark for the term \"Christmas Seals\" to protect their right to be the sole US national fundraising Association to issue them. Of course, this trademark would not apply to Christmas seals issued outside the US or local and regional Christmas seals, used in the US by many organizations since 1907 when the Kensington Dispensary in Philadelphia PA issued their own local Christmas seal.\n\nBy 1908, the campaign had reached Canada. Interested people in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario began Christmas seal campaigns to build and support sanatoria, as TB hospitals were then called.\n\nThe \"Toronto Globe\" came promptly to their aid. Early in December, the \"Globe\" began running a daily story on the front page giving news of the campaign. The column was bordered by holly so that readers could easily spot it.\n\nOne story told how the children of 58 Toronto schools had sold 10,000 Christmas seals. Another issue announced that out in Regina, Saskatchewan another paper, the \"Regina Leader\", had written to say its staff would sell the seals and send the money back for the sanatorium being built in Muskoka.\n\nFrom Saint John, New Brunswick, the Rev. G. A. Moore wrote to say that he and other volunteers would sell 8,500 and send the money to Toronto for the sanatorium.\n\nThat first year, the Toronto campaign brought in $6,114.25 and Hamilton citizens gave $1,244.40.\nYear by year, other cities across Canada tried the Christmas seal campaign as a means not only of raising money but of creating the awareness that tuberculosis could be controlled.\n\nFinally, in 1927, it was agreed that the Christmas seal campaign was to be the official method for tuberculosis associations to appeal to the public for funds. A national seal was established.\n\nChristmas seal campaigns have played an important role in public health. At first, the money raised was used for the new and badly needed sanatoria. When these were established, Christmas seal funds were used for TB prevention. The seals have paid for millions of Canadians to have chest X-ray or tuberculin tests. As a result, thousands of TB cases were discovered before disease spread to others.\n\nThe Canadian Lung Association's Christmas seals continue to symbolize the grassroots support of Canadians that helped win the fight against TB.\n\nThere are nearly one hundred different lung associations worldwide that issue Christmas seals. Many different countries issue their own Christmas seals, as well as cities, states and territories. Green's Catalog, the bible of US and worldwide TB Christmas seal collecting would distinguish them as national versus local Christmas seals. Many tuberculosis seal issuing societies are members of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, which holds a Christmas seal contest for best design among their Organizational and Constituent seal issuing members at their annual World Conference on Lung Health.\n\nBetween 1937 and 1943 the Danish Nazi Party (DNSAP) issued a variety of seals featuring the Nazi swastika. These scarce seals contain Christmas themes like holly, but no known connection to the fight against tuberculosis, and for this reason, they are not listed in Green's Catalog.\n\nHistory has shown that most dictatorial regimes suspend Christmas seals from being issued. This happened in Korea under the Japanese occupation, China under the communists, and Argentina under Eva Peron.\n\nMany other charitable funds were issued at Christmas time, often with Christmas themes, by religious organizations, civic and fraternal societies, patriotic organizations, sororities, etc., but since they were not issued to fight tuberculosis, they lack the double barred cross of Lorraine, the international symbol for the fight against tuberculosis, proposed in 1902 at the International Conference on Tuberculosis in Berlin Germany, and strictly speaking do not qualify as Christmas seals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "194376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194376", "title": "Code page", "text": "Code page\n\nIn computing, a code page is a character encoding and as such it is a specific association of a set of printable characters and control characters with unique numbers.\n\nThe term \"code page\" originated from IBM's EBCDIC-based mainframe systems, but Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle Corporation are among the few vendors which use this term. The majority of vendors identify their own character sets by a name. In the case when there is a plethora of character sets (like in IBM), identifying character sets through a number is a convenient way to distinguish them. Originally, the code page numbers referred to the \"page\" numbers in the IBM standard character set manual, a condition which has not held for a long time. Vendors that use a code page system allocate their own code page number to a character encoding, even if it is better known by another name; for example, UTF-8 has been assigned page numbers 1208 at IBM, 65001 at Microsoft, and 4110 at SAP.\n\nHewlett-Packard uses a similar concept in its HP-UX operating system and its Printer Command Language (PCL) protocol for printers (either for HP printers or not). The terminology, however, is different: What others call a \"character set\", HP calls a \"symbol set\", and what IBM or Microsoft call a \"code page\", HP calls a \"symbol set code\". HP developed a series of symbol sets, each with an associated symbol set code, to encode both its own character sets and other vendors’ character sets.\n\nThe multitude of character sets leads many vendors to recommend Unicode.\n\nIBM introduced the concept of systematically assigning a small, but globally unique, 16 bit number to each character encoding that a computer system or collection of computer systems might encounter. The IBM origin of the numbering scheme is reflected in the fact that the smallest (first) numbers are assigned to variations of IBM's EBCDIC encoding and slightly larger numbers refer to variations of IBM's extended ASCII encoding as used in its PC hardware.\n\nWith the release of PC DOS version 3.3 (and the near identical MS-DOS 3.3) IBM introduced the code page numbering system to regular PC users, as the code page numbers (and the phrase \"code page\") were used in new commands to allow the character encoding used by all parts of the OS to be set in a systematic way.\n\nAfter IBM and Microsoft ceased to cooperate in the 1990s, the two companies have maintained the list of assigned code page numbers independently from each other, resulting in some conflicting assignments. At least one third-party vendor (Oracle) also has its own different list of numeric assignments. IBM's current assignments are listed in their CCSID repository, while Microsoft's assignments are documented within the MSDN. Additionally, a list of the names and approximate IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) abbreviations for the installed code pages on any given Windows machine can be found in the Registry on that machine (this information is used by Microsoft programs such as Internet Explorer).\n\nMost well-known code pages, excluding those for the CJK languages and Vietnamese, fit all their code-points into eight bits and do not involve anything more than mapping each code-point to a single character; furthermore, techniques such as combining characters, complex scripts, etc., are not involved.\n\nThe text mode of standard (VGA-compatible) PC graphics hardware is built around using an 8-bit code page, though it is possible to use two at once with some color depth sacrifice, and up to eight may be stored in the display adaptor for easy switching. There was a selection of third-party code page fonts that could be loaded into such hardware. However, it is now commonplace for operating system vendors to provide their own character encoding and rendering systems that run in a graphics mode and bypass this hardware limitation entirely. However the system of referring to character encodings by a code page number remains applicable, as an efficient alternative to string identifiers such as those specified by the IETF and IANA for use in various protocols such as e-mail and web pages.\n\nThe majority of code pages in current use are supersets of ASCII, a 7-bit code representing 128 control codes and printable characters. In the distant past, 8-bit implementations of the ASCII code set the top bit to zero or used it as a parity bit in network data transmissions. When the top bit was made available for representing character data, a total of 256 characters and control codes could be represented. Most vendors (including IBM) used this extended range to encode characters used by various languages and graphical elements that allowed the imitation of primitive graphics on text-only output devices. No formal standard existed for these ‘extended character sets’ and vendors referred to the variants as code pages, as IBM had always done for variants of EBCDIC encodings.\n\nUnicode is an effort to include all characters from previous code pages into a single character enumeration that can be used with a number of encoding schemes. In the process, duplicate characters are eliminated and new variants are introduced, like fullwidth ASCII. While consistent use of any single Unicode encoding would theoretically eliminate the need to keep track of different code pages or character encodings, the existence of multiple encodings of Unicode as well as the need to remain compatible with existing documents and systems that use the older encodings remains. In practice the various Unicode character set encodings have simply been assigned their own code page numbers, and all the other code pages have been technically redefined as encodings for various subsets of Unicode.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM in its EBCDIC character sets for mainframe computers.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM in its PC DOS operating system. These code pages were originally embedded directly in the text mode hardware of the graphic adapters used with the IBM PC and its clones, including the original MDA and CGA adapters whose character sets could only be changed by physically replacing a ROM chip that contained the font. The interface of those adapters (emulated by all later adapters such as VGA) was typically limited to single byte character sets with only 256 characters in each font/encoding (although VGA added partial support for slightly larger character sets).\n\nWhen dealing with older hardware, protocols and file formats, it is often necessary to support these code pages, but newer encoding systems, in particular Unicode, are encouraged for new designs.\n\nDOS code pages are typically stored in .CPI files.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM in its AIX operating system. They emulate several character sets, namely those ones designed to be used accordingly to ISO, such as UNIX-like operating systems.\n\nCode page 819 is identical to Latin-1, ISO/IEC 8859-1, and with slightly-modified commands, permits MS-DOS machines to use that encoding. It was used with IBM AS/400 minicomputers.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM in its OS/2 operating system.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM when emulating the Microsoft Windows character sets. Most of these code pages have the same number as Microsoft code pages, although they are not exactly identical. Some code pages, though, are new from IBM, not devised by Microsoft.\nThese code pages are used by IBM when emulating the Apple Macintosh character sets.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM when emulating the Adobe character sets.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM when emulating the HP character sets.\n\nThese code pages are used by IBM when emulating the DEC character sets.\n\nThese code pages are used by Microsoft in its own Windows operating system. Microsoft defined a number of code pages known as the ANSI code pages (as the first one, 1252 was based on an apocryphal ANSI draft of what became ISO 8859-1). Code page 1252 is built on ISO 8859-1 but uses the range 0x80-0x9F for extra printable characters rather than the C1 control codes used in ISO-8859-1. Some of the others are based in part on other parts of ISO 8859 but often rearranged to make them closer to 1252.\nMicrosoft recommends new applications use UTF-8 or UCS-2/UTF-16 instead of these code pages.\n\nThese code pages represent DBCS character encodings for various CJK languages. In Microsoft operating systems, these are used as both the \"OEM\" and \"Windows\" code page for the applicable locale.\n\nThese code pages are used by Microsoft in its MS-DOS operating system. Microsoft refers to these as the OEM code pages because they were defined by the OEMs who licensed MS-DOS for distribution with their hardware, not by Microsoft or a standards organization. Most of these code pages have the same number as the equivalent IBM code pages, although they are not exactly identical. There are minimum differences in some code pages from IBM and Microsoft.\n\nThese code pages are used by Microsoft when emulating the Apple Macintosh character sets.\n\nThe following code page numbers are specific to Microsoft Windows. IBM may use different numbers for these code pages. They emulate several character sets, namely those ones designed to be used accordingly to ISO, such as UNIX-like operating systems.\n\nHP developed a series of Symbol Sets (each with its associated Symbol Set Code) to encode either its own character sets or other vendors’ character sets. They are normally 7-bit character sets which, when moved to the higher part and associated with the ASCII character set, make up 8-bit character sets.\n\nThese code pages are independent assignments by third party vendors. Since the original IBM PC code page (number 437) was not really designed for international use, several partially compatible country or region specific variants emerged.\n\nThese code pages number assignments are not official neither by IBM, neither by Microsoft and almost none of them is referred as a usable character set by IANA. The numbers assigned to these code pages are arbitrary and may clash to registered numbers in use by IBM or Microsoft. Some of them may predate codepage switching being added in DOS 3.3.\n\nList of known code page assignments (incomplete):\n\nMany older character encodings (unlike Unicode) suffer from several problems. Some code page vendors insufficiently document the meaning of all code point values, which decreases the reliability of handling textual data through various computer systems consistently. Some vendors add proprietary extensions to some code pages to add or change certain code point values; for example, byte 0x5C in Shift JIS can represent either a back slash or a yen currency symbol depending on the platform. Finally, in order to support several languages in a program that does not use Unicode, the code page used for each string/document needs to be stored.\n\nDue to Unicode's extensive documentation, vast repertoire of characters and stability policy of characters, the problems listed above are rarely a concern for Unicode. Applications may also mislabel text in Windows-1252 as ISO-8859-1. Fortunately, the only difference between these code pages is that the code point values used by ISO-8859-1 for control characters are instead used as additional printable characters in Windows-1252. Since control characters have no function in HTML, web browsers tend to use Windows-1252 rather than ISO-8859-1. In HTML5, treating ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 is even codified as standard. Later, UTF-8 has succeeded both encodings in terms of popularity on the Internet.\n\nWhen, early in the history of personal computers, users did not find their character encoding requirements met, private or local code pages were created using Terminate and Stay Resident utilities or by re-programming BIOS EPROMs. In some cases, unofficial code page numbers were invented (e.g. CP895).\n\nWhen more diverse character set support became available most of those code pages fell into disuse, with some exceptions such as the Kamenický or KEYBCS2 encoding for the Czech and Slovak alphabets. Another character set is Iran System encoding standard that was created by Iran System corporation for Persian language support. This standard was in use in Iran in DOS-based programs and after introduction of Microsoft code page 1256 this standard became obsolete. However some Windows and DOS programs using this encoding are still in use and some Windows fonts with this encoding exist.\n\nIn order to overcome such problems, the IBM Character Data Representation Architecture level 2 specifically reserves ranges of code page IDs for user-definable and private-use assignments. Whenever such code page IDs are used, the user must not assume that the same functionality and appearance can be reproduced in another system configuration or on another device or system unless the user takes care of this specifically.\nThe code page range 57344-61439 (E000h-EFFFh) is officially reserved for user-definable code pages (or actually CCSIDs in the context of IBM CDRA), whereas the range 65280-65533 (FF00h-FFFDh) is reserved for any user-definable \"private use\" assignments.\nFor example, a non-registered custom variant of code page 437 (1B5h) or 28591 (6FAF) could become 57781 (E1B5h) or 61359 (EFAFh), respectively, in order to avoid potential conflicts with other assignments and maintain the sometimes existing internal numerical logic in the assignments of the original code pages. An unregistered private code page not based on an existing code page, a device specific code page like a printer font, which just needs a logical handle to become addressable for the system, a frequently changing download font, or a code page number with a symbolic meaning in the local environment could have an assignment in the private range like 65280 (FF00h).\n\nThe code page IDs 0, 65534 (FFFEh) and 65535 (FFFFh) are reserved for internal use by operating systems such as DOS and must not be assigned to any specific code pages.\n\n\n"}

The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter.\n\nThe concrete cover must have a minimum thickness for three main reasons:\n\nThe premature failure of corroded steel reinforcements and the expansion of the iron corrosion products around the rebars are amongst the main causes of the concrete degradation. The carbon steel of rebars is protected from oxidation by atmospheric oxygen by the high pH of concrete interstitial water. Iron bar surface is passivated as long as the pH value is higher than 10.5. Fresh cement water has a pH of about 13.5 while evolved cement water pH ~ 12.5 is controlled by the dissolution of calcium hydroxide (portlandite). Carbon dioxide present in the air slowly diffuses through the concrete cover over the rebar and progressively reacts with the alkaline hydroxides (KOH, NaOH) and with calcium hydroxide leading to the carbonatation of the hydrated cement paste. As a result, the pH of the cement drops and when its value is below 10.5 – 9.5, steel surface is no longer passivated and starts to corrode. A sufficient thickness of concrete cover is thus required in order to slow down the carbonatation process towards the rebar. The minimum concrete cover will depend on the environmental conditions encountered and must be thicker when the concrete is also exposed to moisture and chloride (proximity to the sea, use of de-icing salt for bridges or roads, ...). A high quality concrete made with a low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio will have a lower porosity and will be less permeable to water and to the ingress of corrosive species (dissolved oxygen, chloride, ...). A thicker cover or a more compact concrete will also reduce the diffusion of CO in the concrete, protecting it better from carbonatation and maintaining a higher pH for a longer time period, increasing so the rebar service life.\n\nConcrete covers are frequently used in the construction of commercial developments, homes, bridges, municipalities, curb forming, and other locations or projects requiring long-lasting, durability. Concrete and steel reinforcement bars combine to create strong, resilient in the following ways:\n\nNational codes also specify minimum cover requirements based on their respective local exposure conditions.\nLarge cover depths (50–75 mm) are required to protect reinforcement against corrosion in aggressive environments, but thick cover leads to increased crack widths in flexural reinforced concrete members. Large crack-widths (greater than 0.3 mm) permit ingress of moisture and chemical attack to the concrete, resulting in possible corrosion of reinforcement and deterioration of concrete. Therefore, thick covers defeat the very purpose for which it is provided. There is a need for judicious balance of cover depth and crack width requirements.\n\nA possible economical solution for this paradox is the placing of a second layer of corrosion-resistant reinforcement like stainless steel rebars or meshes or FRP rebars in the concrete cover to distribute the cracks.\n\n"}

The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, \"not guilty\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \"not proven\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases in which the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand the mechanism for this is a discharge.\n\nFor a host of reasons, the criminal justice system is not perfect: sometimes guilty defendants are acquitted, while innocent people are convicted. Appeal mechanisms and post conviction relief procedures may mitigate the effects of a conviction to some extent. An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice.\n\nAfter a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment. Furthermore, the conviction may lead to results beyond the terms of the sentence itself. Such ramifications are known as the collateral consequences of criminal charges.\n\nA minor conviction is a warning conviction, and it does not affect the defendant but does serve as a warning.\n\nA history of convictions are called antecedents, known colloquially as \"previous\" in the United Kingdom, and \"priors\" in the United States and Australia. The history of convictions also shows that a minor law conviction can be prosecuted as any individual's punishment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1159409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1159409", "title": "Counterattack", "text": "Counterattack\n\nA counterattack is a tactic employed in response to an attack, with the term originating in \"war games\". The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, while the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy (this may take the form of an opposing sports team or military units).\n\nA saying, attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte illustrate the tactical importance of the counterattack : \"the greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory\". In the same spirit, in his Battle Studies, Ardant du Pic noticed that \"he, general or mere captain, who employs every one in the storming of a position can be sure of seeing it retaken by an organised counter-attack of four men and a corporal\".\n\nA counterattack is a military tactic that occurs when one side successfully defends off the enemy’s attack and begins to push the enemy back with an attack of its own. In order to perform a successful counterattack, the defending side must quickly and decisively strike the enemy after defending, with the objective of shocking and overwhelming the enemy. The main concept of the counterattack is to catch the enemy by surprise. Many historical counterattacks were successful because the enemy was off guard and not expecting the counterattack.\n\nThe counterattack tactic was highlighted in Sun Tzu’s, \"The\" \"Art of War\". Written in 5 B.C, \"The Art of War\" serves as a guide on warfare and has been influential to the tactics used during war even to this day. In chapter 3, the book focuses on “stratagem” and goes over how to properly conduct a counterattack. Sun Tzu states, “Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy’s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces”. This quote advises one to wait out the enemy and conduct a counterattack when the time is right. It states that the best strategy is to stay one step ahead of the enemy, and know the enemy’s next move. Thus keeping a general always prepared for the enemy’s move, leaving opportunity for a counterattack.\n\nIn the past, there have been many notable counterattacks which have changed the course of a war. To be specific, Operation Bagration and the Battle of Austerlitz are good examples of the proper execution of a counterattack.\n\nOperation Bagration during World War II was one of the largest counterattacks in military history. In the summer of 1944 the assault by around 1.7 million Red Army soldiers successfully put the Red Army on the offensive in the Eastern Front after Nazi Germany in Operation Barbarossa had captured the territory against the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941.\n\nThe Soviet counterattack focused on Belorussia, but prior to the counterattack starting, the Soviet Union fooled Nazi military leaders into believing that the attack take place further south, near the Ukraine.\n\nTo aid the deception, the Red Army established fake army camps in the Ukraine and after German reconnaissance planes reported Soviet troop concentration in the area, panzer and infantry divisions were rushed south from Belorussia, leaving it vulnerable to a major assault.\n\nTo support the attack, partisan groups in German controlled territory were instructed to destroy German railroads to hamper German efforts to transport supplies and troops throughout the occupied territories and further weakening German Army Group Centre in the Ukraine.\n\nOn June 22, 1944, the attack on Belarus by 1.7 million Soviet troops began and overwhelmed the depleted Germans defenders.\n\nOn July 3, The Red Army captured Minsk and later liberated the rest of Belorussia.\n\nOperation Bagration was a huge Soviet success and opened a direct route to Berlin after the fall of Belorussia leading to the Red Army beginning to liberate territory that was taken by the Wehrmacht three years before.\n\nAnother military battle that utilized the counterattack tactic was the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. While fighting the Austrian and Russian armies, Napoleon purposely made it seem as if his men were weak from the fighting in several cases. Napoleon had his men retreat in an attempt to lure the Allies to battle. He purposely left his right flank open and vulnerable. This deceived the Allies into attacking and the Allies fell into Napoleon's trap. When the Allied troops went to attack Napoleon’s right flank, Napoleon quickly filled up the right flank so the attack was not effective. However, on the Allied side, a large gap was left open in the middle of the Allied front line due to troops leaving to attack the French right flank. Noticing the large hole in the middle of the Allied lines, Napoleon attacked the middle and had his forces also flank around both sides, eventually surrounding the Allies. With the Allies completely surrounded, the battle was over. The Battle of Austerlitz was a successful counterattack because the French army defended off the Allied attack and quickly defeated the Allies. Napoleon deceived the Allies. He made his men seem weak and near defeat.\n\nThe Battle of St. Vith was part of the Battle of the Bulge, which began on 16 December 1944, and represented the right flank in the advance of the German center, 5th \"Panzer-Armee\" (Armored Army), toward the ultimate objective of Antwerp. Given the task of countering the German advance, US General Bruce C. Clarke decided that a mobile defense was the best solution. Knowing that the German army was aiming for an objective far behind the battle line, he decided that they could afford to lose a few kilometers a day - the idea being that a slowing down of the advance was as good as stopping them outright, since the Germans were limited by time.\n\nThe mobile defense he used at St. Vith involved the use of M36 tank destroyers acting as a base of fire to resist the oncoming German armored thrust, slowing them down enough to then counter-attack them with a force of M4 Sherman tanks. Artillery and Infantry were involved in this process as a combined arms force. They key was not to engage the Germans in a pitched battle, but to slow their advance enough to ruin their offensive timetable. The counter-attacks ensured that the German forces could not break through the slowly retreating forces. Clarke's success was one of the first times armor had been used in a mobile defense, and was one of the turning points of the war.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22591333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22591333", "title": "Dynamic terrain", "text": "Dynamic terrain\n\nA Dynamic terrain is the representation of terrain (e.g. mountains, hills, valleys) together with the capability for modification during a simulation (e.g. a constructive soldier (i.e. battlespace entity) digging a trench).\n\nDynamic terrain has been supported in military training simulations since the mid-1990s in the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), the first trainer in the Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT) family of military training systems. At the time, the Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) at the University of Central Florida (UCF) had been researching the dynamic terrain requirements of networked military simulations, including excavation, clouds and other atmospheric events, and water flow. The complexity proposed by IST was computationally expensive and not practical for the technology available at that time. Therefore, CCTT implemented dynamic terrain events as \"dynamically placed features\" (DPFs) that described the terrain deformation, such as a \"tank ditch\". Tank ditches are either 30, 60, 90, or 120 meters long and may be oriented in three dimensions. Since CCTT represents the terrain as an equally spaced elevation grid, terrain reasoning queries are adjusted based on the presence of a DPF. Nevertheless, the dynamic terrain implementation in CCTT caused a mismatch between the CCTT Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) and the visual display. The SAF reasons on the terrain and feature geometry, whereas the visual display focuses on presenting the terrain as a realistic scene. The difference between these two representations of the terrain is similar to the difference between \"feeling\" and \"seeing\", therefore these representations store information in very different ways.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) effort sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) provided the capability to communicate and apply terrain deformations but the implementation still required high-end platforms without satisfying real-time requirements. The Dynamic Terrain Simulator (DTSim) was developed for the STOW Synthetic Environments (SE) program at the United States Army Corps of Engineers Army Geospatial Center (ASG) (formerly Topographic Engineering Center (TEC)). Other applications reused the DTSim framework for more specific implementations of the dynamic terrain capabilities, for example RunwaySim, the Hydrogeologic Simulator (HydroSim), Dynamic Terrain Scribe (DTScribe), Dynamic Terrain Agent (DTAgent), and the Ultra-High Resolution Building Simulator (UHRB-Sim) \n\nIn 2003, the U.S.Army Research Laboratory (ARL) released documentation related to their Dynamic Terrain Server (DTServer). DTServer computes structural effects of detonations and collisions and transmits the result to client simulations, making sure that all simulators share a unified terrain database. DTServer also uses a table look-up to compute the effects of blasts and collisions. The DTServer provides terrain updates by issuing distributed interactive simulation (DIS) protocol data units (PDUs). DTServer sends DIS Set Data PDUs of the following types: Breach Subtract, Breach vertices, and Ding messages. DTServer also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to inspect the state of the database. DTServer runs on three different databases: the terrain database, the object database, and the munitions database. The DIS interface has been successfully tested in the Soldier Visualization System (SVS), the After Action Review (AAR) system from IST, and the ARL DIS.\n\nThere are current efforts to include dynamic terrain capabilities in One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF). The OneSAF Environment Runtime Component (ERC) updates presented in the 2009 OneSAF Users Conference mention that OneSAF 4.0 will include support for terrain deformation such as craters, tank defilades, infantry trenches, and breach holes in walls. OneSAF's dynamic terrain implementation will use a server to resolve dynamic terrain requests. The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) is sponsoring the development of the Shared Architecture for Dynamic Environment (SHADE). SHADE will provide a framework to receive events, calculate effects, and transmit dynamic environment changes to participating applications. These efforts will seek to address the dynamic terrain capability gap in modeling and simulation identified by the U.S. Army Training And Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Intelligence Support Activity (TRISA).\n\n"}

{"id": "48694676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48694676", "title": "Food porn", "text": "Food porn\n\nFood porn is a glamourized visual presentation of cooking or eating in advertisements, infomercials, blogs cooking shows or other visual media. These may be foods of a high fat and calorie content, or exotic dishes that arouse a desire to eat or the glorification of food as a substitute for sex. Food porn often takes the form of food photography with styling that presents food provocatively, in a similar way to glamour photography or pornographic photography.\n\nThe term food pornography is used in Frank Chin's 1978 copyrighted story \"Railroad Standard Time.\" The term appears to have been coined by the feminist critic Rosalind Coward in her 1984 book \"Female Desire\" in which she writes: \"Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a way of expressing affection through a gift... That we should aspire to produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are always beautifully lit, often touched up.\" (p. 103)\n\nIt is important to realize that the term food porn does not strictly deal with the connection, often established throughout history, between food items and sexual contents. In the United States, food porn is a term applied when \"food manufacturers are capitalising on a backlash against low-calorie and diet foods by marketing treats that boast a high fat content and good artery-clogging potential\". The origin of the term was attributed to the Center for Science in the Public Interest which began publishing a regular column called \"Right Stuff vs. Food Porn\" for its Nutrition Action Healthletter in January 1998.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term became popular in the 1990s due to the TV cookery programme \"Two Fat Ladies\" after the shows producer described the \"pornographic joy\" the pair of them took in using vast quantities of butter and cream.\n\nTaking a picture of food became one of the norms for the younger generation in the world. Study from YPulse shows 63% of people between thirteen years old to thirty two years old posted their food picture while they are eating on social networking services. Moreover, 57% of people in the same age range posted information of the food they were eating at that time. From the percentage, food and social media are starting to connect together as trend. People using the hashtag #foodporn helps the food industry to track audiences on social networking services.\n\nThe term food porn has shifted throughout its first appearances. Articles mentioned food porn as early as the late 1970s. The phrase food porn was used in a literal manner, describing food that was unhealthy for human consumption, directly comparing it to pornography. Its use then took on a new meaning, being used to describe food that was presented and prepared in a manner that was aesthetically appealing. It took on this use for over a decade, until the social media boom that was created by the internet. Once the early 2000s hit, the terminology evolved into a way of documenting meals that are recognized for their presentation. This desire for food has flooded the internet, having significant effects on social media sites that provide the ability to display such as Instagram, Flickr, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The popularity of displaying food in a physically appealing manner is driven by the users that create these communities. The use of hashtags that the users of these sites have adapted to, allow food porn to connect people in a way that documents anything about the food such as, foods that reflect cultures, calories, presentation, preparation, delicious taste, and anything else that adds to the authenticity of the meal.\n\nThe term \"food porn\" refers to images of food across various social media platforms such as TV, cooking magazine, online blog, mobile apps, websites and social media platforms. The reason why food porn is strongly connecting with popular culture is due to the fact that people are exposed to food in their everyday lives. Food porn is not specific to social media platforms and could also be part of the category on newspaper and online blog. Moreover, food porn is experienced globally. Language barriers that exist culturally can be bypassed by the usage of #foodporn. Food porn is used collectively by the online users and is does not exclude or privilege one food over another.\n\nContemporary literature and cinema consistently connect food and sexuality. Scholars note historical links between eating and sex, such as male and female humans coming together throughout evolution around food and creating offspring—two essential needs for survival. Today, a more obvious connection exists between the physical acts of eating and having sex in popular culture. In his book \"Food: The Key Concepts\", Warren Belasco examines this particular resonance between kitchen and bedroom in modern-day vocabulary: \"these intensely sexualized associations between eating and loving make it difficult to adopt the asceticism implied in eating responsibly. If pastry, sugar, fat, meat, and salt are so closely tied to life’s most intimately pleasurable experiences, who would ever want to cut back on them?\"\n\nObserving the #foodporn revolution through the lens of digital pornography, scholars have proposed various underlying implications that this social media phenomenon has on users today. Food porn does not supplement sex. It substitutes food as a dangerous desire or a delicious dream. Pornographic images and videos often depict an exciting, unrealistic setting whose very purpose is to stimulate desire for these forbidden fantasies—scandalous images gain attention due to humans fascination with others’ private lives, and porn represents these unattainable visions. Unfortunately, this glorification of the ultimate fantasy severely limits what sex is interpreted as for viewers. For example, the pornography industry has been criticized for primarily featuring white, heterosexual actors (focused on the male’s pleasure), and thus excluding people of other races, sexualities, and abilities. Food porn is argued to operate similarly: it provocatively idolizes unattainably expensive meals at exotic restaurants that, for many, is out of financial reach. Food porn implies a limited accessibility, while idolizing the concept of \"leakage\" that offers a vicarious thrill and makes viewers feel energized by this scandalous viewing. Food porn, it is argued, embodies a new relevance when the pornographic metaphor is emphasized—underneath the oozing hamburgers and foot-tall brownie sundaes is a glorification of invading privacy and unspoken implications about who \"can\" access these fantastical treats. On this analysis food porn glorifies a particular, wealthy lifestyle meant to be universally stimulating but realistically available to a small percentage of people due to financial or logistic factors.\n\n\n"}

African languages were lost among Africans when they were taken into captivity as part of the slave trade, and adherents of Rastafari teachings believe that English is an imposed colonial language. Their remedy for this situation has been the creation of a modified vocabulary and dialect, reflecting a desire to take language forward and to confront what they see as the confusion of a corrupt and decadent society they call Babylon. This is accomplished by avoiding words and syllables seen as negative, such as \"back\", and changing them to positive ones.\n\nSome if not most Rastas choose not to use certain words in the English language as they have Babylonian and devil-like connotations. For example, the word \"hello\" is not used because it contains the word \"hell\" and \"lo\" referring to \"low\". Instead words such as 'Wa Gwaan', 'Yes I' 'Cool Nuh Iyah' are used because they are words that uplift people. If at a Rastafari church, they would use their formal church greetings. For instance, the Rastafari branch known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel would say, \"Greetings in that Most Precious and Divine Name of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has revealed Himself through the wonderful personality of H.I.M Emperor Haile Selassie the 1st of Ethiopia\"\n\nIyaric is sometimes also referred to as Wordsound — a name derived from the Rastafari principle of \"Word, Sound and Power\", which several scholars have compared to West African concepts regarding a power or essence being encapsulated within the pronounced sound of a name or word. Iyaric sometimes also plays a liturgical role among Rastafari, in addition to Amharic and Ge'ez.\n\n\n\nSeveral Rastafari words have migrated into mainstream English usage, or even widespread global usage. The term \"dreadlocks\", for example, is used worldwide for the hairstyle that was popularized by the Rastafari. Rastafari usage of words like \"Zion\" and \"Babylon\" also the term \"overstand\" and \"politricks\" have entered hip hop culture through Caribbean-American and Caribbean-British rappers/musicians. In Europe, perhaps influenced by popular culture depictions of or actual encounters with Afro-Caribbean \"rude boy\" gangs, the term \"Babylon\" is sometimes used to refer to the police.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the many languages (often called dialects) of a complex called Prakrit, and the chief Dramatic Prakrit. Maharashtri was spoken for 1000 years (500 BCE to 500 CE). It was used in numerous works of literature, and its literary use was made famous by the Sanskrit playwright Kālidāsa.\n\nMaharashtri Prakrit was commonly spoken until 875 CE and was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty. Works like \"Karpurmanjari\" and \"Saptashati\" (150BCE) were written in it. Maharashtri Prakrit was the most widely used Prakrit language in western and southern India.\n\nMaharashtri apabhraṃśas remained in use until the 13th century, and were widely used in Jain literature, forming an important link in the evolution of the language. This form of Apabhraṃśa was re-Sanskritised and eventually became Marathi.\n\nThe rise of the Prakrits is dated to the middle of the second millennium BCE when they existed alongside Vedic Sanskrit and later evolved into highly developed literary languages. It is a subject of scholarly debate as to whether Sanskrit or the Prakrits are older with some scholars contending that Sanskrit was born out of the Prakrits. According to the Sanskrit scholar, Rajaramshastri Bhagawat, Maharashtri is older and more vivacious than Sanskrit.\n\nVararuchi, the oldest known grammarian of Prakrit, devotes four chapters of his \"Prakrita-Prakasha\" () to the grammar of Maharashtri Prakrit. The other popular Prakrits—Shauraseni, Ardhamagadhi, and Paishachi—merit only one each. This preeminence of Maharashtri is confirmed by Dandin () who, in his Kavyadarsha, grants it the highest status among all Prakrits.\n\nMaharashtri is the most attested amongst all Prakrit languages. It was spoken from Malwa and Rajputana (north) to the Krishna River and Tungabhadra River region (south). Historians agree that Maharashtri and other Prakrit languages prevailed in what is now modern Maharashtra.\n\nMaharashtri was widely spoken in Western India and even as far south as Kannada-speaking region.\n\nThe \"Gāhā Sattasaī\" is attributed to King Hāla (r. 20-24 CE). Other Maharashtri Prakrit works include \"Setubandh\" and \"Karpuramañjarī\". The language was used by Vakpati to write the poem \"Gaüdavaho\". It is also used in the dialogue and songs of low-class characters in Sanskrit plays, especially the famous dramatist Kālidāsa.\n\nMaharashtri was the official language of the Satavahana dynasty in the early centuries of the Common Era. Under the patronage of the Satavahana Empire, Maharashtri became the most widespread Prakrit of its time, and also dominated the literary culture amongst the three \"Dramatic\" Prakrits of the time, Maharashtri, Shauraseni and Magadhi. A version of Maharashtri called \"Jaina Maharashtri\" was also employed to write Jain scripture.\n\n"}

She was a champion of women's rights, a proponent of anti-semitism and anti-Catholicism, and promoter of the use of Nynorsk. She was the first female to graduate from the Norwegian School of Theology. \nSteinsvik was born in Flekkefjord. he studied medicine in Kristiania, but never finished her studies because she was against vivisection. She studied several other subjects including Egyptology in London. In 1902, Marta Steinsvik studied oriental languages including Assyrian and ancient Egyptian. She also became interested in Esotericism. She was influenced by the thinking of both English Theosophist, Annie Besant and Austrian philosopher, Rudolf Steiner. She was the first woman to graduate from the Norwegian School of Theology, but was not allowed to practice. She was the first Norwegian woman to preach in a church, during 1910 at the Grønland Church in Oslo. She was invited to an international women's conference in Geneva, and planned to give a talk on women priests, until the Pope forbade all Catholic women to attend if she did, forcing her to give a speech on another subject.\n\nIn 1894 she started writing in the newspaper, \"Den 17de Mai\", which had been started that same year by her future husband Rasmus Steinsvik. She was employed as secretary to Hans Tambs Lyche, editor and founder of the cultural journal \"Kringsjaa\"'. In 1910 she became editor of the paper \"Kringsjaa\". She was multilingual and translated several books into Nynorsk, including \"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte\" written by Mark Twain and \"Quo vadis?\" written by Henryk Sienkiewicz.\n\nIn the early 1920s she was active in spreading anti-semitism and was one of the most important proponents of anti-semitism in Norway. Among other things, she delivered lectures based on the Protocolls of the Elders of Zion. \n\nIn 1928 she published an anti-Catholic book \"Sankt Peters himmelnøkler\" (\"Saint Peter's keys to Heaven\").\n\nMarta published \"Frimodige ytringer\", (\"Frank Speech\") in 1946. It was about the Norwegian treatment of suspects when they were punishing traitors after the Second World War. The book includes examples of Norwegian resistance movement torturing suspected Nazi sympathizers in the summer of 1945. It also discussed the legality of withdrawing a group's human rights, (those who were members of Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian National Socialist party, after 9 April 1940), by an ex post facto law that set aside the Hague Convention which Norway had ratified.\n\nThe papers left behind on her death are currently being organised at the Norwegian cultural institution, The Blue Colour Works. Several people have announced their plans to write a book about Marta Steinsvik.\n\n\nShe was born Marta Tonstad on the farm Skjeggestad in Bakke ( now part of Flekkefjord) in the county of Vest-Agder, Norway. Both of her parents Torkild Tonstad (1852–1908) and Ingeborg Evertsdatter Haugan (1848–1922) came from old farming families. Her father worked as a teacher in Flekkefjord and owned the farm Skjeggestad, where Marta lived until she was three years old.\n\nOn 16 May 1896, she married Rasmus Steinsvik (1863–1913), the founder and editor of \"Den 17de Mai\". She had problems in childbirth and her doctor told her a sixth child would be likely to kill her, so she moved away from her husband. Her husband had a friend who was a doctor who diagnosed her as insane as soon as he heard she believed in reincarnation, and her husband had her committed. While institutionalized, she took the opportunity to study psychology. Another doctor became interested in her case and was able to get her released. This episode was often later used against her in newspaper debates. Her husband died in 1913 after an operation, barely 50 years old.\n"}

NASA contends the murder board was created by Hans Mark, Director of Ames Research Center from 1969 to 1977, derived from the earlier concept of the tiger team.\n\nIn highly risk-averse, technical endeavors where extreme efforts are taken to prevent mistakes (e.g. satellite operations), murder boards are used to aggressively review, without constraint or pleasantries, a situation's problem, assumptions, constraints, mitigations, and the proposed solution. The board's goal is to kill the well-prepared proposal on technical merit; holding back even the least suspicion of a problem is not tolerated. Such argumentative murder boards consist of many subject matter experts of the specific system under review and of all interfacing systems.\n\nIn project management, a murder board is a process where a committee asks questions from project representatives as part of the project selection process.\n\nIn U.S. politics, murder boards are used in preparing candidates for debates and presidential appointees for Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nOn April 20, 2010 representative Mary Jo Kilroy asked former Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld if he had set up a murder board to prepare for his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee concerning the 2008 Lehman Brothers failure.

When focusing on a certain quotation, one must interpret it within its scope. Nested quotation can be used in literature (as in nested narration), speech, and computer science (as in \"meta\"-statements that refer to other statements as strings). Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each quotation level is put into perspective.\n\nIn languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech, hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and secondary quotation marks. For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major writing systems, see Quotation mark.\n\nNested quotes often become an issue using the eval keyword. The eval function is a function that converts and interprets a string as actual JavaScript code, and runs that code. If that string is specified as a literal, then the code must be written as a quote itself (and escaped accordingly).\n\nFor example:\nThis code declares a variable a, which is assigned the value 3, and a blank alert window is popped up to the user.\n\nSuppose we had to make a quote \"inside\" the quoted interpreted code. In JavaScript, you can only have \"one\" unescaped quote sublevel, which has to be the \"alternate\" of the top-level quote. If the 2nd-level quote symbol is the same as the first-level symbol, these quotes must be escaped. For example:\nFurthermore, (unlike in the literature example), the third-level nested quote must be escaped in order not to conflict with \"either\" the first- or second-level quote delimiters. This is true regardless of alternating-symbol encapsulation. Every level after the third level must be recursively escaped for all the levels of quotes in which it is contained. This includes the escape character itself, the backslash (“\\”), which is escaped by itself (“\\\\”).\n\nFor every sublevel in which a backslash is contained, it must be escaped for the level above it, and then all the backslashes used to escape that backslash as well as the original backslash, must be escaped, and so on and so forth for \"every\" level that is ascended. This is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in escaping.\n\nHere are some examples that demonstrate some of the above principles:\nNote that the number of backslashes increase from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15, indicating a 2^n-1 rule for successively nested symbols.\n\n"}

Strips would subsequently be pasted together to produce coils of 500 or 1000 stamps. At each join, the paper from the end of one strip would overlap the beginning of the next (the overlap is termed a \"paste-up tab\"). A pair of stamps that straddles the join is known as a paste-up pair.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, rotary presses came into use for printing stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the paste-up phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could be produced by the press and merely needed to be cut into strips. \n"}

He studied at various institutions, including Pritamnagar municipal school of Ahmedabad and Amreli. He matriculated in 1939 from the Navchetan High School, Ahmedabad. He initially missed out on graduate studies due to participating in the Indian independence movement of 1942, which led to him being jailed for six months. He later completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1944 in the Sanskrit and Ardhamagadhi languages, then attained his Master of Arts at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in 1946 in Sanskrit and Linguistics. Later, he went to London and joined the School of Oriental and African Studies, where he worked under the guidance of linguist Ralph Lilley Turner for his doctorate.

{"id": "32159470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32159470", "title": "Reboot", "text": "Reboot\n\nIn computing, rebooting is the process by which a running computer system is restarted, either intentionally or unintentionally. Reboots can be either \"cold\" (alternatively known as \"hard\") where the power to the system is physically turned off and back on again, causing an initial boot of the machine, or warm (alternatively known as soft) where the system restarts without the need to interrupt the power. The term restart is used to refer to a reboot when the operating system closes all programs and finalizes all pending input and output operations before initiating a soft reboot.\n\nEarly electronic computers (like the IBM 1401) had no operating system and little internal memory. The input was often a stack of punch cards. The computer was initiated by pressing a start button that performed a single command, read a card. This first card then instructed the machine to read more cards that eventually loaded a user program. This process was likened to an old saying, \"picking yourself up by the bootstraps\", referring to a horseman who lifts himself off the ground by pulling on the straps of his boots. This set of initiating punch cards was called \"bootstrap cards\". Thus a cold start was called booting the computer up. If the computer crashed, it was rebooted. The boot reference carried over to all subsequent types of computers. For more, see Bootstrapping.\n\nTechnical sources describe two contrasting forms of reboot known as a cold reboot (also a cold boot, hard reboot or hard boot) and warm reboot (also soft reboot, or soft boot), although the definition of these forms can vary slightly between sources.\n\nAccording to Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002), Cooper (2002), Tulloch (2002) and Soper (2004), on IBM PC compatible platform, a cold boot is a boot process in which the computer starts from a powerless state. All except Tulloch (2002) also mention that in cold boot, the system performs a power-on self-test (POST). In addition to the power switch, Cooper (2002) and Soper (2004) also state that the reset button, if present, may commence a cold reboot. Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002) contradicts this assertion and states that a reset button may commence either a cold or warm reboot, depending on the system. Microsoft Support article 102228 also confers that although the reset button is designed to perform a cold reboot, it may not disconnect the power to the motherboard – a state that does not correspond to the cold boot definition given above. According to Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002), both the operating system and third-party software can initiate a cold boot; the restart command in Windows 9x initiates a cold reboot, unless Shift key is held.\n\nFinding a definition for warm boot, however, is more of a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that a warm boot is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur, BIOS must be the recipient of the key combination. Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines warm boot as the result of invoking INT 19h, a BIOS interrupt call, with the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination being only one way of achieving this. According to Grimes (2001), malware may prevent or subvert a warm boot by intercepting the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS. The Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use. Soper (2004) asserts that the Windows \"Restart\" command initiates a warm boot, thus contradicting Jones, Landes, and Tittel (2002), who believe the very same action performs a cold boot.\n\nThe Linux family of operating systems supports an alternative to warm boot; the Linux kernel has optional support for kexec, a system call which transfers execution to a new kernel and skips hardware or firmware reset. The entire process occurs independently of the system firmware. The kernel being executed does not have to be a Linux kernel.\n\nOutside the domain of IBM compatible PCs, the types of boot may not be as disambiguous. According to Sue Loh of Windows CE Base Team, Windows CE devices support three types of boots: Warm, cold and clean. A warm boot discards program memory. A cold boot additionally discards storage memory (also known as the \"object store\"), while a clean boot erases \"all\" forms of memory storage from the device. However, since these areas do not exist on all Windows CE devices, users are only concerned with two forms of reboot: one that resets the volatile memory and one that wipes the device clean and restores factory settings. For example, for a Windows Mobile 5.0 device, the former is a cold boot and the latter is a clean boot.\n\nA hard reboot means that the system is not shut down in an orderly manner, skipping file system synchronisation and other activities that would occur on an orderly shutdown. This can be achieved by either applying a reset, by cycling power, by issuing the command in most Unix-like systems, or by triggering a kernel panic.\n\nThe term \"restart\" is used by Microsoft Windows and Linux family of operating systems to denote an operating system-assisted reboot. In a restart, the operating system ensures that all pending I/O operations are gracefully ended before commencing a reboot.\n\nUsers may deliberately initiate a reboot. Rationale for such action may include:\n\nThe means of performing a deliberate reboot also vary and may include:\n\nUnexpected loss of power for any reason (including power outage, power supply failure or depletion of battery on a mobile device) forces the system user to perform a cold boot once the power is restored. Some BIOSes have an option to automatically boot the system after a power failure. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS), backup battery or redundant power supply can prevent such circumstances.\n\n\"Random reboot\" is a non-technical term referring to an unintended (and often undesired) reboot following a system crash, whose root cause may not immediately be evident to the user. Such crashes may occur due to a multitude of software and hardware problems, such as triple faults. They are generally symptomatic of an error in ring 0 that is not trapped by an error handler in an operating system or a hardware-triggered non-maskable interrupt.\n\nSystems may be configured to reboot automatically after a power failure, or a fatal system error or kernel panic. The method by which this is done varies depending whether the reboot can be handled in software, or must be handled at the firmware or hardware level. Operating systems in the Windows NT family (from Windows NT 3.1 through Windows 7) have an option to modify the behavior of the error handler so that a computer immediately restarts rather than displaying a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error message. This option is enabled by default on some editions.\n\nThe introduction of advanced power management allowed operating systems greater control of hardware power management features. With Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), newer operating systems are able to manage different power states and thereby sleep and/or hibernate. While hibernation also involves turning a system off then subsequently back on again, the operating system does not start from scratch, thereby differentiating this process from rebooting.\n\nA reboot may be simulated by software running on an operating system. For example: the Sysinternals BlueScreen utility, which is used for pranking; or some modes of the bsod XScreenSaver \"hack\", for entertainment (albeit possibly concerning at first glance). Malware may also simulate a reboot, and thereby deceive a computer user for some nefarious purpose.\n\nMicrosoft App-V sequencing tool captures all the file system operations of an installer in order to create a virtualized software package for users. As part of the sequencing process, it will detect when an installer requires a reboot, interrupt the triggered reboot, and instead simulate the required reboot by restarting services and loading/unloading libraries.\n\nWindows 8 & 10 enable (by default) a hibernation-like \"Fast Startup\" (a.k.a. \"Fast Boot\") which can cause problems (including confusion) for users accustomed to turning off computers to (cold) reboot them.\n\n"}

The work itself is usually retained by the academy, and many academies have large and valuable collections acquired in this way. Alternative terms include \"diploma work\" at the Royal Academy in London (where some 18th and 19th century examples are on display), \"diploma piece\", and in France at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, \"tableau de réception\" or \"morceau de réception\". The term masterpiece originated in the same way under the earlier system of guilds, including those for artists. \n\nThe requirement to submit a reception or diploma piece is closely related to the practice in the medieval period and later of requiring a craftsman to submit one or more virtuoso or test-pieces to a guild to demonstrate his skill before he was granted membership.\n\nMembership of an academy may be by genre or technique and limited by numbers or age. The Royal Academy, London, for instance, at one time limited the number of engravers who could join, and where artistic styles and tastes change, new categories of membership may be created as necessary.\n\nWhen Antoine Watteau applied to join the \"Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture\", there was no suitable category for his \"fête galante\" works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a \"peintre des festes galantes\". While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of the genre, it also prevented him being recognised as a history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, later said: \"The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.\"\n\nIn 1728, when Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin was admitted to the same academy for \"The Ray\", it was as a \"painter of animals and fruits\".\n\n\n"}

On the other hand, the blue pill represented a beautiful prison—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the simulated reality of the Matrix.\n\nOn December 1, 1969 the Selective Service System of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the Vietnam War for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque blue plastic capsules that resembled large blue pills. The blue pills were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. The blue pills were then drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The order that each birthdate was drawn signified the draft order for that birthdate. From this first draft lottery, 195 birth dates were selected to serve in Vietnam.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter's book \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" features a pair of characters who \"push-into\" and \"pop-out of\" the two-dimensional world of Escher prints. The way they do this is to drink from a blue or a red phial. A further reference could be taken later in the story when the pair encounter a paradox during which \"The System crashed\". Hofstadter cites Lewis Carroll as a strong influence on the book (the front cover of the book has a line that says that the book is \"in the spirit of Lewis Carroll\".) The \"push-into\" and \"pop-out of\" phials are reminiscent of the \"Alice in Wonderland\" \"drink me\" and \"eat me\" potion and cake, which cause Alice to shrink and grow.\n\nThe science fiction film \"Total Recall\" (1990) features a red pill which is offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Douglas Quaid, by one Dr. Edgemar. He is told \"it's a symbol, of your desire to return to reality.\" No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words \"inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.\" Quaid seriously considers the offer but notices that Dr. Edgemar is sweating, whereupon he shoots him in the forehead. The implication is that if the dream is not a dream but reality, Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid, and the pill is simply poison. He had also told Quaid that if Quaid killed him, \"the walls of reality will come crashing down\"; moments after his death, the walls of the hotel room literally come crashing down.\n\n\"The Matrix\" (1999), directed by The Wachowskis, makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including gnosticism, existentialism, and nihilism. The film's premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Zhuangzi's \"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly\", René Descartes's skepticism and evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the \"Ding an sich\", Robert Nozick's \"experience machine\", the concept of a simulated reality and the brain in a vat thought experiment. \"The Matrix\" very clearly references \"Alice in Wonderland\" with the \"white rabbit\" and the \"down the rabbit hole\" phrases, as well as referring to the Matrix as \"Wonderland\".\n\nJapanese director Mamoru Oshii's \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a strong influence.\n\nIn \"The Matrix\", Neo (Keanu Reeves) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named Morpheus. Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), introduces Neo to Morpheus.\n\nMorpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:\n\nAs narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a \"location device\" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be \"unplugged\" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.\n\nNeo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and bioelectricity consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Lana Wachowski said:\nIn \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", when Ben Stiller's character lands at Nuuk in Greenland, he asks the man in the airport booth: \"Do you have any cars available?\" \"Yeah, we have a blue one and a red one\", the man replies. \"I'll take the red one\", says Walter. \"The choice between the red and blue car at the rental car lot is worthy of mention, if only because it almost candidly pulls the idea from the red pill of \"The Matrix\". Two jelly bean, or pill, shaped cars , red and blue; the only thing missing is Lawrence Fishburne working the counter\". \"The passage connecting reality to illusion is often visualised using tangible things and physical environments [as] Neo took the red pill in \"The Matrix\".\"\n\nAn essay written by Russell Blackford discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first \"Matrix\" film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to \"shove the red pill right up [his] ass.\" When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, \"Ignorance is bliss.\" Blackford argues that the \"Matrix\" films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer James Patrick Kelly feel that \"The Matrix\" stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.\n\n\"Matrix Warrior: Being the One\" author Jake Horsley compared the red pill to LSD, citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as addictive, calling \"The Matrix\" series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.\n\nIn the book \"The Art of the Start\", author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "328801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328801", "title": "Shemale", "text": "Shemale\n\nShemale (also known as she-male) is a term primarily used in sex work to describe a transgender woman with male genitalia and female secondary sex characteristics, usually including breasts from breast augmentation or use of hormones.\n\nMany transgender people regard the term \"shemale\" as offensive, arguing that it mocks or shows a lack of respect towards transgender individuals; in this view, the term emphasizes the natal sex of a person and neglects their gender identity.\n\nUsing the term \"shemale\" for a transsexual woman often implies that she is working in the sex trade. The phrase is commonly used in pornography.\n\nThe term \"shemale\" has been used since the mid-19th century, when it was a humorous colloquialism for \"female\", especially an aggressive woman.\n\nSome biologists have used \"shemale\" to refer to male non-human animals displaying female traits or behaviors, such as female pheromones being given off by male reptiles. \n\nThe term is used by some psychologists to refer to male-to-female transsexual people who have transitioned to female but have not undergone genital surgery.\n\nBiologist and Darwin-critic, Joan Roughgarden, rejected use of the term in the reptile literature, as she says it is \"degrading and has been borrowed from the porn industry.\" She writes that \"gynomorphic male\" and \"andromorphic female\" are preferred in scientific literature, adding, \"I hope future work on these animals is carried out with more professionalism.\"\n\nSome mental health researchers consider attraction to transgender people to be a paraphilia. John Money and Margaret Lamacz proposed a series of terms along these lines. \"Gynemimetophilia\" denotes sexual attraction to male-assigned people who look or act like women, including genetically male crossdressers. It can also refer to an attraction to trans women. A related term is \"gynemimesis\" which refers to a homosexual male who engages in female impersonation without sex reassignment or to describe the adoption of female characteristics by a male. The terms were used by Money for classification purposes in his gender-transposition theory. He also proposed \"gynandromorph\" and \"gynemimetomorph\" as technical terms for trans women. A \"gynandromorph\" is an organism that contains both male and female characteristics. \"Gynandromorphy\" is a term of Greek etymology which means to have some of the body morphology and measurements of both an average woman and man.\n\nPsychologist Ray Blanchard and psychiatrist Peter Collins coined the term \"gynandromorphophilia\". Sociologist Richard Ekins writes that this attraction can include both identification and object choice in \"fantasy femaling\" masturbatory scripts. Blanchard has proposed that this is \"partial autogynephilia.\" Psychiatrist Vernon Rosario has called labels like these \"scientifically reifying\" when applied to those attracted to trans women.\n\nAs an alternative to a paraphilic model, sexologists Martin S. Weinberg and Colin J. Williams have used the term \"Men Sexually Interested in Transwomen\" (MSTW). \n\nSlang terms for individuals with such preferences include \"transfans\", \"tranny chasers\" and \"admirers.' Other slang terms for \"she-male\" that emerged from sex work include \"tranny\" and rhyming terms (not to be confused with rhyming slang), including \"chicks with dicks\" or \"sluts with nuts\".\n\nIn Japan, the term \"New Half\" is used for trans people. It is a variation on the familiar term \"hafu\" (half or ハーフ) that is commonly used for people of mixed Japanese descent, signifying that transgender people are a new type of \"half\".\n\nSince the mid-19th century, the term \"she-male\" has been applied to \"almost anyone who appears to have bridged gender lines\", including effeminate men and lesbians. In the early 19th century, \"she-male\" was used as a colloquialism in American literature for female, often pejoratively. Davy Crockett is quoted as using the term in regard to a shooting match; when his opponent challenges Davy Crockett to shoot near his opponent's wife, Davy Crockett is reported to have replied: \"'No, No, Mike,' sez I, 'Davy Crockett's hand would be sure to shake, if his iron pointed within a hundred miles of a shemale, and I give up beat...'\" It was used through the 1920s to describe a woman, usually a feminist or an intellectual. \n\nThe term came to have a more negative connotation over time and been used to describe a \"hateful woman\" or \"bitch.\" Up through the mid-1970s, it was used to describe an assertive woman, \"especially a disliked, distrusted woman; a bitch.\"\n\nThe term later took on an implicit sexual overtone. In her 1990 book, \"From Masculine To Feminine And All points In Between\", Jennifer Anne Stevens defined \"she-male\" as \"usually a gay male who lives full-time as a woman; a gay transgenderist.\" \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" defines \"she-male\" as \"a passive male homosexual or transvestite.\" It has been used as gay slang for \"faggot\".\n\nIn 1979, Janice Raymond employed the term as a derogatory descriptor for transsexual women in her controversial book, \"The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male\". Raymond and other cultural feminists like Mary Daly argue that a \"she-male\" or \"male-to-constructed female\" is still male and constitutes a patriarchal attack by males upon the female essence. In some cultures it can also be used interchangeably with other terms referring to trans women.\n\nThe term has since become an unflattering term applied to male-to-female transsexual people. Psychologists Dana Finnegan and Emily Mcnally write that the term \"tends to have demeaning connotations.\" French professor John Phillips writes that \"shemale\" is \"a linguistic oxymoron that simultaneously reflects but, by its very impossibility, challenges [gender] binary thinking, collapsing the divide between the masculine and the feminine.\" Trans author Leslie Feinberg writes, \"'he-she' and 'she-male' describe the person's gender expression with the first pronoun and the birth sex with the second. The hyphenation signals a crisis of language and an apparent social contradiction, since sex and gender are 'supposed' to match.\" The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has said the term is a \"dehumanizing slur\" and should not be used \"except in a direct quote that reveals the bias of the person quoted.\"\n\nSome have adopted the term as a self-descriptor but this is often in context of sex work. Gender non-conforming author Kate Bornstein wrote that a friend who self-identified as \"she-male\" described herself as \"tits, big hair, lots of make-up, and a dick.\" Sex researchers Mildred Brown and Chloe Rounsley said, \"She-males are men, often involved in prostitution, pornography, or the adult entertainment business, who have undergone breast augmentation but have maintained their genitalia.\" According to Professors Laura Castañeda and Shannon Campbell at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Journalism, \"Using the term \"she-male\" for a transsexual woman would be considered highly offensive, for it implies that she is working 'in the [sex] trade.' It may be considered libelous.\" Melissa Hope Ditmore, of the Trafficked Persons Rights Project, notes the term \"is an invention of the sex industry, and most transwomen find the term abhorrent.\" Biologist and transgender activist Julia Serano notes that it remains \"derogatory or sensationalistic.\" According to sex columnist Regina Lynn, \"Porn marketers use 'she-male' for a very specific purpose — to sell porn to straight guys without triggering their homophobia — that has nothing to do with actual transgendered people (or helping men overcome their homophobia, either).\" According to sex columnist Sasha, \"The term shemale is used in this setting to denote a fetishized sexual persona and is not typically used by transgendered women outside of sex work. Many transgendered women are offended by this categorization and call themselves T-girls or trans.\"\n\nIn addition to its use in pornography, the term has been used as a punch line or for rhetorical effect. Flora Finch starred in \"The She-Male Sleuth\", a 1920 film comedy. As part of the 42nd Street Art Project in 1994, designer Adelle Lutz turned a former shop in Times Square called American Male into \"American She-Male\", with brightly colored mannequins and clothes made of condoms. The 2004 \"Arrested Development\" episode \"Sad Sack\" had a gag where Maeby tricks Lindsay into wearing a shirt that says \"Shémale\", in order to convince a suitor Lindsay is transgender. Film critic Manohla Dargis has written about the lack of \"real women\" in summer blockbusters, claiming Judd Apatow comedies feature men who act more like leading ladies: \"These aren't the she-males you find in the back pages of \"The Village Voice\", mind you. The Apatow men hit the screen anatomically intact: they’re emasculated but not castrated, as the repeated images of the flopping genitals in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" remind you.\" \n\nThe word came under extreme criticism when it was used during episode four of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 6. Logo TV, the show's broadcast station, released a statement on April 14, 2014 saying: \"We wanted to thank the community for sharing their concerns around a recent segment and the use of the term 'she-mail' on Drag Race. Logo has pulled the episode from all of our platforms and that challenge will not appear again. Furthermore, we are removing the 'You've got she-mail' intro from new episodes of the series. We did not intend to cause any offense, but in retrospect we realize that it was insensitive. We sincerely apologize.\"\n\n"}

The term is often used in the telecommunication field.\n\nIn telephony, sidetone is the effect of sound picked up by the telephone's transmitter (mouthpiece) and instantly introduced at a low electronic signal level into the receiver (earpiece) of the same handset, a form of feedback. \n\nSidetone in 19th century telephones varied until the carbon transmitter was used, which produced a distinct sidetone that discouraged speaking loudly enough, and occasionally so loud as to cause the instrument to produce uncontrolled oscillations, resulting in \"howling\" audio effects. Sidetone is disabled when phones of any kind are running in speakerphone mode, due to perpetual and almost immediate feedback. Anti-sidetone circuitry incorporating the principle of the hybrid coil brought sidetone under control in the early 20th century, leaving enough feedback signal to assure the user that the phone is really working, and allowing the use of a unitized telephone handset. In cellular technologies, one of the many benefits of sidetone-enabled phones is that a user knows a call has been dropped or ended if he or she no longer hears sidetone. Comfort noise provides a similar benefit.\n\nAlmost all land-line (wired and wireless) phones have employed sidetone, so naturally it was an expected convention for cellular telephony but is not standard by any means. Usability experts believe that lack of adequate sidetone causes some people to shout or speak too loudly when using a cell phone (this behavior is sometimes referred to as \"cell yell\"). \n\nSidetone is valuable for the hearing impaired. The amount of sidetone typically found on land-lines is 8%, and is 4% for cellular phones. Sidetone can be, and often is, amplified for land-line phones for the hearing impaired. In VOIP technologies such as Skype, sidetone has been experimented with but has not been formally adopted by software or hardware & accessories creators. Several software packages and wiring workarounds have been developed that replicate sidetone, but feedback looping remains a problem.\n\nIn wireless telegraphy (WT) and amateur radio, sidetone is the audible indication of a continuous wave (CW) signal as the operator sends Morse Code. As in telephony, sidetone serves as feedback to the operator that what they are sending is what is intended. \n\nIt is designed to mimic the tone generated by a typical radio receiver when a CW signal is converted to the intermediate frequency (IF), then mixed with the Beat frequency oscillator (BFO) frequency to generate a \"difference frequency\", which is audible over the radio receiver loudspeaker or headphones.\n\nSidetone is also used on voice radio equipment to give the radio operator confidence that they are transmitting over the radio. The sidetone audio is typically derived from the transmit audio circuitry.\n\nIn aviation audio systems the loudness of the sidetone heard in a helmet or headset may be adjusted to suit personal comfort, although this may lead to communication problems since the person speaking will be largely unaware of how his transmission sounds to the recipient. The ideal level for the right psychoacoustic behavior is reported to be about 7dB below the received audio, according to RTCA specification DO-214. If the headset signal level is set too high, the pilot will inevitably speak more softly, resulting in too low a level of modulation to the radio transmitter.\n\nWhen a commentator, announcer, or MC for a public event may otherwise be able to hear their own voice in the delayed output from the loudspeakers, they may opt to use a headset which provides instant sidetone of their own voice, thus removing the distracting effect of greatly delayed feedback from the loudspeakers.\n\n"}

{"id": "42122506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42122506", "title": "The Rhetorical Presidency", "text": "The Rhetorical Presidency\n\nThe rhetorical presidency is a political communication theory that describes the communication and government style of U.S. presidents in the twentieth century. This theory describes the transition from a presidency that directed rhetoric toward the United States Congress and other government bodies, to one that addresses rhetoric, policy and ideas directly to the public.\n\nAfter political scientists introduced this theory in 1981, Jeffrey Tulis authored \"The Rhetorical Presidency\" in 1987 establishing itself as the first book on the theory. Tulis established three stages in his book how presidential rhetoric evolved throughout the U.S.' history: the \"\"Old Way\", the \"Middle Way\" and the \"New Way\"\". Tulis's book sparked much debate over the historical evolution of presidential rhetoric. Presidential rhetoric integrates both verbal and visual rhetoric practices to gather the support of the public. \nThe term \"rhetorical presidency\" was introduced by political scientists James Ceaser, Glen E. Thurow, Jeffrey Tulis, and Joseph Bessette in 1981. Tulis wrote the foundational book on the subject entitled \"The Rhetorical Presidency\", in 1987. Tulis' book spurred heated debate on the history and evolution of presidential rhetoric, with Tulis himself later revising positions taken in his book.\n\nBy relying less on the traditional methods of communication with Congress and, Presidents rely more on the approval of the people as a means of governance. Presidents hope the people put pressure on their members of Congress to side with the President.\nHe claimed that changes in the rhetorical style of the presidency were a symptom of a shift in American's underlying conceptions regarding how government should function. Rhetorical presidency cut congressional dominion, influenced the power to fit public policy, and put the president in front with the American people to show the development of leadership as an imperative demeanor of presidential character and politics.\n\nThe rhetorical presidency is both a structural theory and a theory of how presidents communicate in the media age. It draws from political science, history and communication studies.\n\nTulis delineates the historical arc of presidential rhetoric in the United States as having three stages: the \"\"Old Way\", the \"Middle Way\" and the \"New Way\"\".\n\nThe Old Way (1789–1900) corresponds with traditional conventions of statecraft and rhetoric addressed to Congress, the courts or visiting dignitaries. Most presidential rhetoric was delivered in writing. The only attempt during this period to use rhetoric to address the whole people was President Andrew Johnson's Swing Around the Circle, which failed.\n\nThe Middle Way (1900–1913) marks a hybrid between internal and external appeals on important matters epitomized by the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. He met fierce opposition from his own party in Congress regarding the Hepburn Act, with appeals directly to the people. William McKinley's 1898 speaking tour is argued to be an integral part of developing the \"Middle Way\" that Theodore Roosevelt is mainly credited for.\n\nThe New Way (1913–present) refers to a presidency which dispenses with traditional statecraft and instead regularly engages the public. Woodrow Wilson employed two types of rhetoric: the policy speech and the visionary speech. A policy speech explains and defends the president's policy on a certain issue, while the visionary speech articulates a goal for the future and calls the nation towards that goal. Since Wilson, all Presidents have emphasized these tools.\n\nVerbal rhetoric used by Presidents is the most common type of presidential rhetoric used. The implication of Woodrow Wilson's policy speeches and visionary speeches laid the groundwork for the following Presidents. The use of the State of the Union Address is an example of Presidents explaining and defending their own policies to gain the support of the public directly. \n\nUsing visual images, text and video to influence or persuade an audience is how Presidents utilize visual rhetoric in their own presidential rhetoric. The increasing growth of the mass media has increased the value of visual rhetoric in helping create a positive political image with the people.\n"}
{"id": "1436515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1436515", "title": "Throwback uniform", "text": "Throwback uniform\n\nThrowback uniforms, throwback jerseys or retro kits or heritage guernseys are sports uniforms styled to resemble the uniforms that a team wore in the past. One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries of significant events.\n\nThrowback uniforms have proven popular in all major pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the teams' merchandising departments. Because the \"authentic\" uniforms (accurate reproductions) and less-authentic \"replicas\" had been so popular at retail, the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as \"third jerseys\".\n\nThrowbacks were first popularized in Major League Baseball, where teams not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct minor league and Negro League baseball teams as well. Often, the games where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as \"Turn Back The Clock Nights\". Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in college football games, National Hockey League games, and in National Basketball Association games.\n\nThe first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman & Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and World Cup soccer), Mitchell & Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; Tiedman & Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman & Formby Vintage Athletic Co..\n\nIn some instances, teams will wear \"fauxbacks\": retro designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. For example, the Tampa Bay Rays, formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball uniforms in 2012 (although they have used Tampa Tarpons and Tampa Smokers throwback jerseys), and the Dallas Mavericks have used a 1970s-like basketball uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980. Fauxback can also refer to a retro style \"vintage inspired\" uniform that has design elements from a uniform from the past but is in itself a completely new and different design due to cosmetic adjustments. An example of this is the current Buffalo Bills NFL team uniforms that feature helmets resembling the team's white helmets from the 1970s but with a different, more modern looking stripe design.\n\nThrowbacks were introduced in the NFL in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks Collection. The rights to produce the vintage apparel was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman & Company Sportswear (exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills (sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In 1994, to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles.\n\nHowever, the designs varied widely in their accuracy:\nAll the teams were informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. The San Francisco 49ers wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their Super Bowl XXIX victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996–1997. In 1998, the gold pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their five Super Bowls.\n\nBoth of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time soon afterwards: The Jets' replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker shade of green than before), and the Giants' 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase \"ny\" instead of the underlined uppercase \"GIANTS\" – which was retained as a secondary logo – imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate logos.\n\nAs a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. The Thanksgiving Day games hosted by the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, San Diego Chargers and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season. Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However; due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns throwbacks are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when Jim Brown was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997 to 2008. In 2009, the team wore their throwbacks for the first time against the Packers on November 8 to debut the \"Buccaneers' Ring of Honor.\" The club has continued to do so annually until 2014.\n\nThe San Diego Chargers wore their 1960s style powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002 to 2006 and in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be worn 1–2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their late former head coach Bill Walsh. For the 2009 season, an updated design based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the Pittsburgh Steelers, celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on Monday Night Football on November 5 against Baltimore. The Steelers enjoyed immense success in both games, winning each handily (26–3 vs. Buffalo, 38–7 vs. Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the New York Jets twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms – once against the Philadelphia Eagles, and once against the Miami Dolphins. Since then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times – twice in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011. For two of the 2009 games, the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms.\n\nThe Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home game against the Lions on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 56–21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During Sunday Night Football on NBC that week, Keith Olbermann named the Philadelphia Eagles the \"Worst Persons in the NFL\" for their blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing \"Throwbacks? Try \"throw-ups!\"\" The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of Philadelphia, were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct Frankford Yellowjackets franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre-Jeffrey Lurie era kelly green was introduced. The kelly green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener vs. the Green Bay Packers to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the Eagles beat the Packers to win the 1960 NFL Championship.\n\nFor the 2009 season, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Football League, the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms from the early 1960s on select \"Legacy Weekends.\" The Dallas Cowboys, also celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some games.\n\nThe Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complimenting the rest of the uniform were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed the yellow circle but retained the color scheme.\n\nThe NFL imposed a new rule for the 2013 season prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them on the regular helmets.\n\nThe Texas Longhorns college football team wore throwback uniforms for a single game during their 2005 national championship season as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963 National Championship season under Coach Darrell K Royal.\n\nThe University of Virginia football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 6, 2008, in honor of Virginia's teams from 1984 through 1993. The university's athletic department termed the game a \"Retro Game\" instead of using the term \"throwback.\" The University of Virginia football team also wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 29, 2012, in honor of Virginia's 1968 team and Frank Quayle.\n\nThe University of Florida football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 30, 2006, in honor of Florida's teams in the 1960s.\n\nFor the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as part of Nike's Pro Combat program, several college football teams, including Ohio State and Oregon State wore throwback-inspired uniforms. In addition, for the 2009 playing of the \"Holy War\" rivalry against the University of Utah Utes (and also in the Las Vegas Bowl), the BYU Cougars donned royal blue throwback uniforms to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their 1984 National Championship season. These throwbacks, along with another alternate royal blue uniform, have been employed occasionally in subsequent seasons; since in 2014, they have been worn for the team's homecoming game each year.\n\nThe Kansas Jayhawks football team wore throwback uniforms on October 1, 2011 to honor the 50th anniversary of the 1961 KU football team, winners of the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, the program's first-ever bowl victory.\n\n'Retro shirts', as they are known in the United Kingdom, are also sometimes used in association football, albeit with modern fabrics. In 2005–06 Arsenal changed their home colours from their traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as a commemoration of their final season at Highbury Stadium; this colour was supposedly the same shade the team had worn when they first played at Highbury in 1913, although later evidence suggested that Arsenal's main colour at that time was a more standard shade known as 'Garibaldi red'. Redcurrant, however, still played a part in their kits since; most recently on their yellow change kit featuring redcurrant shorts and pinstripes on the shirt and socks, between 2010 and 2012.\nManchester United wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as \"Newton Heath\". The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced for their centenary in 1992 and worn for two seasons as a third kit. They wore a replica of their jersey from 1958 during the Manchester derby against Manchester City on February 10, 2008 at Old Trafford to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation by the Premier League to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos and kit markings, and used the traditional \"one to eleven\" numbering scheme rather than using squad numbers. In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, competition sleeve patches, and the player name and squad number on the kit but added a black ribbon above the right breast. The previous season, 2006–07, United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of the Busby Babes' first league championship. After their Champions League victory in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for 2008–09, celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win. The club unveiled an all-blue third kit, based on the one worn against Benfica in the 1968 final.\n\nMore authentic reproductions of kits from the past have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful or memorable teams. When France won the 1998 World Cup, their uniform was reminiscent of the design of the triumphant Euro 1984 team, with a red horizontal stripe and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest.\n\nWhen the United States men's soccer team took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the U.S. Soccer Federation's first uniform worn in 1916. A similar uniform was produced in 2013, complete with vintage crest, to mark the 100th anniversary of the USSF.\n\nFor the FIFA Centenary Match in 2004, France and Brazil played in kits resembling their first ever home kits. The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with green trim after the 1950 World Cup defeat.\n\nTottenham Hotspur celebrated their 125th anniversary during the 2007–08 season by launching a special kit in the club's early colours, sky blue and white, which were originally worn in 1885. The kit was worn for one game only, a 4–4 home draw to Aston Villa.\n\nFor the 2009–10 Premier League, newly promoted Burnley wore a redesigned version of their 1959–60 Football League kits, when they last won the then-First Division.\n\nSouthampton celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in 2010–11, by wearing the strip worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt with a red sash, white shorts and black socks.\n\nDuring the later stages of the 2011–12 season, financially troubled Scottish club Rangers wore their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours of the burgh of Govan (where Ibrox Stadium is located) in an attempt to raise money. The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty for the 2012–13 season.\n\nEnglish club West Bromwich Albion wore a replica of their 1968 FA Cup Final kit, in their Premier League game against Leicester City on 11 April 2015. It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer in the 1968 Cup Final, Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 due to chronic traumatic encephalopathy as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through his career. The kit used the 1–11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days.\n\n2014–15 Scottish Championship winners Heart of Midlothian F.C. chose for their current season a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914–15 season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914–15 shirt bore no badge, the current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the Scottish league, volunteered for the Great War effort en-masse in November 1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th Battalion Royal Scots, commanded by George McCrae (politician) MP. Spurred on by Hearts, \"McCrae's Battalion\" also attracted players and supporters from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team to join up, Hearts and \"McCrae's Battalion\" were mentioned in thanks by Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation of other football and sportsmen battalions of Kitchener's Army. Heart of Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed and unable to resume their careers after the war.\n\nThrowback uniforms, more commonly called heritage guernseys, are worn occasionally by clubs in the Australian Football League, mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual \"Heritage Round\", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from either their club or state.\n\nThe heritage guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national football the years before World War I and the South Australian National Football League for the 19th century, was black with a white \"prison bars\" design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the Collingwood Football Club, who also wear black and white although in a different design. Whether or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has been a point of contention between the clubs.\n\nThe most recent instance of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the 2014 AFL season.\n\nIn 1990, the Chicago White Sox wore replicas of their 1917 World Series uniforms against the Milwaukee Brewers as part of the White Sox celebration of the final season at Comiskey Park. During the game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone. Since then, these games have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV highlight shows. ESPN, for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the highlights and showed them in black and white to emulate the silent film of the era. The team then adopted a modified version of the 1959 \"Go-Go Sox\" era jerseys for the first year at the new Comiskey Park in 1991, having kept that design since and winning the 2005 World Series in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship drought.\n\nWith the introduction of interleague play, when the Atlanta Braves played the Boston Red Sox for the first time in a regular season game in Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified as 'Boston' by their uniforms.\n\nSome throwback nights featured the Oakland Athletics wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the Pittsburgh Pirates' black-and-gold combo from the same era – on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold.\n\nIn 2003 the St. Louis Cardinals hosted the Baltimore Orioles with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said \"Browns\" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well.\n\nAlso in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the first modern World Series, the two participants in that game (the Boston Red Sox and the Pittsburgh Pirates) met in a 3-game interleague series at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have uniform numbers at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The JumboTron screen was left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team names at the time: the \"Boston Americans\" and the \"Pittsburg Pirates\". The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as using a megaphone for announcements.\n\nIn 2006 the New York Mets, in honor of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a \"turn-back-the-clock-night\" and wore their 1986 uniforms. In 2009 the Mets played three games of a four-game set against the San Francisco Giants in a \"fauxback\" jersey based on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant \"NY\" on the chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's past instead of their franchise's past; while the Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers, both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the Washington Nationals, have worn both Twins-Senators and Rangers-Senators throwbacks as well.) In 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies adopted an alternate uniform based on their 1948 uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white color background.\nNot all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration Negro Leagues by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the Homestead Grays played \"home\" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms and Pittsburgh the away ones.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays have staged a \"Turn Back the Clock\" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms of historical local teams such as the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball Association (worn in 2008), the St. Petersburg Saints (2007) and Tampa Smokers (2011) of the Florida International League, and the University of Tampa Spartans (2000). The Rays have worn their own uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore Devil Rays \"rainbow\" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season. Usually, the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston Astros wore their 1980s \"Rainbow Guts\" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 road uniforms of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Mets wore the road unis of their 1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms from the early 1970s.\n\nThe San Diego Padres have also worn multiple throwback uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the Pacific Coast League. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, including the 1969 \"first major league season\" brown and gold, 1984 \"first World Series\" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and \"RAK\" on the sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of the New York Mets, as the owners of the team at the time were investors from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final home game on September 30, the visiting Chicago Cubs and the Padres both wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two teams played against each other.\n\nIn recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove \"MB\" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform.\n\nIn 2008, the Toronto Blue Jays unveiled their new \"Flashback Friday\" powder blue throwback uniforms, similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (most notably, their 1974 \"All Red\" home uniforms), They have also worn uniforms based on the 1948 Indians in honor of Larry Doby, the first African-American player in the American League with the Indians.\n\nThe 2011 Arizona Diamondbacks celebrated the tenth anniversary of their 2001 World Series championship on September 9–11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998 to 2006.\n\nTo celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders.\n\nIn the 1999 season, MLB held a series of \"Turn Ahead the Clock\" nights. It was inspired by an independently held promotion on July 18, 1998 at a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Kansas City Royals. During those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since.\n\nIn 2016, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their 1986 world championship season, the New York Mets revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games.\n\nIn 1921 a baseball game held at Rickwood Field as part of the Semicentennial of Birmingham, Alabama was played in \"old-style\" uniforms and according to \"the rules of the games as they were in 1872.\". Since 1996 Rickwood Field has been the site of the annual \"Rickwood Classic\", a regular season Birmingham Barons game in which both Southern League teams wear uniforms honoring some period of their respective histories.\n\nThe Lotte Giants of the Korea Baseball Organization has \"Again 1984/1992\" day once per month in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete with the old logo. The \"Again 1984/1992\" games are usually the most popular games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other teams in the league such as Doosan Bears and Samsung Lions have started to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well.\n\nThe Buffalo Bisons of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nIn the 1996–97 NBA season, the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as \"Hardwood Classics\". The Toronto Raptors were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct Toronto Huskies, an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the New York Knicks. The Chicago Bulls wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of Michael Jordan's career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the Golden State Warriors, whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled cable car (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early years in California).\n\nIn more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the ABA, ranging from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the Detroit Pistons' lightning bolt uniforms of the Dick Vitale era of the late 1970s, to the Miami Floridians throwbacks worn by the Heat, and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 1980s era jerseys worn by Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, and Ron Harper as well as uniforms based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the New York Knicks often wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an \"interlocking NY\" identical to the one worn by the New York Yankees on their caps and home jerseys. Most \"Hardwood Classics\" jerseys worn by current players for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric designs of the past. The Los Angeles Lakers wore throwback short-shorts in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, \"I feel violated. I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, it's another to actually wear them\". The Philadelphia 76ers began wearing throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982–83 in 2007–08 to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their old logo (modified with a newer \"6\") for the 2009–10 season.\n\nThe Orlando Magic are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003–04, 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004–05 and the white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005–06. The then-New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten American Basketball Association franchises New Orleans Buccaneers, Carolina Cougars, Los Angeles Stars, Minnesota Muskies and Memphis Tams/Pros. The San Antonio Spurs also paid tribute to their predecessors Dallas Chaparrals, while the Bulls and the Washington Wizards did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA franchises, the Stags and Zephyrs.\n\nThe usage of throwback uniforms even inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs in creating new ones. For example, the Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors reverted to their original color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, while the Magic and the Charlotte Bobcats revived the use of pinstripes on their uniforms. The Dallas Mavericks briefly used a third jersey with the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The Houston Rockets revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate uniform in 2009. The Utah Jazz are re-using their classic \"J\" note logo and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974 to 1996. The Washington Wizards also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from the old Bullets logos and the modernized \"Stars and Stripes\" uniform worn from 1974 through 1987. The New York Knicks eliminated black from their color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970–75 uniforms, sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less arched \"NEW YORK\" script. The Sacramento Kings have used their classic Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. The Denver Nuggets revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while the Oklahoma City Thunder wore alternate uniforms with a vertically arranged front script similar to those worn by the Oscar Robertson-era Cincinnati Royals. The Phoenix Suns paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms featuring a modified streaking sun.\n\nIn 2003, the Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team wore throwback jerseys in home games against Kansas and Missouri to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms worn by Jack Hartman's teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's best seasons.\n\nThe Kansas Jayhawks basketball team wore throwbacks in March 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Allen Fieldhouse. In February 2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, respectively, of the 1988 NCAA championship team, and did so again in February 2012 to honor the 1952 NCAA championship team's 60th anniversary.\n\nThe Philadelphia Wings indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms for a game to wear their original orange and white jerseys worn in the early 1970s from the original National Lacrosse League. For the 100th anniversary of the rivalry between Johns Hopkins and Maryland in men's lacrosse, both teams wore special retro jerseys. During the 35th anniversary of women's field hockey at Dartmouth College, the Big Green are wearing a special harlequin-design throwback uniform.\n\nThe first documented use of a throwback uniform came during the 1998 season, when the Calgary Stampeders wore 1948 red striped jerseys to celebrate the first Grey Cup championship won by the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against the BC Lions. The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys in 2003, as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica jerseys from the 1954 BC Lions season. Those jerseys were worn four times that season with the first being the home opener that year. In both cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Roughriders wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys from 2007 to 2013, including their usage in the 97th and 98th Grey Cup.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2008 CFL season that the league started to truly embrace throwback uniforms when they announced that the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Toronto Argonauts would play two games (September 12 in Toronto and October 10 in Winnipeg) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, the 1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game. Both teams wore coloured jerseys, as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old \"Pull Together\" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special CFL \"Retro Week\" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969.\n\nFor the 2009 CFL season, all eight teams wore retro uniforms, this time based on uniforms from the 1960s. Week 3 of the 2009 season featured all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the Labour Day Classic and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch versus Edmonton. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on.\n\nIn 2010, all eight teams again wore retro uniforms and for this season it was based on uniforms worn from the 1970s. Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the Saskatchewan Roughriders wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their regular white uniforms as the away team. The Roughriders wore their regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms were worn on July 17, 2010.\n\nWhile the league had originally planned to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the 100th Grey Cup, the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the 2011 CFL season. Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms at all. In 2012, all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms.\n\nIn 2013, the Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 71st Grey Cup championship. Also that year, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 Hamilton Flying Wildcats to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their 31st Grey Cup victory. In both cases, the uniforms from these games were worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history.\n\nAs of the 2015 CFL season, the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise (Ottawa Rough Riders, Ottawa Renegades, and Ottawa Redblacks) has ever worn a throwback uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over the past 20 years.\n\nIn February 2005 at Eden Park, Auckland, Australia and New Zealand contested the very first Twenty20 cricket international match. Both teams appeared in retro 1980s-style tight-fitting one day international uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors' logos. The Australians wore their original \"yellow and gold\" whilst New Zealand were in \"beige\" inspired by the Beige Brigade sports fans. The game was played in a light-hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s-style head bands, moustaches and hairstyles.\n\nWhen Lance Armstrong won his fifth Tour de France championship, in 2003, his U.S. Postal Service-sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998.\n\nThrowbacks were first introduced in the National Hockey League in their 75th anniversary season of 1991–92. At the time, only the Original Six teams wore throwbacks, although they were also used in the All-Star game.\n\nWhile the NHL had long since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 1977).\n\nThe Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications:\n\nAs other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the New York Islanders wore a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The Buffalo Sabres pulled a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought back a 1960s-era jersey as a third jersey beginning in 1998–99. In 2003–04, the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage \"V\" patch. The following teams were among those that participated in the program:\n\nA few teams also introduced \"fauxback\" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as alternate jerseys. The Colorado Avalanche introduced burgundy third jerseys similar in design to the New York Rangers' blue ones, while the Minnesota Wild introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and Pittsburgh Penguins. The 2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game also featured faux throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a \"fauxback\" jersey designed as an homage to its American Hockey League predecessor, the Bisons, in 2010 and wore it as their third jersey until 2012.\n\nThe Bruins, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through 2006–07. The Buffalo Sabres also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it back again in 2008–09, and making it their 2009–10 home sweater. Although third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for 2007–08 so that teams could get used to the new Rbk Edge uniforms (third jerseys returned for the 2008–09 season), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based on their throwback designs.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins donned throwback uniforms in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, albeit with Reebok's \"Edge\" design template. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for the 2008–09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967–68) and their opposition, the Washington Capitals (1974–75) are expected to wear their first season replicates.\n\nIn recent years, CCM, now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the Phoenix Coyotes, the Colorado Avalanche, the Dallas Stars, the Carolina Hurricanes and the New Jersey Devils when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned \"Flying-V\" uniforms of the Vancouver Canucks were also reissued. The Winnipeg jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after it became clear that a new Winnipeg Jets franchise would be established in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the 2011 NHL Draft, where the new Jets' name was revealed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46191", "title": "Tillage", "text": "Tillage\n\nTillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or no-till methods as well.\n\nTillage is often classified into two types, primary and secondary. There is no strict boundary between them so much as a loose distinction between tillage that is deeper and more thorough (primary) and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location (secondary). Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good seedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation.\n\n\"Tillage\" can also mean the land that is tilled. The word \"cultivation\" has several senses that overlap substantially with those of \"tillage\". In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any kind of soil agitation. Additionally, \"cultivation\" or \"cultivating\" may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants.\n\nReduced tillage leaves between 15 and 30% crop residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100 kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period. This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements. See the general comments below to see how they can affect the amount of residue.\n\nIntensive tillage leaves less than 15% crop residue cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560 kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as conventional tillage but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States), it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or chisel plow. Then a finisher with a harrow, rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations.\n\nConservation tillage leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000 lb/ac (1,100 kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical soil erosion period. This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of soil erosion. Additionally, conservation tillage has been found to benefit predatory arthropods that can enhance pest control. Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, farmers realize significant savings in fuel and labor. In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage.\n\nHowever, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year's spring crop of corn.\n\n\nZone tillage is designed to only disrupt the soil in a narrow strip directly below the crop row. In comparison to no-till, which relies on the previous year’s plant residue to protect the soil and aides in postponement of the warming of the soil and crop growth in Northern climates, zone tillage creates approximately a 5-inch-wide strip that simultaneously breaks up plow pans, assists in warming the soil and helps to prepare a seedbed. When combined with cover crops, zone tillage helps replace lost organic matter, slows the deterioration of the soil, improves soil drainage, increases soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and allows necessary soil organisms to survive.\n\nIt has been successfully used on farms in the mid-west and west for over 40 years and is currently used on more than 36% of the U.S. farmland. Some specific states where zone tillage is currently in practice are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't consistent yield results in the Northern Cornbelt states; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within the agriculture industry. In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage may be used as an alternative to installing more expensive tile drainage.\n\nPlowing:\n\n\n\n\"Primary tillage\" loosens the soil and mixes in fertilizer and/or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture.\n\n\"Secondary tillage\" produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving herbicides.\n\nTilling was first performed via human labor, sometimes involving slaves. Hoofed animals could also be used to till soil by trampling. The wooden plow was then invented. It could be pulled with human labor, or by mule, ox, elephant, water buffalo, or similar sturdy animal. Horses are generally unsuitable, though breeds such as the Clydesdale were bred as draft animals. The steel plow allowed farming in the American Midwest, where tough prairie grasses and rocks caused trouble. Soon after 1900, the farm tractor was introduced, which eventually made modern large-scale agriculture possible.\n\nModern agricultural science has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of herbicides to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called no-till farming, reduces costs and environmental change by reducing soil erosion and diesel fuel usage.\n\nSite preparation is any of various treatments applied to a site in order to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the regeneration of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).\n\nSite preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.\n\nBroadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia, and in the temperate region of North America generally.\n\nPrescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:\n\nPrescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.\n\nChanges in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987) in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7 cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change. Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.\n\nEven a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954), for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.\n\nMarked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7 cm in diameter consumed. Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0 cm to 15 cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within 9 months.\n\nNitrogen will be lost from the site by burning, though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987) to have increased in 2 of 6 plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.\n\nThe \"Picea/Abies\" forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974) describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled \"Picea/Abies\" areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.\n\nSlash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem < 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the forest fire hazard on harvested sites. Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968). In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (<1.27 cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.\n\nThe need to provide shade for young outplants of Engelmann spruce in the high Rocky Mountains is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material. Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.\n\nSite preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.\n\nWang et al. (2000) determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97 cm³) compared with black spruce sheltered (210 cm³), as well as white spruce open (175 cm³) and sheltered (229 cm³) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329 cm³) than open plantations (204 cm³). Wang et al. (2000) recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.\n\nUp to 1970, no \"sophisticated\" site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario, but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.\n\nAccording to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.\n\nJ. Hall's (1970) report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been \"quite successful\" for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.\n\nSite preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985), for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).\n\nThe mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5 cm and 10 cm averaged 10 and 7 °C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25 °C to 60 °C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10 °C at 10 cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10 °C than did the control microsites.\n\nDraper et al.'s (1985) mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.\n\nWith linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by topography or other considerations, but the orientation can often be chosen. It can make a difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants (lodgepole pine) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench in each of north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows. Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south, east, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.\n\nIn a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow but snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling. Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a \"Pinus resinosa\" stand, aged 90 to 100 years.\n\n\n\n"}

This resulted in more than five translations available of the Kural text in Sanskrit. Unlike in other languages where maiden attempts of translating the Kural text is widely made in prose, all translations in Sanskrit are made in verse in the form of typical \"slokas\". This is because historically Sanskrit literature has been in verse, for which it has gained renown.\n\nThe Kural was translated into Sanskrit for the first time in 1922 by Appa Vajapeyin. It was published by Gururajachariar under the title \"Suniti Kusuma Mala\" at Kumbakonam. The second translation was published in 1937–1940 by Sankara Subramanya Sastri, who published it as \"Sugati Ratnaakaraa\" in the journal \"Sahridaya\". Another translation was published in verse by an anonymous translator. It was published in Delhi and contained prose explanation in Hindi.\n\nThe translation by Sanskrit scholar S. N. Srirama Desikan was published in 1961 and in 1978. It was published in Madras by Sarasa Kala Nilayam. Besides translating Tirukkural into Sanskrit, he has translated several other Tamil classics such as \"Ettuthogai\" (Eight Anthologies), \"Pathupāttu\" (Ten Idylls), \"Silappadikāram\", \"Thiruppāvai\", \"Kambarāmāyanam\", \"Nāladiyār\" etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17572391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17572391", "title": "William Crathorn", "text": "William Crathorn\n\nWilliam Crathorn (fl. c. 1330) was an English Dominican philosopher, from Oxford. He was a philosopher who immediately followed in the intellectual tradition of William of Ockham and worked to strengthen his philosophical works. Crathorn created unique theories in the philosophy of language and psychology, as well as in epistemology by focusing on the claims of skeptics. Other areas of Crathorn's philosophy, which have not been extensively studied, show promise is revealing more about his life and his work.\n\nAlmost nothing is certain about Crathorn's life outside of his position as lecturer at Oxford. Crathorn was born in Yorkshire and served as a Dominican friar, lecturing on a book from Peter the Lombard entitled \"Sentences\". Crathorn is also known to have lectured on the Bible during his time teaching. His date of birth and death are unknown; the year in which he lectured is known only by an eclipse mentioned in his manuscripts which is known to have occurred in July 1330.\n\nCrathorn's philosophy focuses mainly upon epistemology and the problem of knowledge. His thoughts on knowledge resemble closely those of Roger Bacon, who held that knowledge of the external world comes from recognition of different \"species\" of objects. The species which is perceived is both a cause and a likeness in the eye of the perceiver. Crathorn asserts a somewhat Kantian view that we have no direct access to things in the external world and that we immediately perceive only their mental likenesses or representations (their species). Crathorn believed that since concepts can only belong to the category of quality, they must be mental qualities having the same nature as non-mental qualities and they must exist subjectively in the mind, which is to say that they exist in some part of the brain. To illuminate this theory, he offered theories of explaining brain function and how such relates to the philosophy of knowledge.\n\nCrathorn affirms that whenever one is contemplating a certain concept, the mind of the person thinking it actually mirrors the concept. He thought that mental concepts cannot resemble substances but only qualities of substances because the species of substance would have to be a substance itself and our minds would turn into a new substance if we thought of it. It also cannot be a pure quantity because in thinking of infinite magnitudes, our minds would become infinite, and the same is true for the other categories besides quality. Crathorn held that one's ability to conceptualize is therefore limited to natural concepts of qualities, which in being conceived become qualities of the soul.\n\nCrathorn also looked into the skeptical challenges which he anticipated in the problem of knowledge. To refute skeptical claims, he turned back to the \"cogito\"-argument to prove that we can at least be certain of our own mental activity, for if one were to doubt a proposition such as ‘I am’, it would follow that he exists, since he who does not exist does not doubt.\n\nLike much philosophical discussion during his time in England, Crathorn considered the linguistic aspects of science. He questioned whether that when we know something scientifically, is that knowledge about external things, propositions, or some other more complex thing. It is believed that Crathorn popularized the notion that neither the external aspect or the proposition is the proper object of science, that the \"total significance\" of the proposition is most important.\n\nHe also discussed the nature of mental language, namely whether it is conventional or natural. Crathorn's predecessors had argued that thinking occurs in a universal language of concepts acquired causally via experience, and that all conventional languages are subordinated to this mental language, which is shared by everyone in an a priori fashion. But Crathorn could not accept such a position because of his view that only qualities are natural signs of their extra-mental significates. Crathorn argued that except for natural signs of qualities, mental language is conventional because it is derived from conventional language. Hence, whatever language one speaks in his head is modeled on that language used for external communication. Crathorn was the revolutionary in his time to affirm that words are prior to ideas and that ideas are shaped by words.\n\nCrathorn differed from the standard system of Aristotle of categories. Crathorn felt the entire system had to be revised; the human mind naturally knows only qualities, and one cannot be certain that even they exist without appealing to the principle that God could not deceive us. Thinking and reasoning are of no help because they are purely conventional. For example, the category of substance is distinguished from the other categories by the fact that it has no contrary and can successively acquire contrary qualities. Thus, there are no non-substances, though a substance can be black and then white in succession, or cold and then gradually hot. But Crathorn claims that when we heat an object, not only the substance but also its qualities become hot, such that its qualities change from one state to their contrary exactly like a substance.\n\n\n"}
