Antony (born 28 December 1940) is an Indian politician and attorney who currently serves as Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, representing the state of Kerala for the fifth consecutive term since 1985. He also currently serves as the Chairman of the Disciplinary Action Committee of the All India Congress Committee, Congress Working Committee, and member of the Central Election Committee.\n\nAntony has served two terms as Defence Minister of India from 2006 to 2014, and was appointed three times as Chief Minister of the state of Kerala.\n\nA. K. Antony was born at Cherthala, near Alleppey in Travancore and was the son of Arackaparambil Kurien Pillai and Aleykutty Kurian. His father died in 1959 and Antony self-financed part of his education through odd jobs.\n\nAntony completed his primary education at Holy Family Boys High school (Lower primary) and Government Boys High school (Upper primary), Cherthala (both are mixed higher secondary schools now and the latter has changed its name to Sree Narayana Memorial Government Higher Secondary school) and completed his Bachelor of Arts from Maharaja's College, Ernakulam and Bachelor of Law from Government Law College, Ernakulam.\n\nAntony entered politics as a student leader in Cherthala Taluk (Alleppey District) as an activist of the Kerala Students Union under the guidance of M. A. John. He has been an active leader of many strikes like \"Oru Ana Samaram\" (Single Penny Strike). He became the youngest president of Kerala Students Union in 1966 and also served in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) before becoming an All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary in 1984. When he became KPCC president in 1972 he was the youngest person to hold that post. He was elected again as KPCC president in 1987, and was defeated by Vayalar Ravi in the KPCC presidential elections in 1991.\n\nAntony founded the Congress (A) political party when he split from the Indian National Congress (Urs), a splinter group of the Indian National Congress (and opposed Indira Gandhi in inner party politics during the time when she was prosecuted by the Morarji Desai government, splitting off from the parent party with Devraj Urs.) The party was primarily active in Kerala and joined the LDF ministry headed by E. K. Nayanar during 1980-1982. After the fall of the Nayanar ministry, this party merged with the Congress in 1982, but Antony was not given any office until the death of Indira Gandhi. The members of the party have continued as a faction in the local congress afterwards.\n\nOn accusations in the Rajan case, K. Karunakaran resigned and Antony was made the 8th Chief Minister of Kerala, becoming the youngest Chief Minister of the state at the age of 37 serving from years 27 April 1977 to 27 October 1978.\n\nAgain, when Karunakaran resigned in connection with the ISRO case Antony was made the 16th Chief Minister of Kerala, serving from 22 March 1995 to 9 May 1996. He was the Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly between 1996-2001. Antony was elected and served a third term from 17 May 2001 to 29 August 2004. He failed to retain power on the first two occasions as Chief minister. In 2004, immediately after the Congress in Kerala suffered a total rout in the Lok Sabha elections amid factional politics and in-fighting within the Congress Party, Antony resigned as Chief Minister. He was succeeded by Oommen Chandy.\n\nIt was at Antony's behest that the decision to construct the new Legislature Complex was taken in 1977. During his tenure, he introduced the Unemployment Allowance, Festival Allowance for the State Employees, Prohibition of arrack and the steps initiated to revive the economy of Kerala.\n\nAntony carried out Asian Development Bank aided \"Modernization of Government Plan\". He also liberalised education by allowing several private engineering and medical colleges to open in Kerala and championed the state as an investment destination. He also ordered the closure of the Kerala Coca-Cola plant in 2004 citing drought and the non-availability of drinking water.\n\nAntony was a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha between 1993 and 1995 and was the Minister for Civil Supplies, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution for a year in 1994 during the tenure of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. He resigned on moral grounds as food minister in 1994 when his ministry was involved in a sugar import scandal, despite there being no allegations against him.\n\nIn 2005, Antony entered the Rajya Sabha and was inducted into the Union Council of Ministers as Defence Minister following Natwar Singh's expulsion from the Congress and Pranab Mukherjee's transfer to the Ministry of External Affairs. After the Congress again won the elections in 2009 and formed the government once again under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Antony retained the portfolio of Defence for the second term becoming the longest-serving Defence Minister of India in a continuous stint for 8 years. His \"Buy and Make Indian\" campaign saw the cancellation of billion of dollars in purchases of foreign arms, while at the same time stunting domestic production by restricting investments. The result has been a \"critical shortage of ammunition and gaping holes in its air defense systems\".\n\nHe held the post of Chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata (2012 to 2014), President of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses and Chancellor of Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (2006 to 2014).\n\nIn the Manmohan Singh Cabinet, Antony was the senior member of the Cabinet Committees on Accommodation, Economic Affairs, Parliamentary Affairs, Political Affairs, and Security.\n\nHe is considered as political guru of Rahul Gandhi.\n\nAntony's political skills and long experience in government have also led him to heading a large number of committees of Ministers in the government, a device that has been employed to obtain consensus within the members of the governing coalition on contentious issues.\nIn order to professionalise the Civil Services, Antony led in decision on creation of a Central Civil Services Authority (CCSA) to oversee the higher bureaucracy.\n\nIn 2018, Antony is one of the signatories to impeachment notice against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra.\n\nAntony is known for his incorruptible record and simple personal life and his intolerance towards corruption in public life. He has assiduously cultivated a public image that turns his perceived weaknesses into strengths. He was ranked among top 10 Most Powerful Indians for the year 2012 by the Indian Express.\n\n10th Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee admired Antony for his simplicity, gentleness and his zeal for reforms and change as a way to ensure acceleration of Kerala's all-round development.\n\nAfter Pranab Mukherjee was nominated for the 2012 President of India election, Antony was placed as the second-in-command after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the Cabinet of India.\n\nWikiLeaks reported that Antony was the only one of the two leaders who criticised Sanjay Gandhi during the 1976 AICC session in Guwahati during Emergency when the latter's political standing was on the rise.\n\nAntony is married to Elizabeth who is a Kerala High Court lawyer and is founder of the Navoothan Charitable Foundation. They have two sons.\n\n\n\"Notes\"\n\n"}

The language was called Oyrot (ойрот) prior to 1948.\n\nDue to its isolated position in the Altai Mountains and contact with surrounding languages, the classification of Altai within the Turkic languages has often been disputed. Because of its geographic proximity to the Shor and Khakas languages, some classifications place it in a Northern Turkic subgroup.\nDue to certain similarities with Kyrgyz, it has been grouped with the Kypchak languages which is within the Turkic language family. A more recent classification by Talat Tekin places Southern Altai in its own subgroup within Turkic and groups the Northern Altai dialects with Lower Chulym and the Kondoma dialect of Shor.\n\nAltai is spoken primarily in the Altai Republic (Southern Altai) and Altai Krai (Northern Altai).\n\nAlongside Russian, Altai is an official language of the Altai Republic. The official language is based on the Southern dialect spoken by the group called the Altay-Kiži, however in the few years it has also spread to the Northern Altai Republic.\n\nThough traditionally considered one language, Southern Altai is not fully mutually intelligible with the Northern varieties. Written Altai is based on Southern Altai, and according to \"Ethnologue\" is rejected by Northern Altai children. In 2006, a Cyrillic alphabet was created for the Kumandy variety of Northern Altai for use in Altai Krai.\n\nDialects are as follows:\n\n\nClosely related to the northern varieties are Kondom Shor and Lower Chulym, which have -j- for proto-Turkic inter-vocalic *d, unlike Mras Shor and Middle Chulym, which have -z- and are closer to Khakas.\n\nAltay is written in the Cyrillic alphabet:\n\nа б в г д ј е ё ж з и й к л м н ҥ о ӧ п р с т у ӱ ф х ц ч ш щ ъ ы ь э ю я\n\nThe following features refer to the outcome of commonly used Turkic isoglosses in Northern Altai.\n\nThe sounds of the Altai language vary from dialect to dialect.\n\nThe voiced palatal plosive varies greatly from dialect to dialect, especially in the initial position. Forms of the word \"јок\" \"no\" include (Kuu dialect) and (Kumandy). Even within dialects, this phoneme varies greatly.\n\nThere are eight vowels in Altai. These vowels may be long or short.\n\nThe language was written with the Latin script from 1928–1938, but has used Cyrillic (with the addition of 9 extra letters: Јј [d͡z~ɟ], Ҥҥ [ŋ], Ӧӧ [ø~œ], Ӱӱ [y~ʏ], Ғғ [ʁ], Ққ [q], Һһ [h], Ҹҹ [d͡ʑ], Ii [ɨ̹]) since 1938.\n\nThe letter Ÿ is sometimes used instead of Ӱ.\n\nAltai has six personal pronouns:\nThe declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. \n\nPronouns in the various dialects vary considerably. For example, the pronouns in the Qumandin dialect follow.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7467175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7467175", "title": "Banana leaf", "text": "Banana leaf\n\nBanana leaves have a wide range of applications because they are large, flexible, waterproof and decorative. They are used for cooking, wrapping and food-serving in a wide range of cuisines in tropical and subtropical areas. They are used for decorative and symbolic purposes in numerous Hindu and Buddhist ceremonies. In traditional homebuilding in tropical areas, roofs and fences are made with dry banana-leaf thatch. Banana and palm leaves were historically the primary writing surfaces in many nations of South and Southeast Asia.\n\nBanana leaves are large, flexible, and waterproof. They impart an aroma to food that is cooked in or served on them; steaming with banana leaves imparts a subtle sweet flavor and aroma to the dish. The leaves are not themselves eaten and are discarded after the contents are consumed.\n\nBesides adding flavor, the leaves keep juices in and protect food from burning, much as foil does. In Tamil Nadu (India) leaves are fully dried and used as packing material for foodstuffs, and are also made into cups to hold liquids. The dried leaves are called 'Vaazhai-ch- charugu' (வாழைச் சருகு) in Tamil. Some South Indian, Filipino and Khmer recipes use banana leaves as a wrapper for frying. The leaves are later removed. In Vietnamese cuisine, banana leaves are used to wrap foods such as \"cha-lua\".\n\nSouth Indian cuisine is traditionally served on a banana leaf, especially in the states of Andhra Pradesh,Telangana,Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala and in the Northern and Eastern parts of Sri Lanka. In these regions, it is customary to serve food on a banana leaf during festive occasions, and banana is often a part of the food served. In Maharashtra, on special occasions like Ganesh chaturthi, people eat off banana leaves. The banana leaf is also used for wrapping fish, which can then be steamed.\n\nIn Bengali cuisine, banana leaf is used to prepare Paturi, which is marinated and seasoned boneless fresh fish steamed and cooked inside a banana leaf and eaten on it. Commonly, Bhetki and Ilish are used in making Paturi.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, banana leaf is employed in cooking methods called \"pepes\" and \"botok\"; the banana-leaf packets of food are steamed, boiled, or grilled on charcoal. Banana leaves are also used to wrap several kinds of snacks \"kue\" (delicacies), such as \"nagasari\" or \"kue pisang\" and \"otak-otak\", and also to wrap pressed sticky-rice delicacies such as \"lemper\" and \"lontong\".\n\nIn Java, banana leaf is also used as a shallow conical bowl called \"pincuk\", usually to serve \"rujak tumbuk, pecel\" or satay. The \"pincuk\" secured with \"lidi semat\" (small thorn-like pins made from the coconut-leaf midrib). The \"pincuk\" fit in the left palm, while the right hand is used to consume the food. It also functions as a traditional disposable take-away food container. The cleaned banana leaf is often used as a placemat; cut banana-leaf sheets placed on rattan, bamboo or clay plates are used to serve food. Decorated and folded banana leaves on woven bamboo plates are used as serving trays, \"tumpeng\" rice cones, and holders for \"jajan pasar\" or \"kue\" delicacies.\n\nIn Malaysian and Singapore cuisine, banana leaves are used to wrap certain kuih and otak-otak. Malay foods such as nasi lemak are also commonly wrapped with banana leaves before being wrapped with newspaper, as banana leaves add fragrance to the rice.\n\nBanana leaves are the traditional method of serving food in Philippine cuisine, with rice and other dishes laid out on large banana leaves (a \"salo-salo\", reminiscent of a buffet) and everyone partaking using their bare hands (\"kamayan\"). Another traditional method of serving food is by placing it on a banana-leaf liner placed over a woven \"bilao\" (a winnowing basket made of bamboo). The \"bilao\" is normally a farm implement used for removing chaff from grains, although there are now smaller woven trays or carved wooden plates of the same kind in Filipino restaurants used specifically for serving food. Banana leaves are also commonly used in wrapping food (\"binalot\"), and are valued for the aroma they impart to the food. Specific Philippine dishes that use banana leaves include \"suman\" and \"bibingka\".\n\nThe Hawaiian imu is often lined with banana leaves.\n\nGuanimos are Dominican tamales made with cornmeal, stuffed with ground meat and wrapped with banana leaves.\n\nIn Puerto Rico \"pasteles\" are made primarily with fresh green banana dough stuffed with pork, and then wrapped in banana leaves which have been softened at the fire. Many rice dishes in Puerto Rico are cooked with banana leaves as a lid to add flavor and aroma. Fish and pork shoulder can be wrapped in plantain leaves and baked. \"Guanimes\" known as Puerto Rican tamales, cornmeal cooked with coconut milk and other ingredients, are wrapped in banana leaves. Sweet cassava tortillas and Puerto Rican arepas are laid on banana leaves for a few hours before cooking.\n\nMexican, and more specifically Oaxacan tamales and a local variety of lamb or barbacoa tacos are often steamed in banana leaves. Banana leaves are used for wrapping pork in the traditional Yucatán dish Cochinita pibil.\n\nVigorón' is a traditional Nicaraguan dish. It consists of a cabbage salad known as \"curtido\" (chopped cabbage, tomatoes, onions, and chile peppers marinated in vinegar and salt), boiled yuca, and chicharrones (fried pork with skin or with meat), wrapped in Banana leaf. Variations of this dish are also found in Costa Rica.\n\nVaho (or Baho) is a mix of meat, green plantains and yuca cooked in banana leaves.\n\nNacatamal is made up mostly of nixtamalized corn \"masa\" (a kind of dough traditionally made from a process called \"nizquezar\") and lard, but also includes seasonings such as salt and \"achiote\" (annatto). Filling consists of seasoned pork meat, rice, a slice of potato, bell pepper, tomato, onion, olives, cilantro and/or spearmint sprigs, and on occasion, though less commonly, capers, raisins or fresh chile (red or green), all wrapped in banana leaves. This dish is traditional to Nicaragua in Honduras.\n\nCoast side region prepare dishes as Bollo, green plantain and peanut butter batter filled with fish or pork wrapped in a banana leaf, this is then baked in a brick oven or steamed. Manabi province prepare a dish called Tonga a chicken stew with rice dyed with achiote and peanut salsa, all this served on a banana leaf and then wrapped. Amazonian provinces has Maito where grilled fish is served with yucca an rice, wrapped in a banana leves.\n\nBanana leaves are used by Hindus and Buddhists as a decorative element for special functions, marriages, and ceremonies in southern India and Southeast Asia. Balinese Hindu prepared banana leaf as the container for floral offerings called \"canang\" dedicated for hyang (spirits or deities) and gods. These floral offerings were placed in various places around the house.\n\nIn Thailand, banana leaf is used to create an offering bowl called \"krathong\", it is an important element during traditional festival of \"Loy Krathong\" day. Thai people will celebrate this on the full-moon day of the twelfth lunar month. The celebration was meant to pay respect to the Mother of Water called \"Phra Mae Kong Kha\" by floating a \"krathong\" on a body of water. Other Asian countries also shares this similar festival such as; Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, India and China. \"Krathong\" means lotus-shaped vessel like a leave bowl made of banana leaves and flowers with joss sticks and a candle in the middle. During Loy Krathong festival, people carry their \"krathongs\" to the river. After lighting candles and three joss sticks and making a wish, they will gently place their \"krathongs\" on the water and let them drift away. People believed that \"krathongs\" will carry their wickedness and bad luck away, and after that happiness will come to them. In fact, it is the time to be happy as the sufferings are floated away and a time to enjoy dancing, singing, or activities with other people. People use banana leaves to make \"krathongs\" because it is organic material, natural and would decompose easily.\n\nBanana and palm leaves were historically the primary writing surface in many nations of South and Southeast Asia. This has influenced the evolution of their scripts. The rounded letters of many of the scripts of southern India (such as Oriya and Sinhala), of Burmese, and of Javanese, for example, are thought to have been influenced by this: Sharp angles and tracing straight lines along the vein of the leaf with a sharp writing implement would risk splitting the leaf and ruining the surface, so rounded letters, or letters with straight lines only in the vertical or diagonal direction, were required for practical daily use.\n\nIn such situations, the ribs of the leaves function as the dividing lines of ruled paper, separating lines of text. It is believed that this was so influential in the development of the rongorongo script of Easter Island that the more elaborate wood tablets were fluted to imitate the surface of a banana leaf.\n\n"}

The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.\n\nThe Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press English Language Teaching publications as well as for research in corpus linguistics. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for Cambridge University Press, and researchers at Cambridge English Language Assessment.\n\nThe Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.\n\nThe Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.\n\nThe Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different first languages and is growing all the time. The exams currently included are:\n\n\nA unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.\n\nAuthors of Cambridge English Language Teaching resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.\n\nConversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of English Profile, a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.

{"id": "13126760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13126760", "title": "Colombian Spanish", "text": "Colombian Spanish\n\nColombian Spanish (Spanish: \"español colombiano\" or \"castellano colombiano\") is a grouping of the varieties of Spanish spoken in Colombia. The term is of more geographical than linguistic relevance, since the dialects spoken in the various regions of Colombia are quite diverse. The speech of coastal areas tends to exhibit phonological innovations typical of Caribbean Spanish, while highland varieties have been historically more conservative. The Caro and Cuervo Institute in Bogotá is the main institution in Colombia to promote the scholarly study of the language and literature of both Colombia and the rest of Spanish America. The educated speech of Bogotá, a generally conservative variety of Spanish, has high popular prestige among Spanish-speakers throughout the Americas.\n\nAs most other Spanish dialects, standard Colombian Spanish has five vowels: two high vowels (), two mid vowels () and one open vowel (). However, vowel shifts, reductions, and breaking have taken place in many of Colombia's populous regions, particularly in Bogotá and the Paisa Region. That means that in Colombian Spanish, there may also be an additional number of vowels, making it one of the most phonologically-rich varieties Spanish.\n\n\n\nSlang speech is frequent in popular culture. In the Paisa Region and Medellín, the local slang is named \"Parlache.\" Many slang expressions have spread outside their original areas and are now commonly understood throughout the country.\n\nMany of the words have been popularized by the Colombian media, such as Alonso Salazar's book, \"No nacimos pa' semilla\", Victor Gaviria's movie \"\", or Andrés López Forero's monologue \"La pelota de letras\" (\"The Lettered Ball\") as well as many other cultural expressions, including telenovelas, magazines, news coverage, jokes, etc..\n\nSome slang terms, with their literal translations and meanings, include the following:\n\nJohn M. Lipski groups Colombian dialects phonologically into four major zones. Canfield refers to five major linguistic regions. Flórez proposes seven dialectal zones, based on phonetic and lexical criteria. Still others recognize eleven dialect areas, as listed below.\n\nThe Paisa dialect is spoken in the Colombian coffee production areas, such as Antioquia, Quindío, Risaralda and Caldas. Paisa Spanish has an apicoalveolar , between and , as in northern and central Spain. Paisa Spanish, a \"voseante\" dialect, often uses \"vos\", rather than \"tú\", for the familiar singular \"you\" pronoun. The role of that voseo usage in forming the distinct Paisa linguistic identity was reinforced by its use in the works of several Paisa writers, including Tomás Carrasquilla, , Manuel Mejía Vallejo, Fernando Vallejo, and Gonzalo Arango.\n\n\"Rolo\" (a name for the dialect of Bogotá) is also called \"cachaco\". It is an area of strong \"ustedeo\", the familiar use of the pronoun \"usted\". The dialect follows many patterns similar to those of the Cundiboyacense dialect (preservation of syllable-final , preservation of in the \"-ado\" ending, preservation of the \"ll/y\" contrast (i.e., no \"yeísmo\"), etc.), but it had ls only marginal use of the formal second-person pronoun \"sumercé\".\n\nThe Cundiboyacense dialect is spoken mainly in the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá (Cundiboyacense High Plateau). It uses the expression \"sumercé\" or \"su merced\" (literally \"your grace\") often as a formal second-person singular pronoun. The pronoun \"usted\" is used when two people speak in an informal situation. \"Tuteo\" (the use of the pronoun \"tú\") is usual in conversation between a man and woman of similar ages. Occasionally, the pronoun \"usted\" may be used briefly in extremely-informal speech between couples or family members or to reprehend someone, depending on the tone of voice.\n\nThe Caribbean or Coastal (\"costeño\", \"celador\") dialect is spoken in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. It shares many of the features typical of general Caribbean Spanish and is phonologically similar to Andalusian and Canarian Spanish. Word-final is realized as velar . Syllable-final is typically pronounced and sk \"costa\" (\"coast\") is pronounced and \"rosales\" (\"roses\") becomes . The most notable and distinguishable varieties of Atlantic- Colombian accents are Barranquilla (Considered the most l-articulated Spanish in America and mostly rhotic in upper-class speakers), Cartagena (Mostly non-rhotic and fast-spoken) and Montería (Sinú Valley Accent, strictly non-rhotic, plosive and very marked wording like Received Pronunciation in British English), and all varieties avoid using r.\n\nThis is the dialect spoken in the Islands of San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina in Colombia's Caribbean Region. It is marked by a mixture of Caribbean Spanish with some features of English. Syllable-final can be realized, in addition to the flap , the trill , and the lateral [l], as the alveolar approximant , the last being thought to be an influence of British English. Thus, \"verso\" (\"verse\") becomes (alongside , , or ); \"invierno\" (\"winter\") becomes (alongside , , or ), and \"escarlata\" (\"scarlet\") becomes (alongside , , or ).\n\nWord-final , when followed by a vowel-initial word, is usually realized as a tap, an approximant, or the lateral , as in \"amo\" \"eterno\" (\"eternal love\"). If it is when followed by a consonant or a pause, it may be realized as any of those sounds or as a trill or elided, as in \"amo\" \"paterno\" (\"paternal love\").\n\nThat phonetic characteristic is not exclusive to Colombians, whose ancestry is traced back to the Spanish period before the British invasion, under British territorial rule, and the recovery of Spanish control. It is also used by Raizals, by whites of British descent, and by descendants of mainland Colombians. The dialect of native Spanish-speakers in the area is closer to the Nicaraguan dialect of the Caribbean coast, reflecting the geographical location of the archipelago, off the coast of Nicaragua.\n\nThe Valluno dialect, or \"español vallecaucano\", is spoken in the valley of the Cauca River between the Western and Central cordilleras. In Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca, there is strong use of \"voseo\" (the use of the pronoun \"vos\" instead of other dialects, which use \"tú\"), with its characteristic verb forms.\n\nThe Valluno dialect has many words and phrases not used outside of the region. People commonly greet one another with the phrase \"¿Q'hubo vé, bien o qué?\". Also, it is common to be asked \"¿Sí o no?\" when assessing agreement to rhetorical statements. Thong sandals are referred to as \"chanclas\", and plastic bags (\"bolsas\" elsewhere) are called \"chuspas\". As in other areas, a \"chocha\" is another crude word for \"vagina,\" and \"chucha\" refers to an opossum. A \"pachanguero\" is someone who dances or parties all night long.\n\nAndrés Caicedo was the main writer to depict the vernacular usage of language accurately.\n\nThe Pastuso dialect is spoken in the southwest ll of the country. One feature is apicoalveolar , between and , as in northern and central Spain. However, unlike Paisa, speakers typically conserve the \"ll\"/\"y\" distinction (the dialect has no \"yeísmo\"), and in some areas, the \"r\" is pronounced as a voiced apical sibilant. Contrary to the usual tendency in Spanish to weaken or relax the sounds , , and between vowels, Pastuso-speakers tend to tense those sounds with more emphasis than in other dialects.\n\nThe Opita dialect is spoken mostly in the departments of Tolima and Huila, mostly in the central and southern parts of the Magdalena River Valley. It is said to show strong influence of indigenous languages and is noted for its slow tempo and unique intonation. As in most of the Americas, the dialect has \"yeísmo\" and \"seseo\". The dialect is traditionally characterised by the use of the second-person pronoun \"usted\" (or \"vusted\" in some rural areas) in formal circumstances but also in familiar ones (in which most other dialects would use \"tú\", see \"ustedeo\" above). However, \"tú\" is gaining ground with young people. The use of \"voseo\" is rare.\n\nSantanderean is spoken mostly in the northeastern part of the country in Santander and Norte de Santander Departments. There is a strong use of \"ustedeo\" in both informal and formal contexts.\n\nLlanero covers a vast area of the country with a low population density. It is spoken in the eastern plains of the country from the Cordillera Oriental (the eastern mountain range of the Andes). It has a characteristic influence of inland Colombian settlers.\n\nThis dialect extends beyond the Department of Chocó throughout the Pacific coast and is said to reflect African influence in terms of intonation and rhythm. Characteristically, syllable-final /s/ is frequently either debuccalized and pronounced as or omitted, as in the Caribbean dialect (see above). Like the Caribbean dialect, word-final is realized as velar , /d/ is replaced by /r/ in some words, and syllable-final and are often merged, as in Caribbean Spanish. This dialect is also spoken by Afro-Colombians living inland in the departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca.\n\n\n"}

Researchers data mine large digital archives to investigate cultural phenomena reflected in language and word usage. The term is an American neologism first described in a 2010 \"Science\" article called \"Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books\", co-authored by Harvard researchers Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden.\n\nMichel and Aiden helped create the Google Labs project Google Ngram Viewer which uses n-grams to analyze the Google Books digital library for cultural patterns in language use over time.\n\nBecause the Google Ngram data set is not an unbiased sample, and does not include metadata, there are several pitfalls when using it to study language or the popularity of terms. Medical literature accounts for a large, but shifting, share of the corpus, which does not take into account how often the literature is printed, or read.\n\nIn a study called \"Culturomics 2.0\", Kalev H. Leetaru examined news archives including print and broadcast media (television and radio transcripts) for words that imparted tone or \"mood\" as well as geographic data. The research was able to retroactively predict the 2011 Arab Spring and successfully estimate the final location of Osama Bin Laden to within .\n\nIn a 2012 paper by Alexander M. Petersen and co-authors, they found a \"dramatic shift in the birth rate and death rates of words\": Deaths have increased and births have slowed. The authors also identified a universal \"tipping point\" in the life cycle of new words at about 30 to 50 years after their origin, they either enter the long-term lexicon or fall into disuse.\n\nIn a 2014 paper by Steffen Roth, culturomic analyses is used to trace the decline of religion, the rise of politics, and the relevance of the economy to modern societies, with one of the major results being that modern societies do not appear to be capitalist or economized. This paper is likely to be the first application of culturomics in sociology.\n\nCulturomic approaches have been taken in the analysis of newspaper content in a number of studies by I. Flaounas and co-authors. These studies showed macroscopic trends across different news outlets and countries. In 2012, a study of 2.5 million articles suggested that gender bias in news coverage depends on topic and how the readability of newspaper articles is related to topic. A separate study by the same researchers, covering 1.3 million articles from 27 countries, showed macroscopic patterns in the choice of stories to cover. In particular, countries made similar choices when they were related by economic, geographical and cultural links. The cultural links were revealed by the similarity in voting for the Eurovision song contest. This study was performed on a vast scale, by using statistical machine translation, text categorisation and information extraction techniques.\n\nThe possibility to detect mood shifts in a vast population by analysing Twitter content was demonstrated in a study by T. Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors. The study considered 84 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the United Kingdom over a period of 31 months, showing how public sentiment in the UK has changed with the announcement of spending cuts.\n\nIn a 2013 study by S Sudhahar and co-authors, the automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.\n\nIn a 2014 study by T Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors, 5 million news articles were collected over 5 years and then analyzed to suggest a significant shift in sentiment relative to coverage of nuclear power, corresponding with the disaster of Fukushima. The study also extracted concepts that were associated with nuclear power before and after the disaster, explaining the change in sentiment with a change in narrative framing.\n\nIn 2015, a study revealed the bias of the Google books data set, which \"suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural popularity,\" and calls into question the significance of many of the earlier results.\n\nCulturomic approaches can also contribute towards conservation science through a better understanding of human-nature relationships. In 2016, a publication by Richard Ladle and colleagues highlighted five key areas where culturomics can be used to advance the practice and science of conservation, including recognizing conservation-oriented constituencies and demonstrating public interest in nature, identifying conservation emblems, providing new metrics and tools for near-real-time environmental monitoring and to support conservation decision making, assessing the cultural impact of conservation interventions, and framing conservation issues and promoting public understanding. \n\nIn 2017, a study correlated joint pain with Google search activity and temperature. While the study observed higher search activity for hip and knee pain (but not arthritis) during higher temperatures, it does not (and cannot) control for relevant other factors such as activity. Mass media misinterpreted this as \"myth busted: rain does not increase joint pain\", while the authors speculate the observed correlation is due to \"changes in physical activity levels\".\n\nLinguists and lexicographers have expressed skepticism regarding the methods and results of some of these studies, including one by Petersen et al., while other have demonstrated bias in the Ngram data set, and their results \"call into question the vast majority of existing claims drawn from the Google Books corpus,\" and \"instead of speaking about general linguistic or cultural change, it seems to be preferable to explicitly restrict the results to linguistic or cultural change ‘as it is represented in the Google Ngram data’\" because it is unclear what caused the observed change in the sample.\n\n\n\n"}

The Declaration outlines a number of rights and freedoms pertaining to LGBT and intersex people that it is proposed be universally guaranteed. It encompasses all aspects of human rights, from the guarantee of fundamental freedoms to the prevention of discrimination against LGBT people in healthcare, education and immigration. The Declaration also addresses various issues that impinge on the global promotion of LGBT rights and intersex human rights. Intended as a starting point in listing the demands of the international LGBT movement, it will ultimately be submitted to the United Nations.\n\nThe Conference aimed to raise the international community's awareness of LGBT rights issues. It was held immediately prior to the Outgames themselves and attended by almost 2000 delegates and 600 conference speakers from across the world, making it the largest LGBT rights conference ever held. A number of international experts took part including distinguished jurists, academics, church leaders and human rights activists. The delegates unanimously approved the Declaration.\n\nAmong the keynote speakers to the Conference were:\n\nThe Declaration aims to address UN failings in consistently applying its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A number of fundamental freedoms, including the right to life, are violated in a number of member countries where homosexuality is criminalised. Homosexual acts are punishable by death in nine jurisdictions: Afghanistan, Iran, Nigeria, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. They remain illegal in 72 countries, and are in many cases punishable by imprisonment or corporal punishment.\n\nThe Convention identifies several areas in which action needs to be taken to uphold the essential rights of LGBT people: \"A world where LGBT rights are systematically violated, is a world where nobody can feel safe and free\" referring to the principle of World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna affirming that \"All human rights are universal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelated.\"\n\nThe declaration calls for an end to the death penalty and all violence against LGBT people whether state condoned or by private parties. States are required to take steps to protect LGBT people from all hate crimes. Forced marriages to persons of the opposite sex are identified as particular human rights violations to be combated.\n\nFinally, violence against intersex people, in particular unnecessary surgery to force conformity to rigid models of sexual characteristics, is condemned as well as genital surgery to them unless they are old enough to understand it and consent to it. This gave influence to Principle 18 (protection from medical abuse) of The Yogyakarta Principles.\n\nLaws which discriminate against LGBT people, such as bans of pride marches, LGBT journalism and registration of non-governmental organisations, are identified as a major stumbling blocks in campaigning for LGBT rights issues. The world community is therefore called upon to guarantee such rights and prevent their being denied by hostile public authorities.\n\nIn addition, the international community is asked to take positive steps in promoting such rights. To this end, the Declaration calls for international development aid packages to be conditional on improvements in respecting human rights, including those of LGBT people. Financial aid is sought for groups campaigning for LGBT rights in areas where such people still fear for their lives or personal safety.\n\nThe repeal of all laws preventing consensual same-sex activity is called for.\n\nLGBT people face discrimination in many aspects of their lives. Governments are called upon to take positive actions to promote LGBT rights to freedom from discrimination in the following areas:\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognises a right to asylum for those fleeing persecution based on sexual orientation or gender identity. All countries are called upon to do the same. In addition, rights of residence for foreign partners are demanded to be free from discrimination against LGBT people.\n\nFamilies are stated to be the most important part of many people's lives. The Declaration requires marriages to be opened up to same-sex couples, all unmarried couples to have similar partnership rights and ensuring equal access for all to every option for parenthood, including adoptions by LGBT people.\n\nIn education, classes on LGBT human rights are sought and schools are required to take action against homophobic bullying. The media are called upon to assist in breaking down stereotypes and to portray LGBT people in a realistic manner. The necessity of access to health care in general and for the specific needs of LGBT people is stressed. In particular funding for sex reassignment surgery is expected to be provided to the same extent that it is for other medically necessary treatments. Finally, religious groups are encouraged to be tolerant towards LGBT people.\n\nThe Declaration calls for the development of programmes to promote fair chances in employment and business for LGBT people in order for their economic independence and self-esteem to be insured. Governments are asked to lead by example in eliminating such discrimination and in promoting the equality and safety of LGBT people in public sector workplaces and trade unions.\n\nIn order to promote LGBT rights globally, the Declaration requires the international community to engage in a worldwide information campaign and calls upon like-minded NGOs and governments to assist in preparing and running such a campaign. Part of this campaign would be to provide education about the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS among LGBT people and governments are generally encouraged to include LGBT people in their fight against HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe failure of the United Nations to recognise LGBT rights as human rights is condemned, despite the case law \"Toonen v. Australia\" by United Nations Human Rights Committee. It is requested that the new UN Human Rights Council adopt LGBT rights as part of its agenda and that the International Gay and Lesbian Association and other LGBT rights organisations be amongst the NGOs that are able to consult with the Council. And at last, the Declaration calls on all nations in the world and United Nations to recognize an promote the 17 May of each year as the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.\n\nThe Montreal borough of Ville-Marie was the first elected body in the world to officially adopt the Declaration in on August 1, 2006, whilst the New Democratic Party became the first political party to do so, by a unanimous vote of its federal convention on September 10, 2006. Accordingly, the NDP's critic for LGBT rights, Bill Siksay, presented a motion in the House of Commons of Canada calling on the Canadian government to abide by the Declaration on September 20, 2006.\n\nThe Declaration has also been adopted by the City Councils of:\n\n\n"}

Weinreich's paper inspired research in the late 1950s to test the proposal. However, the investigations soon showed it to be generally untenable, at least under structuralist theory. With the advent of generative theory in the 1960s, researchers tried applying a generative approach in developing diasystemic explanations; this also fell short.\n\nAccording to some leading sociolinguists, the diasystem idea for incorporating variation into linguistic theory has been superseded by William Labov's notion of the linguistic variable. As such, the concept has not been part of any substantial linguistic theory and the term has limited currency in linguistics.\n\n first suggested comparing accents by their synchronic states, rather than by comparing their different historical developments. He classified sound differences between dialects into three types:\n\nDespite Trubetzkoy's proposal, linguists continued to consider variation between varieties outside of the scope of inquiry of grammar construction; each variety, in their thinking, should only be studied on its own terms.\n\nInspired by Trubetzkoy, proposed a synthesis of linguistic geography and descriptive linguistics by applying the structuralist concept of grammar to the description of regular correspondences between different varieties; a resulting supergrammar, which he called a \"diasystem\", would be consistent with the individual grammars of all the member dialects. A diasystem is a higher order system and its component units of analysis would accordingly be abstractions of a higher order than the units of analysis of the individual systems. That is, just as the phones present within an individual variety are grouped together into abstract phonemes, the phonemes present within a group of varieties could be grouped together into even more abstract diaphonemes. Weinreich exemplified the diasystemic approach by a formulaic arrangement of phoneme correspondences in three dialects of Yiddish, focusing on the vowels but arguing that the principle could work for other aspects of language.\n\nAlthough Weinreich did not elaborate the diasystemic approach, he did consider some theoretical pitfalls to be avoided. He recognized that phonemic mergers and splits with dissimilar results across dialects would pose a difficult challenge for the construction of a diasystem; he cautioned against positing a diasystem when the work of creating all the member systems (e.g. the work of phonemicization) was yet incomplete; and, following the lead of , he noted that the differences in phonological inventory and etymological distribution might prove problematic in the construction of diasystems.\n\nA few linguists took up Weinreich's challenge and quickly found it to be inadequate. Some of the failures had been anticipated by Weinreich himself, as described above.\n\n, examining and , noted the need for refinements in the original proposal; different researchers did not seem to agree on definitions, disciplines of study, or objects of inquiry. The research and debate concluded that multiple dialects could not be described by a common grammar, at least not under structuralist theory. That is, it would be unfeasible to construct a single grammar for multiple dialects unless their differences were very minor or if it incorporated only a small number of dialects.\n\nRelated to Weinreich's proposal were efforts in both American dialectology and generative phonology to construct an \"overall system\" that represented the underlying representation for all dialects of English.\n\nAn example of this was the diaphonemic analysis, made by , that presumably all American varieties could fit.\n\nSix of the nine simple vowels in this diasystem are common across most dialects: occurs in \"pit\", in \"pet\", in \"pat\", in \"putt\", in \"put\", and in \"pot\". The other three are found in specific dialects or dialect groups: represents the vowel of \"road\" in New England varieties; represents a vowel that often appears in stressed syllables in words like \"just\" (when it means 'only'); and represents the vowel of \"pot\" in Southern British and New England dialects.\n\nThese nine simple vowels can then be combined with any of three offglides () to make 36 possible complex nuclei. This system was popular amongst American linguists (despite criticism, particularly from Hans Kurath) until demonstrated its inadequacy.\n\nThe most salient criticism of these broad diasystems was the issue of how cognitively real they are. That is, whether speakers actually have competence in using or understanding the grammatical nuances of multiple varieties. In certain sociolinguistic circumstances, speakers' linguistic repertoire contains multiple varieties. For example, argues that Modern Literary Arabic is a diasystem of various interference phenomena occurring when speakers of different Arabic varieties attempt to speak or read Literary Arabic.\n\nMore concretely, Peter Trudgill put forth what he considered to be a cognitively real diasystem in , a book-length sociolinguistic study of Norwich. As a critic of Weinreich's original proposal, he approached the concept as a generativist, putting forth a series of rules that could generate any possible output reflected in the diversity and variability of sociologically conditioned linguistic variables. Because most speakers of Norwich could vary their pronunciation of each variable depending on the circumstances in which they are speaking, the diasystem's rules reflected speakers' actual linguistic abilities.\n\nCognitively real diasystems are not limited to humans. For example, crows are able to distinguish between different calls that prompt others to disperse, assemble, or rescue; these calls show regional variation so that French crows do not understand recorded American calls. Although captive birds show difficulty understanding the calls of birds from nearby regions, those allowed to migrate are able to understand calls from both, suggesting that they have mentally constructed a diasystem that enables them to understand both call systems.\n\nStill, these sorts of \"idiosyncratic\" grammars differ in degree from broader diasystems, which are much less likely to be part of speakers' linguistic competence. Even Trudgill has argued against their cognitive reality, deeming the concept of a broad diasystem to be a \"theoretical dead-end.\" Although the concept did not withstand scrutiny by research linguists, it nevertheless triggered a surge of academic work that used it in applied linguistics (e.g. for ESL education materials, composition texts for native speakers, basic linguistics texts, and in the application of linguistics to literary criticism). Diasystemic representations are also possible in dictionaries. For example, the Macquarie Dictionary reflects the pronunciation of four phonetically distinct sociolects of Australian English. Because these sociolects are the same phonemically, readers (at least, those from Australia) can interpret the system as representing their own accent.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the fourth Wikipedia edition to exceed 1 million articles, after the English, German and French editions. In April 2016, 1154 active editors made at least five edits in that month.\n\nThe Dutch Wikipedia was started on 19 June 2001, and reached 100,000 articles on 14 October 2005. It briefly surpassed the Polish Wikipedia as the sixth-largest edition of Wikipedia, but then fell back to the eighth position. On 1 March 2006, it overtook the Swedish and Italian editions in one day to rise back to the sixth position. The edition's 500,000th article was created on 30 November 2008. In a 2006 \"Multiscope\" research study, the Dutch Wikipedia was rated the third-best Dutch-language website, after Google and Gmail, with a score of 8.1.\n\nThe Dutch language Wikipedia has the largest ratio of Wikipedia pages per native speaker of all of the top 10 largest Wikipedia editions. Its rate of daily article creations spiked in March 2006, rapidly growing to an average of 1,000 a day in early May 2006. After this number was reached, growth dropped to an average of only about 250 a day, comparable to the averages around December 2005. Since then, there have been more article-creation surges, one of the largest peaking at 2,000 new articles per day in September 2007, but the growth rate has always returned to the lowest average of around 250.\n\nIn 2008, Dutch businessman Bob Sijthoff attempted to sue \"the Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland\" and \"the Stichting Wikimedia Nederland\" to force the removal of his Dutch Wikipedia article, which he stated contained \"false and abusive\" information. On December 10, 2008, the court rejected his request. The judge ruled that he had sued the wrong entity and that legal responsibility for the content of the articles would not lie in the Netherlands, but with the American Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nThe majority of articles in Dutch Wikipedia (59%) were created by internet bots. In October 2011, several bots created 80,000 articles (then equivalent to 10% of the entire edition's article count) in only 11 days.\n\nThe Dutch Wikipedia's one-millionth article was created in December 2011, after another surge of bot activity saw 100,000 added articles in only 10 days. In late March 2013, the Dutch Wikipedia surpassed the French Wikipedia to become the third-largest edition of Wikipedia. In June 2013, it overtook the German Wikipedia to become the second-largest Wikipedia edition.\n\nThe \"depth\" or \"editing depth\" of Wikipedia is a rough indicator of the encyclopedia's collaborative quality, showing how frequently its articles are updated. The depth is measured by taking the average number of edits per article multiplied by the extent in which articles are supported by discussion (among other things, talk pages). Among the nine language editions with one million articles, the Dutch, Swedish, and Polish Wikipedias in that order have much lower than the other six. , for the English version the article depth is 666, for the German 88, for the French 153, for the Spanish 160, for the Dutch only 18.\n\nCompared to most other Wikipedia editions with a similar number of articles, articles on the Dutch Wikipedia have less content with an average of 1,598 bytes per article ().

RTNs are finite-state machines that can be seen as finite-state automata extended with a stack of return states; as well as consuming transitions and formula_1-transitions, RTNs may define call transitions. These transitions perform a subroutine jump by pushing the transition's target state onto the stack and bringing the machine to the called state. Each time an acceptor state is reached, the return state at the top of the stack is popped out, provided that the stack is not empty, and the machine is brought to this state.\n\nThroughout this article we refer to filtered-popping recursive transition networks as \"FPNs\", though this acronym is ambiguous (e.g.: fuzzy Petri nets). \"Filtered-popping networks\" and \"FPRTNs\" are unambiguous alternatives. \n\nA FPN is a structure formula_2 where\n\n\nTransitions represent the possibility of bringing the FPN from a source state formula_11 to a target state formula_12 by possibly performing an additional action. Depending on this action, we distinguish the following types of \"explicitly\"-defined transitions:\n\n\nThe behaviour of call transitions is governed by two kinds of \"implicitly\"-defined transitions:\n\n\nPush transitions initialize subroutine jumps and pop transitions are equivalent to return statements.\n\nA (natural language) text can be enriched with meta-information by the application of a RTN with output; for instance, a RTN inserting XML tags can be used for transforming a plain text into a structured XML document. A RTN with output representing a natural language grammar would delimit and add the syntactic structure of each text sentence (see parsing). Other RTNs with output could simply mark text segments containing relevant information (see information extraction). The application of a RTN with output representing an ambiguous grammar results in a set of possible translations or interpretations of the input. Computing this set has an exponential worst-case cost, even for an Earley parser for RTNs with output, due to cases in which the number of translations increases exponentially w.r.t. the input length; for instance, the number of interpretations of a natural language sentence increases exponentially w.r.t. the number of unresolved prepositional phrase attachments:\n\nFPNs serve as a compact representation of this set of translations, allowing to compute it in cubic time by means of an Earley-like parser. FPN states correspond to execution states (see instruction steps) of an Earley-parser for RTNs \"without\" output, and FPN transitions correspond to possible translations of input symbols. The formula_30 map of the resulting FPN gives the correspondence between the represented output segments and the recognized input segments: given a recognized input sequence formula_31 and a FPN path formula_32 starting at a state formula_33 and ending at a state formula_34, formula_32 represents a possible translation of input segment formula_36. The filtered-popping feature is required in order to avoid FPN paths to represent translations of \"disconnected\" or \"overlapping\" input segments: a FPN call may contain several translation paths from the called state to an acceptor state, where the input segments they correspond to share the same start point but do not necessarily have the same length. Only return states corresponding to the same input point than the acceptor state finishing the call are \"valid\" return states.\n"}

Ghost lights are also sometimes known as \"equity lights\" or \"equity lamps\", possibly indicating their use was originally mandated by the Actors' Equity Association.\n\nThe practical use of a ghost light is mainly for safety. A ghost light enables one to navigate the theater to find the lighting control console and to avoid accidents such as falling into the orchestra pit and stepping on or tripping over set pieces. Aside from its obvious practical purpose, there are a number of superstitions associated with the origin and purpose of ghost lights.\n\nThe superstitious have various justifications for the ghost light in relation to the supernatural. A popular theatrical superstition holds that every theater has a ghost, and some theaters have traditions to appease ghosts that reach far back into their history. For example, the Palace Theatre, London keeps two seats in their balcony permanently bolted open to provide seating for the theater ghosts. Similar superstitions hold that ghost lights provide opportunities for ghosts to perform onstage, thus appeasing them and preventing them from cursing the theater or sabotaging the set or production. This is also used to explain the traditional one day a week that theaters are closed.\n\n"}

{"id": "13622335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13622335", "title": "Hosic report", "text": "Hosic report\n\nIn 1917 the Hosic Report on the Reorganization of English in (United States) Secondary Schools placed courteous letter writing as a number one priority. This might provide rationale for why Pennell and Cusack (1924), writers of a manual for teachers of reading activities, included letter writing in suggested instructional activities. Other important activities suggested in the Hosic report were expository writing, analysis of writing pieces, reports, literary composition, and debate.\n\nIn 1917, the Hosic Report on the Reorganization of English in the Secondary Schools the first report to cite the relationship between speaking and writing, reported that the purpose of teaching composition was to enable the student to speak and write correctly to convince and interest the reader (Burrows, 1977). The first step was to cultivate sincerity through language; next to develop accuracy; and last to arouse artistic and individual expression. The goals focused on developing effective content and correct form including handwriting, spelling, grammar, capitals, and punctuation. Beyond these goals, importance was placed on enlarging vocabulary through reading. Reading authors with \"concise and vigorous style\" was encouraged so that the students could imitate \"fine writing\" (Burrows, 1977, p. 28).\n\nFrom the 1917 Hosic Report, the teacher was urged to focus on developing the individual writer rather than certain forms and rules. The teacher was to observe and respond to the maturing of each student’s growth in thought and expression. This sounds very much like teachers were being instructed to teach in response to the individual learner rather than just deliver a scripted program. Teachers were told to offer many opportunities for students to write and speak on topics that were familiar and of interest to them so that they could give attention to correctness and present thoughts to convince and interest others. The belief was that composition should grow out of the experiences of the child.\n\nThe experiences included recent field trips and outside interests such as home activities and sports. Purpose and audience were stressed. In teaching composition, interesting content came first followed in importance by organization and then mechanics (punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and word choice).\n\nThe Hosic report stated that fact writing and imaginative writing came from two types of minds. It went on to say that short story writing should not be a passing standard for students but that they should be given opportunities to see if they had a talent for it. For those that did show talent and interest, special training should be provided. The same was advocated for debating. Teachers were encouraged to use pictures to stimulate writing development using newspaper editorial cartoons as examples. Authentic purposes for letter writing with students’ interest as content were promoted. Letters by Stevenson, Dickens, Carroll, and Lincoln served as models for informal letter writing. Whose letters today would be excellent exemplars? The report mentioned that students who were clever at writing conversations which was a sign of character should have special training in dramatization and material for dramatizations could be used from local history. Smith (2002) reported that in 1920 (soon after this report) that suggestions for dramatizations followed longer stories in readers to support comprehension. Repeatedly, the Hosic Report stressed that the work should spring from the students' interests. It was after this report in the 1920s that Language Experience Charts based on children’s experiences were initiated. Reading material was developed by using students’ own compositions about their firsthand experiences (Smith, 2002). It was also at this time that ability grouping, flexible promotions, differentiated assignments, and promoting individual progression were reported (Smith, 2002, p. 183). The emphasis in writing and reading instruction at this time seemed to be giving birth to differentiated instruction and responding to student interest. The 1917 Hosic Report proposed that composition activities should come from the life of the student and \"develop in him the power to express his individual experiences\" (Burrows, 1977, p. 32). Developing the skill of oral composition was also a strong emphasis in order to develop the power to think in front of an audience and find language for personal expression.\n\nJames Hosic, author of this report, was an Emeritus professor at Teachers College, Columbia University as well as being the first Secretary (now Executive Director) of the National Council of Teachers of English from 1911 through 1920.\n\n"}
{"id": "5575456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5575456", "title": "ISO 639 macrolanguage", "text": "ISO 639 macrolanguage\n\nISO 639-3 is an international standard for language codes. In defining some of its language codes, some are classified as macrolanguages, which include other individual languages in the standard. This category exists to assist mapping between another set of languages codes, ISO 639-2, and ISO 639-3. ISO 639-3 is curated by SIL International, ISO 639-2 is curated by the Library of Congress (USA).\n\nThe mapping often has the implication that it covers borderline cases where two language varieties may be considered strongly divergent dialects of the same language or very closely related languages (dialect continuums). It may also encompass situations when there are language varieties that are sometimes considered to be varieties of the same language and sometimes different languages for ethnic or political rather than linguistic reasons. However, this is not its primary function and the classification is not evenly applied. For example, \"Chinese\" is a macrolanguage encompassing many languages that are not mutually intelligible, but the languages \"Standard German\", \"Bavarian German\", and other closely related languages do \"not\" form a macrolanguage despite being more mutually intelligible. Other examples include Tajiki not being part of the Persian macrolanguage despite sharing much lexicon, and Urdu and Hindi not forming a macrolanguage. Even all dialects of Hindi are considered as separate languages. Basically, ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 use different criteria for dividing language varieties into languages, 639-2 uses shared writing systems and literature more whereas 639-3 focuses on mutual intelligibility and shared lexicon. The macrolanguages exist within the ISO 639-3 code set to make mapping between the two sets easier.\n\nThere are fifty-six language codes in ISO 639-2 that are considered to be macrolanguages in ISO 639-3. The use of this category of macrolanguage was applied in \"Ethnologue\", starting in the 16th edition.\n\nSome of the macrolanguages had no individual language (as defined by 639-3) in ISO 639-2, e.g. \"ara\" (Arabic), but ISO 639-3 recognizes different varieties of Arabic as separate languages under some circumstances. Others, like \"nor\" (Norwegian) had their two individual parts (nno Nynorsk, nob Bokmål) already in 639-2. That means some languages (e.g. \"arb\" Standard Arabic) that were considered by ISO 639-2 to be dialects of one language (\"ara\") are now in ISO 639-3 in certain contexts considered to be individual languages themselves. This is an attempt to deal with varieties that may be linguistically distinct from each other, but are treated by their speakers as forms of the same language, e.g. in cases of diglossia. For example,\n\n\nISO 639-2 also includes codes for collections of languages; these are not the same as macrolanguages. These collections of languages are excluded from ISO 639-3, because they never refer to individual languages. Most such codes are included in ISO 639-5.\n\n\nThis list only includes official data from http://www.sil.org/iso639-3.\n is the ISO 639-3 language code for Akan. Its ISO 639-1 code is ak.

{"id": "12865002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12865002", "title": "Interlanguage fossilization", "text": "Interlanguage fossilization\n\nInterlanguage fossilization is a phenomenon of second language acquisition (SLA) in which second language learners develop and retain a linguistic system, or interlanguage, that is self-contained and different from both the learner's first language and the target language. This linguistic system has been variously called interlanguage, approximative system, idiosyncratic dialects, or transitional dialects.\n\nAccording to Corder this temporary and changing grammatical system, interlanguage, which is constructed by the learner, approximates the grammatical system of the target language. In the process of second language acquisition, interlanguage continually evolves into an ever-closer approximation of the target language, and ideally should advance gradually until it becomes equivalent, or nearly equivalent, to the target language. However, during the second language learning process, an interlanguage may reach one or more temporary restricting phases when its development appears to be detained. A permanent cessation of progress toward the target language has been referred to as fossilization. This linguistic phenomenon, interlanguage fossilization, can occur despite all reasonable attempts at learning. Fossilization includes those items, rules, and sub-systems that second language learners tend to retain in their interlanguage, that is, all those aspects of interlanguage that become entrenched and permanent, and that the majority of second language learners can only eliminate with considerable effort. Moreover, it has also been noticed that this occurs particularly in adult second language learners' interlanguage systems.\n\nSelinker suggests that the most important distinguishing factor related to second language acquisition is the phenomenon of fossilization. However, both his explanation that \"fossilizable linguistic phenomena are linguistic items, rules, and subsystems which speakers of a particular native language will tend to keep in their interlanguage relative to a particular target language, no matter what the age of the learner or amount of explanation or instruction he receives in the target language\" and his hypotheses on interlanguage fossilization are fascinating in that they contradict our basic understanding of the human capacity to learn. How is it that some learners can overcome interlanguage fossilization, even if they only constitute, according to Selinker, \"a mere 5%\", while the majority of second language learners cannot, \"no matter what the age or amount of explanation or instruction\"? Or is it perhaps not that they cannot overcome fossilization, but that they will not? Does complacency set in after second language learners begin to communicate, as far as they are concerned, effectively enough, in the target language, and as a result does motivation to achieve native-like competence diminish?\n\nThe concept of fossilization in SLA research is so intrinsically related to interlanguage that Selinker considers it to be a fundamental phenomenon of all SLA and not just to adult learners. Fossilization has received such wide recognition that it has been entered in the \"Random House Dictionary of the English Language\" (1987). Selinker's concept of fossilization is similar to that of Nemser, Tarone, and Sridhar, all of whom attempted to explore the causes of fossilization in second language learners' interlanguage.\n\nFossilization has attracted considerable interest among researchers and has engendered significant differences of opinion. The term, borrowed from the field of paleontology, conjures up an image of dinosaurs being enclosed in residue and becoming a set of hardened remains encased in sediment. The metaphor, as used in SLA literature, is appropriate because it refers to earlier language forms that become encased in a learner's interlanguage and that, theoretically, cannot be changed by special attention or practice of the target language. Despite debate over the degree of permanence, fossilization is generally accepted as a fact of life in the process of SLA.\n\nMany researchers have attempted to explain this. Workers have attempted to discover: 1) why fossilization occurs, 2) the precipitating conditions, 3) what kind of linguistic material is likely to be fossilized, and 4) what type of learners are more prone to fossilize. However, there has been almost no investigation by SLA theorists on the possibilities of preventing or overcoming fossilization, and little explanation related to those adult second language learners who overcome one or more \"areas of stability\" in interlanguage—those learners whose interlanguage does not fossilize, and who reach a high level of proficiency in the second language.\n\nOne factor of obvious relevance is motivation, and studies have been conducted regarding motivation to learning second language, and the relationship of fossilization to the learner's communicative needs. Arguments have emerged regarding adult learners' general lack of empathy with target language native speakers and culture. According to Guiora et al., adults do not have the motivation to change their accent and to acquire native-like pronunciation. Unlike children, who are generally more open to target language culture, adults have more rigid language ego boundaries. Thus, adults may be inclined to establishing their pre-existing cultural and ethnic identity, and this they do by maintaining their stereotypical accent. Notwithstanding this, there is a lack of needed research, particularly regarding achievement motivation, especially considering that fossilization can be considered the most distinctive characteristic of adult SLA.\n\n\nThe text of this article is taken with permission from \"The Role of Achievement Motivation on the Interlanguage Fossilization of Middle-Aged English-as-a-Second-Language Learners\" by Dr. Zoran Vujisić (2007).\n\n"}

{"id": "17224369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17224369", "title": "Kannada grammar", "text": "Kannada grammar\n\nThe Kannada grammar () is primarily based on Keshiraja's Shabdamanidarpana (c. 1260 CE) which provides the fullest systematic exposition of Kannada language. The earlier grammatical works include portions of \"Kavirajamarga\" (a treatise on \"alańkāra\") of 9th century, \"Kavyavalokana\" and \"Karnatakabhashabhushana\" both authored by Nagavarma II in first half of the 12th century.\nThe grammar of Kannada differs greatly from that of the Indo-European languages. As a Dravidian language, Kannada is not genetically related to Sanskrit, Hindi or any of the Indo-Aryan languages spoken in India.\n\nVarious grammatical aspects of Kannada include, tatsama–tadbhava, vibhakti pratyaya, kāla (tense-forms), linga (gender-forms), sandhi, samāsa, chandassu, alańkāra; and different poetrical metres such as \"vritta\", \"tripadi\", \"kanda\" (also called, \"choupadi\" or \"chaturpadi\"), \"shatpadi\", sāngatya and others.\n\nThe name given for a pure, true letter is \"akshara\", \"akkara\" or \"varna\". Each letter has its own form (\"ākāra\") and sound (\"shabda\"); providing the visible and audible representations, respectively. Kannada is written from left to right.\nKannada alphabet (\"aksharamale\" or \"varnamale\") now consists of 49 letters.\n\nEach sound has its own distinct letter, and therefore every word is pronounced exactly as it is spelt; so the ear is a sufficient guide. After the exact sounds of the letters have been once gained, every word can be pronounced with perfect accuracy. The accent falls on the first syllable. \n\nThe first treatise on Kannada grammar in English was written in 1864 by Rev. Thomas Hodson, a Wesleyan missionary, as \"An Elementary Grammar of the Kannada, or Canarese Language\"\n\n\nAccording to Keshiraja's \"Shabdamanidarpana\", there are nine gender forms in Kannada. However, in modern Kannada literature only three gender forms are used in practice: masculine, feminine, and neuter.\nAll Kannada nouns code for gender.\nBiological sex tends to correspond with the grammatical gender category. However, certain concepts personified by deities, such as \"sūrya\", meaning 'the sun', share the grammatical gender of the deity, which in this case is masculine.\n\n\n\nNouns that do not belong to either of the above two classes are considered to have neuter gender.\n\nKannada has seven cases:\n\nBecause the traditional study of Kannada grammar is based on Sanskrit grammar, a fifth case (since the dative case is the fourth case and the genitive case is the sixth in the traditional order of the cases) is sometimes considered: the ablative case (ಅಪಾದಾನವಿಭಕ್ತಿ). This case is formed periphrastically by combining the genitive case of the noun supposedly in the ablative with the instrumental-case form of the noun 'ದೆಸೆ', meaning 'cause, vicinity, place, point'. Thus the Kannada ablative literally translates to 'from/by the cause/point of the {noun}'. However, this 'ablative' form is not commonly used colloquially, and exists only for propriety—it is not a true case, serving only to provide a parallel to the Sanskrit ablative. In its place, the third case, the instrumental-ablative case, is normally used.\n\n\nOf course, \"Marada deseyiṁda allige hōdenu.\" would also be correct.\nNote that the nominative-case and accusative-case forms of a noun are often in the colloquial dialect substituted by the crude base.\n\nThere are, as in English, two grammatical numbers: the singular number (ಏಕವಚನ) and the plural number (ಬಹುವಚನ). In declension, the plural form of a masculine or feminine noun is made by suffixing 'ಅರ್' to the crude base, and then the case-termination, and the plural form of a neuter noun is made by suffixing 'ಗಳ್' to the crude base, and then the case-termination. However, nouns of relationship, such as 'mother', 'great-grandfather', 'son-in-law', and 'younger brother', which are always masculine or feminine, have the plural number marker \"ಅಂದಿರ್'.\n\nKannada has \"four\" declensions, or groups of case-terminations. The first declension includes all masculine and feminine nouns that end in 'ಅ'; the second declension includes all neuter nouns that end in 'ಅ'; the third declension includes all nouns of all genders that end in 'ಇ', 'ಈ', 'ಎ', 'ಏ', or 'ಐ'; the fourth declension includes all nouns of all genders that end in 'ಉ', ಊ', 'ಋ', 'ೠ', 'ಓ', or 'ಔ'.\nBelow are the 'standard' case-terminations, which are suffixed to the plural number markers to create the full case-termination in the plural. However, in the singular number, all the declensions use variations of the 'standard' case-terminations as the final case-terminations.\n\nSandhi is the mutation of the final or initial letters of a word for euphony. Sandhi occurs very often in declension.\n\nIn the first declension and in the second declension, the only sandhi that occurs is the elision (dropping) of the final 'ಅ' ('atva') before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel.\n\nIn the third declension, a euphonic 'ಯ್' ('yatva') must be inserted after the noun before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel.\n\nIn the fourth declension, a euphonic 'ವ್' ('vatva') must be inserted after the noun before a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel. However, when a Kannada noun ends in a 'ಉ' that was already added for euphony at some original stage, that final vowel is eliminated when the noun is followed by a plural marker or case-termination that begins with a vowel. For example, the Kannada word for ‘table’ is ‘ಮೇಜು', from the Persian ‘\"mez\"’. In transference, the\nfinal ‘z’ of ‘\"mez\"’ became a ‘j’, since Kannada has no letter to represent the ‘z’ sound. However, ‘ಮೇಜ್’ does not sound good in Kannada—so a euphonic ‘ಉ’ was added to the crude base of the word. However, because technically the true base has no final vowel (although the base still takes the fourth declension endings), that euphonic ‘ಉ’ of ‘ಮೇಜು’ is elided during declension. These words that already have a euphonic 'ಉ' that is elided during declension attached to their end must be learned, but most native Kannada, or originally Kannada, words have this 'euphonic \"ಉ\" ' on their end, because not many Kannada words originally ended in 'ಉ'.\n\nNote that for the instrumental case, the genitive case, and the locative case, the case-termination first given is generally preferred.\n\nKannada, as does English, uses adjectives and adverbs as modifiers. Kannada does not have articles. However, the adjectives 'ಆ' ('that') and 'ಒಂದು' ('one') can be used as the definite and the indefinite article, respectively.\n\nKannada possess few adjectives that are not derived from some noun. Adjectivalizing suffixes include 'ಆದ' (\"literally:\" 'which/that became') and 'ಇಕ'.\n\n\"Example: sundaravāda hengasu - ಸುಂದರವಾದ ಹೆಂಗಸು ('a beautiful woman'), aitihāsika dina - ಐತಿಹಾಸಿಕ ದಿನ ('a historic day')\"\n\nKannada lacks true predicate adjectives. To use an adjective predicatively, suffix the third-person pronoun to the end of the adjective that matches the subject.\n\n\"Example: Ā hengasu sundaravādavaļu - ಆ ಹೆಂಗಸು ಸುಂದರವಾದವಳು. ('That woman (is) beautiful.')\"\n\nAdverbs are formed by the suffix 'ಆಗಿ'. Adverbs can be added to adjectives or to nouns, unlike in English, where '-ly' can only be suffixed to adjectives.\n\n~=== Sandhi with verb inflection (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪದಗಳ ರೂಪನಿಷ್ಪತ್ತಿಯ ಸಂಧಿ) ===\n\nSandhi is the mutation of the final or initial letters of a word for euphony. Sandhi with verbs applies in any case when the form of a verb is being changed.\n\nWhen any verb form (ಕ್ರಿಯಾರೂಪ) ends with the vowel 'ಅ' ('atva') or with the vowel 'ಉ' ('utva'), eliminate that final vowel if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows.\n\nWhen the \"crude form/root\" of the verb (ಕ್ರಿಯಾಪಕೃತಿ) ends with the vowel 'ಇ' ('itva') or with the vowel 'ಎ' ('etva') or with the vowel 'ಆ' ('ātva'), insert a euphonic 'ಯ್' ('yatva') after the form if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows.\n\n\"ಬರೆ (crude verb form; 'write') → ಬರೆಯ್ + ಅಲ್ (infinitive form suffix) + ಪಟ್ಟಿತು (past passive third person singular neuter suffix) = ಬರೆಯಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಿತು (past passive third person neuter form of 'ಬರೆ'; 'it was written')\"\n\nWhen any other form of the verb ends with the vowel 'ಇ' ('itva') or with the vowel 'ಎ' ('etva'), eliminate that final vowel if a suffix that begins with a vowel follows. No other verb form other than the crude form/root of a verb will end in 'ಆ'.\n\n\"ಮಾಡು (crude verb form; 'make') → ಮಾಡಿ (past adverbial participle; 'having made') + ಇತು (past active third person singular imperative suffix) = ಮಾಡಿತು\"\n\nKannada verbs have several forms: an affirmative form (ನಿಶ್ಚಯರೂಪ), a\ncontingent-future, or potential, form (ಸಂಭಾವರೂಪ),\nan imperative form (ವಿಧಿರೂಪ),\nand a negative form (ನಿಷೇಧರೂಪ).\nThe action of a verb in the affirmative form does happen, but the action\nof a verb in the negative form does not happen. The contingent-future form\nexpresses the idea of the possibility of an action’s occurrence at the present\nor in the future; the imperative form commands, exhorts, or optates.\n\nAs in English, the three tenses (ಕಾಲಗಳು)\ninclude the present tense (ವರ್ತಮಾನಕಾಲ),\nthe past tense (ಭೂತಕಾಲ),\nand the future tense (ಭವಿಷ್ಯತ್ತುಕಾಲ).\nHowever, distinct forms for each of these tenses exist only in the\naffirmative form. The imperative form, as in English lacks tense, and because\nof the meaning of the contingent-future form, it also lacks tense distinctions.\nThe negative form is peculiar, for its forms can possess a present-tense,\npast-tense, or future-tense meaning, to be inferred from context; in the modern\ndialect, other modes of negation are employed.\n\nThere are two grammatical aspects (ಸ್ಥಿತಿಗಳು)\nof verbs—the perfect aspect (ಪೂರ್ಣವಾಚಕ\nಸ್ಥಿತಿ), in which the action has already occurred at the time expressed\nby the tense of the verb, and the progressive aspect (ಗತಿಸೂಚಕ ಸ್ಥಿತಿ), in which the\naction is ongoing at the time expressed by the tense of the verb.\n\nThe expression of voice (ಪ್ರಯೋಗ)\nin Kannada is quite different than in English, but the same two voices\nexist in both languages—the active voice (ಕರ್ತರೀ ಪ್ರಯೋಗ) and the passive voice (ಕರ್ಮಣಿ ಪ್ರಯೋಗ).\n\nFinite Kannada verbs are conjugated for all these properties as well as\nthree properties of the subject: person (ಪುರುಷ),\nnumber (ವಚನ), and\ngender (ಲಿಂಗ). There\nare three persons in Kannada as in English—the first person (ಉತ್ತಮ ಪುರುಷ), the second person\n(ಮಧ್ಯಮ ಪುರುಷ),\nand the third person (ಪ್ರಥಮ\nಪುರುಷ)—as well as a singular number (ಏಕವಚನ) and a plural number (ಬಹುವಚನ). Whether a noun is of\nthe masculine gender (ಪುಲ್ಲಿಂಗ),\nof the feminine gender (ಸ್ತ್ರೀಲಿಂಗ),\nor of the neuter gender (ನಪುಂಸಕಲಿಂಗ)\nis decided semantically. All nouns denoting male entities, including\nentities personified—for example, religiously—as male entities, are masculine,\nand all feminine nouns denote female entities or femalely personified entities;\nthe remaining nouns fall into the neuter gender.\n\nThe first non-finite verb form is the infinitive form (ಭಾವರೂಪ). There are three infinitives, which vary in their uses and their endings.\nOther than the infinitive, Kannada has two types of participle—an adjectival participle (ಕೃದ್ವಾಚಿ) and an adverbial participle (ಕ್ರಿಯಾನ್ಯೂನ). While the present participle of English can function both adjectivally and adverbially, and the past participle can function only adjectivally, Kannada participles’ functions are quite consistent.\nThe Kannada adjectival participle is peculiar, for it takes the place of the relative pronoun that introduces a restrictive relative clause, the verb of the relative clause, and if the relative pronoun is a prepositional complement, of the governing preposition. There is a present-future adjectival participle, as well as a past adjectival participle.\nThe adverbial participle has a present-tense form and a past-tense form, and modifies the verb of the sentence. The adverbial participle may accept its own nominative, as may the adjectival participle in its clause.\nKannada does not have a gerund, but nouns that express the same idea can be formed by suffixing the third-person neuter pronoun to the present adjectival participle.\n\nTo form the present adverbial participle of a verb, add the suffix 'ಉತ್ತ' to the crude form of the verb. There are no exceptions in the modern dialect, but occasionally the forms 'ಉತ' or 'ಉತ್ತಾ' may appear.\n\nTo form the past adverbial participle of a verb that ends in “ಉ,” add the suffix “ಇ” to the crude form of the verb. To form the past adverbial participle of a verb that ends in any vowel but “ಉ,” add the suffix “ದು” to the crude form of the verb.\n\nThere are many oddly formed past adverbial participles, some of them irregular, and some of them following old formations, and others changed for euphony. They are listed below: \n\nFor these verbs, or any modern forms of them: \nsuffix “ತು.”\n\nCertain\nfinal consonants\nare replaced with other consonants before the “ದು” or the “ತು”\nof the past participle. Before 'ದು': \nಲ್ →\nದ್; ಳ್ →\nದ್. Before\n“ತು”: ಱ್ →\nತ್; \nಱು\n(in which the\nfinal “ಉ”\nwas originally euphonic, as with the euphonic “ಉ”\nfor nouns) →\nತ್\n\nThe\nfollowing verbs’ past participles can be formed regularly, but there is also\nanother, irregular form of those verbs: ಆಗು\n→ ಆಯ್; ಪೋಗು\n→ ಪೋಯ್; \nಹೋಗು\n→ ಹೋಯ್\n\nTo form the present-future adjectival participle, add the suffix “ಉವ” to the crude form of the verb. There are not irregulars for this form in the modern dialect.\n\nThe past adjectival participle of the verb is formed from the past adverbial participle. If the past adverbial participle of a verb ends in 'ಉ', add 'ಅ' to the end of the past adverbial participle to form the past adjectival participle. If the past adverbial participle of a verb ends in 'ಇ', add 'ದ' to the end of the past adverbial participle.\n\nIrregular past adjectival participles include: 'ಆದ', from crude verb root 'ಆಗು'; 'ಪೋದ', from crude verb root 'ಪೋಗು'; and 'ಹೋದ', from crude verb root 'ಹೋಗು'.\n\nTo conjugate verbs in their present-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the present adverbial participle.\n\nTo conjugate verbs in their past-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the past adjectival participle, except for the third person neuter singular suffix, which is attached to the past adverbial participle.\n\nTo conjugate verbs in their future-tense affirmative form, attach the following suffixes to the present-future adjectival participle.\n\nThe negative form of the verb does not have any tense. Tense must be told from context. However, more commonly used to negate a verb is the negative word 'ಇಲ್ಲ'.\n\nSuffix these terminations (which are the same as the future tense's suffixes) to the verbal infinitive that ends in \"ಅ\" for the tenseless negative form:\n\nThe negative form has only the irregular formation that 'ಇಲ್ಲ' may be \"alternatively\" used in place of the regular negative forms of 'ಇರು'.\n\nThe contingent-future form expresses the idea that the action of a verb may perhaps occur in the future. For example, 'ಮಾಡಿಯೇನು', which is conjugated in the contingent-future form, may be translated as 'I \"might\" do (it)'.\n\nThese are the suffixes for the contingent-future form, suffixed to the past adverbial participle:\n\nThe contingent-future form does not have irregular formations.\n\nThe imperative form of the verb optates, exhorts, or commands. For example, the first-person and the third-person imperative expresses the idea of 'may/let {I/we/he/she/it/they} ___'. However, the second-person imperative either is used either to command ('Do something!') or with an optative or jussive sense ('may you ___'), depending on the verb's meaning and the context.\n\nThese suffixes are attached to the root of the verb:\n\nBelow are the irregular imperative forms:\n\nKushalathe\n\nKannada word order is 'S-O-V', or 'subject-object-verb', as opposed to English, which is a 'S-V-O', or 'subject-verb-object' language. However, in Kannada, due to its highly inflected nature, a sentence's word order may be freely changed for style or emphasis.\n\nKannada sentences have two basic parts: the subject and the predicate. The subject consists of the central topic of the sentence, declined to the nominative case, while the predicate consists of a verb, often with an object (which formally should be in the accusative case), \"or\" may have no verb and object at all but rather simply have another noun declined in the nominative case, known as the predicate nominative, where an equivalency statement is intended.\n\n\"Example: ನಾನು (subject) ಮೇಜನ್ನು (object) ಕಟ್ಟಿದೆನು (verb). ('I built the table.' Here, the subject is 'I' and 'built the table' is the predicate, with 'built' as the verb and 'the table' as the object.\"\n\n\"<nowiki>Example: ನಾನು (subject) ಕನ್ನಡದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯು (predicate nominative). ('I (am) a student of Kannada.' Note that there is no direct Kannada equivalent for the verb 'to be' as a copula [linking verb], because Kannada is a zero-copula language, although the sentence may be alternatively written 'ನಾನು ಕನ್ನಡದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ(ಯನ್ನು) ಆಗಿದ್ಧೇನೆ.' literally meaning 'I am/exist having become a student of Kannada.'</nowiki>\"\n\nIn Kannada, the subject is declined to the nominative case. While the subject almost always performs the action in Kannada (use of the passive voice is highly rare), the subject may actually be the patient.\n\nIn a sentence with a subject, verb, and object, if the subject has already been made clear or is known from context, the subject may be omitted, with the predicate standing alone to make the sentence.\n\n\"Example: ಮನೆಗೆ ಹೋಗುವೆನು. ('I will go home.' Here, we can omit the subject 'ನಾನು', meaning 'I' because it is clear by the termination of the verb (a first-person singular termination, the same person and number of 'I') that the subject is 'I'.\"\n\n\"Example: ವಿನಯನು ಇವತ್ತು ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಮನೆಗೆ ಬಂದನು. ('Vinay did not go to school today. {Vinay/he} came home.' In the second sentence, the subject 'Vinay' is omitted because it is clear from the previous sentence that the subject is 'Vinay'.)\"\n\nIn Kannada, there cannot be more than one finite, or conjugated, verb in the sentence. For example, the sentence 'I went to school and came home.' cannot be literally translated into Kannada. The Kannada equivalent of that sentence would be 'Having gone to school, I came home.' In Kannada, adverbial participles must be used.\n\n\"Example: ನಾನು ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಹೋಗಿ ಮನೆಗೆ ಬಂದೆನು. ('I, having gone to school, came home.' / 'I went to school and came home.')\"\n\n\"Example: ನಾನು ಓಡಿ ಆಡುವೆನು. ('I, having run, will play.' / 'I will run and play.' Note that if the intention is to say that the two actions will happen simultaneously ('I will play as I run.') then the sentence would be written 'ನಾನು ಓಡುತ್ತ ಆಡುವೆನು.')\"\n\nIn Kannada, the dative construction is used often. The dative construction occurs when the semantic subject is in the dative case and semantic direct object is in the nominative case. For example, in Kannada, one does not say 'I feel cold'; rather, one says the equivalent of 'cold is happening to me' ('ನನಗೆ ಚಳಿಯು ಆಗುತ್ತ ಇದೆ'). Similarly, one says 'dinner is wanted to me' ('ನನಗೆ ಉಟವು ಬೇಕು' or 'ನನಗೆ ಊಟವು ಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ'; the latter literally is broken apart 'ನನಗೆ ಊಟವು ಬೇಕಾಗಿ ಇದೆ', literally meaning 'to me, dinner has become wanted/needed').\n\nYet another example is the use with 'ಇಷ್ಟ'. For example, one says 'ನನಗೆ ಸೇಬುಗಳು ಇಷ್ಟ ಆಗುತ್ತವೆ' (idiomatically--'I like apples'; literally--'to me, apples become pleasure').\n\nDative constructions are used to make the equivalent of English sensory linking verbs and with many modal auxiliary verbs. For example, 'I see him' is translated as 'he causes me to see (him)', with 'me' in the dative case.\n\nKannada does \"not\" have any semantically negative words such as 'never', 'no one', and 'nothing'. These words are expressed by negating the verb with the positive equivalent of the negative word. For example, in Kannada, one cannot say 'students never go to school on Sundays'; one must say the equivalent of 'students do not go to school on Sundays ever' ('ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಯಾವಾಗಾದರೂ ವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಭಾನವಾರಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗುವದಿಲ್ಲ'). Similarly, for 'no one goes to school on Sundays', one says 'anyone does not go to school on Sundays' ('ಯರೂ ವಿದ್ಯಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಭಾನವಾರಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗುವದಿಲ್ಲ').\n\n\"Example:\" 'ಎಲ್ಲೂ ಆ ಘೋಷಣೆಯನ್ನು ಜನರು ಅಂಗೀಕರಿಸಲಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ.' ('Nowhere will the people accept that declaration.')\n\nAlthough there is a negative 'mood' or form of the verb in Kannada, it is not used commonly anymore. In addition, the negative form does not express time distinctions, so analytic negative forms are employed.\n\nThere is no negative adverb like 'not' in Kannada. Analytic verb negation is very peculiar, and it employs a form of 'ಇರು' ('to be, exist'), which is 'ಇಲ್ಲ'. However, negative Kannada verbs with 'ಇಲ್ಲ' do not have personal terminations—they do not indicate the person, gender, or number of the subject.\n\nTo form a past negative verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ', suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the infinitive form of the verb ending in 'ಅಲ್'. To form a present negative verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ', suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the verbal noun of the verb. To form a future negative verb, either use the present-tense negative form of the verb with 'ಇಲ್ಲ' or suffix 'ಇಲ್ಲ' to the infinitive form of the verb ending in 'ಅಲಿಕ್ಕೆ'.\n\nAspect is expressed by 'ಇಲ್ಲ' in the normal way—by using a negative form of 'ಇರು' with an adverbial participle. For example, 'I will not have been being hit' is 'ಹೊಡಿಯಲ್ಪಡುತ್ತ ಇದ್ದು ಇರಲಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ'.\n\n\"Example:\" 'ಹೋಗುತ್ತ ಇರುವದಿಲ್ಲ.' ('I am not going.')\n\n\"Example:\" 'ಹೋಗಿ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ.' ('I had not gone.')\n\nHowever, in the present tense, one can directly use 'ಇಲ್ಲ' after the participle to express aspect.\n\n\"Example:\" 'ಹೋಗುತ್ತ ಇಲ್ಲ.' ('I am not going.')\n\n\"Example:\" 'ಹೋಗಿ ಇಲ್ಲ.' ('I have not gone.')\n\nAdverbial participles have a negative form, created by suffix 'ಅದೆ' to the crude form of the verb. This form is tenseless, and is best translated as 'without ___ing'. For example 'ನೋಡಿ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'I went having seen (it)', 'ನೋಡುತ್ತ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'seeing (it), I went' or 'I went seeing (it)', and 'ನೋಡದೆ ಹೋದೆನು' means 'I went not seeing (it)', \"I went not having seen (it)', or 'I went without seeing (it)'.\n\nHowever, 'ಇಲ್ಲ', derived from 'ಇರು' has an adverbial participle form – 'ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' – and this can be used to keep tense when the adverbial participle must be negated. For example, one can say 'ನೋಡಿ ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' to definitively mean 'not having seen, and 'ನೋಡುತ್ತ ಇಲ್ಲದೆ' to definitively mean 'not seeing'.\n"}
{"id": "526409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526409", "title": "Kildin Sami language", "text": "Kildin Sami language\n\nKildin Saami (also known by its other synonymous names Saami, Kola Saami, Eastern Saami and Lappish), is a Saami language that is spoken on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia that today is and historically was once inhabited by this group. As social and cultural emphasis has been put on the writing and speaking of the various languages that constitute Russia, Kildin Saami has now become a critically endangered language. Russian is prominently spoken in Kildin Saami communities so much so that the original language is hardly ever heard of or only spoken privately amongst those who still know how to do so within an insular community. The few Kildin Saami who speak and understand their language proficiently can also speak various dialectical tongues that constitute ethnic Russia. Because the language has eroded so rapidly over the centuries, it is more widely spoken amongst or between older elders who were taught and educated between themselves and thus retained the spoken language and hardly spoken by children. The reasons for the loss and decline in speakership is as follows: a lack of education, dispersion of the Saami, no generational transmission of traditional Saami trades and ways of life, and not ever needing to speak or not regularly speaking the language have both caused speakership to take a hit over the years. Kildin Sami is written using an official Cyrillic script.\n\nThe area around Lovozero has the highest concentration of speakers. It is the largest of the Eastern Sami languages by number of speakers. Its future, however, appears to be not as bright as that of Skolt Sami or Inari Sami because the language is used actively by only very few people today. The Sami languages closest to Kildin are Ter Sami and Akkala Sami. The latter is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Kildin Sami. Originally, Kildin Saami was spoken in the mainland areas with the largest pockets of these people in clustered areas and in the coastal parts of the Kola Peninsula. Kildin Saami speakers can be found in rural and urban areas, with one of them being in the administrative center of the Murmansk area. Kildin Saami enclaves can be found throughout villages in Lovozero, Revda, Kola, Loparskaja, Teriberka, but can also be found in larger more sizable areas of Russia such as Olenegorsk and Apatity. Lovozero is known as the area where the Kildin Saami are dominantly present and where the language is still widely spoken amongst the small population: 700–800 ethnic Kildin Saami among a total village population of approximately 3,000. Today, the language has only about 100 active and perhaps 600 passive speakers. As a result of relocation, migration, and forced movement of the group, the community has really fragmented and become divided over other areas in Russia, thus leading to an inability for the revival and sustenance of their language, traditions, customs, and beliefs. From a strictly geographical point of view, only Kildin and Ter, spoken on the Peninsula, should be regarded as Kola Saami.\n\nThe Kildin Saami (Kola Saami) first came into contact and had more subsequent meetings with the Russians in the 12th century, when Pomor traders from the empire of Novgorod landed on the southern shores of the Kola Peninsula. Russians themselves inhabited and set up shelters in the Kola and the Ter Coast as it was known then during the 13th–14th centuries. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Russians started heavily occupying and building their own communities in northern Karelia and increased exposure between the Kildin Saami and Russians naturally blossomed as a result. In the 19th century, Kola Saami were organized and advocated for themselves through \"tight-knit familial communities\" where they worked in pastures, lived by fishing, and survived through hunting all in a concrete set around defined territory with extended family. During this time, they community shared in spiritual customs and held similar ideologies on their language and community. In the Russian empire, the Kildin Saami had no authority, rights or privileges, or liberties of autonomy and independence to control their affairs and to educate and teach their language through schools. After the 1917 Revolution which overthrew the tsarist regime of Nicholas II and led to the rise of the Bolsheviks, party systems, and emphasis towards a village-centered, peasant-centered, society, the Soviet state implemented laws or statutes that encouraged the development and protection of Saami language and Saami culture.\n\nDuring the 1930s, with an orientation toward Russian nationalism (\"Russification\") and Russian identity that came about more dramatically with Joseph Stalin's rise to power and his oppressive tactics, 20 years of repression, relocations, murders, and the extinguishment of certain languages came about, which had a quite negative influence on the Kola Sami languages and culture. As Stalins' reign went on in Soviet Russia, his paranoia, frustrations, anger, and delusions grew, emotions he would act on as leader. Resistance and refusal to submit to the collectivized farms, villages and working conditions of the reindeer Kildin Saami community led to arrests by Stalin in the 1930s of those who lived in the Kola tundras. As Russia entered World War II, Kildin Saami youth were drafted and impressed to serve in the Red Army, which lessened hardships and prejudices they faced for a temporary period. Although the repression ended after the death of Stalin in 1953, Russification policies continued and the work with the Sami languages started again only in the beginning of the 1980s when new teaching materials and dictionaries were published.\n\nThere is an opportunity to revitalize, reintegrate, and have Kildin Sami be more widely spoken such as reintroducing and raising awareness and support for Kildin Saami as an everyday language for communication—like in the Saami community of Lovozero. Youth and adolescents are expressing more interest now to speak Kildin Saami which can help in the languages survival. A sizable portion of political and cultural Kildin Saami groups are pushing for policies and local measures that help to maintain and protect Saami tradition, which is important if the language is to survive the test of time. The federal Russian legislation guarantees the Sami several legal rights giving them language sovereignty and rights to use and develop their languages. But for the practical realization of these rights the Kola Sami community needs to hold a constant constructive dialogue with the municipal and regional authorities, which have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Sami in the development of the Sami language and culture.\n\nA majority of children hold no knowledge of their languages, traditions, customs, or beliefs, and have had no formal or informal teaching which may give them a base of knowledge from which to work from. Antiquated materials, ineffective or inaccessible resources, and old teaching methods are often used to teach the language; there is no efforts towards the transmission of the language to future generations nor is there an active effort to preserve written language for scholarly use or to build opportunities to learn Kildin Saami at higher levels. Although authorities and some government officials express a desire and willingness to resuscitate and revitalize the language, the community is not using that to their advantage, either because they do not know how to do so or who to reach out to. There is no collaboration or team effort from language activists, language experts and language users and no coordinated or organized process to make learning the Kildin Saami language a reality for more people. A language center or another initiative to carry out a more coordinated and well-planned language work could solve that problem.\n\nKildin Sami is written in an extended version of Cyrillic since the 1980s. The alphabet has three variants with some minor differences in certain letters, mostly in Ҋ vs. Ј and ’ (apostrophe) vs. Һ. Whereas the dictionary of Sammallahti/Khvorostukhina(1991) uses Ҋ and ’ (apostrophe), Kuruč at al. 1985 uses Ј and Һ. The third orthographic variant, used, e.g. by Kert (1986), has neither of these letters.\n\nNote that the letters Ӓ, Ҋ/Ј, Һ/’ (apostrophe), Ӆ, Ӎ, Ӊ, Ӈ, Ҏ, Ъ, Ь, Ҍ and Ӭ do not occur word initially, either because the letters mark features of preceding consonants or the sounds they represent do not occur word initially. So these letters do not normally occur in uppercase, except for all caps text.\n\nThe letter Щ occurs only in Russian loanwords.\n\nThe orthographic principles are more or less similar to Russian, but note the following special features.\n\nSimilar to Russian, palatalization of a consonant in Kildin Sami is marked by the letter Ь or one of the vowel letters Е, Ё, И, Ю, and Я following the consonant. Palatalized Д, Т, Н, however, are marked by ҍ or one of the vowel letters Ӓ and Ӭ. Note also that the consonant letter Н before Ь or one of the vowel letters Е, Ё, И, Ю, and Я does not represent palatalization but the palatal nasal .\n\nLong vowels are marked with a macron over the vowel letter (and above the diaeresis in the cases of Ё).\n\nThe letter Һ occurs before the letters П, Т, К, Ц and Ч, and marks (historical) preaspiration. The actual pronunciation, however, varies between true preaspiration or the fricative sounds , , or .\n\nVoiceless sonorants are represented by the letters Ҋ/Ј, Ӆ, Ӎ, Ӊ, and Ҏ.\n\nThe velar nasal is written as Ӈ.\n\nBelow are all of the consonants in Kildin Sami. The symbols in parenthesis are minimal sounds.\n\nRimma Kuruch's dictionary presents the following vowels for Kildin Sami:\n\nIn Kildin Saami negation is formed by a syntagma, which consists of a finite negative auxiliary and a finite main verb in a special case called \"connegative\" (negative form of the main verb). The negative auxiliary gets inflected by person, number and mood. The connegative is a case for the main verb in a negative clause. The tense (whether present or past) is marked by the main verb in a negative clause. The negative auxiliary has the same form in all tenses.\n\nThis is the inflectional paradigm of the negative auxiliary:\nNegative clause in present tense:\nNegative clause in present tense:\nWith the negation of the verb \"to be\" in the third person it comes to an amalgamation of the main verb and the negative auxiliary:\n\n\"ell'a\" = \"is not\", compound of \"ejj\" (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and \"lea\" (connegative, present, main verb: \"to be\")\n\n\"jievla\" = \"are not\", compound of \"jiev\" (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and \"lea\" (connegative, present, main verb: \"to be\")\n\n\"ell'ij\" = \"was not\", compound of \"ejj\" (3. pers. sg. negative auxiliary) and \"liijja\" (connegative, past, main verb: \"to be\")\n\nIn the third person plural of the past tense there is no amalgamation of the negative auxiliary and the main verb \"to be\":\n\n\"jiev liijja\" = \"were not\", compound of \"jiev\" (3. pers. pl. negative auxiliary) and \"liijja\" (connegative, past, main verb: \"to be\")\n\nNegative indefinite pronouns are formed with the negative prefix \"ni-\". It is the only prefix in Kildin Saami and is borrowed from the Russian language. The prefix \"ni-\" can get used with all interrogative pronouns. The negative indefinite pronouns can stay in different cases. Some examples are:\n\n\"ni-k'ē\" Neg-who? nominative, singular \"nobody\"\n\n\"ni-k'ējn\" Neg-who? comitative, singular \"with nobody\"\n\n\"ni-k'ēnn\" Neg-who? genitive, singular \"nobody's\"\n\n\"ni-mī\" Neg-what? nominative, singular \"nothing\"\n\n\"ni-mēnn\" Neg-what? accusative, singular \"nothing\"\n\nThe word \"tundra\" has been borrowed to English, via Russian. In Kildin Sami, (') means \"treeless plain\", but its genitive case is (').\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35466941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35466941", "title": "Manual babbling", "text": "Manual babbling\n\nManual babbling is a linguistic phenomenon that has been observed in deaf children and children born to deaf parents and appears at the early stages of language acquisition. It is characterized by repetitive movements that are confined to a limited area in front of the body similar to the sign-phonetic space used in sign languages. In their 1991 paper, Pettito and Marantette concluded that between 40% and 70% of deaf children's hand movements can be classified as manual babbling.\n\nAll infants are equipped to detect rhythmic patterns and properties of the linguistic input they receive. Where hearing children are triggered by the sound patterns they hear, deaf children are more attentive to the movement patterns they see. In other words, vocal babbling is triggered by patterns of the spoken linguistic environment, and manual babbling is triggered by patterns of a signed linguistic environment. This, however, still leaves room for non-hearing children to piece together what these movements are and what they mean. Because of this lack of clarity, non-hearing infants explore manual gestures like a hearing child may explore phonemes. Petitto and Marentette researched the difference between the manual babbling used by hearing and non-hearing infants, and they discovered that non-hearing babies produce more different kinds of manual babbles than hearing infants do. However, there was not a significant difference between the frequency of communicative gestures between hearing and non-hearing infants.\nThe difference between manual babbling and signed syllables is that while signed syllables are language-driven, manual babbling is centered on hand shape, location, and movement. In other words, instead of being language-driven, manual babbling is motor-driven.\n\nWhen an infant is beginning to develop a means of communication, it is often also trying to get a sense of their spatial orientation and cognition. This means that there will be arm and hand movements outside of what could be categorized as manual babbling. For example, when an infant is waving their arm back and forth, they may be transitioning between uncoordinated behaviors and intentional, voluntary behaviors like reaching. The frequency of these arm and hand gestures peaks between 5 and a half months and 9 and a half months, which is the same developmental point as vocal development.\n\nIn 1995, Meier and Willerman defined the three primary manual gestures as pointing, reaching, and waving, so anything beyond those three could be categorized as manual babbles. Common babbles by this definition include arm waves, body pats, and claps. Common communicative gestures, which are different from babbles because they carry meaning, include reaches, points, conventional waves, and rituals (like patty cake). \nIdentification of manual babbling references American Sign Language phonology. This means that the babbles have hand shapes, a general place of articulation, movement, and palm orientation.\n\nAdrianne Cheek, Kearsy Cormier, Christian Rathmarm, Ann Repp, and Richard Meier did testing that yielded similarities between babbles and first signs. The analysis of properties of babbles and signs showed that in hand shape, all infants produced a relaxed hand with all fingers extended more often than any other hand shape; the same held for deaf infants in first signs. For movement, infants displayed downward movements more often for babbles and signs than any other movement category. For the relationship between the hands, babies demonstrated a preference for one-handed babbles over two-handed ones. Deaf babies maintained this preference by producing more one-handed signs than two-handed ones. For palm orientation, subjects predominately babbled or signed with palms down.\n\nKearsy Cormier, Claude Mauk, and Ann Repp conducted an observational study of the natural behaviors of hearing and deaf infants. They opted to utilize a more global approach to manual babbling in their coding, as suggested by Meier and Willerman. Their two goals are as follows: (1) Determine when manual babbling in deaf and hearing infants during their respective developmental timelines; and (2) Analyze how manual babbling and the onset of communicative gestures are related. The results support the predictions and claims made previously by Meier and Willerman since it was found most of early gestural behavior is a result of motor development in addition to linguistic influences. In addition, deaf children usually produced more referential gestures, specifically referential pointing, than hearing children, which could be caused by their distinct linguistic environments. For instance, points become essential for deaf children learning sign. On the contrary, for hearing children, points will always be added gestures that are not necessary to the spoken language.The study concludes that, while the child’s early communicative gestures are partially determined by linguistic environment, manual babbling is mainly influenced by motor development, which is the same for both deaf and hearing children.\n\nThere is also evidence that manual babbling resembles the babbling of hearing children and allows for further communication through sign. As the deaf infant develops, the cyclic increase in manual babble leads to making different handshapes used in sign, such the 5 hand, C hand, and S hand in early babbling. These handshapes become more significant since they allow for the reception of the caretaker’s child-directed signing. The infant soon begins to notice that they are making these handshapes in a manner analogous to how infants with hearing parents listen to speech.\n\n"}

The term \"mint never hinged\" has developed to provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term \"unmounted mint\" was thought to be ambiguous.\n\nMint stamps are often more valuable than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive.

Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.\n\nDifferences between mint and used values for the same stamp have led to a small industry in removing, or adding, postal cancellations to stamps. Another common practice is to attempt to remove fiscal cancellations, which are often pen cancels, in order to change a stamp used fiscally (for tax purposes) to one apparently unused. Stamps available for both postage and revenue (fiscal) purposes are usually worth more unused or with a postal cancellation.

The word oophagy is formed from the classical Greek ᾠόν (ōion, egg) and classical Greek φᾱγεῖν (phāgein, to eat). In contrast, adelphophagy is the cannibalism of a multi-celled embryo.\n\nOophagy is thought to occur in all sharks in the order Lamniformes and has been recorded in the bigeye thresher (\"Alopias superciliosus\"), the pelagic thresher (\"A. pelagicus\"), the shortfin mako (\"Isurus oxyrinchus\") and the porbeagle (\"Lamna nasus\") among others. It also occurs in the tawny nurse shark (\"Nebrius ferrugineus\"), and in the family Pseudotriakidae.\n\nThis practice may lead to larger embryos or prepare it for a predatory lifestyle.\n\nThere are variations in the extent of oophagy among the different shark species. The grey nurse shark (\"Carcharias taurus\") practices intrauterine cannibalism, the first developed embryo consuming both additional eggs and any other developing embryos. Slender smooth-hounds\n(\"Gollum attenuatus\"), form egg capsules which contain 30-80 ova within which only one ovum develops while all other ova are ingested and packed to an external yolk sac. The embryo then develops normally without ingesting further eggs.\n\nOophagy is also used to refer to more general egg-eating behaviours such as those practised by some snakes. Similarly, the term can be used to describe the destruction of non-queen eggs in nests of certain social wasps, bees, and ants. This is seen in the wasp species \"Polistes biglumis\" and \"Polistes humilis\". Oophagy has been observed in \"Leptothorax acervorum\" and \"Parachartergus fraternus\", where oophagy is practiced to increase energy circulation and consume more protein. \"Polistes fuscatus\" use oophagy as a method to establish a dominance hierarchy; dominant females will eat the eggs of subordinate females such that they no longer produce eggs, possibly due to the unnecessary expending of energy and resources. This behavior has also been observed in some bee species. Bee species include \"Xylocopa sulcatipes\" and \"Bombus ruderatus\", where queen bees will eat the larva deposited by workers or ejected them from the nest in order to maintain dominance over the female workers.\n\n"}
{"id": "181240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181240", "title": "Pennsylvania German language", "text": "Pennsylvania German language\n\nPennsylvania German (, \"Pennsylvania \", , Hinterwäldler Deutsch, ; often called Pennsylvania Dutch) is a variety of West Central German spoken by the Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites and other descendants of German immigrants in the United States and Canada, closely related to the Palatine dialects. There are possibly more than 300,000 native speakers in the United States and Canada. In Pennsylvania 29.9% of the population currently claim to have German ancestry.\n\nIt has traditionally been the dialect of the Pennsylvania Dutch, descendants of late 17th- and early to late 18th-century immigrants to Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina from southern Germany, eastern France (Alsace and Lorraine), and Switzerland. Although for many, the term \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" is often taken to refer to the Amish and related Old Order groups exclusively, the term should not imply a connection to any particular religious group.\n\nIn this context, the word \"Dutch\" does not refer to the Dutch people or their descendants. Historically, it has been accepted that the \"Dutch\" in Pennsylvania Dutch is a corruption or \"folk-rendering\" of the Pennsylvania German endonym . An alternative theory is that it is left over from an archaic sense of the English word \"Dutch\"; compare German ('German'), Dutch ('German'), ('Dutch'), which once referred to any people speaking a non-peripheral continental West Germanic language on the European mainland.\n\nSpeakers of the dialect today are primarily found in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and other Midwestern states of the United States, and in Ontario in Canada. Historically, the dialect was also spoken in several other regions where its use has either largely or entirely faded. The practice of Pennsylvania German as a street language in urban areas of Pennsylvania (such as Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, and York) was declining by the arrival of the 20th century, while in more rural areas it continued in widespread use through the World War II era. Since that time, its use has greatly declined. The exception to this decline is in the context of the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities, and presently the members of these two groups make up the majority of Pennsylvania German speakers .\n\nThe ancestors of Pennsylvania German speakers came from various parts of the southwest corner of the German-speaking region of Europe, mainly the Palatinate, but also including the Electoral Palatinate (), the Duchy of Baden, Swabia, Württemberg, Alsace (German ), German Lorraine, and Switzerland. Most of them spoke Rhine Franconian, especially Palatinan and to a lesser degree Alemannic dialects, and it is believed that in the first generations after the settlers arrived these dialects merged. The result of that dialect levelling was a dialect very close to the eastern dialects of Palatinian, especially the rural dialects around Mannheim/Ludwigshafen.\n\nWhen individuals from the Palatinate \"(Pfalz)\" region of Germany encounter Pennsylvania German speakers today, conversation is often possible to a limited degree. There are many similarities between the German dialect that is still spoken in this small part of southwestern Germany and Pennsylvania German. There are approximately 2,400,000 Germans in Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region (a region almost identical to the historical Palatinate) speaking Palatinate German, the specific German dialect from which the \"Pennsylvania German\" is mainly derived.\n\nPennsylvania German has primarily been a spoken dialect throughout its history, with very few of its speakers making much of an attempt to read or write it. Writing in Pennsylvania German can be a difficult task, and there is no spelling standard for the dialect. There are currently two primary, competing models which numerous orthographic (i.e., spelling) systems have been based upon by individuals attempting to write in the Pennsylvania German dialect. One 'school' tends to follow the rules of American English orthography, the other the rules of Standard German orthography. The choice of writing system is not meant to imply any difference in pronunciation. For comparison, a translation into Pennsylvania German, using two different spelling systems, of the Lord's Prayer, as found in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, is presented below. The text in the second column illustrates a system based on American English orthography. The text in the third column uses, on the other hand, a system based on Standard German. The English original is found in the first column, and a Standard German version appears in the fifth column. (Note: The German version(s) of the Lord's Prayer most likely to have been used by Pennsylvania Germans would have been derived in most cases from Martin Luther's translation of the New Testament.)\n\nSince 1997, the Pennsylvania German newspaper \"Hiwwe wie Driwwe\" allows dialect authors (of whom there are still about 100) to publish Pennsylvania German poetry and prose. \"Hiwwe wie Driwwe\" was founded by Michael Werner. It is published twice a year (2,400 copies per issue) - since 2013 in cooperation with the Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center at Kutztown University. Since 2002, the newspaper is published both online and in print. \n\nIn 2006, the German publishing house \"Edition Tintenfaß\" started to print books in Pennsylvania German.\n\nIn 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses began to publish literature in Pennsylvania German.\n\nPennsylvania German for the most part does not reflect the origins of the early speakers from different regions along the upper Rhine River (Rhineland, Württemberg, Baden, Saarland, Switzerland and the Elsass/Alsace) but almost exclusively the strong immigrant group from the Palatine. \n\nPennsylvania German is not a corrupted form of Standard German, since Standard German evolved as an archaic — and for a long time artificial — koiné language in a very long process that started in the time of classical Middle High German (1170–1250), see Standard German: Origins. Pennsylvania German instead reflects the independent development of Palatine German, especially from the region that is called in German. \n\nSeveral vowel and consonant in Pennsylvania German represent older forms of the German language, e.g. \"p\" instead of \"pf\" or \"v\" instead of \"b\", while Standard German consonants shifted. They only appear as shifts if Standard German is erroneously seen as the basis from which Pennsylvania German evolved. The correspondence between Standard German and Pennsylvania German occur with a fair degree of regularity. \n\nThe American English influence is most significant on vocabulary and to a much lesser degree on pronunciation; the English influence on grammar is relatively small. The question of whether the large loss of the dative case — the most significant difference compared with Palatine German — is due to English influence or reflects an inner development, is disputed.\n\nAs in Standard German, Pennsylvania German uses three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Pronouns inflect into three or four cases, while in Standard German always four cases. Concerning the article, the nominative and accusative merged, and the dative is mostly lost. As in all other German dialects, the genitive is lost and often replaced by a special construction using the dative and the possessive pronoun: \"the man's dog\" becomes (literally: \"to the man his dog\"). In most regions, the dative has been gradually replaced by the accusative, so that , for example, has frequently become .\n\nAdjectival endings exist, but appear simplified compared to Standard German. As in all other South German dialects, the past tense is generally expressed using the perfect: (\"I have run into the field\") and not the simple past ( [\"I ran into the field\"]), which is only retained in the verb \"to be\", as or , corresponding to English \"was\" and \"were\". The Subjunctive mood is only extant as ( is totally lost) in a limited number of verbs. In all other verbs it is expressed through the form of of the verbs \"to do\" () and \"to have\" ( / ) combined with the infinitive or the past participle, e.g., (\"I would eat\"), (\"I would have eaten\"). \n\nSeveral Pennsylvania German grammars have been published over the years. Two examples are \"A Simple Grammar of Pennsylvania Dutch\" by J. William Frey and \"A Pennsylvania German Reader and Grammar\" by Earl C. Haag.\n\nThe list below \"appears\" to use IPA symbols to represent sounds used in Standard German (to the left), with an arrow pointing to a sound found to be at times its Pennsylvania German equivalent. Following each of these entries is an example of a related word from Standard German, once again with an arrow pointing to its modern Pennsylvania German counterpart.\n\n\n\nIn Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, there have been numerous other shifts that can make their Pennsylvania German particularly difficult for modern High German speakers to understand. A word beginning in generally becomes (which is more easily pronounced), so that German > > and German > > . Likewise, German > > (as if it were English *\"chite\"). German > > (exactly as in American English \"trick\" but with an extra ). This shift is rather common with German children learning to speak.\n\nThe softened after guttural consonants has mixed with the guttural of earlier generations and also turned into an American , so that German > > and German > > (spoken as *\"trint\" would be in American English). These changes in pronunciation, combined with the general disappearance of declensions as described above, result in a form of the dialect that has evolved somewhat from its early Pennsylvania origins nearly 300 years ago, while still being rather easy to understand by German dialect speakers of the Rhineland-Palatinate area.\n\nThe people from southern Germany, eastern France and Switzerland, from whom the Pennsylvania German culture and dialect sprang, started to arrive in America in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. To a more limited extent, this is also true of a second wave of immigration in the mid-19th century, which came from the same regions, but settled more frequently in Ohio, Indiana and other parts of the Midwest. Thus, an entire industrial vocabulary relating to electricity, machinery and modern farming implements has naturally been borrowed from the English. For Pennsylvania German speakers who work in a modern trade or in an industrial environment, this could potentially increase the challenge of maintaining their mother tongue.\n\nNumerous English words have been borrowed and adapted for use in Pennsylvania German since the first generations of Pennsylvania German habitation of southeastern Pennsylvania. Examples of English loan words that are relatively common are \"bet\" ( = I bet you can speak Pennsylvania German), \"depend\" ( = it depends somewhat on who you are); for \"chap\" or \"guy\"; and for \"to jump\". Today, many speakers will use Pennsylvania German words for the smaller numerals and English for larger and more complicated numbers, like $27,599.\n\nConversely, although many among the earlier generations of Pennsylvania Germans could speak English, they were known for speaking it with a strong and distinctive accent. Such Pennsylvania Dutch English can still sometimes be heard to this day. Although this more recently coined term is being used in the context of this and related articles to describe this Pennsylvania German-influenced English, it has traditionally been referred to as \"Dutchy\" or \"Dutchified\" English.\n\nPennsylvania German, which is now in its fourth century on North American soil, had more than 250,000 speakers in 2012. It has shifted its center to the West with approximately 160,000 speakers in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and other Midwest states. There is even a small but growing number of Pennsylvania German speakers in Upper Barton Creek and Springfield in Belize among Old Order Mennonites of the Noah Hoover group. The dialect is used vigorously by the horse and buggy Old Order Mennonites in the northern part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhile speakers without an Anabaptist background in general do not pass the dialect to their children today, the Old Order Amish and horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites do so in the current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The Old Beachy Amish and the Kauffman Amish Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches. Even though Amish and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist John A. Hostetler, less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania German population was Amish or Mennonite.\nThere have been efforts to advance the use of the dialect. Kutztown University offers a complete minor program in Pennsylvania German Studies. The program includes two full semesters of the Pennsylvania German dialect. In the 2007–2008 school year, the classes were being taught by Professor Edward Quinter. In 2008–2009, Professor Robert Lusch served as the instructor.\n\nSince 2005, Pennsylvania Germans have been working on a .\n\nAccording to one scholar, \"today, almost all Amish are functionally bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English; however, domains of usage are sharply separated. Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish. Finally, the Amish read prayers and sing in Standard, or High, German () at church services. The distinctive use of three different languages serves as a powerful conveyor of Amish identity.\" Although \"the English language is being used in more and more situations,\" nonetheless Pennsylvania Dutch is \"one of a handful of minority languages in the United States that is neither endangered nor supported by continual arrivals of immigrants.\"\n\nBecause it is an isolated dialect and almost all native speakers are bilingual in English, the biggest threat to the dialect is gradual decay of the traditional vocabulary, which is then replaced by English loan words or words corrupted from English.\n\nIn the United States, most Old Order Amish and all \"horse and buggy\" Old Order Mennonite groups speak Pennsylvania German, except the Old Order Mennonites of Virginia, where German was already mostly replaced at the end of the 19th century. There are several Old Order Amish communities (especially in Indiana) where Bernese German, a form of Swiss German and Low Alemannic Alsatian, not Pennsylvania German, are spoken. Additionally, English has mostly replaced Pennsylvania German among the car driving Old Order Horning and the Wisler Mennonites. \n\nOther religious groups among whose members the Pennsylvania German dialect would have once been predominant, include: Lutheran and German Reformed congregations of Pennsylvania German background, Schwenkfelders, and Schwarzenau (German Baptist) Brethren. Until fairly recent times, the speaking of Pennsylvania German had absolutely no religious connotations.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, the Old Order Amish, the members of the Ontario Old Order Mennonite Conference, the David Martin Old Order Mennonites, the Orthodox Mennonites and smaller pockets of others (regardless of religious affiliation) speak Pennsylvania German. The members of the car driving Old Order Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference have mostly switched to English. In 2017, there were about 10.000 speakers of Pennsylvania German in Canada, far fewer than in the United States.\n\nThere are also attempts being made in a few communities to teach the dialect in a classroom setting; however, as every year passes by, fewer and fewer in these particular communities speak the dialect. There is still a weekly radio program in the dialect whose audience is made up mostly of these diverse groups, and many Lutheran and Reformed congregations in Pennsylvania that formerly used German have a yearly service in Pennsylvania German. Other non-native speakers of the dialect include those persons that regularly do business with native speakers.\n\nAmong them, the Old Order Amish population was probably around 227,000 in 2008. Additionally, the Old Order Mennonite population, a sizable percentage of which is Pennsylvania German-speaking, numbers several tens of thousands. There are also thousands of other Mennonites who speak the dialect, as well as thousands more older Pennsylvania German speakers of non-Amish and non-Mennonite background. The Grundsau Lodge, which is an organization in southeastern Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania German speakers, is said to have 6,000 members. Therefore, a fair estimate of the speaker population in 2008 might be close to 300,000, although many, including some academic publications, may report much lower numbers, uninformed of those diverse speaker groups.\n\nThere are no formal statistics on the size of the Amish population, and most who speak Pennsylvania German on the Canadian and U.S. censuses would report that they speak German, since it is the closest option available. Pennsylvania German was reported under ethnicity in the 2000 census.\n\nPennsylvania German speakers live mostly in the United States and Canada, but there are also some speakers who belong to traditional Anapaptist groups in Latin America. Even though most Mennonite communities in Belize speak Plautdietsch, some few hundreds who came to Belize mostly around 1970 and who belong to the Noah Hoover Mennonites speak Pennsylvania German. There are also some recent New Order Amish immigrants in Bolivia and Argentina who speak Pennsylvania German while the great majority of conservative Mennionites in these countries speak Plautdietsch.\n\nIn Mario Pei's book \"Language\", a popular poem in the dialect (with significant English influence in the form of loanwords) is printed; the free-translation is, in the main, by J. Cooper.\nFollowing the links, there are two examples of spoken Pennsylvania German: (The mother tongue) and (Are you born as a Christian?). More example of spoken Pennsylvania German can be found at the page \"American Languages - our nation's many languages online\" of the University of Wisconsin.\n\nAn example of a Pennsylvania German song is \"\" (My father and mother are German), here sung by John Schmid.\n\n\"The Office\" character Dwight Schrute and his family, including his cousin Mose, are frequently mentioned to be speakers of Pennsylvania German. Although Schrute works in the titular office, he also owns and operates an Amish-style beet farm and often alludes to his family's long Pennsylvania German heritage.\n\n\"Orange is the New Black\" character Leanne Taylor and family are featured speaking Pennsylvania Dutch in flashbacks showing her Amish background before ending up in penitentiary.\n\n\n\nOrganizations\n\nPennsylvania German\n\nFurther information\n"}

{"id": "14632360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14632360", "title": "Remand (detention)", "text": "Remand (detention)\n\nRemand (also known as pre-trial detention or provisional detention) is the process of detaining a person who has been arrested and charged with an offense until their trial. A person who is held on remand may be held as a prisoner in prison. Varying terminology is used, but \"remand\" is generally used in common law jurisdictions. Detention before charge is referred to as custody and continued detention after conviction is referred to as imprisonment.\n\nBecause imprisonment without trial is contrary to the presumption of innocence, in liberal democracies pre-trial detention is usually subject to safeguards and restrictions. Typically, a suspect will only be remanded if it is likely that they could commit a serious crime, interfere with the investigation, or fail to turn up in court. In the majority of court cases, the suspect will be outside of custody while awaiting trial, often with restrictions such as bail.\n\nResearch on pretrial detention in the United States has found that pretrial detention increases the likelihood of convictions, primarily because individuals, who would otherwise be acquitted or have their charges dropped, enter guilty pleas. \n\nThe pre-charge detention period is the period of time during which an individual can be held and questioned by police, prior to being charged with an offence. Not all countries have such a concept, and in those that do, the period for which a person may be detained without charge varies by jurisdiction.\n\nThe prohibition of prolonged detention without charge, \"habeas corpus\", was first introduced in England about a century after Magna Carta; the use of \"habeas corpus ad subjiciendum\" in 1305 was cited by William Blackstone.\n\nUnder Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic, which has the same legal standing as the Czech Constitution, a suspect must be immediately familiarized with the grounds of detention, must be interviewed and within 48 hours either released or charged and handed over to a court. The court then has a further 24 hours either to order a custody, or to release the person detained.\n\nDetailed rules of detention are included in the Criminal Procedural Code. The police may arrest and detain a suspect after obtaining prosecutor's consent. In an urgent case the police may detain a suspect without the consent. In both cases, however, the police detention may take place only when grounds for pre-trial detention exist (see below). The statutory limits of 48 + 24 hours must be complied with and reaching the time limit should aways trigger immediate release, unless a court has ordered pre-trial custody.\n\nAnybody may detain a person, who was caught while perpetrating a crime (not a misdemeanor) or immediately after it, when capturing of the perpetrator is necessary to either ascertain the perpetrator's identity or to prevent the perpetrator from escaping or to secure evidence. The perpetrator must immediately be handed over to the police, or when that is not possible, detention of the perpetrator must be immediately reported to the police.\n\nIn the United States, a person is protected by the federal constitution from being held in prison unlawfully. The right to have one's detention reviewed by a judge is called \"habeas corpus\". The U.S. Constitution states that \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\". A declaration of a state of emergency can suspend the right to \"habeas corpus\".\n\nThe Sixth Amendment requires criminal defendants to be \"informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\". The U.S. Bill of Rights thus grants some protection against being held without criminal charge, subject to the courts' interpretation of what due process means. Federal authorities have also exercised the power to arrest people on the basis of being a material witness. Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill is another category of detention without criminal prosecution, but the right of \"habeas corpus\" still applies. The scope of such detentions is also limited by the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe executive's military powers have been used to justify holding enemy combatants as prisoners of war, unlawful combatants, and civilian internees; the latter two practices have been controversial, especially with regard to the indefinite detention implied by uncertainty as to when the \"War on Terror\" might be declared to have ended. Administrative detention, a term applied to many of these categories, is also used to imprison illegal immigrants.\n\n\"\" is a pre-trial supervision measure pursuant to Swedish law, meaning that a suspect can be detained by a court in the case of crimes for which there is a prison term of one year or more. There are two degrees of suspicion:\n\nReason for detention is if the crime is a statutory minimum penalty of at least 1 year, and one of:\nor, for \"probable cause\" suspicion and also for lesser crimes:\n\nA person may be held in custody for a period of normally not more than 14 days (seven days if only the degree of suspicion \"reasonable suspicion\" exists), then normally new remand hearing should be held. For suspect who has not yet turned 18 needed \"serious reasons\" for detention decisions are to be notified of the court.\n\nA person, with less serious crimes, they are given by prosecutors a summary penalty order.\n\nA person who was \"häktad\" but was not charged (or was freed after trial) is entitled to financial compensation, with an amount determined by the Chancellor of Justice. It is usually around 500 SEK (US$80) per day for the suffering, somewhat more if there was media attention, plus compensation for lost work income. 1200 people were compensated in 2007. If the prisoner is sentenced, the time as \"häktad\" counts as a part of the prison time, so that less time will remain after the trial.\n\nThe Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe has repeatedly criticized pre-trial detention in Sweden for the high percentage of cases where restrictions on communication are applied. Such communication restrictions means in Sweden no visits, no telephone calls, no newspapers and no TV.\n\nThe term \"remand\" may be used to describe the process of keeping a person in detention rather than granting bail. A prisoner who is denied, refused or unable to meet the conditions of bail, or who is unable to post bail, may be held in a prison on remand. Although remanded prisoners are usually detained separately from sentenced prisoners, due to prison overcrowding they are sometimes held in a shared accommodation with sentenced prisoners. Reasons for being held in custody on remand vary depending on the local legal system, but may include:\n\n\nIn most countries, remand prisoners are considered innocent until proven guilty by a court and may be granted greater privileges than sentenced prisoners. For example, most jurisdictions that prohibit convicted criminals from voting in elections will still allow remand prisoners to vote, unless they have been disqualified from voting for some other reason. Other privileges commonly granted include:\n\n\nNot all remand prisons grant these privileges, in particular, remand prisoners are often forced to wear prison uniforms and denied additional visitation rights, supposedly for safety reasons, although some facilities allow remand prisoners to wear a uniform that is a different color or otherwise clearly distinguishable from the uniforms of convicted criminals. Often they are denied all visits and all newspaper and media access, for risk of interfering with the investigation, such as communicating a story with fellow remand prisoners.\n\nUnder Article 8 (5) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms, which has the same legal standing as the Constitution, nobody shall be taken into custody except on the basis of a court decision, and for reasons and a detention period stipulated by the law.\n\nDetailed rules of remand custody are contained in the Criminal Procedural Code. A person may be remanded in custody by the decision of a court only when a number of preconditions is met cumulatively:\n\nAt the same time, there must be reasonable concern, that the charged person may either\n\nThe charged person may be remanded in custody subject to maximum terms as follows: \none third of the maximum detention periods time may be exhausted in pre-trial proceedings and two thirds may be exhausted during the trial. Reaching the maximum time is always reason for immediate release.\n\nAn exception to the time limits above arises in cases of remand due to concern of \"(b)\" interfering with witnesses or similar frustration of proceedings, in which case the maximum pre-trial detention period may be only three months, except where the charged person has already been influencing witnesses or otherwise frustrating the proceedings.\n\nThe court must review the reasons for the pre-trial custody every three months and decide either to continue it, or to release the charged person. Both the prosecutor and the person in custody may file a complaint against any decision on custody, which leads to review by an appellate court.\n\nSpecial rules of remand pertain to persons who are processed for extradition, e.g. illegal foreigners, those detained due to international (foreign) warrant or the European Arrest Warrant.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, remand takes place in remand prisons or in separated sections of standard prisons. Remand prisons are often in city centres and appertain to court houses. Most remand prisons are over 80 years old, with some, like Pankrác Prison, being more than 125 years old. Men, women and juveniles are held separately. Also persons charged with committing different types of crimes (e.g. unintentional, intentional, violent, etc.) are held separately.\n\nCells have capacity varying between 1—8 beds, with most having between 2—4 beds. Some remand prisons have rooms intended for watching TV, gyms or chapels, but these are exceptional mainly due to overcrowding and lack of space. All have special areas for interviews between the inmates and their attorneys, visiting rooms and courtyards for out-walks.\n\nEach cell has a WC divided from the rest of the cell-space and running cold water. Each cell-mate has own bed, storage locker and chair.\n\nInmates which are held due to concern of influencing witnesses are held in isolation with very limited possibility of contact with other inmates as well as the outer world (apart from interviews with own attorneys).\n\nAt any given time in 2011, there were around 2.500 inmates in the Czech remand prisons (including ~170 women and ~45 juveniles), compared to some 20.500 convicted inmates (for 10,6 million population). The average length of remand custody is around 100 days, with few inmates spending in remand more than 2 years.\n\nMore than half of foreign inmates of the Czech remand prisons are from Slovakia, Ukraine and Vietnam. Other numerous foreigners are from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia and Serbia. When it comes to non-European states, there are numerous detainees from Nigeria, Algeria, Morocco, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. There are mostly only few individuals of other nationalities.\n\nIn England and Wales, a suspect may be remanded after charge if:\nRemanding a suspect requires permission from a magistrates' court. After charge, the court can choose to remand the suspect until the first hearing of their trial (if the offence is tried at the Crown Court, there is a preliminary hearing at a magistrates' court). At the first hearing, the court can then decide whether it necessary to remand the suspect until the end of the trial. Adults will be held on remand at a regular prison, while those below the age of 18 will be held at a secure centre for young people. If a remanded suspect is convicted and given a prison sentence, the time they spent on remand is deducted from the length of the sentence. In some cases, a convicted suspect has been released immediately after being sentenced, if the time they spent on remand was longer than or equal to the sentence they received.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits excessive bail. Under the US Code, pretrial detention of federal suspects is allowed only under certain circumstances, such as when the defendant is a danger to witnesses or jurors.\n\nTwo 2018 study in the \"American Economic Review\" and \"the Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization\" found that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, largely because individuals who would otherwise be acquitted in trial enter guilty pleas. The AER study found that pretrial detention also lowers the defendants' prospects in the labor market. The JLEO study found that pretrial detention caused 42% longer incarceration sentence and 41% higher nonbail court fees owed. The JLEO study notes that \"the use of money bail contributes to a “poverty-trap”: those who are unable to pay bail wind up accruing more court debt.\"\n\nPre-trial detention has been described as a \"necessary evil\". A 2013 report by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies concluded that pre-trial detention was being overused worldwide, and that most were being held for minor crimes. A 2014 report by the Open Society Foundations called it a \"massive and widely ignored pattern of human rights abuse\".\nA person must be found guilty \"beyond reasonable doubt\" in order to be convicted at a trial. However, pre-trial detention requires a lower threshold such as \"reasonable suspicion\". In most countries, the prosecution only need to prove that the charges are well-founded and that there is a sufficient threat that the defendant will commit another crime or undermine the judicial process. In the United States, the system of money bail means that a defendant can be detained even if neither of these threats can be identified, solely because nobody was willing or able to deposit the bail money for them.\n\nIn the \"Harvard Law Review\", Stephanie Bibas also noted its impact on plea bargaining. Pretrial detention alters a defendant's incentives by making his or her best-case scenario not zero days in jail, but the length of time served pretrial. Therefore, a defendant may be more likely to plead guilty if the chance of acquittal is low, or if the expected sentence on a guilty plea is less than the amount of jail time that would be served pretrial. Pretrial detainees may also find it harder to mount an effective defense.\n\nThe Open Society Foundation report also concluded that some detainees face worse conditions than convicted prisoners; for example the suicide rate is three times higher worldwide.\n\n"}

A prose narrative written in pre-Old-Kannada (\"Purva Halegannada\"), \"Vaddaradhane\" is considered the earliest extant work in the prose genre in the Kannada language. Scholars are, however, still divided about when exactly the text was written, with claims ranging from before the 6th century to the 10th century.\n\nAccording to the scholar R.S. Mugali, \"Vaddaradhane\" is one of the finest pieces of Jain literature, which stands out by itself in all of Kannada literature. In addition to religious content describing the lives of Jain saints (\"Jainas\"), it treats on Jain tenets regarding the torments of flesh and spirit, interpretations of fate (\"karma\"), rebirth and the plight of humans on earth. The text gives useful information about contemporary society including education, trade and commerce, magic and superstitions, the caste system and untouchability, and position of women in society. The text provides details on contemporary urban and rural society: towns with majestic buildings and multi-storied houses; temples (\"devalaya\"); a street for the prostitutes (\"sulegeri\"); palaces; streets with people, horses and elephants; homes of cloth merchants (\"dusigar\"); homes of diamond merchants (\"baccara\"); feudatories (\"samanta\"); royal officials (\"niyogi\"); grain markets and traders; and various types of settlements such as villages (\"grama\") and towns (\"nagara\"). The text dwells on the evils of \"Kali Yuga\" including miscegenation and takes a critical look at contemporary Brahmin practices. It mentions fierce warriors, royal retainers (\"velevali\") who were under oath to lay down their life for the king and royalty.\n\nThe dating of the work and its authorship has been a controversy. According to the scholar R.S. Mugali, experts are not unanimous whether the prose piece was written before \"Kavirajamarga\" (ca. 850) or after. According to modern Kannada poet and scholar M. Govinda Pai, the \"Vaddaradhane\" dates much further back. Based on his studies of the text and some pre-2nd century inscriptions from Shravanabelagola, Pai authored two scholarly publications in 1960: \"Kannada Sahityada Halame\" (\"Antiquity of Kannada literature\") and \"Kannada Sahityada Prachinate\" (also meaning \"Antiquity of Kannada literature\"), in which he argued \"Vaddaradhane\" more accurately dates to the pre-6th century period. However, the scholar D.L. Narasimhachar opines that the writing is from around c. 920. Professor Upadhye dates the writing to the post-9th century period while the historians A.R. Naronakar, K.A.N. Shastri, and Dravidian scholar Zvelebil date it to c. 900.\n\nThere is an opinion that Shivakoti was not the author of the work, and that his Prakrit work \"Bhagavati Aaradhane\" may have been the inspiration for this Kannada writing. However, it has been pointed out that the author's name appears in the concluding section of every story in the writing, and that the Prakrit writer, also named Shivakoti, lived in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. and was the disciple of Acharya Samantabhadra. Another name, Revakotiacharya, also appears in some places in the Kannada text. Historian Jyotsna Kamat is of the opinion that the didactic work comprising 19 stories dates to the 10th century and was inspired by the Sanskrit writing \"Brihatkatha-Khosa\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28307", "title": "Sin", "text": "Sin\n\nIn a religious context, sin is an act of transgression against divine or natural law. Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and God; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human living. In Jainism, sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the \"jiva\" (being) to attain \"moksha\" (supreme emancipation). In Islamic ethics, Muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of Allah (God). Judaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin.\n\nThe word derives from \"Old English \"syn(n)\", for original *\"sunjō\". The stem may be related to that of Latin '\"sons\", \"sont-is\"' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'\". The English Biblical terms translated as \"sin\" or \"syn\" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of New Testament Greek \"hamartia\" \"sin\", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing; Hebrew \"hata\" \"sin\" originates in archery and literally refers to missing the \"gold\" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error. \"To sin\" has been defined from a Greek concordance as \"to miss the mark\".\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.\n\nBuddhism believes in the principle of \"karma\", whereby suffering is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the Three poisons). While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of Buddhist ethics is consequentialist in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.\nKarma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. \nOne needs to purify negative karma Four Satipatthanas to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches Nirvana, the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.\n\nIn the Old Testament, some sins were punishable by death in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. Christians consider the Old Covenant to be fulfilled by the Gospel.\n\nIn the New Testament the forgiveness of sin is effected through faith and repentance (Mark 1:15). Sin is forgiven when the sinner acknowledges, confesses, and repents for their sin as a part of believing in Jesus Christ. The sinner is expected to confess his sins to God as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes giving thanks to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a union with God which abides forever. In the Epistle to the Romans , it is mentioned that \"the wages of sin is death\", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit salvation.\n\nIn Jewish Christianity, sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme love for mankind. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross as a satisfactory sacrifice for the sins of humanity. Humanity was destined for life with God when Adam disobeyed God. The Bible in says \"For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.\"\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as the refusal to follow God's plan and the desire to be \"like God\" (as stated in Genesis 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of Adam and Eve in Genesis).\nOriginal sin is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through Adam and Eve's sin in the Garden of Eden and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.\n\nThe serpent who beguiled Eve to eat of the fruit was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and Eve's descendants (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being subordinate to Adam originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper (Genesis 2:18-25); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her husband and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain to be planted, nurtured, and harvested. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when buried after death. When Adam's son Cain slew his brother Abel, he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first marked him with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).\n\nOne concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in Heaven. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the temporal) body, is not of (eternal) transcendental living and therefore its \"excessive\" savoring is considered a sin. The unforgivable sin (or eternal sin) is a sin that can never be forgiven;\nMatthew 12:30-32 :\n\" He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.\"\n\nIn Catholic Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called mortal sins and less serious sins called venial sin. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in Purgatory.\n\nJesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.\n\nThe Lamb of God was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, Leviticus 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest Aaron was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a spotless young lamb.\n\nIn Hinduism, the term \"sin\" (\"\" in Sanskrit) is often used to describe actions that create negative Karma by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) Dharma, or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term \"aparadha\" is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and Purva-Mimansa . The term \"papa\" however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a lack of consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that \"papa\" has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.\n\nIn Islamic ethics, Muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of Allah (God), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion. Islamic terms for sin include \"dhanb\" and \"khaṭīʾa\", which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; \"khiṭʾ\", which means simply a sin; and \"ithm\", which is used for grave sins.\n\nIn Jainism, the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (\"paap\"), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (\"punya\") meaning merit. A \"jiva\" (a being) acquires sin based on its karma, if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.\n\nNo \"jiva\" can achieve \"moksha\" (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A \"jiva\" accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A \"jiva\" ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of \"samyak gyan\" (right knowledge), \"samyak darshan\" (right sight) and \"samyak charitra\" (right character). A \"jiva\" begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.\n\nIf a \"jiva\" does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a \"jiva\" is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant reincarnation, wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are \"dev\" (beings of heaven, including deities), \"manushya\" (human), \"tiryanch\" (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and \"naarki\" (beings of hell). \n\nDuring this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the \"jiva\" will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the \"jiva\" will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.\n\nIt is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the \"sinful karma\" but even the \"meritorious karma\" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the \"jiva\" to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain \"moksha\", because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.\n\nJains believe that only a human \"jiva\" has the capacity and the will to attain \"moksha\". Hence the \"jiva\" should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to \"moksha\". In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely vegetarian but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.\n\nMainstream Judaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments of the Mosaic law for Jews, or the seven Noahide laws for Gentiles as a sin. Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth. Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the mitzvot (without negligence) do not count as sins. \"Sins by error\" are considered as less severe sins. When the Temple yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer sacrifices for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of \"korbanot\" is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, \"korbanot\" only expiate such \"sins by error\", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, \"korbanot\" cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, \"korbanot\" have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.\n\nJudaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave \"gehinnom\", because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.\n\nIn Mesopotamian mythology, Adamu (or Addamu/Admu, or Adapa) goes on trial for the \"sin of casting down a divinity\".\nHis crime is breaking the wings of the south wind.\n\nEvil deeds fall into two categories in Shinto: \"amatsu tsumi\", \"the most pernicious crimes of all\", and \"kunitsu tsumi\", \"more commonly called misdemeanors\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8134295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8134295", "title": "Tax sale", "text": "Tax sale\n\nA tax sale is the forced sale of property (usually real estate) by a governmental entity for unpaid taxes by the property's owner.\n\nThe sale, depending on the jurisdiction, may be a tax deed sale (whereby the actual property is sold) or a tax lien sale (whereby a lien on the property is sold) Under the tax lien sale process, depending on the jurisdiction, after a specified period of time if the lien is not redeemed, the lienholder may seek legal action which will result in the lienholder either automatically obtaining the property, or forcing a future tax deed sale of the property and possibly obtaining the property as a result.\n\nThe governmental entity can be any level of government that can assess and collect property taxes or other governmental debt, such as counties (parishes, in the case of Louisiana), cities, townships (in New England and other jurisdictions), and school districts (in places where they are independent of other governmental jurisdictions, such as in Texas).\n\nState law offers the governmental entity a method of collecting its tax without simply having to \"ding\" the nonpaying person or business, by (after a specified grace period, whereby the property owner can be charged interest and/or penalties as well as other costs) placing a lien on the property which, if not paid, will result in future cost and ultimately the seizure and selling of the property. In most places in the US, a tax lien takes priority, eclipsing other liens such as mortgages.\n\nThe requirements to begin the foreclosure process (and to avoid it) must be strictly followed; otherwise, the property owner will lose all rights to the property (or the governmental entity will lose its right to collect the outstanding debt). Common requirements include:\n\nOnce the process begins, the property owner can still avoid foreclosure by paying the amount owed plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs or fees. The amounts can end up being quite high once the process is well under way. Even after foreclosure, in some jurisdictions the owner can still recover the property by paying the amounts owed (plus additional interest/penalties/costs) within a specified time. Alternatively, the owner can file suit to have the sale set aside on grounds that the requirements were not followed (such as proper notice not given).\n\nTwo main methods are used to capture delinquent real property tax: the tax deed sale and the tax lien sale.\n\nBoth methods operate using an auction method. Traditionally, the auctions have been live events held at the county courthouse or another designated official location. However, online auctions have increased in usage.\n\nIn a tax deed sale, the property itself is sold.\n\nAt the sale, the minimum bid is generally the amount of back taxes owed plus interest, as well as costs associated with selling the property. The purchaser making the highest bid for the property takes title. However, the purchaser usually has a very short period (generally 48–72 hours) to pay the entire amount owed, or else the sale is invalidated.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, any amount in excess of the minimum bid may or may not be returned to the original property owner, or the owner may forfeit rights to such excess amount if not claimed within a specified period. Also, anyone having an interest in the property (such as a governmental entity having weed liens on the property) may, in some cases, claim the excess.\n\nIn the event the property is not purchased at auction, title generally reverts to the governmental entity that initiated the sale, which can then offer it for at or even below the original minimum bid (depending on property value and/or interest in the parcel).\n\nTitle is generally transferred in a tax deed sale through a form of limited warranty or quitclaim deed (sometimes styled as Tax Deed or Sheriff's Deed). In most jurisdictions, this type of deed is generally insufficient to acquire title insurance. Therefore, a purchaser would most likely then need to initiate a quiet title action in order to resell the property later. However, the property can be sold from one purchaser to another using a limited warranty or another quitclaim deed, though usually at far less than its market value.\n\nSome jurisdictions allow for a post-sale \"redemption period,\" whereby the former owner has a specified amount of time to reclaim the property by repaying the amount bid at auction plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs. As such, purchasers of properties at tax deed sales are cautioned not to make major improvements on the property until after the redemption period has expired, as such improvements would then become the property of the original owner.\n\nA tax deed sale may also be used in conjunction with a tax lien sale process, whereby the lienholder (instead of a governmental agency) starts the process toward forcing a public sale of the property. In those instances the lienholder's investment (the price of the lien plus any additional costs necessary to start the tax deed sale process, such as required fees and payment of any still-unpaid taxes or buyout of other certificate holders' interests) constitutes the minimum bid; if no other bids are received at the sale then the lienholder will take title to the property subject to redemption periods (if applicable) or any lawsuit to overturn the sale.\n\nAlthough the possibility of obtaining property at rates far below market values is promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing:\n\n\nIn a tax lien sale, instead of selling the actual property, the governmental entity sells a lien on the property. The lien is generally for the amount of delinquent taxes, accrued interest, and costs associated with the sale.\n\nIn the event that more than one investor seeks the same lien, depending on state law the winner will be determined by one of five methods:\n\nLiens not sold at auction are considered \"struck\" (sold) to the jurisdiction conducting the auction. Some jurisdictions allow \"over the counter\" purchases of liens not sold at auction, subject to some liens being exempt from sale.\n\nThe investor must wait a specified period of time (commonly referred to as the \"redemption period\") before taking action to foreclose on the property. During the redemption period, the lien (plus interest and any other fees) may be repaid by the owner or a legal designee of the owner. Usually the lien holder is not permitted during this period to contact the property owner (or anyone else having an interest in the property, such as the mortgage holder) to demand payment or threaten foreclosure, or else the lienholder can face sanctions (such as: termination of the lien and loss of money spent, being banned from future sales, and/or criminal charges).\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the lienholder must agree to pay subsequent unpaid property taxes during the redemption period in order to protect his/her interest. If the lienholder does not pay such taxes, a subsequent lienholder would \"buy out\" (redeem) the prior lienholder's interest. Other jurisdictions allow the lienholder first right to pay subsequent taxes, but if the lienholder chooses not to do so, a separate lien is offered for sale. Still other jurisdictions do not offer subsequent tax payment priority; each lien is sold separately (and can result in multiple liens on a property held by different lienholders).\n\nOnce the redemption period is over, the lien holder may initiate foreclosure proceedings. Normally, the cost of the proceedings will include, in addition to statutorily-mandated costs (such as application fees and costs for public notices), buy-outs of other liens and payment of any other unpaid taxes plus accrued interest. During the period between the initiation of proceedings and actual foreclosure, the property owner still has the opportunity to repay the lien with interest plus the costs incurred to foreclose.\n\nThe foreclosure proceedings, depending on the jurisdiction, may be either:\nIn both cases, as with tax deed sales, title to the property will normally be in the form of a quitclaim deed, thus requiring further action to quiet title.\n\nIf the lienholder does not act within a specified period of time, as defined by state law, the lien is forfeited and the holder loses his investment. This period of time cannot be extended unless the tax lien holder is officially in the process of foreclosing on the property or other legal action (such as bankruptcy) is pending.\n\nA lien issued in error of state law is repaid, but usually at a far lower interest rate than had the lien been valid.\n\nThe popularity of tax lien sales is driven, in large part, by the maximum rate of returns offered, which can be far higher than other investments, as well as the guarantee that the governmental entity, if the lien is redeemed, will repay the investor. Examples of such high returns include:\n\nThe market in tax liens has been so popular that a number of major banks and hedge funds have invested large amounts of capital in it.\n\nAlthough the rates of return are promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing:\n\n"}
{"id": "1214877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1214877", "title": "Universal language", "text": "Universal language\n\nUniversal language may refer to a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the world's population. In some contexts, it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all living things, beings, and objects alike. It may be the idea of an international auxiliary language for communication between groups speaking different primary languages. In other conceptions, it may be the primary language of all speakers, or the only existing language. Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people, or shared by humans and supernatural beings.\n\nIn other traditions, there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. For example in Islam the Arabic language is the language of the Qur'an, and so universal for Muslims. The written Classical Chinese language was and is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan; for centuries it was a \"de facto\" universal \"literary\" language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way Sanskrit in India and Nepal, Tamil in India and Sri Lanka and Pali in Sri Lanka and in Theravada countries of South-East Asia (Burma, Thailand, Cambodia), were literary languages for many for whom they were not their mother tongue.\n\nComparably, the Latin language (\"qua\" Medieval Latin) was in effect a universal language of literati in the Middle Ages, and the language of the Vulgate Bible in the area of Catholicism, which covered most of Western Europe and parts of Northern and Central Europe also.\n\nIn a more practical fashion, trade languages, such as ancient Koine Greek, may be seen as a kind of \"real\" universal language, that was used for commerce.\n\nIn historical linguistics, monogenesis refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago.\n\nVarious religious texts, myths, and legends describe a state of humanity in which originally only one language was spoken.\n\nIn Jewish and Christian beliefs, the story of the Tower of Babel tells of a consequent \"confusion of tongues\" (the splintering of numerous languages from an original Adamic language) as a punishment from God.\n\nMyths exist in other cultures describing the creation of multiple languages as an act of a god as well, such as the destruction of a 'knowledge tree' by Brahma in Indic tradition, or as a gift from the God Hermes in Greek myth. Other myths describe the creation of different languages as concurrent with the creation of different tribes of people, or due to supernatural events.\n\nRecognizable strands in the contemporary ideas on universal languages took form only in Early Modern Europe. A \"lingua franca\" or trade language was nothing very new; but an international auxiliary language was a natural wish in light of the gradual decline of Latin. Literature in vernacular languages became more prominent with the Renaissance. Over the course of the 18th century, learned works largely ceased to be written in Latin. According to Colton Booth (\"Origin and Authority in Seventeenth-Century England\" (1994) p. 174) \"The Renaissance had no single view of Adamic language and its relation to human understanding.\" The question was more exactly posed in the work of Francis Bacon.\n\nIn the vast writings of Gottfried Leibniz can be found many elements relating to a possible universal language, specifically a constructed language, a concept that gradually came to replace that of a rationalized Latin as the natural basis for a projected universal language. Leibniz conceived of a \"characteristica universalis\" (also see \"mathesis universalis\"), an \"algebra\" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. This algebra would include rules for symbolic manipulation, what he called a \"calculus ratiocinator\" . His goal was to put reasoning on a firmer basis by reducing much of it to a matter of calculation that many could grasp. The \"characteristica\" would build on an alphabet of human thought.\n\nLeibniz's work is bracketed by some earlier mathematical ideas of René Descartes, and the satirical attack of Voltaire on Panglossianism. Descartes's ambitions were far more modest than Leibniz's, and also far more successful, as shown by his wedding of algebra and geometry to yield what we now know as analytic geometry. Decades of research on symbolic artificial intelligence have not brought Leibniz's dream of a \"characteristica\" any closer to fruition.\n\nOther 17th-century proposals for a 'philosophical' (i.e. universal) language include those by Francis Lodwick, Thomas Urquhart (possibly parodic), George Dalgarno (\"Ars signorum\", 1661), and John Wilkins (\"An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\", 1668). The classification scheme in Roget's Thesaurus ultimately derives from Wilkins's \"Essay\".\n\n\"Candide\", a satire written by Voltaire, took aim at Leibniz as Dr. Pangloss, with the choice of name clearly putting universal language in his sights, but satirizing mainly the optimism of the projector as much as the project. The argument takes the universal language itself no more seriously than the ideas of the speculative scientists and \"virtuosi\" of Jonathan Swift's Laputa. For the like-minded of Voltaire's generation, universal language was tarred as fool's gold with the same brush as philology with little intellectual rigour, and universal mythography, as futile and arid directions.\n\nIn the 18th century, some rationalist natural philosophers sought to recover a supposed Edenic language. It was assumed that education inevitably took people away from an innate state of goodness they possessed, and therefore there was an attempt to see what language a human child brought up in utter silence would speak. This was assumed to be the Edenic tongue, or at least the lapsarian tongue.\n\nOthers attempted to find a common linguistic ancestor to all tongues; there were, therefore, multiple attempts to relate esoteric languages to Hebrew (e.g. Basque and Irish), as well as the beginnings of comparative linguistics.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, there was a large profusion of constructed languages intended as genuine, spoken language. There were created languages which don't belong to any country and can be learned by everyone. Among these are Solresol, Volapük, and Esperanto, the most spoken constructed language nowadays. At that time, those ideas were readily accepted. With the advent of World Wars and the Cold War, these successes were buried. \n\nThe constructed language movement produced such languages as Latino Sine Flexione (1903), Ido (1907), Occidental (1922), and Interlingua (1951).\n\nEnglish remains the dominant language of international business and global communication through the influence of global media and the former British Empire that had established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, English is not the only language used in global organizations such as in the EU or the UN, because many countries do not recognize English as a universal language.\n\nThe early ideas of a universal language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels. Michel Foucault believed such classifications to be subjective, citing Borges' fictional Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge's Taxonomy as an illustrative example.\n"}

He was among the most prominent novelists in the field of Konkani literature. Rodrigues specialised in writing serialised novels of extraordinary length running into more than 150 chapters.\n\nVictor Rodrigues was born in the Anjelore locality of Mangalore, the eldest child of four children to a Mangalorean Catholic couple, Anthony and Charmine Rodrigues. While he successfully graduated high school, the family's poverty prevented him from enrolling in a college. After his high school graduation, Rodrigues joined Simon & Company and worked as a painter, where he worked for a short period. He then sought a career in painting, after having learnt painting and art from a drawing master of St. Aloysius College named Peter. He received a job at Fr. Mullers Hospital in 1960, where he worked until 1972. Rodrigues later migrated to Bahrain in 1975, where he worked until 1995. He was married to Celine D'Souza. The union lasted until his death and produced three children—Lolita, Veena and Santhosh.\n\nWhile was working at Fr. Mullers Hospital, Rodrigues began his literary career writing for \"Mithr\" (Friend) and \"Jhelo\" (Garland), respectively Konkani weekly and fortnightly. He wrote his first novel \"Vibhadlelen Gharane\" (Ruined Family) in 1967 for the Konkani periodicals, \"Mithr\" and \"Jhelo\". He wrote his first health related article on the topic of breast cancer which was published on \"Jhelo\". During his literary tenure, Rodrigues wrote 23 novels, the most notable being \"Andhkarachea Khondkant\" (Fond of Darkness), \"Rogtachi Bobatt\" (Bloodcurdling Screams), \"Don Max\" and \"Paap ani Shiraap\" (Sin and Curse). His literary works were published in 21 papers and magazines.\n\nRodrigues's stories highlighted his revolutionary views and were usually directed against perceived social evils and social customs and systems, which he found degrading. He penned his articles with the purpose of creating awareness about social justice.\nHis novel, \"Pratikar\" was serialised in the Konkani weekly, \"Poinnari,\" for almost 198 weeks, while \"Paap ani Shiraap\" ran for 219 weeks. Apart from his novels, he wrote six plays and two biographies of Catholic priests, Fr. Sylvester Menezes and Fr. Marian Fernandes. Rodrigues also wrote a book on traditional medicines, entitled \"Bholaike Daiz\" (Treasure of Health). His famous serial story, \"Paap ani Shiraap\" was selected by 'Mangalore Tele Films' for the first Konkani TV mega serial. It was telecasted on DD Chandana channel under the title \"Kanni Ashi Mogachi\" (A Hopeful Love Story).\n\nRodrigues was honoured by Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi for his contribution to literature, in the year 2000. He also received the Daiji Dubai Award in 2006, and Francis Danthy Literary Award the same year.\n\n\n"}

A function is well-defined if it gives the same result when the representation of the input is changed without changing the value of the input. For instance if \"f\" takes real numbers as input, and if \"f\"(0.5) does not equal \"f\"(1/2) then \"f\" is not well-defined (and thus: not a function). The term \"well-defined\" is also used to indicate whether a logical statement is unambiguous.\n\nA function that is not well-defined is not the same as a function that is undefined. For example, if \"f\"(\"x\") = 1/\"x\", then \"f\"(0) is undefined, but this has nothing to do with the question of whether \"f\"(\"x\") = 1/\"x\" is well-defined. It is; 0 is simply not in the domain of the function.\n\nLet formula_1 be sets, let formula_2 and \"define\" formula_3 as formula_4 if formula_5 and formula_6 if formula_7.\n\nThen formula_8 is well-defined if formula_9. This is e. g. the case when formula_10 (then \"f\"(\"a\") happens to be formula_11).\n\nIf however formula_12 then formula_8 is not well-defined because formula_14 is \"ambiguous\" for formula_15. This is e. g. the case when formula_16 and formula_17. Indeed, formula_18 and \"f\"(2) would have to be 0 as well as 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the latter \"f\" is not well-defined and thus not a function.\n\nIn order to avoid the apostrophes around \"define\" in the previous simple example, the \"definition\" of formula_8 could be broken down into two simple logical steps:\n\nWhereas the definition in step 1. is formulated with the freedom of any definition and is certainly effective (without the need to classify it as „well-defined“), the assertion in step 2. has to be proved: If and only if formula_9, we get a function formula_8, and the formula_8 of \"definition\" is well-defined (as a function).\n\nOn the other hand: if formula_12 then for an formula_15 there is both, formula_25 \"and\" formula_26, and the binary relation formula_8 is not \"functional\" as defined in Binary relation#Special types of binary relations and thus not well-defined (as a function). Colloquially, the \"function\" formula_8 is called ambiguous at point formula_29 (although there is \"per definitionem\" never an \"ambiguous function\"), and the original \"definition\" is pointless.\n\nDespite these subtle logical problems, it is quite common to anticipatorily use the term definition (without apostrophes) for \"definitions\" of this kind, firstly because it is sort of a short-hand of the two-step approach, secondly because the relevant mathematical reasoning (step 2.) is the same in both cases, and finally because in mathematical texts the assertion is «up to 100%» true.\n\nThe question of well-definedness of a function classically arises when the defining equation of a function does not (only) refer to the arguments themselves, but (also) to elements of the arguments. This is sometimes unavoidable when the arguments are cosets and the equation refers to coset representatives.\n\nFor example, consider the following function\nwhere formula_31 and formula_32 are the integers modulo \"m\" and formula_33 denotes the congruence class of \"n\" mod \"m\".\n\nN.B.: formula_34 is a reference to the element formula_35, and formula_36 is the argument of \"f\".\n\nThe function \"f\" is well-defined, because\n\nIn particular, the term well-defined is used with respect to (binary) operations on cosets. In this case one can view the operation as a function of two variables and the property of being well-defined is the same as that for a function. For example, addition on the integers modulo some \"n\" can be defined naturally in terms of integer addition. \nThe fact that this is well-defined follows from the fact that we can write any representative of formula_39 as formula_40, where k is an integer. Therefore, \nand similarly for any representative of formula_42.\n\nFor real numbers, the product formula_43 is unambiguous because formula_44. (Therefore, the notation is said to be \"well-defined\".) Because of this property of the operation (here formula_45), which is known as associativity, the result does not depend on the sequence of multiplications, so that a specification of the sequence can be omitted.\n\nThe subtraction operation, formula_46, is not associative. However, there is a convention (or definition) in that the formula_46 operation is understood as addition of the opposite, thus formula_48 is the same as formula_49, and is called \"well-defined\".\n\nDivision is also non-associative. However, in the case of formula_50 the convention formula_51 is not so well established, so this expression is considered ill-defined.\n\nUnlike with functions, the notational ambiguities can be overcome more or less easily by means of additional definitions, i. e. rules of precedence, and/or associativity of the operators. In the programming language C e. g. the operator codice_1 for subtraction is \"left-to-right-associative\" which means that codice_2 is defined as codice_3 and the operator codice_4 for assignment is \"right-to-left-associative\" which means that codice_5 is defined as codice_6. In the programming language APL there is only one rule: from right to left − but parentheses first.\n\nA solution to a partial differential equation is said to be well-defined if it is determined by the boundary conditions in a continuous way as the boundary conditions are changed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58977377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58977377", "title": "Writer's Workbench", "text": "Writer's Workbench\n\nThe Writer's Workbench (wwb) was a software package developed for the Unix operating system by Lorinda Cherry and Nina McDonald of Bell Labs. It was perhaps the earliest grammar checker to receive wide usage on Unix systems.\n\nwwb's utilities were capable of analysing text for parts of speech, and for word and sentence length, and of comparing the results to established norms.\n\nThe Writer's Workbench was meant to help students learn to edit their work:\n\nMy feeling about a lot of those tools is their value in education is as much pointing out to people who are learning to write that they have choices and make choices when they do it. They don’t think of a writing task as making choices per se. Once they get it on paper they think it’s cast in stone. So it makes them edit.\n\nPolling at Colorado State University in the 1980s indicated that wwb was well received by students and faculty. Additional analysis in the 1980s indicated close correlation between wwb's assessments and essay grading rubrics.\n\nAs of 1983, the wwb package contained 29 utilities. As of 1986, this had increased to around 35-40 utilities. wwb's utilities included style and diction. It also included a \"word choice checker\", and a program to help users avoid sexist language.\n\nThe wwb package was included with AT&T UNIX in the late 1970s and early 1980s and received wide distribution as a result. However, wwb was not included with Version 7 Unix, and gradually became abandonware. Various successors arose, based closely upon wwb, such as the commercial \"Grammatik\" packages for IBM PCs.\n\nThe GNU/Linux operating system contains free software implementations of several wwb utilities, such as look, spell, style and diction.\n\n\n"}
