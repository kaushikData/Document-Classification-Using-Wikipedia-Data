The initial ε \"e\" is the augment. When it comes before a consonant, it is called the \"syllabic augment\" because it adds a syllable. Sometimes the syllabic augment appears before a vowel because the initial consonant of the verbal root (usually digamma) was lost:\n\nWhen the augment is added before a vowel, the augment and the vowel are contracted and the vowel becomes long: \"akoúō\" \"I hear\", \"ḗkousa\" \"I heard\". It is sometimes called the \"temporal augment\" because it increases the time needed to pronounce the vowel.\n\nIn Homer, past-tense (aorist or imperfect) verbs appeared both with and without an augment.\n\nUnaccented syllabic augment disappeared during the Byzantine period as a result of the loss of unstressed initial syllables. However, accented syllabic augments remained in place. So Ancient ἔλυσα, ἐλύσαμεν \"I loosened, we loosened\" corresponds to Modern έλυσα, λύσαμε (\"élisa\", \"lísame\"). Temporal augment has not survived in the vernacular, which leaves the initial vowel unaltered: Ancient ἀγαπῶ, ἠγάπησα \"I love, I loved\"; Modern αγαπώ, αγάπησα (\"agapó\", \"agápisa\").\n\nSanskrit had the augment अ- / \"a-\", prefixed to past-tense verbs (aorist and imperfect).\n\n\nThe term has also been extended to describe similar features in non-Indo-European languages.\n\nIn Nahuatl, the perfect \"ō-\" prefix is called an augment.\n\nIn certain Bantu languages such as Zulu, the term \"augment\" refers to the initial vowel of a noun class prefix such as (in Zulu) umu-\", ama-\". That vowel may be present or absent, according to grammatical rules.\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's High Elvish, the repetition of the first vowel before the perfect (for instance \"utúlië\", perfect tense of \"túlë\", \"come\") is also called an augment.\n"}

Their job is to put the best calls on the air and filter out the callers that don't have anything worthwhile to add to the conversation.

[ˈeːlʧǝ ˈhɪdəs ˈhɔlbǝtsma] (the r is silent); Dutch form: Eeltje Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [ˈeːlcǝ ˈhɪdəs ˈhalbǝrtsma]) (Grou, October 8, 1797 – there, March 22, 1858), was a Dutch Frisian writer, poet and physician, and the youngest of the Halbertsma Brothers. He became well known when he and his elder brother Justus published the poetry and short story collection \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\" in 1822. Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, Tsjalling, until all the Halbertsma Brothers' prose and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work \"Rimen en Teltsjes\". This book played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. Of the three Brothers Halbertsma, Eeltsje was probably the most talented, en especially his poetry is still very much admired. His oeuvre included the poem \"De Alde Friezen\", which later became the national anthem of the Western Frisian people.\n\nEeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 8, 1797, in his parents' house on Kowemerk (\"Cow Market\") street in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland. He was the fourth son of the baker and small-time merchant Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809) and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809). He had three elder brothers: Justus (\"Joast\") (1789–1869), Tsjalling (1792–1852), and Binnert (1795–1847). Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Eeltsje was only eleven years of age. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life, were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.\n\nThis mother, Ruerdtsje Binnerts, was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From the letters of Eeltsje's brother Justus Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title \"Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland\" (\"Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents ran in the family.\n\nLike his elder brother Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma was sent to the French school in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden for a year by his mother, and after that, he was enrolled in the Latin school, also in Leeuwarden. There, he started following lessons probably just before Ruerdtsje Binnerts' death in December 1809. As their father, Hidde Halbertsma, hat died in January of that same year, the brothers became orphans because of this unfortunate event. Justus, the eldest brother, was studying in Amsterdam at the time. Eeltsje could continue his education in the Latin school because the middle brothers, Tsjalling and Binnert, kept their father's bakery running with the help of their father's baker's mates. As commuting from Grou to Leeuwarden and back again on a daily basis was out of the question with roads and transportation being what they were at that time, Eeltjse boarded in the city with one Hawerdink, an acquaintance of his brother Justus, who apparently introduced him to the most vulgar form of City Frisian, a Dutch (not Frisian) dialect which is spoken in the cities in Friesland.\n\nWhen he had finished his training in the Latin school, towards the end of 1814, Eeltsje Halbertsma left for Holland, where he started a study of medicine at the University of Leiden which lasted until April 1818. In the student city of Leiden, however, he became caught up in the rough night life, and that was why, by way of reorientation, he left for Heidelberg, in Germany, for half a year in the spring of 1818. There he enjoyed himself tremendously at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität, and later in his life he always looked back on his Heidelberg period with a sense of whistfulness. The lessons he followed in Heidelberg for the most part had to do with obstetrics. After the summer, he returned to Leiden, where he ended his study by obtaining his doctorate in medicine on October 13, 1818.\n\nAfterwards, Halbertsma became physician in Purmerend, in northern Holland, where he lived for a year and a half, and also became involved with a local girl whom he referred to as \"the Little Peacock\" in his letters to his brother Justus. Eventually, though, he became ill, and was brought back to his family in Grou, probably towards the end of 1820. When he had recovered, he did not go back to Holland, but instead started a practice in the village where he was born. He would spend the rest of his life there, because, he wrote to his brother Justus, \"Grou is alway lovely to me.\" Because of his good education, but also because of his compassionate bedside manner, Halbertsma had a very spread-out practice, with patients not only in Grou, but also scattered around the countryside and in neighbouring villages. This required him to travel a lot, for which he often had to depend on boats in the marshy lake country of Central Friesland.\n\nFrom stories of people who knew him, Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma emerges as a man who was quickly moved, but could also have a lot of fun. According to the bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff, who was acquainted with him for many years, Halbertsma was big-hearted and generous, and a droll story-teller. One of Halbertsma's biographers described him as \"a fine-feeling spirit, an idealistic dreamer, an independent and courageous man, afflicted by periods of melancholy and doubt; a \"bohémien\" and a rascal, such as there has been no second of in all of Western Frisian literature.\" Halbertsma's letters to his brother Justus are lively and open-hearted, and also quite entertaining still. As for his views, Halbertsma had become influenced by Deism in his student days, but according to himself he had changed his opinion after reading the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder.\n\nPolitics Halbertsma tried to stay away from. In the company of others he was sometimes seduced into speaking on that subject, but he was always afraid to say too much; his father had been a supporter of the Patriot movement, and Halbertsma could never forget how badly that had ended. For all that, he did not just stand by when his sense of justice was violated, as is shown by his poems \"De Grytman\" (\"The Grietman\"; about corruption in the political upper classes in Friesland) and \"Batthyany's Dea\" (\"Batthyany's Death\"; about the execution of Lajos Batthyány, the leader of the Hungarians in the Hungarian Rebellion of 1848–1849). He also wrote, in Dutch, a poem in which he rages against the fact that Frisian members of the Tweede Kamer voted against the proposal to abolish slavery in 1853. On the other hand, he was not so progressive that he felt himself in any way connected with those he called, in 1855, \"red democrats\" (that is to say socialists and other political radicals), whom he separated from \"the decent-minded\", with which he meant the progressive, liberal section of the settled middle class, to which he himself belonged.\n\nIn 1827, Halbertsma became a member of the Provinciaal Friesch Genootschap ter Beoefening van Friesche Geschied-, Oudheid- en Taalkunde (\"Provincial Frisian Society for the Study of Frisian History, Antiquities and Linguistics\"), but in 1834, he cancelled his membership because he felt this club was full to the rafters with silly people. He could not stomach the affected poshness of the middle class gentlemen, and neither could he reconcile such graveness of bearing with the 'gluttony and wine-guzzling' which followed the gatherings. \"Es gibt Narren aller Art\" (\"It takes fools of all kinds\"), he wrote to his brother Justus. Justus did stay a member of the society, but because he was a Mennonite minister in Deventer, in the province of Overijssel, and was therefore mostly a member by correspondence, it was somewhat easier for him to look at things with a certain detachment. Later, Eeltsje Halbertsma became a member of the Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse (\"Society for Knowledge of Frisian Language and Literature\"), where he felt much more at home.\nIn June 1823, Halbertsma married Baukje Fockens (1795–1877), a woman from a well-to-do family from Bolsward, whom he had met in the autumn of 1822. She was the daughter of Livius (Liuwe) Regnerus Fockens, a mayor of Bolsward who had died not long before. Halbertsma and his wife had four children: two sons and two daughters. Only their son Hidde would survive his father, as the other son, Liuwe, died in 1854, and both of the girls, Ruerdtsje and Anna, were laid to rest yn 1851. The death of Anna (1832–1851), with whom he was exceptionally close, hit Halbertsma especially hard; about this loss he wrote the touching poem \"Op Anna's Dea\" (\"On Anna's Death\"), which was published in 1854, in the poetry and short story collection \"Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen\" (\"Grief and Pleasure and Down Upon the Lee Shore\").\n\nHalbertsma's marriage was, after the first few years, not very happy, as he was much too fond of alcohol, while his wife nagged constantly, was distrustful and reproached him continuously for living off her money. It is therefore probably not coincidental that in several of Halbertsma's stories the main characters are a drunken man and his angry wife. In 1853, when both marriage partners had neglected their household for years, the parents were placed under guardianship by both of their sons, which was done especially on the initiative of Liuwe. Although Halbertsma managed to become his own master again in 1857, this was a humiliation for which it was not easy for him to forgive his son, and there is no elegy for Liuwe's passing in 1854, as Halbertsma did make for both of his daughters.\n\nHalbertsma felt the drive to write for the first time, as his brother Justus would later tell it, when he came back from his half-year in Heidelberg, and noticed that the street songs in the Netherlands were of a very low quality compared to those in Germany. According to Justus, Eeltsje Halbertsma set out writing poetry to replace the existing songs with better ones of his own making. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, who added an extensive and penetrating afterword to the reprint of \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" of 1993, observed, however, that this assertion could \"never be more than half the truth,\" as Halbertsma's early poetry was not of a high literary value; quite the opposite, in fact. According to Breuker, it seems more likely that Halbertsma wanted to emulate these Dutch street songs.\n\nLater on, he must have come under the influence of Justus' ideas, who wanted to preserve the Western Frisian language by reintroducing it for writing after it had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. From that it followed that Justus had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and to achieve that aim, he set out writing the sort of folk literature which dovetailed nicely with Eeltsje Halbertsma's work. As Justus remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and short fiction were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning. Although writing short stories and poems was something which Eeltsje Halbertsma could not do without, from approximately 1830 onwards the social prestige he won with it also started to play a role.\n\nIn 1822, the best of the early works of Eeltsje and Justus were collected under the title \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\" (\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\"; original, archaic spelling: \"De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor\"), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time. A second, expanded edition of \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\", consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (\"De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar\"), 1840 (\"Twigen út in Alde Stamme\"), 1854 (\"Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen\"), and 1858 (\"De Jonkerboer\" and \"Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd\").\n\nEeltsje Halbertsma was almost certainly the most talented of the three writing Halbertsma Brothers. While Tsjalling's works were purely intended for entertainment, and Justus composed his stories and poetry in a somewhat distant, cerebral way, which keeps the reader a little detached from what is read, Eeltsje put his soul and heart into his poems and stories. It is this emotion which brings his work closer to the reader. Furthermore, Eeltsje's prose and poetry are in proportion to each other, qualitatively, while in Justus' works the poetry is generally quite clearly not of the same high standing as his prose. In the middle of the 20th century the author and literary critic Anne Wadman stated that Eeltsje was the greatest poet of his time in the Netherlands; as neither Willem Bilderdijk nor Isaäc da Costa were fit to hold a candle to him (he wrote), one would look invain for someone of the same stature in the Dutch literature of that period.\n\nOn the basis of Romanticism, which he had acquired in Heidelberg, Eeltsje Halbertsma often needed a first impulse for his works, an existing text or melody that he could, as he himself put it, frisify \"in such a way that no one could recognise the original anymore.\" Because of this it is thought that the masterful \"Jonker Pyt en Sibbel\" (\"Squire Pete and Sibylle\") could possibly be a much improved version of the Dutch-language poem \"Steedsche Jonker en een Friessche Boerin\" (\"City Squire and a Frisian Farmer's Wife\"), from the 18th century. It is beyond dispute that Halbertsma based some of his poetry on earlier works by such poets as Johann Peter Hebel and Ludwig Hölty. For instance, \"De Boalserter Merke\" (\"The Bolsward Fair\"), still one of his most well-known works, is a \"Nachdichtung\" of Hebel's lovesong \"Hans und Verene\", in which the main characters were renamed Hoatse and Wobbel, the background was shifted from a German well to a fair in the Frisian city of Bolsward, and quite a few smaller changes were made. An example of a poem based on Hölty's work is the somewhat morbid \"Deagraverssankje\" (\"Grave-digger's Song\").\n\nThough Halbertsma often wrote idyllic poems in his early years, such as \"It Marke\" (\"The Little Lake\") and \"Geale' Sliepke\" (\"Geale's Nap\"), and, to a lesser degree, \"It Famke\" (\"The Girl\"), later the circumstances of his family life and professional difficulties so depressed him that he wrote, \"you [will] find in my last works nothing of that Arcadia.\" In its place came moving elegies, such as \"De Likeblommen\" (\"The Leek Flowers\"), \"Op Anna's Dea\" (\"On Anna's Death\"), and \"It Tsjerkhôf by Jûntiid\" (\"The Churchyard in the Evening\"), and also poems such as \"It Libbensein\" (\"Life's End\"), and \"Deagraverssankje\" (\"Grave-digger's Song\"), which reflect upon the transitory nature of human existence. Halbertsma was, however, also the author of the mildly humorous \"Ald Jan-om\" (\"Old Uncle John\"), in which a farm-hand of advanced years complains of the farmer's daughter's constant stream of suitors, who are always getting in his way, and of the love poem \"Skipperssankje\" (\"Skipper's Song\"), an entreaty of a mariner to his beloved to not forget him, even if his ship should sink and he should drown. The appreciation for Halbertsma's strongly retorical freedom hymns has eroded in the course of the 20th century, but even so, the nationalistic song \"De Alde Friezen\", is still the national anthem of the Western Frisian people, which it was proclaimed to be yn 1875 (in a thoroughly revised version by Jacobus van Loon).\n\nIn his prose Halbertsma shows himself to be a smooth story-teller, occasionally using a poetic-realistic approach, such as in the story \"Utfanhûs by de Boer\" (\"Staying the Night on the Farm\"), at other times becoming ironic, such as in \"De Klúnskonk fan Us Ald Dominy\" (\"The Skate-walking Leg of Our Old Minister\"). \"De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar\" (\"The Norg Gelding to Gabe Tailor\"), which has the form of a letter from the afterlife to Gabe Tailor, written by his dead horse, is a satire, while in \"De Reis nei de Jichtmasters\" (\"The Journey to the Gout Masters\") Halbertsma uses mild humour and a little mockery to poke fun at his own medical profession. In the longer story \"De Jonkerboer\" (\"The Gentleman Farmer\"), which some critics call a novella, the main motif is a longing for a peaceful and diligent existence in the country-side. That same feeling is also embodied by \"De Quickborn\" (\"The Quickborn\"), a choice of poems Halbertsma translated very freely from the poetry collection of the same name which was originally written in the Low German dialect of the northern German region of Dithmarschen by Klaus Groth. \nStriking things about Eeltsje Halbertsma's literary works are the wonderful sound patterns in some of his poems, especially \"Geale' Sliepke\" (\"Geale's Nap\"), and his playful additions of phrases in other languages or dialects, which occur mostly in his stories, but also in some poems, like \"Jonker Pyt and Sibbel\" (\"Squire Pete and Sibylle\"), where the squire has just returned from fashionable France, and now believes it shows his breeding and social status to throw around French words and phrases. \"Gibberish, odd names, strange types of people, stopgap words, [...] the most surprising metaphors, and the most unexpected jumps in a train of thought,\" all of this occurs regularly in Halbertsma's prose. In his works he is guided by the ideal image he had in his mind of the Western Frisians as simple but genuine people, which he contrasts against the Dutch, who were in his eyes refined but insincere.\n\nIn his last years there was not much which connected Halbertsma to the village of Grou. Because of his unhappy marriage, he could not find solace at home, and the death of his daughter Anna, in 1851, had made him lose his cheerfulness. The following year his brother Tsjalling also died, who had been the steadfast centre of the family. That is why Eeltsje, after he had transferred his medical practice to his son Hidde in 1856, started a wandering life visiting family members who lived far away. Later on, he lived for little while by himself in Leeuwarden, but a few weeks before his death he arranged to be brought back to Grou. He died there on March 22, 1858, when he was sixty years old. He was buried in a double-deep grave which later came to lie outside of the churchyard boundaries, and is now marked by three red stones in an otherwise yellow-paved pathway.\n\nAfter the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" (\"Rhymes and Tales\"). This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critcs, it is undeniable that \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" and its predecessor \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\" played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.\n\nIn 1949, the author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\" As of today \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics. In 1993, the tenth reprint of the book was published, including for the first time some (earlier, lower-quality) work of Eeltsje Halbertsma which had until then remained outside of \"Rimen en Teltsjes\". This reprint had a (for Western Frisian literature) ambitious printing of 3,000 copies, but was sold out within two months.\n\nThe Selskip foar Fryske Taal en Skriftekennisse hired the sculptor Willem Molkenboer in 1875, to make a stone tablet in which the likeness of Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma was chiselled out. This was placed as a gable stone in the front wall of the house where the Halbertsma Brothers were born, on what later was renamed Halbertsmaplein (\"Halbertsma Square\"). In 1879, another stone tablet by the same artist was added to the left with the likeness of Justus Hiddes Halbertsma. Furthermore, in 1903 the Selskip ordered a statue of Eeltsje Halbertsma to be made and placed on Parkstrjitte (\"Park Street\") in Grou, consisting of a bust on a more than man-high limestone column resting on a pedestal of granite, made by Johan Schröder. The inscription reads: \"TO D EELTSJE HIDDES HALBERTSMA\", with on the back of the column: \"Ljeaf bliuwe ús Fryske tael en liet.\" (\"Beloved to us remain the Western Frisian language and its songs.\")\n\n\n"}

Floor plans may also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans may include notes for construction to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.\n\nIt is also called a \"plan\" which is a measured plane typically projected at the floor height of , as opposed to an \"elevation\" which is a measured plane projected from the side of a building, along its height, or a section or \"cross section\" where a building is cut along an axis to reveal the interior structure.\n\nSimilar to a map the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional map, a plan is drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. Plan view or planform is defined as a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.\n\nThe term may be used in general to describe any drawing showing the physical layout of objects. For example, it may denote the arrangement of the displayed objects at an exhibition, or the arrangement of exhibitor booths at a convention. Drawings are now reproduced using plotters and large format xerographic copiers.\n\nA \"reflected ceiling plan\" (RCP) shows a view of the room as if looking from above, through the ceiling, at a mirror installed one foot below the ceiling level, which shows the \"reflected\" image of the ceiling above. This convention maintains the same orientation of the floor and ceilings plans - looking down from above. RCPs are used by designers and architects to demonstrate lighting, visible mechanical features, and ceiling forms as part of the documents provided for construction.\n\nA floor plan is not a top view or birds eye view. It is a measured drawing to scale of the layout of a floor in a building. A \"top view\" or \"bird's eye view\" does not show an orthogonally projected plane cut at the typical four foot height above the floor level. A floor plan could show:\n\nA plan view is an orthographic projection of a three-dimensional object from the position of a horizontal plane through the object. In other words, a plan is a section viewed from the top. In such views, the portion of the object above the plane (section) is omitted to reveal what lies beyond. In the case of a floor plan, the roof and upper portion of the walls may typically be omitted. Whenever an interior design project is being approached, a floor plan is the typical starting point for any further design considerations and decisions.\n\nRoof plans are orthographic projections, but they are not sections as their viewing plane is outside of the object.\n\nA plan is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a three-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in technical drawing and is traditionally crosshatched. The style of crosshatching indicates the type of material the section passes through. \n\nA 3D floor plan can be defined as a virtual model of a building floor plan. It is often used to better convey architectural plans to individuals not familiar with floor plans. Despite the purpose of floor plans originally being to depict 3D layouts in a 2D manner, technological expansion has made rendering 3D models much more cost effective. 3D plans show a better depth of image and are often complimented by 3D furniture in the room. This allows a greater appreciation of scale than with traditional 2D floor plans.\n\n"}
{"id": "1343753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343753", "title": "Government (linguistics)", "text": "Government (linguistics)\n\nIn grammar and theoretical linguistics, government or rection refers to the relationship between a word and its dependents. One can discern between at least three concepts of government: the traditional notion of case government, the highly specialized definition of government in some generative models of syntax, and a much broader notion in dependency grammars.\n\nIn traditional Latin and Greek (and other) grammars, government is the control by verbs and prepositions of the selection of grammatical features of other words. Most commonly, a verb or preposition is said to \"govern\" a specific grammatical case if its complement must take that case in a grammatically correct structure (see: case government). For example, in Latin, most transitive verbs require their direct object to appear in the accusative case, while the dative case is reserved for indirect objects. Thus, the phrase \"I see you\" would be rendered as Te video\" in Latin, using the accusative form \"te\" for the second person pronoun, and \"I give a present to you\" would be rendered as Tibi donum do\", using both an accusative (\"donum\") for the direct and a dative (\"tibi\"; the dative of the second person pronoun) for the indirect object; the phrase \"I help you\", however, would be rendered as Tibi faveo\", using only the dative form \"tibi\". The verb \"favere\" (to help), like many others, is an exception to this default government pattern: its one and only object must be in the dative. Although no direct object in the accusative is controlled by the specific verb, this object is traditionally considered to be an indirect one, mainly because passivization is unavailiable except perhaps in an impersonal manner and for certain verbs of this type. A semantic alternation may also be achieved when different case constructions are available with a verb: Id credo\" (\"id\" is an accusative) means \"I believe this, I have this opinion\" and \"Ei credo\" (\"ei\" is a dative) means \"I trust this, I confide in this\".\n\nPrepositions (and postpositions and circumpositions, i.e. adpositions) are like verbs in their ability to govern the case of their complement, and like many verbs, many adpositions can govern more than one case, with distinct interpretations. For example \"in Italy\" would be \"in Italia, \"Italia\" being an ablative case form, but \"towards Italy\" would be \"in Italiam, \"Italiam\" being an accusative case form.\n\nThe abstract syntactic relation of government in government and binding theory, a phrase structure grammar, is an extension of the traditional notion of case government. Verbs govern their objects, and more generally, heads govern their dependents. \"A\" governs \"B\" if and only if:\n\nThis definition is explained in more detail in the government section of the article on government and binding theory.\n\nOne sometimes encounters definitions of government that are much broader than the one just produced. Government is understood the property that regulates which words can or must appear with the referenced word. This broader understanding of government is part of many dependency grammars. The notion is that many individual words in a given sentence can appear only by virtue of the fact that some other word appears in that sentence. \n\nAccording to this definition, government occurs between any two words connected by a dependency, the dominant word opening slots for subordinate words. The dominant word is the \"governor\", and the subordinates are its \"governees\". The following dependency tree illustrates governors and governees:\n\nThe word \"has\" governs \"Fred\" and \"ordered\"; in other words, \"has\" is governor over its governees \"Fred\" and \"ordered\". Similarly, \"ordered\" governs \"dish\" and \"for\", that is, \"ordered\" is governor over its governees \"dish\" and \"for\"; Etc. This understanding of government is widespread among dependency grammars.\n\nThe distinction between the terms \"governor\" and \"head\" is a source of confusion, given the definitions of government produced above. Indeed, \"governor\" and \"head\" are overlapping concepts. The governor and the head of a given word will often be one and the same other word. The understanding of these concepts becomes difficult, however, when discontinuities are involved. The following example of a \"w\"-fronting discontinuity from German illustrates the difficulty:\nTwo of the criteria mentioned above for identifying governors (and governees) are applicable to the interrogative pronoun \"wem\" 'whom'. This pronoun receives dative case from the verb \"geholfen\" 'helped' (= case government) and it can appear by virtue of the fact that \"geholfen\" appears (= licensing). Given these observations, one can make a strong argument that \"geholfen\" is the governor of \"wem\", even though the two words are separated from each other by the rest of the sentence. In such constellations, one sometimes distinguishes between \"head\" and \"governor\". So while the governor of \"wem\" is \"geholfen\", the head of \"wem\" is taken to be the finite verb \"denkst\" 'think'. In other words, when a discontinuity occurs, one assumes that the governor and the head (of the relevant word) are distinct, otherwise they are the same word. Exactly how the terms \"head\" and \"governor\" are used can depend on the particular theory of syntax that is employed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "288087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288087", "title": "Hypercorrection", "text": "Hypercorrection\n\nIn linguistics or any variety of language usage, hypercorrection is non-standard language use that results from the over-application of a perceived rule of language-usage prescription. A speaker or writer who produces a hypercorrection generally believes through a misunderstanding of these rules that the form is more correct, often combined with a desire to appear formal or educated.\n\nLinguistic hypercorrection occurs when a real or imagined grammatical rule is applied in an inappropriate context, so that an attempt to be \"correct\" leads to an incorrect result. It does not occur when a speaker follows \"a natural speech instinct\", according to Otto Jespersen and Robert J. Menner.\n\nHypercorrection is sometimes found among speakers of less prestigious language varieties who attempt to produce forms associated with high-prestige varieties, even in situations where speakers of those varieties would not. Some commentators call such production \"hyperurbanism\".\n\nHypercorrection can occur in many languages and wherever multiple languages or language varieties are in contact.\n\nStudies in sociolinguistics and applied linguistics have noted the over-application of rules of phonology, syntax, or morphology, resulting either from different rules in varieties of the same language or second-language learning. An example of a common hypercorrection based on application of the rules of a second (aka new, foreign) language is the use of \"octopi\" for the plural of octopus in English; this is based on the faulty assumption that octopus is a second declension word of Latin origin when in fact it is third declension and comes from Greek.\n\nSociolinguists often note hypercorrection in terms of pronunciation (phonology). For example, William Labov noted that all of the English speakers he studied in New York City in the 1960s tended to pronounce words such as \"hard\" as rhotic (pronouncing the \"R\" as rather than ) more often when speaking carefully. Furthermore, middle class speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than working class speakers did. \n\nHowever, lower-middle class speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than upper-middle class speakers. Labov suggested that these lower-middle class speakers were attempting to emulate the pronunciation of upper-middle class speakers, but were actually over-producing the very noticeable R-sound.\n\nA common source of hypercorrection in English speakers' use of the language's morphology and syntax happens in the use of pronouns; see the section below.\n\nHypercorrection can also occur when learners of a new-to-them (aka second, foreign) language try to avoid applying grammatical rules from their native language to the new language (a situation known as language transfer). The effect can occur, for example, when a student of a new language has learned that certain sounds of his or her original language must usually be replaced by another in the studied language, but has not learned when \"not\" to replace them.\n\nEnglish has no authoritative body governing correct usage of the standard language, unlike some other languages, such as Arabic (مجمع اللغة العربية), French (Académie française and Office québécois de la langue française), Italian (Accademia della Crusca), Icelandic (Íslensk málstöð), and Spanish (Real Academia Española). Nonetheless, within groups of users of English, certain usages are considered unduly elaborate adherences to \"formal\" rules.\n\nSuch speech or writing is sometimes called \"hyperurbanism\", defined by Kingsley Amis as an \"indulged desire to be posher than posh\".\n\nIn 2004, Jack Lynch, assistant professor of English at Rutgers University, wrote that the correction of the subject-positioned \"me and you\" to \"you and I\" leads people to \"internalize the rule that 'you and I' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they should not – such as 'he gave it to you and I' when it should be 'he gave it to you and me.'\"\n\nOn the other hand, the linguists Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum claim that utterances such as \"They invited Sandy and I\" are \"heard constantly in the conversation of people whose status as speakers of Standard English is clear\" and that \"Those who condemn it simply assume that the case of a pronoun in a coordination must be the same as when it stands alone. Actual usage is in conflict with this assumption.\"\n\nSome British accents, such as Cockney, drop the initial \"h\" from words; e.g. \"have\" becomes \"ave\". A hypercorrection associated with this is H-adding, adding an \"h\" to a word which would not normally have an initial \"h\". An example of this can be found in the speech of the character Parker in \"Thunderbirds\", e.g. \"We'll 'ave the h'aristocrats 'ere soon\" (from the episode \"Vault of Death\"). Parker's speech was based on a real person the creators encountered at a restaurant in Cookham.\n\nHyperforeignism arises from speakers misidentifying the distribution of a pattern found in loanwords and extending it to other environments. The result of this process does not reflect the rules of either language. For example, \"habanero\" is sometimes pronounced as though it were spelled , in imitation of other Spanish words like \"jalapeño\" and \"piñata\". \"machismo\" is sometimes pronounced 'makizmo', apparently as if it were Italian, rather than the phonetic English pronunciation which resembles the original Spanish word.\n\nSome English-Spanish cognates primarily differ by beginning with \"s\" vs. \"es\", such as the English word \"spectacular\" and the Spanish word \"espectacular\". A native Spanish speaker may conscientiously hypercorrect for the word \"establish\" by writing or saying \"stablish\", which is archaic, or an informal pronunciation in some dialects.\n\nIn Cantonese, some speakers omit the initial . For instance, the character 牙 (, meaning \"tooth\"), ends up being pronounced \"aa4\". Prescriptivists tend to consider these changes as substandard and denounce them for being \"lazy sounds\" (). However, in a case of hypercorrection, some speakers have started pronouncing words that should have a null initial using an initial , even though according to historical Chinese phonology, only words with \"light\" tones (which correspond to tones 4, 5, and 6 in Jyutping) had voiced initials (which includes ). Because of this hypercorrection, words such as 愛 (, meaning \"love\"), which has a \"dark\" tone, are pronounced by speakers with an initial, \"ngoi3\".\n\nIdiomatically, some words such as 溝 ( 'communication') have evolved to the sound to avoid embarrassment, because 㞗 is a vulgar word in Cantonese, but some speakers insist on pronouncing and it may cause ridicule.\n\nSpeakers of some Mandarin dialects, particularly in the south of China and in Taiwan, pronounce the retroflex initials , and as the alveolar initials , , and . Such speakers may hypercorrect by pronouncing words that should start with , and as if they started with their retroflex counterparts.\n\nIn Taiwan, under the influence of Taiwanese (Min Nan), many people pronounce the initial as , and often hypercorrect by pronouncing the initial as . This is also noticeable in the Hakka population, where many words that begin in in Mandarin and Taiwanese begin in in Hakka. (Examples: 火, 花)\n\nErhua hypercorrection may occur among non-native speakers of rhotic Chinese.\n\nIn standard Bulgarian and in the eastern dialects, the old yat letter is pronounced as я (\"ya\") when stressed and the following syllable does not contain the vowels и (\"i\") or е (\"e\"), and pronounced as е in all other cases. But in the western dialects it is always pronounced as е. Attempting to speak the standard Bulgarian dialect, some speakers from Western Bulgaria mispronounce many words containing the yat letter – голями (\"golyami\"), желязни (\"zhelyazni\"), бяли (\"byali\"), видяли (\"vidyali\"), спряни (\"spryani\"), живяли (\"zhivyali\") instead of големи (\"golemi\"), железни (\"zhelezni\"), бели (\"beli\"), видели (\"videli\"), спрени (\"spreni\"), живели (\"zhiveli\"). This trend is especially common with past participles such as видяли.\n\nRussian speakers sometimes palatalize consonants in loanwords that had never been palatized (as instead of for модерн) under the influence of the spelling. Russian has five so-called hard vowels (а, э, ы, у, о), which follow hard or unpalatized consonants, each with a corresponding soft vowel (я, е, и, ю, ё respectively), which follow soft or palatized consonants. However, the hard vowel э has orthographic limits allowing it to be written only at the beginning of a word or after a vowel (as in the Cyrillic spelling of Aeroflot). So in many loanwords, the soft vowel e is written but read as if it were э.\n\nThe syllables \"je\" and \"ije\" appear in the Ijekavian variant of Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian (spoken in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and south-western parts of Serbia), while the Ekavian variant (spoken in most of Serbia) has only variation in quantity (length of the vowel) of \"e\". Not every Ekavian \"e\" becomes \"je\" or \"ije\" like in Ijekavian. Speakers of Ijekavian may hypercorrect their dialect by either undersupplying or oversupplying the \"je\"s and the \"ije\"s.\n\nAnother example of hypercorrection appears with word \"faliti\" meaning \"to be missing\". As \"hvala\" (\"thank you\") used to be converted to \"fala\" in many vernacular varieties, formal education heavily emphasized the correct word \"hvala\" in standard language. Many speakers also started to hypercorrect the unrelated word \"faliti\" into \"hvaliti\", which is a non-standard form.\n\nAs locative case is rarely used in colloquial usage in southern and eastern dialects of Serbia, and accusative is used instead, speakers tend to overcorrect when using the language in more formal occasions, thus using locative even when accusative should be used (typically, when indicating direction rather than location): \"Izlazim na kolovozu\" instead of \"izlazim na kolovoz\".\n\nIn German, the accent spoken in the cities of Düsseldorf, Cologne and its surroundings heavily features the front 'ch' sound (aka the \"ich sound\", ) where standard German calls for the 'sch' sound. Speakers with this accent would sometimes say 'Fich' instead of 'Fisch' (fish), and 'Tich' instead of 'Tisch' (table). This is due to a hypercorrection of the Rhineland dialect prevalent in that area of Germany, an accent that often has a 'sch' sound where Standard German has a front 'ch' (as in \"isch\" [ʔɪʃ] versus \"ich\" [ʔɪç]). Attempting to avoid this perceived error, speakers of the Ripuarian accent hypercorrect it to an abundance of 'ch' . \nAnother example is use of the genitive case where the dative case is required. Colloquially, the genitive is often dropped in favor of the dative even if correct grammatical usage demands the genitive. Because language critics deride such substitution, some German speakers use the genitive even with prepositions that actually demand the dative (e.g., \"entgegen\", \"gegenüber\"), seemingly under the false impression that the genitive is always right and the dative is always wrong, or at least that the genitive is a better form than the dative.\n\nAs the /w/-sound does not exist in Norwegian, Norwegians speaking English often produce [v] for /w/. Sometimes such speakers hypercorrect by pronouncing [w] for /v/ as well as /w/, pronouncing a word such as \"vexed\" as .\n\nThe West Flemish dialects do not use the Dutch \"ch\" (Northern Dutch pronunciation) or (Southern Dutch pronunciation). Instead they pronounce both 'g' and 'ch' as a soft 'h', whereas the Standard Dutch way to pronounce them would respectively in /ç/ and /ʝ/ in Southern Dutch or both /x/ in Northern Dutch. For example, a West-Fleming would pronounce the phrase 'een gouden hart' (a golden heart) as 'een Houden hart'. Some older people, who grew up speaking nothing but their dialect, are unaware that there is a difference between 'g', 'ch' and 'h' altogether and trying to 'mimic' Dutch, they often overcompensate and pronounce \"every\" word they would normally pronounce with a 'h'-sound as a 'g'. This includes words actually pronounced 'h'. In the example above, they would go overboard and pronounce the phrase 'een gouden hart' as 'een gouden Gart'.\n\nA popular joke illustrates this phenomenon. It concerns a pastor of a West Flemish church, who wants to impress his flock by celebrating mass in flawless, 'civilized' AN Dutch. His 'civilized' Dutch consists of pronouncing a 'ch' and 'g' as the Northern Dutch (instead of the 'h' as the West Flemish dialect does). However to be absolutely sure, he also pronounces the 'h' as even though he should continue pronouncing it as a 'h'. The results are as follows; instead of praying for \"De hele kerk\" (the whole church) he ends up praying for \"de gele kerk\" (the yellow church) and \"de heilige maagd\" (the holy virgin) becomes \"de geilige maagd\" (the horny virgin). Finally, he ends his sermon in asking what should be \"de goede hulp van de Heer\" (the good help of the Lord). Instead he asks for \"de goede gulp van de geer\" (the good zip of the gusset).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the spelling of Latin was simplified in various respects: for example, \"æ\" and \"oe\" became \"e\", and \"ch\" became \"c\". Occasionally these changes were reversed, and \"e\" and \"c\" were sometimes expanded to \"æ\" (or \"oe\") and \"ch\", even when such spelling contradicted Classical Latin. For example, \"caelum\" was contracted to \"celum\" and re-expanded to \"coelum\". These spellings are often preserved in English derivatives, including \"et cætera\" and \"et coetera\" (occasionally found as variants for \"et cetera\"); the British and international English \"foetus\" (originally \"fetus\", as it is currently spelled in American English).\n\nGhil'ad Zuckermann argues that the following hypercorrect pronunciations in Israeli Hebrew are snobbatives (from \"snob\" + \"-ative\", modelled upon comparatives and superlatives):\n\n\nThe last two hypercorrection examples derive from a confusion related to the Qamatz Gadol Hebrew vowel, which in the accepted Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation is rendered as but which is pronounced in Ashkenazi Hebrew, and in Hebrew words that also occur in Yiddish. On the other hand, the Qamatz Qaṭan vowel, which is visually indistinguishable from the Qamatz Gadol vowl, is rendered as in both pronunciations. This leads to hypercorrections in both directions.\n\nOther hypercorrections occur when speakers of Israeli Hebrew (which is based on Sephardic) attempt to pronounce Ashkenazi Hebrew, for example for religious purposes. The month of Shevat (שבט) is mistakenly pronounced \"Shvas\", as if it were spelled *שְׁבַת. In an attempt to imitate Polish and Lithuanian dialects, \"qamatz\" (both \"gadol\" and \"qatan\"), which would normally be pronounced , is hypercorrected to the pronunciation of \"holam\", , rendering גדול (\"large\") as \"goydl\" and ברוך (\"blessed\") as \"boyrukh\".\n\nIn some Spanish dialects, final intervocalic () is dropped, such as in \"pescado\" (fish), which would typically be pronounced but can be manifested as dialectically. Speakers sensitive to this variation may insert a intervocalically into a word without such a consonant, such as in the case of \"bacalao\" (cod), correctly pronounced but occasionally hypercorrected to .\n\nThe same holds true for speakers with seseo, who pronounce the letters \"z\" and soft \"c\" as , who find themselves in parts of Spain that pronounce them as (distinción), sometimes hypercorrect all instances of \"s\" as (ceceo).\n\nIn some Spanish dialects, especially in the Caribbean, is debuccalized at the end of syllables to , or sometimes elided completely, so \"pescado\" is or . As a result, speakers from these areas may add the sound to words which do not contain the letter s.\n\nBecause the infinitive marker \"att\" (\"to\") is often pronounced \"å\" (which is phonotactically correct—the conjuction \"att\" (\"that\") is never pronounced \"å\" on the other hand. \"Det är sant att jag älskar å segla\"), it's sometimes hypercorrected to \"och\", \"jag älskar och segla\"*.\n\nIn Hungarian the suffix -ban/ben indicates location, such as \"házban\" (in the house), while -ba/be indicates direction, such as \"házba\" (in(to) the house). Speakers of regional dialects often use the latter, shorter forms for both cases: \"a házba vagyok\" (non-standard: I'm in(to) the house). This is often perceived as lower quality or uneducated speech. To avoid this perception, some people make the opposite mistake, using the first form everywhere, such as in the incorrect sentence \"a házban megyek\" (I go in the house). This effect can be observed most often in public speeches of politicians, religious figures, etc.\n\nA similar mistake affects old intransitive verbs, which in old Hungarian had a distinct system of conjugation (the so-called \"ikes\" conjugation, referring to the \"-ik\" suffix in third-person singular). Among others, this system requires the use of a suffix \"-m\" instead of \"-k\" in first person (e.g. \"eszem\" instead of \"*eszek\", for \"I eat\"). This conjugation is now only preserved in parts, most of which are rapidly fading out of use. However, due to prescriptivist pressure, some Hungarian speakers mistakenly use -m suffixes on all verbs ending in \"-ik\", not just old intransitive ones (e.g. \"*kapaszkodom\" instead of \"kapaszkodok\", for \"I hold on\"). The \"-ik\" suffix is also sometimes mistakenly applied to verbs that normally do not end in it, causing the verb \"robban\" \"to explode\" to turn into \"*robbanik\".\n\nAs the voiced consonants \"b\", \"d\" and \"g\" are very rare in native Finnish words, some Finns tend to emphasise them in foreign words, more than should be necessary. For example, Finns might say *\"bedagogiikka\" instead of \"pedagogiikka\" (\"pedagogy\"), *\"brobleema\" instead of \"probleema\" (\"problem\"), or *\"psygologia\" instead of \"psykologia\" (\"psychology\"). Another form of hypercorrection is emphasised avoidance of pronouncing the diphthong \"ie\" as \"ia\", which occurs in some Finnish dialects, leading to mispronouncing the word \"piano\" (\"piano\") as *\"pieno\".\n\nOne example of hypercorrection in the Polish language is the \"adoption\" of coleslaw (itself stemming from a Dutch term) as \"kolesław\", adding an accent that seems to be simulating the Polish name Bolesław. This can be explained by only some English sounds in foreign names entering the Polish mass lingual consciousness: for example, cola is almost never pronounced with a [ts] sound, as would Polish language rules dictate the letter \"c\" to be pronounced.\n\nOther common examples of hypercorrection in Polish include nasal pronunciation of terminal \"ę\", as in \"rękę\" (correctly [-ɛ] and hypercorrectly [-ɛ᷉]) or hypercorrect pronunciation of voiced consonants instead of voiceless ones (\"jabłko\" pronounced as [ʝabʊwko] instead of [ʝapwko] or [ʝapko]).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4885398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4885398", "title": "Jabo language", "text": "Jabo language\n\nThe Jabo language is a Kru language spoken by the Jabo people of Liberia. They have also been known in the past as the Gweabo.\n\nJabo is part of the Grebo language continuum, encoded by \"Ethnologue\" more specifically as a dialect of the Southern Grebo language. However, Jabo satisfies the ISO 639-3 criteria for an individual language:\n\nOn the other hand, the commercial interaction of the Grebo peoples, together with exogamy, produces widespread multilingualism, magnifying the impression of homogeneity of the varieties of Grebo. Additionally, the goal of literacy is facilitated by a unificationalist approach to the varieties.\n\nThe Jabo language is known to scientific linguistics in some level of detail because it was analysed by the respected linguist Edward Sapir, and extensively transcribed by his doctoral student George Herzog. Both Sapir and Herzog relied upon the cooperation of Charles G. Blooah as their native informant. Most of the material was recorded on site in Liberia by Herzog, who was primarily a folklorist and ethnomusicologist. His interest in the Jabo language centered on its use in the oral literature of proverbs and sayings, and also in the Jabo drum-signalling system. This became focus of the corpus he collected. There is a natural overlap between these areas, since many of the drum signals are formulaic in nature and are based on elements of the oral literature.\n\nThis may also have entailed that much of the material recorded was originally uttered in a declamatory, rhetorical, or performance style. It has not been established the degree to which such style might depart from more informal styles of Jabo speech. However, this material is the basis of what is presented below.\n\nAs analyzed by Sapir, Jabo was represented as possessing four phonemically distinct pitch levels (or registers), independent of phonation type or supraglottal articulation. Furthermore, mono-moraic (short syllable) glides from any register to any other register were phonotactically possible. This meant that there could possibly be sixteen distinct, segmentally-identical short monosyllables with significative pitch contours—more if long syllables were admitted. The not-uncommon word types (CVV) and CVCV could potentially have 256 possible prosodic contours, each with a different dictionary meaning for the same three or four segments.\n\nSapir devised a system of \"tone letters\" for specifying tone, but they are inconvenient to typeset and not included in the Unicode inventory. The common convention for Kru languages is to mark tone with subscript or superscript tone numbers following the vowel, with 1 denoting the highest register. They may also be transcribed in the IPA with tone letters or diacritics. The default tone of the language, in Jabo tone 2, is generally left unmarked in a diacritic system. As an example, take the word \"Jabo people\", which is tone 2. For literacy purposes some system of diacritics would likely be preferable.\n\nFalling contour tones (parentheses) are very rare. Where they occur, they seem to be in imitation of other languages or dialects.\n\nThe vowels marked with a subscript dot are said to be \"dark\" or \"turbid\".  This is usually understood as being due to an articulation with pharyngeal constriction.  Advanced tongue root position or faucalization may also be involved.  This last possibility may make it simpler to rationalize the apparent markedness of the extreme vowels and , which are said always to be \"turbid\".\n\nNasalized versions of , and were reported, but it is doubtful whether they have phonemic status. Since the articulations involved are probably to a degree mutually exclusive (velic and pharyngeal), and since they seem to contribute similar auditory components (nasalization and \"turbidity\"), they are more likely to be allophones resulting from assimilation. Sapir was an excellent phonetician, so his transcriptions may be narrowly accurate, whatever their phonological implication. In the case of Herzog or Blooah, one suspects that there may have been a normalization attempt by the transcriber. This nonetheless gives an appearance of vowel harmony to Jabo phonology.\n\nSyllabic nasals and also occur. Related to this is a phenomenon of prenasalization, termed \"anacrusis\" by Sapir by analogy with the metrical term. It is probably best accounted for systematically by an underlying syllabic nasal, since it occurs with some approximants, as well as with voiced plosives.\n\nThe forms enclosed in brackets show the orthography used by Sapir/Herzog; other forms are the same.\n\nSegments and probably have only allophonic status. Word initial occurs only in loans from English. The fronted or \"dental\" nasal occurs in only a single word, but that word meaning \"possessive\" is very common.\n\nConsonants here called \"breathy\" are those termed \"emphatic\" by Sapir. The plosives are here marked with a superscript hooked h (), while the continuants are marked with a subscript diaeresis. The contrastive use of this feature defines a major isogloss separating Jabo from Glebo.\n\nThe metalinguistic import of the Jabo tonemic repertory becomes apparent when the attempt is made to select phonological distinctive features to represent the tonemes, whether binary or \"n\"-ary features. This in turn has implications for linguistic universals. However, the possibility exists that Sapir's analysis is overdifferentiated (i.e., the transcription is too \"narrow\" to claim tonemic status).\n\nThis tonal system implies an extremely high level of significative functional load to borne by pitch in the language. As such it has been cited over the years by a number influential theorists in the phonological field, such as Trubetskoy and others.\n\nA similar situation exists in the vowel space postulated by the Sapirean analysis. Since tongue and jaw position, nasalization and pharyngealization are all significative in this model, the vowel space is crowded indeed, with from 19 to 22 possible vowels, not counting diphthongs or long vowels.\n\nThe emphatic consonants of Jabo were once thought to be an example of the emergence of an implosive consonant series. There currently does not seem to be any evidence to suggest this.\n\nGlebo (Seaside Grebo) had possibly the earliest literary history of any speech variety in the Cape Palmas area, dating to the time of the missionary efforts associated with Maryland in Africa. Nonetheless, Jabo, rather than Glebo, has been proposed by the SIL survey as the basis of a unification orthography or Ausbausprache for the speech varieties of the Southern Grebo group, despite the prestige and precedence of Glebo.\n\nThis choice may be due to Jabo's preserving a number of \"archaic\" features from the proto-language, if it is indeed the case that its highly differentiated phonology reflects a common stage of development. The pedagogic principle would be that it is easier to teach across heterogeneous groups from a differentiated writing system (to a variety in which the contrast has been merged), than the reverse. Students speaking the less differentiated variety need only learn to ignore the \"superfluous\" distinctions as heterographic homonyms, rather than memorizing numerous, seemingly random heterophonic homographs.\n\n"}
{"id": "17148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17148", "title": "Killer poke", "text": "Killer poke\n\nIn computer jargon, a killer poke is a method of inducing physical hardware damage on a machine or its peripherals by the insertion of invalid values, via, for example, BASIC's POKE command, into a memory-mapped control register. The term is typically used to describe a family of fairly well known tricks that can overload the analog electronics in the CRT monitors of computers lacking hardware sanity checking (notable examples being the IBM Portable and Commodore PET.)\n\nThe PET-specific killer poke is connected to the architecture of that machine's video rasterizer circuits. In early PETs, writing a certain value to the memory address of a certain I/O register (codice_1) made the machine able to display text on the screen much faster. When the PET range was revamped with updated hardware, it was discovered that performing the old trick on the new hardware led to strange behavior by the new video chip, which could possibly damage the PET's integrated CRT monitor.\n\nThe Commodore 64 had an optional external 5-1/4\" floppy drive. The Commodore 1541 contained a 6502 microprocessor which was used to run Commodore DOS and also to manage the drive mechanism. The drives stored data on 40 tracks (#0–39), and the stepper motor could be manually controlled through BASIC by PRINT#-ing \"MEMORY-WRITE\" commands to the drive (which correspond to the POKE command of BASIC, but write to the drive's internal memory and I/O registers, not those of the computer itself). If the drive was at either end of its range (track 0 or track 39) and it was commanded to continue moving, there was no software or firmware method to prevent drive damage. Continued \"knocking\" of the drive head against the stop would throw the mechanism out of alignment. The problem was exacerbated by copy protection techniques that used non-standard disk formats with unusual track counts. The Commodore 1571 had an optical head stop instead of a mechanical one.\n\nThe TRS-80 Model III had the ability to switch between a 32-character-wide display and a 64-character display. Doing so actuated a relay in the video hardware, accomplished by writing to a specific memory-mapped control register. Programs that repeatedly switched between 32- and 64-character modes at high speed (either on purpose or accidentally) could permanently damage the video hardware. While this is not a single \"killer poke\", it demonstrates a software failure mode that could permanently damage the hardware.\n\nThe TRS-80 Color Computer, IBM PC, IBM PCjr, Nascom, MSX, Amstrad CPC, and BBC Micro from Acorn Computers all contained a built-in relay for controlling an external tape recorder. Toggling the motor control relay in a tight loop would reduce the relay's longevity.\n\nThe floppy drive of the Commodore Amiga personal computer could be made to produce noises of various pitches by making the drive heads move back and forth. A program existed which could play El Cóndor Pasa, more or less correctly, on the Amiga's floppy drive. As some sounds relied on the head assembly hitting the stop, this gradually sent the head out of alignment.\n\nCertain models of LG CD-ROM drives with specific firmware used an abnormal command for \"update firmware\": the \"clear buffer\" command usually used on CD-RW drives. Linux uses this command to tell the difference between CD-ROM and CD-RW drives. Most CD-ROM drives dependably return an error for the unsupported CD-RW command, but the faulty drives interpreted it as \"update firmware\", causing them to stop working (or, in casual parlance, to be \"bricked\").\n\nSystemd mounts variables used by Unified Extensible Firmware Interface on Linux system's sysfs as writable by the root user of a system. As a result, it is possible for the root user of a system to completely brick a system with a non-conforming UEFI implementation (specifically some MSi laptops) by using the codice_2 command to delete the codice_3 directory, or recursively delete the root directory.\n\nThe Game Boy's LCD screen can be turned off by game software. Doing so outside of the vertical blanking interval can damage the hardware.\n\n\n"}

China became the fourth country that began machine translation (MT) research following USA, UK, and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Language Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences took the initiative in Russian-Chinese MT research program and set up an MT research group. From then on the research activities were directed and applied for academic purposes in Universities. The turning point of MT systems launching initiatives in market began from 1990s. MT systems went into blossom into the market. Among these systems, there were commercialized MT systems. To be more specific, Transtar was the first commercialized MT system and has been constantly upgraded. What’s more, IMC/EC MT system which was developed by Computer Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences has further made great advancement. Meanwhile, the practical MT system MT-IT-EC specific to communication domain was also striking to notice, for it has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity in the issue of publications. \n\nGovernment funding is a critical component and support in the development of market-oriented machine translation in China. It is evident to see that since Chinese opened up to the outside world and joined the WTO, the vigorous import and export trade generate opportunities for machine translation to transfer technical terms of products into the readable target information. Facing the increasing demand of sophisticated state-of -the -art translation technology, the academic area including research institute and universities are even launching bachelors’ and masters’ programs regarding machine translation. Thus, strong evidence illustrates the promising field of machine translation in the future market of China.\n\n"}

Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.\n\n\nAnother game-related use of the term \"metagaming\" refers to operation on knowledge of the current strategic trends within a game. This usage is common in games that have large, organized play systems or tournament circuits and which feature customized decks of cards, sets of miniatures or other playing pieces for each player. Some examples of this kind of environment are tournament scenes for tabletop or computer collectible card games like \"\" or \"Hearthstone\", tabletop war-gaming such as \"Warhammer 40,000\" or \"Flames of War\", or team-based multiplayer games such as \"Star Conflict\", \"Dota 2\", \"League of Legends\", and \"Team Fortress 2\". \n\nThe metagame in these environments is often affected by new elements added by the game's developers and publishers, such as new card expansions in card games, or adjustments to character abilities in online games. The metagame may also come within player communities as reactions to win over currently-popular strategies, creating ebbs and flows of strategy types over time.\n\nRecently the term metagame has come to be used by PC Gaming shoutcasters to describe an emergent methodology that is a subset of the basic strategy necessary to play the game at a high level. The definitions of this term are varied but can include \"pre-game\" theory, behavior prediction, or \"\"ad hoc\" strategy\" depending on the game being played. An example of this would be in StarCraft where a player's previous matches with the same opponent have given them insight into that player's playstyle and may cause them to make certain decisions which would otherwise seem inferior.\n\nIn role-playing games, metagaming is a term often used to describe players' use of assumed characteristics of the game. In particular, metagaming often refers to having an in-game character act on knowledge that the player has access to but the character should not. For example, tricking Medusa to stare at a mirror when the character has never heard of Medusa and would not be aware of her petrifying stare. \n\nFor instance, a player might adjust his character's actions if the player has some foreknowledge of the long-term intentions of the gamemaster, or, more commonly, the gamemaster's tendency to have (or lack) mercy on players whose characters do things that would cause them to fail at their objectives. A player changing how they play the game based on their knowledge of the gamemaster would be metagaming.\n"}

Indeed the term \"opera house\" itself is often used as a term of prestige for any large performing-arts center.\n\nThe first public opera house was the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice, opened in 1637. Italy is a country where opera has been popular through the centuries among ordinary people as well as wealthy patrons and it continues to have a large number of working opera houses such as Teatro Massimo in Palermo (the biggest in Italy), Teatro di San Carlo in Naples (the world's oldest working opera house) and Teatro La Scala in Milan. In contrast, there was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing and the first opera house in Germany was built in Hamburg in 1678.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, opera houses were often financed by rulers, nobles, and wealthy people who used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambition and social position. With the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the 19th century, European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system.\n\nEarly United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities, hosting community dances, fairs, plays, and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events. In the 2000s, most opera and theatre companies are supported by funds from a combination of government and institutional grants, ticket sales, and private donations.\n\nThe Teatro San Carlo in Naples, opened in 1737, introduced the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, the oldest in the world, a model for the Italian theater. On this model were built subsequent theaters in Italy and Europe, among others, the court theater of the Palace of Caserta, which became the model for other theaters.\nGiven the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century Europe, opera houses are usually large, often containing more than 1,000 seats. Traditionally, Europe's major opera houses built in the 19th century contained between about 1,500 to 3,000 seats, examples being Brussels' La Monnaie (after renovations, 1,700 seats), Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater (with 1,636), Warsaw's Grand Theatre (the main auditorium with 1,841), Paris' Palais Garnier (with 2,200), the Royal Opera House in London (with 2,268) and the Vienna State Opera (the new auditorium with 2,280). Modern opera houses of the 20th century such as New York's Metropolitan Opera House (with 3,800) and the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco (with 3,146) are larger. Many operas are better suited to being presented in smaller theaters, such as Venice's La Fenice with about 1,000 seats.\n\nIn a traditional opera house, the auditorium is U-shaped, with the length of the sides determining the audience capacity. Around this are tiers of balconies, and often, nearer to the stage, are boxes (small partitioned sections of a balcony).\n\nSince the latter part of the 19th century, opera houses often have an orchestra pit, where a large number of orchestra players may be seated at a level below the audience, so that they can play without overwhelming the singing voices. This is especially true of Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus where the pit is partially covered.\n\nThe size of an opera orchestra varies, but for some operas, oratorios and other works, it may be very large; for some romantic period works (or for many of the operas of Richard Strauss), it can be more than 100 players. Similarly, an opera may have a large cast of characters, chorus, dancers and supernumeraries. Therefore, a major opera house will have extensive dressing room facilities. Opera houses often have on-premises set and costume building shops and facilities for storage of costumes, make-up, masks, and stage properties, and may also have rehearsal spaces.\n\nMajor opera houses throughout the world often have highly mechanized stages, with large stage elevators permitting heavy sets to be changed rapidly. At the Metropolitan Opera, for instance, sets are often changed during the action, as the audience watches, with singers rising or descending as they sing. This occurs in the Met's productions of operas such as \"Aida\" and \"Tales of Hoffman\". London's Royal Opera House, which was remodeled in the late 1990s, retained the original 1858 auditorium at its core, but added completely new backstage and wing spaces as well as an additional performance space and public areas. Much the same happened in the remodeling of Milan's La Scala opera house between 2002 and 2004.\n\nAlthough stage, lighting and other production aspects of opera houses often make use of the latest technology, traditional opera houses have not used sound reinforcement systems with microphones and loudspeakers to amplify the singers, since trained opera singers are normally able to project their unamplified voices in the hall. Since the 1990s, however, some opera houses have begun using a subtle form of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement (see below).\n\nOften, operas are presented in their original languages, which may be different from the first language of the audience. For example, a Wagnerian opera presented in London may be in German. Therefore, since the 1980s modern opera houses have assisted the audience by providing translated supertitles, projections of the words above or near to the stage. More recently, electronic libretto systems have begun to be used in some opera houses, including New York's Metropolitan Opera, Milan's La Scala, and the Crosby Theatre of The Santa Fe Opera, which provide two lines of text on individual screens attached to the backs of the seats so as to not interfere with the visual aspects of the performance.\n\nA subtle type of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement is used in some opera houses. Acoustic enhancement systems help give a more even sound in the hall and prevent \"dead spots\" in the audience seating area by \"...augment[ing] a hall's intrinsic acoustic characteristics.\" The systems use \"...an array of microphones connected to a computer [which is] connected to an array of loudspeakers.\" However, as concertgoers have become aware of the use of these systems, debates have arisen, because \"...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered.\"\n\nKai Harada\n\nOne example of the use of this kind of enhancement is the New York State Theater when it was used by the New York City Opera company.\n\nIn the 19th-century United States, many theaters were given the name \"opera house,\" even ones where opera was seldom if ever performed. Opera was viewed as a more respectable art form than theater; calling a local theater an \"opera house\" therefore served to elevate it and overcome objections from those who found the theater morally objectionable.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Also, when the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a popular contest to nominate the \"most energizing\" word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because \"it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars.\"\nFor comparison, \"Parom\" a corrupted form of the name \"Perun\", is used as a mild curse in Slovak language - \"Do Paroma!\" is roughly equivalent to perkele in Finnish.\n\nAs Finland was Christianized, the Catholic Church started to demonise the old Finnish deities. This led to the use of \"Perkele\" as a translation for \"Devil\" in the Finnish translation of the Bible. Later, in a 1992 translation, the word was rendered as \"paholainen\" (the evil one).\n\nMany Finnish heavy metal bands like Impaled Nazarene, Norther and Pepe Deluxe use the word \"perkele\" for emphasis and to reference Finnishness, while another Finnish metal band, Amorphis, have a song titled \"Perkele (The God of Fire)\", the sixth track on their album \"Eclipse\".\n\nThe Swedish Oi! band Perkele were formed in 1993 in Gothenburg and are currently signed to Oi! the Boat Records.\n"}
{"id": "2091820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2091820", "title": "Proto-Uralic language", "text": "Proto-Uralic language\n\nProto-Uralic is the reconstructed language ancestral to the Uralic language family. The language was originally spoken in a small area in about 7000–2000 BCE (estimates vary), and expanded to give differentiated protolanguages. The exact location of the area or Urheimat is not known, and various strongly differing proposals have been advocated, but the vicinity of the Ural Mountains is usually assumed.\n\nAccording to the traditional binary tree model, Proto-Uralic diverged into Proto-Samoyedic and Proto-Finno-Ugric. However, reconstructed Proto-Finno-Ugric differs little from Proto-Uralic, and many apparent differences follow from the methods used. Thus Proto-Finno-Ugric may not be separate from Proto-Uralic. Another reconstruction of the split of Proto-Uralic has three branches (Finno-Permic, Ugric and Samoyedic) from the start. Recently these tree-like models have been challenged by the hypothesis of larger number of protolanguages giving a \"comb\" rather than a tree. The protolanguages would be Sami, (Baltic‑)Finnic, Mordva, Mari, Permic, Magyar, Khanti, Mansi, and Samoyedic. This order is both the order of geographical positions as well as linguistic similarity, with neighboring languages being more similar than distant ones.\n\nSimilarly to the situation for Proto-Indo-European, reconstructions of Proto-Uralic are traditionally not written in IPA but in UPA. UPA is used here, followed by the IPA equivalents between slashes (because it is a phonemic reconstruction).\n\nProto-Uralic had vowel harmony and a rather large inventory of vowels in initial syllables, much like the modern Finnish or Estonian system:\n\nSometimes a mid vowel *\"ë\" is reconstructed in place of *\"ï\", or a low back rounded *\"å\" in place of *\"a\".\n\nThere were no monophonemic long vowels nor diphthongs, though sequences of vowel and semivowel within a single syllable (such as *äj) could exist.\n\nVowel inventory in non-initial syllables was restricted: only a two-way contrast of open and non-open vowels is incontestably reconstructible. The actual realization of this contrast is a question of debate: one view considers this two archiphonemic vowels and , realized as four allophones , as per vowel harmony.\n\nFor the non-open vowel(s), most branches reflect a reduced vowel ; only two branches give evidence for a specific value:\n\nWhile vowel reduction is a common sound change, Finnic is known to have adstrate influence from language groups that would not have known reduced vowels (namely the Baltic languages and the early Germanic languages), so a value of already in Proto-Uralic remains a possibility.\n\nAlthough these three or four stem types were certainly the most prominent ones in Proto-Uralic, it is possible that other, rarer types may have existed as well. These include for example kinship terms such as \"sister-in-law\", found as *kälü in both Proto-Finnic and Proto-Samoyedic. Janhunen (1981) and Sammallahti (1988) reconstruct here instead a word-final labial glide: *käliw.\n\nA general difficulty in reconstructing unstressed vowels for Proto-Uralic lies in their heavy reduction and loss in many of the Uralic languages. Especially in the Ugric and Permic languages, almost no trace of unstressed vowels appears in basic word roots. The original bisyllabic root structure has been well preserved in only the more peripheral groups: Samic and Finnic in the northwest, Samoyedic in the east. The main correspondences of unstressed vowels between these are as follows:\n\nDevelopments in Mordvinic and Mari are rather more complicated. In the former, Proto-Uralic *-a and *-ä are usually reduced to *-ə; *-a is however regularly retained whenever the first syllable of the word contained *u. Proto-Uralic *-ə is regularly lost after open syllables, as well as in some other positions.\n\nA number of roots appear to diverge from the main picture of unstressed syllables in a different way: while Finnic, Samic and Samoyedic languages all have one of the \"typical\" stem shapes, they may not quite match. Words in these classes often feature discrepancies in the vowels of the first syllable as well, e.g. Finnic *a or *oo (suggesting Proto-Uralic *a or *ë) against Samic *ā (suggesting Proto-Uralic *ä) or *oa (suggesting Proto-Uralic *o).\n\nA number of such cases may result simply from conditional vowel shifts in unstressed syllables. In fact, multiple vowel shifts are reconstructed in branches of Uralic sensitive to a particular combination of stem vowel and following reduced vowel, in which both change at once. A shift *a-ə > *o-a can be posited for Samic as well as the Mordvinic languages. E.g.:\n\nThe change is, however, masked by the shift of *ë to *a (which later develops to Proto-Samic *uo) in words such as:\n\nIn a second group, a change *ä-ä > *a-e appears to have taken place in Finnic in words such as:\nIn the consonant system, palatalization, or palatal-laminal instead of apical articulation, was a phonemic feature, as it is in many modern Uralic languages. Only one series of stops (unvoiced unaspirated) existed:\n\nThe phonetic nature of the segment symbolized by *x is uncertain, though it is usually considered a back consonant; , , , and have been suggested among others. Janhunen (1981, 2007) takes no explicit stance, leaving open the option for even a vocalic value. The segment has some similarity to the Indo-European laryngeals (to which it can correspond in loanwords): it is reconstructed by certain scholars in syllable-final position in word-stems where a contrastive long vowel later developed (similar to Turkish ğ), best preserved in the Finnic languages, and where Samoyedic features a vowel sequence such as *åə. The correlation between these two stem classes is however not perfect, and alternate possibilities exist for explaining both vowel length in Finnic and vowel sequences in Samoyedic. *x is also reconstructed word-medially, and in this position it also develops to a Finnic long vowel, but has clear consonantal reflexes elsewhere: *k in Samic, *j in Mordvinic and *ɣ in Ugric. If a consonant, it probably derives from lenition of *k at a pre-Uralic stage; it is only found in words ending in a non-open vowel, while *k is infrequent or nonexistent in similar positions.\n\nThe phonetical identity of the consonant is also subject to some doubt. It is traditionally analyzed as the palatalized counterpart of the voiced dental fricative , that is, as ; however, this a typologically rare sound value for which no direct evidence is found in any Uralic language, and a pure palatal fricative is another option; a third option is a palatal liquid like, e. g., Czech \"ř\". Ugricist László Honti has advanced a reconstruction with lateral fricatives: , for .\n\nThe phonemes in parentheses—*ć, *š, *ĺ—are supported by only limited evidence, and are not assumed by all scholars. Sammallahti (1988) notes that while instances of *ć are found in all three of Permic, Hungarian and Ob-Ugric, there are \"very few satisfactory etymologies\" showing any correlation between the branches in whether *ć or *ś appears. In the other languages, no consistent distinction between these consonants is found. The evidence for the postalveolar sibilant *š however is \"scarce but probably conclusive\" (ibid): it is treated distinctly from *s only in the more western (Finno-Permic) languages, but certain loans from as far back as the Proto-Indo-European language have reflexes traceable to a postalveolar fricative (including *piši- or *peši- \"to cook\"). The possibility of *ĺ is not considered by him at all. In contrast, Janhunen, who considers Samoyedic evidence necessary for conclusions about Proto-Uralic, doubts that *š can be reconstructed, preferring to consider it a secondary, post-Proto-Uralic innovation (p. 210). He agrees with Sammallahti in omitting *ĺ and in only considering a single palatal obstruent as necessary to reconstruct; for the latter he suggests the sound value of a palatal stop, (p. 211).\n\nNo initial or final consonant clusters were allowed, so words could begin and end with a maximum of one consonant only. The single consonants also could not occur word-initially, though at least for the first of these, this may be an coincidental omission in the data. A reconstruction \"spleen\" exists but is not found in Samoyedic and the most stringent criteria for a Proto-Uralic root thus exclude it. A similar case is \"fox\", a loanword from Indo-Iranian.\n\nInside word roots, only clusters of two consonants were permitted. Since \"*j\" and \"*w\" were consonants even between a vowel and another consonant, there were no sequences of a \"diphthong\" followed by two consonants, like in e.g. Finnish \"veitsi\". While voicing was not a phonemic feature, double (i.e. geminate) stops probably existed ( \"father-in-law\", \"five\", \"to push\"), and the singleton–geminate contrast in most descendant languages developed into a voiced–voiceless distinction (Finnic is a notable exception, e.g. Finnish \"appi\", \"lykkää\").\n\nWhen, due to suffixation, consonant clusters arose that were not permitted, the non-low vowel was inserted as a prop vowel. This process was obscured in the Finnic languages by an opposing process which syncopated unstressed \"*e\" in many cases.\n\nProto-Uralic did not have tones, which contrasts with Yeniseian and some Siberian languages. Neither was there contrastive stress as in Indo-European; in Proto-Uralic the first syllable was invariably stressed.\n\nConsonant gradation may have occurred already in Proto-Uralic: if it did, it was probably a phonetical alternation involving allophonic voicing of the stop consonants: [p] ~ [b], [t] ~ [d], [k] ~ [g].\n\nGrammatically Proto-Uralic was an agglutinative nominative–accusative language.\n\nProto-Uralic nouns are reconstructed with at least six noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Grammatical gender was not recognized and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown.\n\nThe plural marker of nouns was *\"-t\" in final position and *\"-j-\" in non-final position, as seen in Finnish \"talot\" and \"talojen\" (\"house\" Pl.Nom and Pl.Gen). The dual marker has been reconstructed as *\"-k-\", but the dual number has been lost in many of the contemporary Uralic languages.\n\nThe cases were:\n\nThe cases had only one three-way locative contrast of entering, residing and exiting (lative, locative and ablative respectively). This is the origin of the three-way systems as the three different ones in Karelian Finnish (illative/inessive/elative, allative/adessive/ablative, translative/essive/excessive). The partitive case, developed from the ablative, was a later innovation in the Finnic and Samic languages. Further cases are occasionally mentioned, e.g. Robert Austerlitz's reconstruction of Proto-Finno-Ugric includes a seventh, adverbial.\n\nThe nouns also had possessive suffixes, one for each combination of number and person. These took the place of possessive pronouns, which did not exist.\n\nVerbs were conjugated at least according to number, person and tense. The reconstructions of mood markers are controversial. Some scholars argue that there were separate subjective and objective conjugations, but this is disputed; clear reflexes of the objective conjugation are found in only the easternmost branches, and hence it may also represent an areal innovation. Negation was expressed with the means of a negative verb \"*e-\", found as such in e.g. Finnish \"e+mme\" \"we don't\".\n\nOnly some 200 word roots can be reconstructed for Proto-Uralic, if it is required that every word reconstructed for the proto-language should be present in Samoyedic languages (related to the hypothesis that Samoyedic was the first group to split off: see discussion at Finno-Ugric languages). With a laxer criterion of reconstructing words which are attested in most branches of the language family, a number in the range of 300–400 roots can be reached.\n\nThe following examples of reconstructed items are considered to fulfill the strictest criteria and are thus accepted as Proto-Uralic words by practically all scholars in the field:\n\nA reconstruction of a word *\"wäśkä\", meaning 'reddish metal' (copper, bronze or iron), has also been proposed. However, this word shows irregularities in sound correspondence, and some scholars believe it to be a Wanderwort instead.\n\nThe reconstructed vocabulary is compatible with a Mesolithic culture (bow, arrow, needle, sinew, but also rope, fence, cradle, ski), a north Eurasian landscape (spruce, birch, Siberian pine), and contains interesting hints on kinship structure.\n\nExamples of vocabulary correspondences between the modern Uralic languages are provided in the at the Finnish Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n"}

Quantitative linguistics deals with language learning, language change, and application as well as structure of natural languages. QL investigates languages using statistical methods; its most demanding objective is the formulation of language laws and, ultimately, of a general theory of language in the sense of a set of interrelated languages laws. Synergetic linguistics was from its very beginning specifically designed for this purpose.\nQL is empirically based on the results of language statistics, a field which can be interpreted as statistics of languages or as statistics of any linguistic object. This field is not necessarily connected to substantial theoretical ambitions. Corpus linguistics and computational linguistics are other fields which contribute important empirical evidence.\n\nThe earliest QL approaches date back in the ancient Greek and Indian world. One of the historical sources consists of applications of combinatorics to linguistic matters, another one is based on elementary statistical studies, which can be found under the header colometry and stichometry.\n\nIn QL, the concept of law is understood as the class of law hypotheses which have been deduced from theoretical assumptions, are mathematically formulated, are interrelated with other laws in the field, and have sufficiently and successfully been tested on empirical data, i.e. which could not be refuted in spite of much effort to do so. Köhler writes about QL laws: \"Moreover, it can be shown that these properties of linguistic elements and of the relations among them abide by universal laws which can be formulated strictly mathematically in the same way as common in the natural sciences. One has to bear in mind in this context that these laws are of stochastic nature; they are not observed in every single case (this would be neither necessary nor possible); they rather determine the probabilities of the events or proportions under study. It is easy to find counterexamples to each of the above-mentioned examples; nevertheless, these cases do not violate the corresponding laws as variations around the statistical mean are not only admissible but even essential; they are themselves quantitatively exactly determined by the corresponding laws. This situation does not differ from that in the natural sciences, which have since long abandoned the old deterministic and causal views of the world and replaced them by statistical/probabilistic models.\"\n\nThere exist quite a number of proposed language laws, among them are:\nOther linguistic units which also abide by this law are e.g., letters (characters) of different complexities, the lengths of the so-called hrebs and of speech acts. The same holds for the distributions of sounds (phones) of different durations.\n\nThe study of poetic and also non-poetic styles can be based on statistical methods; moreover, it is possible to conduct corresponding investigations on the basis of the specific forms (parameters) language laws take in texts of different styles. In such cases, QL supports research into stylistics: One of the overall aims is evidence as objective as possible also in at least part of the domain of stylistic phenomena by referring to language laws. One of the central assumptions of QL is that some laws (e.g. the distribution of word lengths) require different models, at least different parameter values of the laws (distributions or functions) depending on the text sort a text belongs to. If poetic texts are under study QL methods form a sub-discipline of Quantitative Study of Literature (stylometrics).\n\n\n\n\n"}

This idiom is thought to originate in American English, although similar or even identical idioms occur in many other languages. In the political realm, it is a term with reference to issues that a politician would rather not touch.\n\nThe idiom is based on the popular understanding of the elevated place of cows in Hinduism and appears to have emerged in America in the late 19th century. A literal sacred cow or sacred bull is an actual cow or bull that is treated with sincere respect. A figurative sacred cow is a figure of speech for something considered immune from question or criticism, especially unreasonably so.\n\nOne writer has suggested that there is an element of paradox in the concept of respect for a sacred cow, as illustrated in a comment about the novelist V. S. Naipaul: \"V. S. Naipaul ... has the ability to distinguish the death of an ordinary ox, which, being of concern to no one, may be put quickly out of its agony, from that of a sacred cow, which must be solicitously guarded so that it can die its agonizing death without any interference.\"\n\nThe motto of the satirical magazine \"The Realist\" was \"Irreverence is our only sacred cow\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6971034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6971034", "title": "Singlish vocabulary", "text": "Singlish vocabulary\n\nSinglish is the English-based creole or patois spoken colloquially in Singapore. English is one of Singapore's official languages, along with Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.Although English is the lexifier language, Singlish has its unique slang and syntax, which are more pronounced in informal speech. It is usually a mixture of English, Mandarin, Tamil, Malay, and other local dialects like Hokkien, Cantonese or Teochew. There are a few loan words from these languages i.e. 'pek chek' is often taken as being annoyed or frustrated and originate from Hokkien dialect. It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying. Singapore English can be broken into two subcategories. Standard Singapore English (SSE) and Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singlish as many locals call it. The relationship between SSE and Singlish are viewed as a diglossia, in which SSE is restricted to be used in situations of formality where Singlish/ CSEi s used in most other circumstances. \n\nSome of the most popular Singlish terms have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) since 2000, including \"wah\", \"sabo\", \"lepak\", \"shiok\", and \"hawker centre\". On 11 Feb 2015, \"kiasu\" was chosen as OED's Word of the Day.\n\nSinglish vocabulary formally takes after British English (in terms of spelling and abbreviations), although naming conventions are in a mix of American and British ones (with American ones on the rise). For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (\"sport\" in British English) and \"soccer coverage\" (soccer—originally slang for \"association football\"—while used in Britain, is more usually called just \"football\"). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from Hokkien, the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the Chinese in Singapore, and from Malay. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. It is also taken from Indian words such as \"dai\" meaning 'hey', \"goondu\" meaning 'stupid', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as \"borrow\"/\"lend\", which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, 借 (\"jiè\"), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were Sylvia Toh Paik Choo's \"Eh, Goondu!\" (1982) and \"Lagi Goondu!\" (1986). In 1997 the second edition of the \"Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary\" was published. To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the \"Coxford Singlish Dictionary\", a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website Talkingcock.com. In 2004 a website, \"A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English\", was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the Oxford English Dictionary does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur lexicographer, the \"Dictionary\" appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe Singapore Tourism Board and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the Speak Good English Movement over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of \"The Straits Times\", the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\nBelow is the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\nSinglish is prominently used in local coffee shops, or \"kopitiams\" (the word is obtained by combining the Malay word for coffee and the Hokkien word for shop), and other eateries. Local names of many food and drink items have become Singlish and consist of words from different languages and are indicative of the multi-racial society in Singapore. For example, \"teh\" is the Malay word for \"tea\" which itself originated from Hokkien, \"peng\" is the Hokkien word for \"ice\", \"kosong\" is the Malay word for \"zero\" to indicate no sugar, and \"C\" refers to \"Carnation\", a brand of evaporated milk.\n\nNames of common local dishes in Singapore hawker centres are usually referred to in local dialect or language. However, as there are no English words for certain food items, the dialect terms used for them have slowly evolved into part of the Singlish vocabulary. Ordering in Singlish is widely understood by the hawkers. Some examples of food items which have become part of Singlish:\n\nThe above list is not complete; for example, one can add the \"-peng\" suffix (meaning \"iced\") to form other variations such as \"Teh-C-peng\" (tea with evaporated milk and ice) which is a popular drink considering Singapore's warm weather.\n\n\n\n"}

The flame is typically on or applied with a fire wand (essentially a small torch), and frequently utilizes 70% isopropyl alcohol as fuel. Other common fire play toys include flaming gloves and flaming floggers; other common varieties of fuel include 91% isopropyl alcohol, mousse, hand sanitizer, super-proof rum, grain alcohol, and flash cotton. As with many forms of BDSM play, the proper tools, fuels, and safety guidelines are often in hot contention between players.\n\nFire play is usually considered a form of edge play - frequently exciting, but with significant dangers. Unlike other forms of edge play (extreme rough body play, blood play, interrogations, abductions, etc.), fire play scenes tend to look kinder and gentler; although it can be dramatic, the sensations inflicted in most fire play scenes aren't actually painful (much like hot wax play or sensation play). Fire play also rarely leaves marks on the skin - though some people deliberately burn the skin slightly to leave it red and irritated.\n\nThe two most common fire play techniques are bouncing and streaking. In bouncing, lit fire wands (sometimes called batons; essentially a small torch) are bounced along the skin. This may or may not involve transfer of burning fuel.\n\nIn streaking, fuel is applied directly to the skin (commonly in straight lines, though sometimes in more elaborate patterns), lit, and then extinguished before the skin begins to burn. Frequently the fuel is applied to the skin with unlit fire wands, then ignited with a lit fire wand (sometimes double-headed wands or two wands are used to streamline the procedure).\n\nFire cupping is where the air inside a cup (almost always glass) is heated then placed on the skin - the cooling air creates a low-pressure pocket that pulls the skin partially into the cup. Experienced cuppers can create varying strengths of suction by controlling the heat of the cup.\n\nFire cupping was appropriated from traditional and holistic medicine communities. Cupping was used in Western medicine to encourage blood movement as recently as the American Civil War. It is still used (often with the same name) by masseurs and in Chinese medicine (where it is said to have predated traditional needle acupuncture) as well as in traditional Arab medicine. For this reason, cupping sets can be found in some Asian stores. Some merchants will only sell sets to licensed massage therapists.\n\nMethods include:\n\nFire cupping typically leaves small, round marks on the body that may last for hours or for days. If a single area is cupped again and again, a deep bruise may form and not disappear for some time.\n\nFire cupping is often combined with blood play, and is then usually termed blood- or wet-cupping. (This variant also comes from traditional medicine). The skin is pierced (commonly with needles or scalpels) before the cups are applied; the suction then draws blood out of the wound.\n\nIce play is a form of temperature play that usually involves running pieces of ice across a person's naked skin. In popular culture this form of cold temperature play is frequently shown as foreplay to suggest sex with a flair of kink/interest but which may not be classed as BDSM - see movies such as Do the Right Thing, and 9½ Weeks. In BDSM, it's not uncommon for ice play to be used more elaborately. Ice is sometimes used as an insertable (for the vagina, anus, and occasionally for the male urethra), but this is risky because ice, as it melts, can form edges sharp enough to cut skin or tender tissues. Part or all of the body may be immersed in ice or ice water for short periods of time (longer periods of time run the risk of hypothermia and frostbite). Ice may be used to provide contrast in a scene that also involves warm or hot stimuli.\n\nExposure to heat and cold conditions is often employed. These are usually extremes of either of these not usually experienced on an everyday basis.\n\nA common and easily employed type of cold torture is to make subjects stand or lay naked in snow. This can be either freely or tied up. Where a subject is tied it may be in a stretched or splayed out position to expose as much of the body to the extreme condition. A variant of cold exposure is to water down a subject with cold water in cold or windy conditions or employing fans. The risks of cold exposure are hypothermia and frostbite.\n\nCommon methods of heat torture are to wrap a subject in plastic wrap, blankets, or leather or pvc bodysuits, usually with their legs together and their arms next to their body. Other methods include physical activity in severe heat or sun exposure. Lesser used methods employ heaters, fire or coals (known as roasting) for direct exposure to extreme heat. Other physical tortures such as electric shock are sometimes applied at the same time to make the subject exert themselves in order to generate more body heat. The main risk of heat exposure is dehydration but under extreme conditions heatstroke can also occur.\n\nWith both heat and cold exposure other torture methods are sometimes applied at the same time. General heat and cold exposure may be used as foreplay where during which intercourse occurs or orgasm is induced.\n\n"}

{"id": "209287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209287", "title": "Warrant (law)", "text": "Warrant (law)\n\nA warrant is generally an order that serves as a specific type of authorization, that is, a writ issued by a competent officer, usually a judge or magistrate, which permits an otherwise illegal act that would violate individual rights and affords the person executing the writ protection from damages if the act is performed.\n\nA warrant is usually issued by a court and is directed to a sheriff, a constable, or a police officer. Warrants normally issued by a court include search warrants, arrest warrants, and execution warrants.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, senior public appointments are made by warrant under the \"royal sign-manual\", the personal signature of the monarch, on the recommendation of the government. In an interesting survival from medieval times, these warrants abate (lose their force) on the death of the sovereign if they have not already been executed. This particularly applied to death warrants in the days when England authorized capital punishment. Perhaps the most celebrated example of this occurred on 17 November 1558, when several Protestant heretics were tied to their stakes in Smithfield, and the firewood bundles were about to be lit when a royal messenger rode up to announce that Mary I had died and that the warrants had lost their force. The first formal act of Mary's successor, Elizabeth I, was to decline to re-issue the warrants, and the heretics were released a few weeks later.\n\nFor many years, the English, later British, government had used a \"general warrant\" to enforce its laws. These warrants were broad in nature and did not have specifics as to why they were issued or what the arrest was being made for. A general warrant placed almost no limitations on the search or arresting authority of a soldier or sheriff. This concept had become a serious problem when those in power issued general warrants to have their enemies arrested when no wrongdoing had been done. The Parliament of Great Britain, passed the Revenue Act of 1767, which reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, and gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods. This law was one of the key acts of the United Kingdom which led to the American Revolution, and is the direct reason that the American Founding Fathers ensured that general warrants would be illegal in the United States by ratifying the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1791.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution a warrant is broadly required which particularly describes the place to be searched, and the persons, or things, to be seized; and no warrants shall be issued, but upon probable cause, supported by testimony before a judge.\n\nThe courts have recognized many exceptions to the warrant requirement, including exceptions for routine administrative or inventory searches, searches made under exigent circumstances, and searches made with consent.\n\nA typical arrest warrant in the United States will take the approximate form of: \"This Court orders the Sheriff or Constable to find the named person, wherever he may be found, and deliver said person to the custody of the Court.\" Generally, a U.S. arrest warrant must contain the caption of the court issuing the warrant, the name (if known) of the person to be arrested, the offense charged, the date of issue, the officer(s) to whom the warrant is directed, and the signature of the magistrate.\nWarrants may also be issued by other government entities, including legislatures, since most have the power to compel the attendance of their members. When a legislature issues a warrant, it is called a call of the house.\n\nThe person being investigated, arrested, or having their property seized, pursuant to a warrant is given a copy of the warrant at the time of its execution.\n\n\n\n"}

WordQ's main purpose is helping individuals who struggle with writing. WordQ uses word prediction to suggest words that the user is typing into documents and emails, helping with spelling. It also uses high-quality Acapela text-to-speech voices to read back text that the user has entered, allowing for proofreading and editing. WordQ is sold alongside a companion product, SpeakQ®, which combines speech recognition with the features of WordQ to allow users to switch between speaking and typing while writing. The combined program works with Windows. WordQ also works with Mac OS X.\n\nWordQ was first developed in the late 90’s by a research team led by Dr. Fraser Shein at the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Shein and the hospital established a co-owned company, called Quillsoft Ltd, to commercialize WordQ and support further research at the hospital. WordQ’s development followed previous software products also developed at Holland Bloorview, KeyREP® and WiVox®, which were tools to assist students who had physical writing difficulties. WordQ’s application and functionality was expanded to help those who struggled in writing as a result of learning disabilities and put to use in larger context in Ontario schools. Its use then widely expanded in schools in Canada and elsewhere around the world after further development, as the team added features and released the SpeakQ add-on. SpeakQ was developed in collaboration with the Education Development Center (Newton, MA) with support from the US Department of Education. Today, WordQ is used by a broad population of students, not just those with learning difficulties, e.g., second-language learners and average students and workers.\n\nWordQ has a small interface window that appears on top of whatever window is being run and functions with any application where the user types. As an assistive technology, this is called transparent accessibility. As the user types in letters, the software attempts to suggest the word being used, based upon the first letters and words previously written by the user. As they are writing, the user may use the directional keys or the number keys to select the desired word. The user may also have the program read their typed speech aloud to them as they write, allowing for spelling and grammar changes to be caught while writing. The program can be turned on and off by the user as they write, and it works with all commonly used programs. WordQ currently can be used in English, French, Spanish & German.\n\nA companion program, SpeakQ, adds speech recognition capability to WordQ. SpeakQ uses Windows Speech Recognition to allow the user to dictate into a microphone and have the text appear in the word processor. The user can switch between typing and speaking at will, and the program will suggest words that are hard to pronounce or spell. The user may also train the software to recognize more of their voice, although no initial training is necessary. Like WordQ, SpeakQ may be used with additional languages. SpeakQ has several unique functions: a simple training interface where training words are spoken aloud; speech feedback of recognized words; speech-enabled word prediction; and no verbal commands to learn. SpeakQ was specifically designed to make it easier for people who struggle with the mechanics of writing to express their ideas.\n\nWordQ & SpeakQ is used in many schools throughout the US and Canada. The software has been marketed in Canada for several years, but is only beginning to emerge on the US market. In Canada, many schools have adopted it for use throughout their systems. In 2010, OSAPAC, the organization responsible for buying software for schools in Ontario, bought a license to use WordQ in all the schools in the entire province. The software has been primarily used as a tool for struggling writers and those with learning disabilities which hurts their ability to write. Third-party research suggests that WordQ does as well, if not better, than other similar software at helping these struggling writers. Another independent research study suggests that WordQ's word prediction and text-to-speech capabilities could have a positive impact on the writing skills of elementary school students with specific learning disabilities.\n\nPC Magazine reviewed this software in early 2011, giving it four stars out of five, and calling it \"one of the simplest, most useful, and least expensive options\" for helping with the mechanical processes of writing. The review found that WordQ was most useful for students and struggling writers, and noted goQ Software's targeted licensing towards the education market, in particular the free home copies that are given to students.\n\n"}
