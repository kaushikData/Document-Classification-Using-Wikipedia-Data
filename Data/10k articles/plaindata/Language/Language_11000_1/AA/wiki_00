{"id": "1461817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1461817", "title": "Achumawi language", "text": "Achumawi language\n\nThe Achumawi language (also Achomawi or Pit River language) is the native language spoken by the Pit River people of present-day California. The term Achumawi is an anglicization of the name of the Fall River band, \"ajúmmááwí\", from \"ajúmmá\" \"river\". Originally there were nine bands, with dialect differences among them but primarily between upriver and downriver dialects, demarcated by the Big Valley mountains east of the Fall River valley.\n\nTogether, Achumawi and Atsugewi are said to comprise the Palaihnihan language family. The basis of this assertion is weakened by poor quality of data. David Olmsted's dictionary depends almost entirely upon de Angulo, and carelessly includes Pomo vocabulary from a manuscript in which he (de Angulo) set out to demonstrate that Achumawi and Pomo are not related. William Bright has also pointed out problems with Olmsted's methods of reconstruction. The phenomenon of non-reciprocal intelligibility is a matter of bilingualism (due to intermarriage) being more prevalent in the smaller speech community (Atsuge) than in the larger.\n\nAchumawi has 37 consonants. Most of these form pairs of plain and laryngealized or glottalized series. Plosives and affricates also have a third, aspirated member of the series (except for the single glottal stop) which is contrastive only syllable-initially and probably derives historically from clusters, as in the neighboring and possibly related Yana language.\nThe laryngealized stops are similar in articulation to the ejective glottalized stops of neighboring languages, but more lenis, that is, not \"popped\" unless an unusual effort is made at articulating the distinction. The plain-aspirated distinction is neutralized and realized with aspiration or voiceless release in syllable-final position and before another consonant. Plain stops are voiced before a short vowel or after an aspirated stop, voiceless elsewhere.\n\nIn a 5-vowel system, consisting of 5 short and long, /ɪ ɛ ʌ ə ʊ/ and /i e a o u/, the mid vowels may be of secondary origin historically, as in Yana and Atsugewi. A schwa [ə] appears epenthetically between the consonants of certain prefixes, as in \"lhúpta\" \"let's go!\". Two degrees of length are contrastive for both vowels and consonants. In downriver dialects, the second mora of a long vowel is devoiced before a plain or aspirated consonant (preaspiration) and laryngealized before a laryngealized consonant. Long vowels are typically more peripheral and short vowels more centralized. In downriver dialects, utterance-final syllables may be devoiced or whispered.\n\nUnlike the neighboring and related language Atsugewi, Achumawi has distinctive tone on every syllable.\n\nThe Achumawi language does not have gender nor a sense of plurality expressed as nouns. Instead of having plurality, the language has independent adjectives or numerals.\n\nToday, the Achumawi language is severely endangered. Out of an estimated 1500 Achumawi people remaining in northeastern California, perhaps ten spoke the language in 1991, with only 8 in 2000. However, out of these 8, 4 had a limited English proficiency.\n\nAs of 2013, a mobile app is planned for the language.\n\nLouise Davis, who lives in northern California, is almost tearful when she describes hearing people using the language of her Pit River tribe in conversation for the first time. It happened years ago when an older man from another part of the state met up with her grandmother.\n\nIt was such a powerful, emotional experience that Davis is driven to use flashcards at home with her children and do whatever it takes to preserve the language.\n\n“You can say things in our language that you can’t say in English,” she said.\n\nTesting out a language app in February [2013], she said she couldn’t wait to see it being used among young people in the tribe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11322600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11322600", "title": "Acoustic model", "text": "Acoustic model\n\nAn acoustic model is used in automatic speech recognition to represent the relationship between an audio signal and the phonemes or other linguistic units that make up speech. The model is learned from a set of audio recordings and their corresponding transcripts. It is created by taking audio recordings of speech, and their text transcriptions, and using software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word.\n\nModern speech recognition systems use both an acoustic model and a language model to represent the statistical properties of speech. The acoustic model models the relationship between the audio signal and the phonetic units in the language. The language model is responsible for modeling the word sequences in the language. These two models are combined to get the top-ranked word sequences corresponding to a given audio segment.\n\nMost modern speech recognition systems operate on the audio in small chunks known as frames with an approximate duration of 10ms per frame. The raw audio signal from each frame can be transformed by applying the mel-frequency cepstrum. The coefficients from this transformation are commonly known as mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)s and are used as an input to the acoustic model along with other features. \n\nRecently, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks has led to big improvements in acoustic modeling.\n\nAudio can be encoded at different sampling rates (i.e. samples per second – the most common being: 8, 16, 32, 44.1, 48, and 96 kHz), and different bits per sample (the most common being: 8-bits, 16-bits, 24-bits or 32-bits). Speech recognition engines work best if the acoustic model they use was trained with speech audio which was recorded at the same sampling rate/bits per sample as the speech being recognized.\n\nThe limiting factor for telephony based speech recognition is the bandwidth at which speech can be transmitted. For example, a standard land-line telephone only has a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s at a sampling rate of 8 kHz and 8-bits per sample (8000 samples per second * 8-bits per sample = 64000 bit/s). Therefore, for telephony based speech recognition, acoustic models should be trained with 8 kHz/8-bit speech audio files.\n\nIn the case of Voice over IP, the codec determines the sampling rate/bits per sample of speech transmission. Codecs with a higher sampling rate/bits per sample for speech transmission (which improve the sound quality) necessitate acoustic models trained with audio data that matches that sampling rate/bits per sample.\n\nFor speech recognition on a standard desktop PC, the limiting factor is the sound card. Most sound cards today can record at sampling rates of between 16 kHz-48 kHz of audio, with bit rates of 8 to 16-bits per sample, and playback at up to 96 kHz.\n\nAs a general rule, a speech recognition engine works better with acoustic models trained with speech audio data recorded at higher sampling rates/bits per sample. But using audio with too high a sampling rate/bits per sample can slow the recognition engine down. A compromise is needed. Thus for desktop speech recognition, the current standard is acoustic models trained with speech audio data recorded at sampling rates of 16 kHz/16bits per sample.\n\n"}

He also advised Jan van Eijk in his work on Lillooet and Hank Nater in his work on Nuxalk and did import work on comparative Salishan.\n\nAfter obtaining his PhD at Columbia University in 1951 with the study \"A contribution to the analysis of the Qabardian language\", Kuipers was on the faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1951 to 1954. During those years, as well as in the course of a 1956 field trip, he collected extensive material on the Squamish language.

{"id": "37598370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37598370", "title": "Aggressive mood", "text": "Aggressive mood\n\nThe aggressive () is a verb construction that occurs in the Finnish language, especially in emotional outbursts. It expresses negation or rejection and resembles a negative clause, but it lacks the Finnish negative auxiliary. Instead, the aggressive is often marked with an obscene word, which tends to be seen as a distinctive feature of the construction. The aggressive has playfully been described as a grammatical mood by the inventor of the term, but the construction operates on the syntactical level and morphologically the verb is in a regular mood (typically in the indicative).\n\nThe aggressive has vogue particularly in the vernacular of the youth, but the characteristic omission of the negative auxiliary has already been found in samples of dialectal Finnish recorded in the early 20th century. Even though the construction is not uncommon in colloquial Finnish, little attention has been paid to it in Finnish grammars, as it has mostly been regarded as an exceptional variant of the negative clause.\n\nThe characteristics of the aggressive were analyzed by Lari Kotilainen in his doctoral dissertation in 2007. According to Kotilainen, the aggressive is an affective and reactive construction where the negative auxiliary is omitted and the main verb tends to be at the end. In addition, there is often an expletive (obscene) word at the beginning and the construction tends to include a semi-negative word – typically \"mitään\" '[not] anything', which can be analyzed as a pronoun or an adverb. More specifically, Kotilainen has identified four main varieties of the construction (below, nearly word-by-word translations into English are given with extra clarifications in square brackets):\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his dissertation, Kotilainen does not directly refer to the construction as \"the aggressive\", but he mentions that such a name has been used of the negative construction without the negative auxiliary. Elsewhere, he has himself repeatedly used it to refer to a negative construction that includes no negative auxiliary.\n\nThe Finnish term \"aggressiivi\" first appeared in a parody of linguistic argumentation written by Jaakko Häkkinen in 1999. It was coined by shortening the adjective \"aggressiivinen\" 'aggressive' into a novel noun inspired by the existing noun \"egressiivi\" (referring to the completely unrelated egressive case of the Komi language). Häkkinen's pseudo-scientific definition describes the aggressive as a recently discovered affective negative verb mood in the Finnish language. The verbs in Häkkinen's examples are morphologically in the indicative mood, but according to his description it is typical for the \"aggressive mood\" to prefix \"vittu\" ('fuck', literally 'cunt' but largely diluted owing to its high frequency especially in the vernacular of young people) as a mock bound morpheme to a pronoun that functions as the grammatical subject of the clause (\"vittumä sinne mene\" 'fuck-I there go [fuck I won't go there]') or, alternatively, to a pronoun in a locative case (\"vittusiellä ketään ole\" 'fuck-there anybody is [fuck there won't be anybody there]').\n\nHäkkinen's joke was first published in Siulaset, the zine of the students of Finnish and Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Helsinki, and later republished in Suomen Kuvalehti (1/2000), a magazine in nationwide circulation. Since then, the joke has been posted and reposted on various Internet forums, but often with additions that miss the original idea of a grammatical mood and focus on the use of the expletive. Sometimes the aggressive has mistakenly been described as a grammatical case or part of speech.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47067031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47067031", "title": "Automatic content recognition", "text": "Automatic content recognition\n\nAutomatic content recognition (ACR) is an identification technology to recognize content played on a media device or present in a media file. Devices containing ACR support enable users to quickly obtain additional information about the content they seen without any user-based input or search efforts. For example, developers of the application can then provide personalized complementary content to viewers.\n\nTo start the recognition, a short media clip (audio, video, or both) is selected. This clip could be selected from within a media file or recorded by a device. Through algorithms such as fingerprinting, information from the actual perceptual content is taken and compared to a database of reference fingerprints, each reference fingerprint corresponding to a known recorded work. The database may contain metadata about the work and associated information, including complementary media. If the fingerprint of the media clip is matched, the identification software returns the corresponding metadata to the client application.\n\nAudio based ACR is commonly used in the market. The two leading methodologies are acoustic fingerprinting and watermarking. Another common approach uses video fingerprinting.\n\nAcoustic fingerprinting generates unique fingerprints from the content itself. Fingerprinting techniques work regardless of content format, codec, bitrate and compression techniques. This makes it possible to use across networks and channels. Therefore, it is widely used for interactive TV, second screen application and content monitoring sectors. Popular apps like Shazam, YouTube, Facebook, Thetake, Wechat and Weibo are using audio fingerprinting methodology to recognize the content played from a TV and trigger additional features like votes, lotteries, topics or purchases.\n\nIn contrast to fingerprinting, digital watermarking requires inserting digital tags containing information about the content into the content itself prior to distribution. For example, a broadcast encoder might insert a watermark every few seconds that could be used to identify to broadcast channel, program id, and time stamp. The watermark is normally inaudible or invisible to the users. Terminal devices like phones or tablets read the watermarks instead of actually recognizing the played content. Watermarking technology is utilized in media protection field to trace where illegal copies originate.\n\nIt is expected by Next/Market Insights that 2.5 billion devices will be integrated with ACR technology to provide synchronized live and on-demand video watching experience.\n\nACR technology was applied in TV content by Shazam in 2011 which captured the attention from TV industries. Shazam was previously a music recognition service which recognizes music from a sound recording. By utilizing its own fingerprint technology to identify live channels and videos, Shazam extended their business for TV. In 2012 DIRECTV partnered with Viggle which is a TV loyalty vendor to provide interactive viewing experience on the second screen. In 2013 LG partnered with Cognitive Networks (later purchased by Vizio and renamed Inscape), an ACR vendor, to provide ACR driven interaction. In 2015 ACR technology is spread widely to even more applications and smart TVs. Now, social applications and TV manufacturers like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Wechat, Weibo, LG, Samsung, Vizio TV have already used ACR technology either developed by themselves or integrated from third party ACR providers. In 2016 there are more applications and mobile OS embedded with automatic content recognition services on the market like Peach, Omusic and Mi OS to enhance the music discover experiences.\n\nACR technology helps audiences easily retrieve information about the content they watched. For smart TVs and applications with ACR technology embedded the audience can check the name of the song which is played or descriptions of the movie they watched. In addition to that, the identified video and music content can be linked to internet content providers for on-demand viewing, third parties for additional background information, or complementary media.\n\nBecause devices can be \"aware\" of content being watched or listened to, second screen devices can feed users complementary content beyond what is presented on the primary viewing screen. ACR technology can not only identify the content, but also it can identify the precise location within the content. Thus, additional information can be presented to the user. ACR can enable a variety of interactive features such as polls, coupons, lottery or purchase of goods based on timestamp.\n\nReal-time audience measurement metrics are now achievable by applying ACR technology into smart TVs, set top boxes and mobile devices such as smart phones and tables. This measurement data is highly essential to quantify audience consumption to set advertising pricing policies.\n\nFor advertisers and content owners, it is vital to know when and where their content has been played. Traditionally agencies or advertisers have to manually audit the presentation. At scale it only can be checked through a statistical sampling method. ACR technology enables automatic monitoring of the content played in TV. Information like the time of play, duration, frequency can be achieved without any manual effort. Many people have expressed some concern however on the information that these smart TVs are sending out to the companies collecting this data. However there is an option in almost every set to disable this feature. \n\nThe alternative approaches are video based automated content recognition technologies. These are a suite of technologies that revolve around the convergence of video and TV Everywhere which will render the audio and digital watermarking methods incapable of handling the millions of unique streams going out and billions of hours of footage to be reviewed with metadata extracted or enriched in relation to the content in real-time. Where acoustic fingerprint fails in its reliance on a database of reference fingerprints. Digital watermarking relies on intrusive frame by frame production stage imprinting on every piece of content. The effectiveness of these techniques have been challenged based on their presumed inability to effectively scale to the amount of video being generated. In practice for monetization and other user based ACR applications the reference database or presence of watermarks only has to cover those videos that are targets of monetization. For example, a video that is hosted on YouTube and viewed only once does not need to be present in a world wide ACR database or be impressed with a watermark.\n\nACR service providers include ACRCloud, Digimarc, Gracenote, Kantar Media, and Shazam.\n\n"}
{"id": "28897698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28897698", "title": "Berber orthography", "text": "Berber orthography\n\nBerber orthography is the writing system(s) used to transcribe the Berber languages. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script (Tifinagh) was utilized to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Following the spread of Islam, some Berber scholars also utilized the Arabic script. There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh (Libyco-Berber), the Arabic script, and the Berber Latin alphabet. Different groups in North Africa have different preferences of writing system, often motivated by ideology and politics.\n\nNeo-Tifinagh, a resurrected version of an alphabetic script found in historical engravings, is the \"de jure\" writing system for Tamazight in Morocco. The script was made official by a Dahir of King Mohammed VI, based on the recommendation of IRCAM. It was recognized in the Unicode standard in June 2004.\n\nTifinagh was chosen to be official after consideration of its univocity (one sound per symbol, allowing regional variation), economy, consistency, and historicity. Significantly, Tifinagh avoids negative cultural connotations of the Latin and Arabic scripts.\n\nTifinagh is preferred by young people as a symbol of identity and has popular support. It is especially popular for symbolic use, with many books and websites written in a different script featuring logos or title pages using Neo-Tifinagh. However, virtually no books or websites were being published in this alphabet, with activists primarily favoring Latin scripts for serious usage.\n\nTifinagh has been criticized for not being practical to implement, and for being Kabyle-centric and not historically authentic. Following the Tifinagh Dahir road signs were installed in the Riffian city of Nador in Arabic and Tifinagh, but these were removed by security forces in the middle of the night soon after.\n\nThe Moroccan state arrested and imprisoned people using this script during the 1980s and the 1990s, but now Morocco is the only country in which Tifinagh has official status.\n\nThe Latin script has its origins in French colonialism. French missionaries and linguists found the Arabic script inconvenient, so they adapted the Latin alphabet to various Berber languages and Arabic vernaculars. While the established body of literature in the Arabic script was a barrier to wider adoption of the Latin script, it caught on among the French-educated minority, particularly in Algeria. Since independence, the Latin alphabet has been largely favored by the intelligentsia, especially in Kabylie where the Berberists are largely pro-Westernization and French-educated. A standard transcription for the Kabyle language was established in 1970, and most other Northern Berber dialects have to varying extents published literature in the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe Latin alphabet has been preferred among Amazigh linguists and researchers, and also has a great deal of established writing, including newspapers, periodicals, and magazines. It is more popular in Algeria than Morocco, but prevalent in the Riffian area. It is backed by the Amazigh elite, but is vehemently opposed by the Moroccan pro-Arab establishment. The Latin script is far more ensconced in the Kabyle dialect than in Tamazight.\n\nThe orthography used in most modern printed works is the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales (INALCO) standard, designed for phonemicity. Older systems from the colonial French era are still found in place names and personal names. The older colonial system showed marked influence from French, for instance writing as and as , and was inconsistent in marking many Berber sounds, for instance writing as a circumflex over the vowel, and often leaving emphatics unmarked.\n\nThe Tifinagh script is the traditional script for written Berber; but Latin Script remains the predominant orthography for Berber literature for the general public in North Africa. Some Tamazight newspapers, periodicals, and magazines are written in Arabic script, although the Latin alphabet is preferred. Some North-African states policies have imposed Arabic script over other scripts suggested by Berber groups, this has been perceived as Arab colonialism replacing former French colonialism. Amazigh activists, however, eschew Arabic script which is generally unpopular among Berbers who believe it is symptomatic of North African governments' pan-Arabist views.\n\nA consistent orthography was used in the few Berber texts in existence from the eleventh to the fourteenth century CE. These were written in an older Berber language likely to be most closely related to Tashelhiyt. The consonant \"g\" was written with \"jīm\" () or \"kāf\" (), \"ẓ\" with \"ṣād\" () or sometimes \"zāy\" (), and \"ḍ\" with \"ṭāʼ\" (). Vowels \"a, i, u\" were written as orthographically long vowels ‹ā›, ‹ī›, ‹ū›. Word-final \"wāw\" was usually accompanied by \"alif al-wiqāyah\". The vowels signs \"fatḥah\" or \"kasrah\" represent a phonemic shwa /ə/ which was lost in the post-medieval language, e.g. \"tuwərmin\" ‹tūwarmīn› () “joints, articulation”. Labialization may be represented by \"ḍammah\", e.g. \"tagʷərsa\" ‹tāgursā› () “ploughshare”. Prepositions, possessive complements and the like are mostly written as separate words. The medieval texts display many archaisms in phonology, morphology and lexicon.\n\nThe way in which Tashelhiyt has been written in the Arabic script during the past centuries is very consistent, to the extent that it is possible to talk about “a conventionalized orthography”. This premodern orthography has remained virtually unchanged since at least the end of the 16th century, and is still used today in circles of traditional Islamic scholars (\"ṭṭlba\").\n\nThe Maghrebi script style is always used. Distinctive features of Maghrebi script are: the different pointing of \"fāʼ\" and \"qāf\"; \"shaddah\" may be represented with a V-shaped symbol; \"waṣl\" is indicated by writing the final vowel of the preceding word a second time with the \"alif\" (with \"u\" represented by a bar through the middle of the \"alif\"), e.g. \"kullu n-nāsi\" ‹kullu (u)l-nnāsi› “all the people”.\n\nIn premodern Shilha orthography, two extra letters were added to the alphabet to represent consonants not represented by the Standard Arabic alphabet: a \"kāf\" with three dots for \"g\", and \"ṣād\" with three dots for \"ẓ\" (dots may also be added underneath the letter). Consonants \"ṛ\" and \"ḷ\", which bear a minimal functional load, are not distinguished in the spelling from \"r\" and \"l\".\n\nTexts are always fully vocalized, with \"a\", \"i\" and \"u\" written with the vowel signs \"fatḥah\", \"kasrah\", and \"ḍammah\". Consonants without a following phonemic vowel are always written with a \"sukūn\". Gemination is indicated as usual with \"shaddah\", but in Shilha spelling it may be combined with \"sukūn\" to represent a geminated consonant without following vowel (which never occurs in Standard Arabic). Labialization is generally not represented, e.g. \"tagʷrsa\" ‹tagrsa› “plough share”. The Arabic \"waṣl\" spellings are often “mirrored” and used to write word-initial vowels, e.g. \"ayyur ula tafukt\" ‹ayyur(u) ulatafukt› “the moon as well as the sun”.\n\nVowel length is not distinctive in Shilha, but orthographically long vowels may be used to indicate emphasized syllables in metric texts, e.g. \"lxálayiq\" ‹lxālayiq› “creatures” vs. standard Arabic orthography ‹l-xalāʼiq›.\n\nThe Arabic letters ﺙ, ﺫ, ﻅ, representing the Arabic interdentals /θ, ð, ð̣/ may be used in etymological spellings of loanwords, but they are often replaced by ﺕ, ﺩ, ﺽ, in accordance with Shilha pronunciation, e.g. \"lḥadit\" “tradition” can be written as ‹lḥadiθ› (etymological) or as ‹lḥadit› (phonemic). Final /-a/ in both native Berber words and loan words is sometimes written with \"alif maqṣūrah\", even if the Standard Arabic spelling does not use it, e.g. \"zzka\" “alms tax” written as ‹zzká› vs. standard ‹z-zkā›. Final \"-t\" in words of Arabic origin is sometimes written with \"tāʼ marbūṭah\", whether or not the original Arabic word was spelled with it, e.g. \"zzit\" “olive oil” written as ‹zzi›. Nunation diacritics are sometimes used to write final \"-Vn\" in Shilha words, e.g. \"tumẓin\" “barley” ‹tumẓin› or ‹tumẓ›. Native words starting with a vowel and a geminated consonant may sometimes be written as if they contain the Arabic definite article, e.g. \"azzar\" “hair” written as ‹al-zzar›. Final \"-u\" or \"-w\" in Shilha words may be written with a following \"alif al-wiqāyah\".\n\nWith respect to word divisions, the premodern orthography may be characterized as conjunctive (in contrast to most European orthographies, which are disjunctive). Thus, elements such as prepositions, preverbials, pronominal affixes, demonstrative and directional particles are written connected to a noun or verb form, e.g. ‹urānɣiḍhir manīɣurikfis iblisī› = \"ur anɣ iḍhir mani ɣ ur ikfis iblis-i\" “it is not apparent to us where Iblis has not sown [his depravity]”.\n\n"}

In 1852, in Salonica, the cleric printed a bilingual manuscript. It contains a Greek evangeliarium and its translation to Solun-Voden dialect from today Slavic dialects of Greece, both written in Greek letters. The texts represent the vernacular, not church language.\n\nThis translation is the oldest known text of greater scope, that directly reflects the living dialects of Aegean Macedonia of that period. Bulgarian academician , who found the title page of the gospel in 1907, described it as written in Bulgarian dialect. On the title page is written \"Typed in Bulgarian language\" even the author himself was known later as Bulgarian Exarchate's worker.\n\nThe label \"Bulgarian language\" for various Macedonian dialects can be seen from early vernacular texts such as the four-language dictionary of Daniel Moscopolites, the early works of Kiril Peichinovich and Yoakim Karchovski and such vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the local Slavic vernacular were registered in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian. It is also considered by researchers from the University of Helsinki to be the oldest known Gospel translation in what would later be known as Macedonian language.\n\nUntil the winter of 2003-04 it was believed that both the manuscript and the printed text were destroyed. Only the front page was preserved and published in the book \"Bulgarian antiquities in Macedonia\", Jordan Ivanov, 1931, p. 182., among others. Then a group of researchers from the University of Helsinki found the original manuscript of the translation of the Alexandrian Patriarch, under the reference: Bibl.Patr.Alex. 268. Another example is the \"Kulakian gospel\" from 1863, which represents translation from Greek evangeliarium to Solun-Voden dialect and was written by hand with Greek letters from Evstati Kipriadi in the town of Chalastra. On the title page is also inscription \"Written in Bulgarian language\". \nIn 1952 a liturgical edition of the 4 Gospels was printed. This was translated by Milošev Djordje with the help of the Macedonian Committee of the Orthodox Church. In 1957 further selections based upon the lectionary readings were published. In 1959 the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, translated by Georgi Milosev, Boris Boskovski and Petar Ilijevski was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS). The first complete e New Testament translated in the Macedonian language was then completed and published in 1967. In 1970 the Bible Society printed an edition with cross-references following the verses. Another edition was printed in Belgrade in 1988 by the Yugoslav office of the United Bible Societies (UBS).\n\nThe whole Bible (including the Deuterocanonical books) translated in Macedonian by the Archbishop Gavril was printed in 1990. This was published by the Bible Society and it has the official sanction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. An audio edition of the 1990 New Testament was produced.\n\nThe text was revised in 2006 and called the Macedonian Standard Bible. This was printed in 2 editions, one without the deuterocanonical books and one with them, which has the official sanction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. These have been digitised by the Bible Society and the 2006 editions are now on YouVersion as MK2006 and MK2006D. The Bible Society launched a Macedonian Bible app which was launched in Skopje in October 2016. This is available on Android, iPhone and Google platforms. An audio edition of the New Testament was also produced.\n\nIn 2008 the Orthodox Church edited the 1952 liturgical 4 Gospels to produce a new edition used with their lectionary and liturgy.\n\nAn independent translation of the complete Bible was prepared by Duško Konstantinov in the mid 1970s, but it was not printed until 1996 by the Loucas Foundation. A dynamic translation of the New Testament prepared by Ivan Grozdanov and Goran Stojanov was published in 1999 under the umbrella of Biblica. Jehovah's Witnesses have translated their New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures from English into Macedonian.\n\n"}

Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats. Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.\n\nAlso included are species that have gone extinct since 500 AD. When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term \"threatened\" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.\n\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.\n\nNatureServe conservation status focuses on Latin America, United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. It has been developed by scientists from NatureServe, The Nature Conservancy, and the network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: \"presumed extinct\" (GX), \"possibly extinct\" (GH), \"critically imperiled\" (G1), \"imperiled\" (G2), \"vulnerable\" (G3), \"apparently secure\" (G4), and \"secure\" (G5). The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including \"inexact numeric ranks\" (e.g. G2?), and \"range ranks\" (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for \"captive or cultivated only\" (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List \"extinct in the wild\" (EW) status.\n\nThe Red Data Book of the Russian Federation is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.\n\nIn Australia, the \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\" (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 IUCN Red List Categories & Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the \"Endangered Species Protection Act 1992\". Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status.\n\nIn Belgium, the Flemish Research Institute for Nature and Forest publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.\n\nIn Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada. Under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.\n\nIn China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.\n\nIn Finland, a large number of species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the EU Habitats Directive and EU Birds Directive.\n\nIn Germany, the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation publishes \"red lists of endangered species\".\n\nIndia has the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003 and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.\n\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Environment publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.\n\nIn New Zealand, the Department of Conservation publishes the New Zealand Threat Classification System lists. threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon. While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.\n\nIn Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.\n\nIn South Africa, The South African National Biodiversity Institute, established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004, is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.\n\nIn Thailand, the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen reserved animal species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is responsible for the regulation of these activities.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from \"0\" - extinct to \"VI\" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.\n\nIn the United States of America, the Endangered Species Act created the Endangered Species List.\n\nSome consumer guides for seafood, such as Seafood Watch, divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:\n\nThe categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through bycatch or ocean bottom trawlers. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. squid, prawns).\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their \"FishOnline\" website.\n\n\n"}

An example of \"cover vs. concealment\" would be sandbags vs. tall grass. Cover may be a naturally occurring feature, such as a rock or a tree stump, or it may be a constructed feature, such as a foxhole or a trench.\n\nIn some military services (especially in the United States), a uniform's hat is sometimes referred to officially as a cover, as in \"Hey soldier, remove your cover!\" or \"You're not in uniform without your cover.\" It is a convention in the United States Military that an armed soldier must wear cover while indoors to indicate that they are under arms.\n\nMany first and third-person shooter video games encourage the player to utilize cover.

The general feel of the project reflects that of an actual death march because project members are forced to continue the project by their superiors against their better judgment.\n\nSoftware development and software engineering are the fields in which practitioners first applied the term to these project management practices. Other fields have since recognized the same occurrence in their own spheres and have adopted the name.\n\nDeath marches of the destined-to-fail type usually are a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling, feature scope, or both, and often include lack of appropriate documentation or relevant training and outside expertise that would be needed to accomplish the task successfully. The knowledge of the doomed nature of the project weighs heavily on the psyche of its participants, as if they are helplessly watching themselves and their coworkers being forced to torture themselves and march toward death. Often, the death march will involve desperate attempts to right the course of the project by asking team members to work especially grueling hours (14-hour days, 7-day weeks, etc.) or by attempting to \"throw (enough) bodies at the problem\", often causing burnout.\n\nOften, the discomfort is heightened by the knowledge that \"it didn't have to be this way\"; that is, that if the company wanted to achieve the goal of the project, it could have done so in a successful way had it been managed competently (such as by devoting the obviously required resources, including bringing all relevant expertise, technology, or applied science to the task rather than just whatever incomplete knowledge a few employees happened to possess). Patent under-resourcing is especially offensive at a large corporation with sufficient financing. Business culture pressures, such as the corporate pursuit of short-term maximization of profits, may play a role in addition to mere incompetence.\n\nThe term \"death march\" in this context was discussed at length in Edward Yourdon's book \"Death March: The Complete Software Developer's Guide to Surviving 'Mission Impossible' Projects\" (), which has a second edition simply titled \"Death March\" (). Yourdon's definition: \"Quite simply, a death march project is one whose 'project parameters' exceed the norm by at least 50 percent.\" \n\n"}

Extemporaneous speaking is a competitive speaking event in the United States in both high school and college forensics competition.\nExtemporaneous speaking provides 30 minutes of preparation time, followed by a seven minute speech. When preparation starts, speakers are offered three questions to answer. Questions are based on current affairs, and topic areas generally include international and domestic policy, economic policy, and social or scientific issues. Speakers generally speak persuasively, though some areas of the US offer informative speeches.\n\nAccording to Pausanias (6.18.6), Anaximenes was \"the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously.\" Extemporaneous Speaking was designed as an event to not be a memorized, rehearsed speech, but rather, a short, analytical speech spoken off the cuff, emphasizing critical thinking in addition to performance.123\n\nExtemporaneous speaking is a speech that is either persuasive or informative in nature, usually modeled off of a 5 paragraph essay. At top levels, extemporaneous is a smooth, dynamic performance that incorporates research, background knowledge, and opinion. A successful extemporaneous speech has an introduction that catches the listener's attention, introduces the theme of the speech, and answers the question through three, or sometimes two, areas of analysis, which develop an answer to the question. These areas of analysis are followed by a conclusion, which summarizes the speech. Extemporaneous speaking sometimes allows for the use of index cards, but many extemporaneous competitors forgo their usage, and many forensic leagues do not allow their usage. The use of the Internet is often not allowed during preparation.\n\nDebate and public speaking (collectively called \"forensics\") are generally stratified into novice and varsity levels. A varsity level extemporaneous speech typically contains anywhere from 6 – 15 sources, while averaging 8-10, to provide a basis of fact for analyzing the question. References are often referred to as a \"cite\" or \"citation.\" Quality sources include newspapers like \"The New York Times\" and \"Christian Science Monitor\", magazines like \"the Economist\" and \"Foreign Policy\" and journals like \"The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs\" and \"Foreign Affairs\". For a speech dealing with a certain region's issues, say Africa or the Middle East, it is good to include regional sources as well, like \"All Africa\" and \"Al Jazeera\" respectively.\n\nThe introduction is usually structured as a 1 minute, 30 second section, with an attention-getter to grab the attention of the audience, background information, which often includes a source to build credibility, a statement of significance, which tells the audience why the topic is important, before going into the basic overview of the structure of the speech, including the question, answer, and a preview of the three areas of analysis.\n\nAn individual point in Extemporaneous Speaking is typically structured like a basic warrant, with a claim, warrant, and impact with about 1 minute and 30 to 1 minute and 40 seconds of content. This usually incorporates two to four sources to build credibility and provide information for analysis, and a mid of both broad argumentation and specific examples. Finally, the end of a point usually links back to the speaker's answer to the question, which functions as an impact. Some schools of thought argue that the impact of a point should link to a scenario outside of the scope of the question, but most competitive circuits in High School and Collegiate competition value a link back to the answer to the question instead.\n\nThe conclusion, which lasts for between 30 seconds and 1 minute, in Extemporaneous Speaking follows the basic format of the introduction, but backwards, starting with the speaker restating the question, answer, and review of the three points. Finally, the speech finishes with a basic reference to the attention-getter.\n\nDuring the speech, competitors are evaluated by way of comparison to the other speakers in a \"round\" of competition. Generally, there are five to seven competitors in a given round. Judges give speakers time signals to help them pace their presentations, usually starting from five minutes remaining. Judges rank all students in a room in order, with the first rank being the best and the worst speaker ranked last (sixth, for example in a round of six competitors).\n\nIn High School competition, the National Forensic League (NFL), Stoa USA, the National Christian Forensics and Communication Association (NCFCA) and the National Catholic Forensic League (CFL) host most Extemp tournaments in High School. Both leagues have a national tournament at the end of every year, with the NFL tournament drawing a larger number of competitors. There is also the Extemporaneous Speaking Tournament of Champions, held each May at Northwestern University, along with the Tournament of Champions at the University of Kentucky, which has held a round robin since 2012. In addition, there are highly prestigious \"circuit\" tournaments, as in Policy debate, Public Forum, and Lincoln-Douglas. These include the Glenbrooks Tournament in Chicago, the Yale Invitational at Yale University, the Patriot Games at George Mason University, the Barkley Forum at Emory University, the Berkeley Tournament in University of California, Berkeley, and the Invitational at Harvard University. There are also two major round-robins, held at George Mason University and at Montgomery Bell Academy (MBA).\n\nIn collegiate competition, a myriad of organizations provide national competition in Extemporaneous Speaking. The American Forensic Association (AFA) and the National Forensic Association (NFA) are organizations responsible for Extemporaneous speaking at the four year level, with Phi Ro Pi serving the two year, community college level. Other organizations which offer Extemporaneous Speaking competition are Pi Kappa Delta, Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, and the International Forensic Association. Collegiate competition is almost identical to High School competition, with most tournaments hosted by Universities. The AFA hosts a National Individual Events Tournament (NIET), usually in April. The NFA hosts a separate tournament with easier qualification requirements known as NFA Nationals. Additionally, collegiate competition consists of dozens of tournaments across the country, like the Norton Invitational, hosted by Bradley University, and the Hell Froze Over swing tournament.\n\nRankings for High School Extemporaneous Speaking are maintained by multiple organizations, three of which are: Extemp Central, the Institute for Speech and Debate, and SpeechRanks.com. All three use a points system which assigns points to tournaments on the national circuit based on the size of each tournament's field, and its prestige.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As early as the 9th century Judah ibn Kuraish discussed the relationship between Arabic and Hebrew. In the 10th century, Aaron ben Moses ben Asher refined the Tiberian vocalization, an extinct pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe first treatises on Hebrew grammar appear in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Midrash (a method of interpreting and studying the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad around the 7th century. The \"Diqduq\" (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible.\n\nSolomon ibn Gabirol in the 11th century composed a versified Hebrew grammar, consisting of 400 verses divided into ten parts. In the 12th century, Ibn Barun compared the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition.\n11th to 12th century grammarians of the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain included Judah ben David Hayyuj, Jonah ibn Janah, Abraham ibn Ezra, Joseph Kimhi, Moses Kimhi and David Kimhi. Ibn Ezra gives a list of the oldest Hebrew grammarians in the introduction to his \"Moznayim\" (1140).\nRoger Bacon was \"a tolerable Hebrew scholar\". Profiat Duran published an influential grammar in 1403.\n\nJudah Messer Leon's 1454 grammar is a product of the Italian Renaissance. Hebrew grammars by Christian authors appeared during the Renaissance. Hieronymus Buclidius, a friend of Erasmus, gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a branch of Hebrew studies at Louvain in Flanders. Elijah Levita was called to the chair of Hebrew at the University of Paris. Cardinal Grimani and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the Cabala with Jewish teachers; even the warrior Guido Rangoni attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of Jacob Mantino (1526). Pico de la Mirandola (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and Reuchlin was the first Christian author to write a vocabulary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506). A more detailed grammar was published in 1590 by Otto Walper.\nConrad Gesner (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books.\nPaul Fagius and Elia Levita operated the first Hebrew printing office in the 1540s. Levita also compiled the first Hebrew-Yiddish dictionary.\n\nThrough the influence of Johannes Buxtorf (d. 1629) a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin. Gesenius' \"Hebrew Grammar\" appeared in 1813.\n\nThe Hebrew language is subdivided by era, with significant differences apparent between the varieties. All varieties, from Biblical to Modern, use a typically Semitic templatic morphology with triconsonantal stems, though Mishnaic and Modern Hebrew have significant borrowed components of the lexicon that do not fit into this pattern. Verbal morphology has remained relatively unchanged, though Mishnaic and Modern Hebrew have lost some modal distinctions of Biblical Hebrew and created others through the use of auxiliary verbs.\n\nSignificant syntactic changes have arisen in Modern Hebrew as a result of non-Semitic substrate influences. In particular:\n\n\nHowever, most Biblical Hebrew constructions are still permissible in Modern Hebrew in formal, literary, archaic or poetic style.\n\n\nModern Hebrew\nBiblical Hebrew\n\n"}

Besides this he worked as musician and choirmaster as well as conductor and dramaturg\n\nJakob Streit was born in the Berner Oberland in Switzerland, the son of a watchmaker, and lived there for most of his life. He had four brothers and sisters and everyone helped to tend the family beehives, their cow and calf and their sheep.\n\nHe studied Education at the teacher training college in Bern, where his skills in Music, Education and Literature were honed. His musical education he completed with Hans Klee, the father of artist Paul Klee, then began on a career as teacher of different age groups, in the course of which the many stories he told to the children were published as children's stories in over forty books. Many of these are translated into English and other languages. His educational method, and particularly his music instruction drew heavily on the indications of Rudolf Steiner on Waldorf education.\n\n“When one has told stories to different age groups of children for 45 years on a daily basis, one learns a great deal from them, one is carried on the wings of Poetry, of the imagination. In later years, this interest grows into everything that is truly human. For example, this is how I came to write my first book about gnomes: A girl in the third grade brought a beautiful Edelweiss to my desk one morning, saying: “My father gave it to me and told me that, if you can tell us how the Edelweiss came about, you can keep it.” Quickly the children all sat down at their desks, for in their eyes the teacher of the third grade is capable of anything at all. Forty pairs of eyes are looking expectantly at you. (…) I began thoughtfully; soon there were gnomes and elves in the picture, finding magic ways to transform the stars of the night into the Edelweiss.

In 1868, she was proclaimed heiress apparent to the Bhopal \"musnaid\" following the death of her grandmother, Sikander Begum and her mother's succession to the throne. In 1901, Sultan Jahan succeeded her mother at her death, becoming Nawab Begum of Dar-ul-Iqbal-i-Bhopal.\n\nA great reformer in the tradition of her mother and grandmother, Sultan Jahan founded several important educational institutions in Bhopal, establishing free and compulsory primary education in 1918. During her reign, she had a particular focus on public instruction, especially female education. She built many technical institutes and schools and increased the number of qualified teachers. From 1920 until her death, she was the founding Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University. Even till today, she is the only female Chancellor ever served for Aligarh Muslim University.\n\nNot just a reformer in the field of education, the Nawab Begum reformed taxation, the army, police, the judiciary and the jails, expanded agriculture, and constructed extensive irrigation and public works in the state. Also, she established an Executive and Legislative State Council in 1922 and began open elections for the municipalities.\n\nIn 1914, she was the President of the All-India Muslim Ladies' Association. Sultan Jahan's primary legacy, though, was in the field of public health, as she pioneered widespread inoculation and vaccination programs and improved the water supply and standards of hygiene and sanitation. A prolific author, she wrote several books on education, health and other topics, including \"Hidayat uz-Zaujan\", \"Sabil ul-Jinan\",\n\"Tandurusti\" (Health), \"Bachchon-ki-Parwarish\", \n\"Hidayat Timardari\", \"Maishat-o-Moashirat\". Owing to her numerous activities, she was the recipient of numerous honours and awards.\n\nIn 1926, after a reign of 25 years, Sultan Jahan abdicated the throne in favour of her youngest child and only surviving son, Hamidullah Khan. She died four years later, aged 71.\n\nOn 1 February 1874, Sultan Jahan married HH Ali Jah, Ihtisham ul-Mulk, Nasir ud-Daula, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan Bahadur, Sultan Dulha Sahib, Nawab Consort of Bhopal, (1854–1902), 9th cousin, once removed, and a member of the senior male-line branch of the dynasty.

{"id": "1673294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1673294", "title": "Krymchak language", "text": "Krymchak language\n\nThe Krymchak language (, \"Qrımçah tılyı\") (also called Judeo-Crimean Tatar, Krimchak, Chagatai, Dzhagatay) is a moribund Turkic language spoken in Crimea by the Krymchak people. The Krymchak community was composed of Jewish immigrants who arrived from all over Europe and Asia and who continuously added to the Krymchak population. The Krymchak language, as well as culture and daily life, was very similar to Crimean Tatar, the peninsula's majority population, with the addition of a significant Hebrew influence.\n\nLike most Jewish languages, it contains a large number of Hebrew loanwords. Before the Soviet era, it was written using Hebrew characters. In the Soviet Union in the 1930s, it was written with the Uniform Turkic Alphabet (a variant of the Latin script), like Crimean Tatar and Karaim. Now it is written in the Cyrillic script.\n\nOver the last century the language has disappeared and been replaced by Russian, with approximately 70% of the population perishing in the Holocaust. When in May 1944 almost all Crimean Tatars were deported to Soviet Uzbekistan, many speakers of Krymchak were among them, and some remained in Uzbekistan.\n\nNowadays the language is almost extinct. According to the Ukrainian census of 2001, less than 785 Krymchak people remain in Crimea. One estimate supposes that of the approximately 1500-2000 Krymchaks living worldwide, mostly in Israel, Crimea, Russia, and the United States, only 5-7 are native speakers.\nKrymchak is within the Turkic language family. It has alternatively been considered as a separate language or as an ethnolect of Coastal/Middle Crimean Tatar, along with Crimean Karaite. Glottochronological reckoning evidenced that these subdialects became distinct from Crimean Tatar around 600-800 AD. Krymchak and Karaite became distinguishable around 1200-1300.\n\nThe Krymchak community formed over hundreds of years as Jews from all over Europe and Asia immigrated to the Crimean peninsula. A Greek-speaking Jewish community had resided on the peninsula from 100 BC, and other Jewish peoples settled there over time as well. The Krymchak community originated during the Middle Ages, grew intensely in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, became a unified group in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and continued to grow until the nineteenth century. This growth occurred continuously as Jewish emigrants arrived from the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Persia, and many other regions. The study of Krymchak surnames affirms that their community formed slowly and was composed from elements of different origins.\n\nLike other Jewish groups in the Crimea, Krymchak culture, everyday life, and language had strong Crimean Tatar influences. The Crimean Tatar language became dominant between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries for political reasons, it being the language of the Crimean peninsula's Tatar political majority. Tatar was the common language used between different ethnic groups residing on the peninsula, and it also became the common language between the different Jewish groups living in the Crimea.\n\nAlthough Krymchak is often considered by modern linguists to be an ethnolect of Crimean Tatar, and for hundreds of years Krymchaks themselves considered Crimean Tatar to be their language, Krymchak has at times been labeled a unique language. For political reasons, another Crimean Jewish community, the Karaites, claimed that Krymchaks spoke a separate language. Additionally, during the time of the Soviet Union, the Krymchaks themselves claimed to have a language distinct from Crimean Tatar because association with the Tatars would have been dangerous. In their translation of a Krymchak storybook, linguists Marcel Erdal and Iala Ianbay found that Krymchak was different enough from Crimean Tatar to warrant a separate name and study.\n\nThe general switch from Krymchak to Russian began after the Russian Revolution and intensified in the 1930s. In 1897, 35% of Krymchak men and 10% of women spoke Russian. In 1926, the majority of Krymchaks considered Crimean Tatar as their native language, however the youth attending Russian schools preferred to speak the Russian language, though they usually spoke incorrectly. Neither did they have a firm command of the Krymchak language.\n\nIn 1959, 189 Krymchaks considered Crimean Tatar as their native language. This number should have been higher, however by this time there was ambiguity about the Kymchak ethnic identity and confusion about the language's name.\n\nIn 1989 only a few elders could speak Krymchak, while a significant amount of the intermediate generation could speak it somewhat. The younger generation had no knowledge of it.\n\nA 2007 estimate supposes 1,200-1,500 Krymchaks live worldwide, mainly in Israel, Russia, the Crimea, and the US. Of these, only 5-7 can speak the language.\n\nKrymchak was spoken in the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. In 1783, when Russia conquered Crimea, most Krymchaks lived in the town of Karasubazar (now Belogorsk). This continued to be their population center until World War II, though beginning in the 1880s many migrated to Simferopol. Around 1913 about 1,500 Krymchaks lived in Simferopol. A community-conducted census in 1913 shows they also lived in Kerch, Theodosia, and Sevastopol. There was also a small community in Palestine.\n\nTheir population began to decline in the twentieth century, beginning with the Russian civil war and ensuing famine. \n\nAbout 70% of the Krymchak community died during World War II. Between December 1941 and July 1942 Krymchaks, and many other Jews and other civilians, were killed throughout the Crimean peninsula by the German Einsatzgruppen. When German soldiers reached the towns in which Jewish communities resided, they murdered them en masse. After the war, the remaining Krymchak population dispersed from the Crimean peninsula.\n\nBy 1942 about one hundred Krymchak families lived in the United States, most in New York City, and they quickly integrated into the Jewish community there.\n\nIn 1979, its estimated that 1000 Krymchaks lived in the Ukraine, 600 in Russia, 200 in Georgia, and 200 in Uzbekistan. In 1974 only two Krymchak men were still living in Belogorsk, formerly Karasubazar, the community's historic center. \n\nKrymchak is designated as an indigenous language in Ukraine.\n\nThough itself considered a dialect of Crimean Tatar, Krymchak differed geographically depending on the dialect of the surrounding Tatar population.\n\nKrymchak employs the five vowels \"a o u I e.\" Their phonology contains only short vowels. They do not distinguish between front and back labial vowels, such as o / ö and u / ü.\n\nSpeakers intone words differently than speakers of Crimean Tatar. Krymchak pronunciation of Hebrew also differs from its traditional pronunciation, which was used by Crimean Karaites, another Judeo-Crimean community.\n\nKrymchak contains a significant amount of borrowed words from Hebrew. As much as 5% of vocabulary is Hebrew. One study of various Krymchak texts also shows borrowed vocabulary from Oghuz and Kypchak. Later texts show strong Russian influence, while earlier texts have many Arabic and Persian borrowings, where the use of Arabic or Persian lends a lofty style.\n\nKrymchak was written using the Hebrew alphabet. Over time new characters were created to represent sounds found in Crimean Tatar. Due to the discontinuation of literature written in Krymchak in 1936, it slowly made its way into the realm of non-written languages. Instead, the Krymchaks began utilizing the Russian Cyrillic alphabet (table 2).. \n\nThe Krymchak alphabet can be found on Omniglot.\n\nБулут къап-къара, сэн нэге давранайсынъ?\n\nНэге ачылгъан кӧклерде долашайсынъ?\n\nНэге къарартайсынъ ярых кӱнлерны?\n\nНэге йыгълатайсынъ частлы аваны?..\n\nBulut qap-qara, sän näge davranaysıñ?\n\nNäge açılğan kӧklerde dolaşaysıñ?\n\nNäge qarartaysıñ yarıh künlernı?\n\nNäge yığlataysıñ çastlı avanı?..\n\nThe last one of clouds of scattered a tempest,\n\nJust single you're flying in azure, the prettiest,\n\nJust single you're bringing the sorrowful shade,\n\nJust single you're saddening day that is glad.\n"}

The prospective first buyer and operator (i.e., a country's defense authorities and the relevant military units) gets to thoroughly test the weapons system over some protracted amount of time—in order to gain a reasonable degree of confidence as to whether the system actually performs to the agreed-upon requirements before contracts for mass production are signed. At the same time, manufacturers can use the LRIP as a production test-phase where they develop the assembly line models that would eventually be used in mass production. Therefore, the LRIP is commonly the first step in transitioning from highly customized, hand-built prototypes to the final mass-produced end product. In practice, either the production capability or the weapons system itself can be unready during the LRIP phase. This can mean that systems produced during LRIP are built significantly differently both in terms of technique and cost owing to the immaturity of the production line or changes in the weapons system's design, necessitating a large degree of hand-assembly and trial-and-error typically associated with the prototyping stage. Furthermore, the cost of each LRIP system can be much greater than the final mass production unit cost, since the LRIP cost can include both the R&D and setup cost for production, although the goal is that this additional cost is spread out over future production carried out by the assembly capacity developed during LRIP.\n\nThe term is also applied in fields other than weapons production, most commonly in non-weapon military equipment programs.\n\nImmaturity in a system's design or its method of production discovered during LRIP phase can result in additional LRIP phases to verify corrections/improvements, or project cancellation. The Congressional Budget Office has found that the United States Department of Defense rarely achieves projected cost savings because too many programs fail to move from LRIP to full-scale production.\n"}

It is also the name of one of these Azumeina people groups.\n\nThis article relates to the Marba language [mpg] spoken by the Azumeina peoples.\n\nThe Marba language is indigenous primarily to:\n\nAlternate non-preferred spellings include Maraba. Historically the language has sometimes been called Azumeina. Banana, and Ho Ho were sometimes used during the time of the French administration but have fallen into disuse. \n\nThe Marba of this article is a different topic from Marfa [mvu] and Maba [mde] which are Nilo-Saharan languages spoken in the Ouaddaï and Wadi Fira regions of Chad.\n\nMarba [mpg] is classified in the Masa languages () subgroup of the Chadic languages () branch of the Afro-Asiatic language () family.\n\nThe following people groups speak Marba and are therefore called Azumeina:\n\nEach of these people groups comprises several clans. The name of a clan is often the same as the name of the clan’s home village or township as noted in the following tables. On the internet Kolon is sometimes misspelled Kulung.\n\nMany Azumeina now live outside their traditional area. For example, there is a significant community of Marba-speaking people in N’Djaména and around Kouroup north of Koyom in the Mayo Boneye () department of Mayo-Kebbi Est ().\n\n\nThe following Musey (also spelt ) clans speak Marba but often as a subsequent language:\n\nSpoken Marba is often mixed with some Hausa and Chadian Arabic words. However, geographical variations of Marba itself are barely significant enough to be called dialects if a dialect is defined as distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation. Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation, the term accent may be preferred over dialect. There is little difference in the Marba spoken by the Marba and Kolon peoples. The differences in speech between the Marba and Kolon tribes on the one hand and the Leou tribe on the other hand are more related to pronunciation than to grammar or vocabulary. This difference affects mainly some vowels.\n\nPeople who live at the periphery of the Marba-speaking area mix Marba words with words from neighbouring languages. This occurs for example in the Musey area increasingly as one travels from Leou towards Pala, Gounou Gaya and Fianga.\n\nThe Azumeina peoples now prefer to call their language Marba.\n\nHowever, when their language began to be written down in the 1950s and 1960s, the language was sometimes called Azumeina. The Kolon and Leou clans do not see themselves as ethnically Marba i.e. they are not part of the Marba people group even though they share a common language. This approach had the advantage of avoiding ambiguity between the Marba people group and the wider group of speakers of the common language.\n\nMarba is now generally accepted by the Azumeina peoples as the name of their common language. This approach simplifies discussion about language variations in border regions because differences can be explained more easily in terms of mixing of languages. A disadvantage of this approach is the potential ambiguity of the term Marba between the Marba people group and the wider group of Marba-speaking Azumeina peoples.\n\nThe transition to the new approach is illustrated in the following timeline:\n\nThe origin of Marba is historically unknown: no ancient document explains its origin. However Christian Seignobos recorded that the Marba migrated across the Logone River at the beginning of the 20th century:\nLes migrations gumay ont été, en revanche, quelque peu bousculées par le passage du Logone, au Sud, de colonies marba et musey, toujours plus nombreuses. Au début de la période coloniale, les Marba Gogor, aprés leurs démêlés avec le chef Azina Kolon, ont en effet traversé le Logone et les Musey les ont suivis. Faisant irruption dans le \"no man’s land\" dégagé par les Kwang, alors en repli devant les Masa à Vabolo et Kunsul, Marba et Musey ont agrandi le passage entre Kwang et Masa, allant jusqu’à coloniser les abords de la piste Bongor-Gelendeng. Les fronts pionniers masa avancent moins vite que les colonies marba-musey, disposant du poney. De tradition guerrière, Marba et Musey suscitent encore la crainte. Aussi les Kwang lâchent-ils pied devant eux et gagnent de leur côté le Chari, alors que les Masa ne progressent plus dans cette région. L’interférence marba-musey avec la remontée masa a fait s’infléchir le couloir de migration de ces derniers en direction des Munjuk, au Nord, ce qui complique encore une carte ethnique déjà passablement bigarrée dans cette région de l’interfluve Chari-Logone.\nAn English translation is as follows:\nThe Gumay migrations were, however, somewhat diverted by the passage of Logone, in the South, of Marba and Musey colonies, ever more numerous. At the beginning of the colonial period, the Marba Gogor, after their separation from the chief Azina Kolon, crossed the Logone and the Musey followed them. Bursting into the \"no man's land\" cleared by the Kwang, then retreating before the Masa to Vabolo and Kunsul, the Marba and Musey expanded the gap between the Kwang and the Masa, colonising as far as the area around the Bongor-Gelendeng track. The pioneer Masa fronts advanced more slowly than Marba-Musey colonies, with the pony. Of a warrior heritage, the Marba and Musey are still feared. Also the Kwang let them walk in front of them and gained their side of the Chari, while the Masa no longer advanced in this region. The Marba-Musey interference of the rise of the Masa curbed the migration corridor of the latter in the direction of the Munjuk, to the North, further complicating an already quite patchy ethnic map in this region between the Logone and Chari rivers. \n\nCurrent legends explain the etymology of Marba in various ways as follows:\n\nGiven the practice of naming people after events, these two legends are not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the other hand, they may be more myth than legend.\n\nThe etymology of Azumeina is historically unknown.\n\nIn 1969, Robert Price wrote, “The French know this tribe as the Bananas or the Banana Marba, but the people call themselves the Azumeina. In Azumeina, Banana means ‘my male friend’, and Marba is a clan of the Azumeina! Naturally, the people want to be called by their correct name.”\n\nThe term Banana was sometimes used during the time of the French administration to refer to the Marba people group. It is derived from the Marba phrase ‘my male friend’.\n\nLegend has it that a French official asked someone what language his friend spoke. The reply, “My friend is Marba” (Banana Marba) was misunderstood to be the name of the people group.\n\nThe name Banana is not preferred.\n\n‘Ho Ho’ refers to the traditional practice of communicating over distances by shouting the sound ‘ho’ in the tone of the relevant words. The Marba language has three tones.\n\nMarba was put into writing during the 20th century by representatives of the Azumeina peoples with the support of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad, the Roman Catholic Church, the United Bible Societies, SIL and other organisations. This was seen as a means to improve life, preserve Azumeina culture and facilitate education and prosperity.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1950, several individuals had compiled word lists. For example, Johannes Lukas published information about Marba in 1937 including a list of words.\n\nIn 1959, representatives of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad published and printed the first book in the Marba language. This contained 25 hymns and some passages from the Holy Bible, namely the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, John 3:16 and Romans 3:23. The hymn book was expanded over time with several reprints.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the team for promotion and translation of the Marba language finalised an orthography based on a questionnaire that was sent to nearly 500 Marba readers. This orthography was used for the first complete books of the Holy Bible, namely Mark and Ephesians. These were published by the American Bible Society in 1967.\n\nColin Price captured his learning in his 500-page “Azumeina-English” lexicon published in 1968. Working separately, Franco Nicola published a lexicon in 1970.\n\nThe first edition of the complete New Testament was published in England by the Bible Society (UBS) in 1978, with the support of the Assemblées Chrétiennes au Tchad and the Roman Catholic Church. The Holy Bible, both Old and New Testaments, was initially prepared by the UBS Bible Society in Cameroon (Alliance Biblique du Cameroun) in 1994, but was published by the UBS Bible Society in Chad (Alliance Biblique du Tchad) in 1999.\n\nThe orthographic principles finalised in the 1960s remained generally the same up to AD 2000. They were as follows:\n\nThis orthography may be seen online.\n\nMarba has three tones. Subject to the orthographic principles above, vowels a, e, i, o and u were annotated as follows in order of precedence: dieresis ̈ for long vowels, circumflex ̂ for nasal vowels, acute ́ for high tones, grave ̀ for low tones, mid tones unmarked.\n\nThe apostrophe ' indicated:\n\nConsonants were written as noted in Table 1.\n\nQuotation marks were not used. Speech was reported; direct speech was not used. For example, He said, \"“I ate the rice.”\" was written \"He said that he ate the rice.\"\n\nFull stops, question marks, colons and semi colons were used in a similar manner to French (and English).\n\nTo be completed\n\nImplementation of Unicode in a wider range of computer software in the early 2000s facilitated use of a wider range of letters (graphemes).\n\nIn 2009 the government of Chad specified the character set for use for Chadian languages ().\n\nIn addition to the letters previously used, the sixth edition of the Marba hymn book published in 2014:\n\n\"Table 1 Orthography of consonants used prior to AD 2000 compared with the 2014 edition of the Marba song book.\"\n\nThe following tables indicate the characters known to be in use:\n\n\"Table 2 Consonant characters in use, with their Unicode numbers (U+0000)\"\n\n\"Table 3 Vowel characters is use, with their Unicode numbers (U+0000)\"\n\n\"Table 4 Vowel tonal and pronunciation marks in use, with their Unicode numbers U+0000\"\nNotes:\n\n\"Table 5 Punctuation marks in use, with their Unicode numbers U+0000\"\nIn the introduction to his lexicon, Colin Price stated that it has 3,405 entries.\n\nTo be completed\n\nMasa languages\n\nMasa (Ethnologue)\n\nMusey language\n\nMusey (Ethnologue)\n\nAjello, Roberto, M.

The language is also a lingua franca along the western coastal region of the province of North Sumatra, and is even used in parts of Aceh, where the language is called \"Aneuk Jamee\". It is also spoken in some parts of Malaysia, especially Negeri Sembilan.\n\nDue to the huge proximity between the Minangkabau language and Malay, there is some controversy regarding the relationship between the two. Some see Minangkabau as a nonstandardized dialect of Malay, while others think of Minangkabau as a proper (Malay) language.\nBesides Indonesia, Minangkabau is also spoken in Malaysia, by some descendants of migrants from the Minang-speaking region in Sumatra (\"Ranah Minang\", \"Tanah Minang\", or Land of the Minang). Significant numbers of the early migrants settled in what is now the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan; this \"Negeri Sembilan Malay\" is known as \"Bahaso Nogori / Baso Nogoghi\". More recent immigrants are known as \"Minang\".\n\nThe Minangkabau language has several dialects, sometimes differing between nearby villages (e.g. separated by a river). The dialects are Rao Mapat Tunggul, Muaro Sungai Lolo, Payakumbuh, Pangkalan-Lubuk Alai, Agam-Tanah Datar, Pancungsoal, Kotobaru, Sungai Bendung Air, and Karanganyar. In everyday communication between Minangkabau people of different regions, the Agam-Tanah Datar dialect (\"Baso Padang\" or \"Baso Urang Awak\" \"our (people's) language\") is often used and has become a kind of standard.\n\nThe Tapan language, spoken in the town of Tapan in southern West Sumatra province, is a recently discovered Malayan language which has been proposed as related to but not part of Minangkabau. Together, Tapan and Minangkabau would form a Greater Minangkabau subgroup. The two languages Tapan and Muko-Muko form a \"Lunangic\" subgroup within the \"Minangic\" (Greater Minangkabau) language group.\n\nThe Minangic subgroup is characterized by the following word-final sound changes.\n\nThe phonology and orthography of Minangkabau is listed below:\n\n\n\n"}

OpenPAS is an open-source implementation of such a probabilistic argumentation system.\n\nProbabilistic argumentation systems encounter a problem when used to determine the occurrence of Black Swan events since, by definition, those events are so improbable as to seem impossible.

{"id": "24985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24985", "title": "Pronoun", "text": "Pronoun\n\nIn linguistics and grammar, a pronoun (abbreviated ) is a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase. It is a particular case of a pro-form.\n\nPronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform. Subtypes include personal pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.\n\nThe use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. This applies especially to third-person personal pronouns and relative pronouns. For example, in the sentence \"That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat\", the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is the noun phrase \"that poor man\".\n\nThe adjective associated with \"pronoun\" is pronominal. A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in \"That's not the one I wanted\", the phrase \"the one\" (containing the prop-word \"one\") is a pronominal.\n\nPersonal pronouns may be classified by person, number, gender and case. English has three persons (first, second and third) and two numbers (singular and plural); in the third person singular there are also distinct pronoun forms for male, female and neuter gender. Principal forms are shown in the adjacent table (see also English personal pronouns).\n\nEnglish personal pronouns have two cases, \"subject\" and \"object\". Subject pronouns are used in subject position (I like to eat chips, but she does not\"). Object pronouns are used for the object of a verb or preposition (\"John likes me but not her).\n\nOther distinct forms found in some languages include:\n\nSome special uses of personal pronouns include:\n\nReflexive pronouns are used when a person or thing acts on itself, for example, \"John cut himself.\" In English they all end in \"-self\" or \"-selves\" and must refer to a noun phrase elsewhere in the same clause.\n\nReciprocal pronouns refer to a reciprocal relationship (\"each other\", \"one another\"). They must refer to a noun phrase in the same clause. An example in English is: \"They do not like each other.\" In some languages, the same forms can be used as both reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.\n\nPossessive pronouns are used to indicate possession (in a broad sense). Some occur as independent noun phrases: \"mine\", \"yours\", \"hers\", \"ours\", \"yours\", \"theirs\". An example is: \"Those clothes are mine.\" Others act as a determiner (adjective) and must accompany a noun: \"my\", \"your\", \"her\", \"our\", \"your\", \"their\", as in: \"I lost my wallet.\" (\"His\" and \"its\" can fall into either category, although \"its\" is nearly always found in the second.) Those of the second type have traditionally also been described as possessive adjectives, and in more modern terminology as possessive determiners. The term \"possessive pronoun\" is sometimes restricted to the first type. Both types replace possessive noun phrases. As an example, Their crusade to capture our attention\" could replace The advertisers' crusade to capture our attention.\"\n\nDemonstrative pronouns (in English, \"this\", \"that\" and their plurals \"these\", \"those\") often distinguish their targets by pointing or some other indication of position; for example, \"I'll take these.\" They may also be \"anaphoric\", depending on an earlier expression for context, for example, \"A kid actor would try to be all sweet, and who needs that?\"\n\nIndefinite pronouns, the largest group of pronouns, refer to one or more unspecified persons or things. One group in English includes compounds of \"some-\", \"any-\", \"every-\" and \"no-\" with \"-thing\", \"-one\" and \"-body\", for example: \"Anyone can do that.\" Another group, including \"many\", \"more\", \"both\", and \"most\", can appear alone or followed by \"of\". In addition,\n\nRelative pronouns (\"who\", \"whom\", \"whose\", \"what\", \"which\" and \"that\") refer back to people or things previously mentioned: \"People who smoke should quit now.\" They are used in relative clauses.\n\nInterrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use \"who\" (subject), \"whom\" (object) or \"whose\" (possessive); for example, \"Who did that?\" In colloquial speech, \"whom\" is generally replaced by \"who\". English non-personal interrogative pronouns (\"which\" and \"what\") have only one form.\n\nIn English and many other languages (e.g. French and Czech), the sets of relative and interrogative pronouns are nearly identical. Compare English: \"Who is that?\" (interrogative) and \"I know the woman who came\" (relative). In some other languages, interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns are frequently identical; for example, Standard Chinese 什么 \"shénme\" means \"what?\" as well as \"something\" or \"anything\".\n\nThough the personal pronouns described above are the \"contemporary\" English pronouns, older forms of \"modern\" English (as used by Shakespeare, for example) use a slightly different set of personal pronouns as shown in the table. The difference is entirely in the second person. Though one would rarely find these older forms used in literature from recent centuries, they are nevertheless considered \"modern\".\n\nThe use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. The referent of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the antecedent of the pronoun. The following sentences give examples of particular types of pronouns used with antecedents:\n\nSome other types, such as indefinite pronouns, are usually used without antecedents. Relative pronouns are used without antecedents in free relative clauses. Even third-person personal pronouns are sometimes used without antecedents (\"unprecursed\") – this applies to special uses such as dummy pronouns and generic \"they\", as well as cases where the referent is implied by the context.\n\nPronouns \"(antōnymía)\" are listed as one of eight parts of speech in \"The Art of Grammar\", a treatise on Greek grammar attributed to Dionysius Thrax and dating from the 2nd century BC. The pronoun is described there as \"a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person.\" Pronouns continued to be regarded as a part of speech in Latin grammar (the Latin term being \"pronomen\", from which the English name – through Middle French – ultimately derives), and thus in the European tradition generally.\n\nIn more modern approaches, pronouns are less likely to be considered to be a single word class, because of the many different syntactic roles that they play, as represented by the various different types of pronouns listed in the previous sections.\nCertain types of pronouns are often identical or similar in form to determiners with related meaning; some English examples are given in the table on the right. This observation has led some linguists, such as Paul Postal, to regard pronouns as determiners that have had their following noun or noun phrase deleted. (Such patterning can even be claimed for certain personal pronouns; for example, \"we\" and \"you\" might be analyzed as determiners in phrases like \"we Brits\" and \"you tennis players\".) Other linguists have taken a similar view, uniting pronouns and determiners into a single class, sometimes called \"determiner-pronoun\", or regarding determiners as a subclass of pronouns or vice versa. The distinction may be considered to be one of subcategorization or valency, rather like the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs – determiners take a noun phrase complement like transitive verbs do, while pronouns do not. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase.\n\nThe grammatical behavior of certain types of pronouns, and in particular their possible relationship with their antecedents, has been the focus of studies in binding, notably in the Chomskyan government and binding theory. In this context, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns (such as \"himself\" and \"each other\") are referred to as anaphors (in a specialized restricted sense) rather than as pronominal elements.\n\n\n\n"}

Each sound change may be shared by a number of languages; a grey background indicates no change.\n\nThe palatalized plosives and are not carried down into any of the modern families.

In Mamean they are reflected as and and in Yukatek and K'ichean as and .\n\nThe Proto-Mayan liquid is reflected as in the western languages (Chujean- Q'anjob'alan and Cholan), Huastecan and Yukatek but as in Mamean and in K'ichean and Poqom.\n\nProto-Mayan velar nasal is reflected as in the eastern branches (K'ichean Mamean), as in Q'anjob'alan, Cholan and Yukatekan, and only conserved as in Chuj and Poptí.

His work was published by Cambridge University Press and The Folio Society among other presses. Early in his life, he was a campaigner for better handwriting and in 1957 organised a survey of British handwriting which drew over 25,000 responses and was subsequently published in book form. He advocated the use of a form of italic script to replace the civil service script widely used in Britain which he thought tended to illegibility when written at speed.\n\nReginald Piggott was born in 1930. He married Marjorie. He was a long time resident of Decoy Lodge, Decoy Road, Potter Heigham, Norfolk.\n\nIn February 1957, eleven newspapers and journals published a letter from Reginald Piggott of 10 Finlay Drive, Dennistoun, Glasgow, in which he requested samples of handwriting. By far the greatest response came from readers of \"The Observer\" whose readers sent him 15,000 samples of their writing. In an article in that paper in March 1957, Piggott explained that he had been interested in the history of handwriting since he had begun to study calligraphy and that he wished to develop a \"practical, everyday cursive\" script to replace the civil service style then in use in Britain that was derived from Victorian copperplate writing but which tended to illegibility when written at speed. By gathering samples of handwriting, he hoped to develop a new style that would command widespread acceptance. He made clear that he was not a graphologist and was not offering insights into the character of the writer.\n\nPiggott envisaged a simplified script that dispensed with loops and flourishes and reduced letter forms to as fundamental a shape as possible. In a running script, joins were to be made in the simplest manner. He went on to discuss the beauty of italic script, which he used in his own writing, and the unsuitability of the ball point pen to produce it before concluding that once his research was complete \"and it is certain that the new style is near perfect\", then it could be widely adopted, leading to a great improvement in the handwriting of the nation.\n\nThe results of the survey were published in 1958 as \"Handwriting: A national survey, together with a plan for better modern handwriting\" by which time Piggott had acquired over 25,000 samples of handwriting. He analysed the results of his survey according to multiple characteristics including sex, age and occupation, and concluded with a chapter outlining a plan for better modern writing using a form of italic script. Writing in the \"New Scientist\", Gail Vines placed Piggott's research and the public's enthusiasm for the project in the context of rapid social and technological change in the 1950s that resulted in a moral panic about declining standards of penmanship that reflected a generalised anxiety about threats to standards in a changing world.\n\nPiggott's cartography was known for its clarity and elegance which was aided by his distinctive italic lettering. In 2014, the travel writer Nicholas Crane described him as \"the most brilliant book-cartographer of our generation\".\n\nHe produced numerous maps for Cambridge University Press, and had a long association with The Folio Society for whose books he produced many works, including a double page map of the spread of the Great Fire of London which was included in their volume on that subject published in 2003. He prepared the maps for \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain\" (1984) and with his wife Marjorie for volumes of Nikolaus Pevsner's \"The Buildings of England\".\n\nIn 2012, Aurum Press published \"Mile by mile London to Paris\" in which the route between the cities was mapped out by Piggott with a text by Matt Thompson, assuming a journey by the Golden Arrow, when it existed, and the Eurostar more recently.\n\n"}

This usually means the following:\n\n\nThe first two characteristics have to do with simple morphosyntax, and from them, it is quite obvious the syntactic pivot in English (and most other European languages) is called the subject. An English verb cannot lack a subject (even in the imperative mood, the subject is implied to be \"you\" and is not ambiguous or unspecified) and cannot have just a direct object and no subject; and (at least in the present tense, and for the verb \"to be\") it agrees partially with the subject.\n\nThe third point deserves an explanation. Consider the following sentence:\n\nThere are two coordinated propositions, and the second proposition lacks an explicit subject, but since the subject is the syntactic pivot, the second proposition is assumed to have the same subject as the first one. One cannot do so with a direct object (in English). The result would be ungrammatical or have a different meaning:\n\nThe syntactic pivot is a feature of the morphosyntactic alignment of the language. In nominative–accusative languages, the syntactic pivot is the so-called \"subject\" (the argument marked with the nominative case). In ergative–absolutive languages, the syntactic pivot may be the argument marked with the absolutive case but not always so since ergative languages are often not \"pure\" and show a mixed behaviour (they can have ergative morphology and accusative syntax).\n\nLanguages with a passive voice construction may resort to it to allow the default syntactic pivot to shift its semantic role (from agent to patient) in a coordinated proposition:\n\nIt is easier in English because it is secundative in passives and dative/unmarked in active and in passive with pronouns.\n\n"}
{"id": "48647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48647", "title": "Thai language", "text": "Thai language\n\nThai, Central Thai, or Ayutthaya or Siamese, () is the sole official and national language of Thailand, and the first language of the Central Thai people and vast majority of Thai of Chinese origin. It is a member of the Tai group of the Kra–Dai language family. Over half of Thai vocabulary is derived from or borrowed from Pali, Sanskrit, Mon, and Old Khmer. It is a tonal and analytic language.\n\nThai has a complex orthography and system of relational markers. Spoken Thai is mutually intelligible with Lao and Isan, fellow Southwestern Tai languages, to a significantly high degree where its speakers are able to effectively communicate each speaking their respective language. These languages are written with slightly different scripts but are linguistically similar and effectively form a dialect continuum.\n\nThai is the official language of Thailand, natively spoken by, according to Ethnologue, over 20 million people (2000). In reality, the number of native Thai speakers is likely to be much higher, since the Thai people of ethnic Chinese origins throughout the country learn it as their first language. The populations of western and eastern parts of Thailand, which had since ancient time formed the core territory of Siam, also speak central Thai as their first language. Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media. A recent research finds that the speakers of Northern Thai language (or Kham Mueang) have become so few, as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai, such that they are now using mostly central Thai words and seasoning their speech only with \"kham mueang\" accent. Standard Thai is based on Ayutthaya dialect, and register in the educated classes.\nIn addition to Central Thai, Thailand is home to other related Tai languages. Although some linguists classify these dialects as related but distinct languages, there is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these regional dialects/languages. Nonetheless, it is often claimed that the language policy of the Thai government has shaped the dominant view that these languages are only regional variants or dialects of the \"same\" Thai language, or as \"different kinds of Thai\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Thai is composed of several distinct registers, forms for different social contexts:\n\nMost Thais can speak and understand all of these contexts. Street and Elegant Thai are the basis of all conversations. Rhetorical, religious, and royal Thai are taught in schools as the national curriculum.\n\nMany scholars believe that the Thai script is derived from the Khmer script. Certainly the numbers were lifted directly from Khmer. The language and its script are closely related to the Lao language and script. Most literate Lao are able to read and understand Thai, as more than half of the Thai vocabulary, grammar, intonation, vowels and so forth are common with the Lao language.\n\nMuch like the Burmese adopted the Mon script (which also has Indic origins), the Thais adopted and modified the Khmer script to create their own writing system. While in Thai the pronunciation can largely be inferred from the script, the orthography is complex, with silent letters to preserve original spellings and many letters representing the same sound. While the oldest known inscription in the Khmer language dates from 611 CE, inscriptions in Thai writing began to appear around 1292 CE. Notable features include:\n\n\nThere is no universally applied method for transcribing Thai into the Latin alphabet. For example, the name of the main airport is transcribed variously as Suvarnabhumi, Suwannaphum, or Suwunnapoom. Guide books, textbooks and dictionaries may each follow different systems. For this reason, most language courses recommend that learners master the Thai script.\n\nOfficial standards are the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS), published by the Royal Institute of Thailand, and the almost identical defined by the International Organization for Standardization. The RTGS system is increasingly used in Thailand by central and local governments, especially for road signs. Its main drawbacks are that it does not indicate tone or vowel length. As the system is based on pronunciation, not orthography, reconstruction of Thai spelling from RTGS romanisation is not possible.\n\nThe ISO published an international standard for the transliteration of Thai into Roman script in September 2003 (ISO 11940). By adding diacritics to the Latin letters, it makes the transcription reversible, making it a true transliteration. Notably, this system is used by Google Translate, although it seems not to appear in many other contexts, such as textbooks and other instructional media. This may be because the particular problems of writing Thai for foreigners, including silent letters and placement of vowel markers, decrease the usefulness of literal transliteration.\n\nThai distinguishes three voice-onset times among plosive and affricate consonants:\n\nWhere English makes a distinction between voiced and aspirated , Thai distinguishes a third sound that is neither voiced nor aspirated, which occurs in English only as an allophone of , for example after an as in the sound of the \"p\" in \"spin\". There is similarly an alveolar , , triplet in Thai. In the velar series there is a , pair and in the postalveolar series a , pair, but the language lacks the corresponding voiced sounds and . (In loanwords from English, English and are borrowed as the tenuis stops and .)\n\nIn each cell below, the first line indicates (IPA), the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). Note also that ห, one of the two \"h\" letters, is also used to help write certain tones (described below).\n\nAlthough the overall 44 Thai consonant letters provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. For finals, only eight sounds, as well as no sound, called \"mātrā\" () are used. To demonstrate, at the end of a syllable, บ () and ด () are devoiced, becoming pronounced as and respectively. Additionally, all plosive sounds are unreleased. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.\n\nOf the consonant letters, excluding the disused ฃ and ฅ, six (ฉ ผ ฝ ห อ ฮ) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.\n\nIn Thai, each syllable in a word is considered separate from the others, so combinations of consonants from adjacent syllables are never recognised as a cluster. Thai has phonotactical constraints that define permissible syllable structure, consonant clusters, and vowel sequences. Original Thai vocabulary introduces only 11 combined consonantal patterns:\n\nThe number of clusters increases when a few more combinations are presented in loanwords such as (ทร) in (, from Sanskrit \"indrā\") or (ฟร) in (, from English \"free\"); however, it can be observed that Thai language supports only those in initial position, with either , , or as the second consonant sound and not more than two sounds at a time.\n\nThe vowel nuclei of the Thai language, which includes monophthongs and opening diphthongs, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the , the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai alphabet, where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.\n\nThe vowels each exist in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming unrelated words in Thai, but usually transliterated the same: เขา (\"khao\") means \"he\" or \"she\", while ขาว (\"khao\") means \"white\".\n\nThe long-short pairs are as follows:\n\nThere are also closing diphthongs and triphthongs in Thai, which analyze as underlyingly and . For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nThere are five phonemic tones: mid, low, falling, high, and rising, sometimes referred to in older reference works as \"rectus, gravis, circumflexus, altus,\" and \"demissus,\" respectively. The table shows an example of both the phonemic tones and their phonetic realization, in the IPA.\n\nThe full complement of tones exists only in so-called \"live syllables\", those that end in a long vowel or a sonorant ().\n\nFor \"dead syllables\", those that end in a plosive () or in a short vowel, only three tonal distinctions are possible: low, high, and falling. Because syllables analyzed as ending in a short vowel may have a final glottal stop (especially in slower speech), all \"dead syllables\" are phonetically checked, and have the reduced tonal inventory characteristic of checked syllables.\n\nIn some English loanwords, closed syllables with long vowel ending in an obstruent sound, have high tone, and closed syllables with short vowel ending in an obstruent sound have falling tone.\n\nFrom the perspective of linguistic typology, Thai can be considered to be an analytic language. The word order is subject–verb–object, although the subject is often omitted. Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.\n\nThere is no morphological distinction between adverbs and adjectives. Many words can be used in either function. They follow the word they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb.\n\nComparatives take the form \"A X กว่า B\" (\"kwa\", ), \"A is more X than B\". The superlative is expressed as \"A X ที่สุด\" (\"thi sut\", ), \"A is most X\".\n\nBecause adjectives can be used as complete predicates, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Tense below) may be used to describe adjectives.\n\nVerbs do not inflect. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any participles.\nThe passive voice is indicated by the insertion of ถูก (\"thuk\", ) before the verb. For example:\n\nTo convey the opposite sense, a sense of having an opportunity arrive, ได้ (\"dai\", , can) is used. For example:\n\nNote, \"dai\" ( and ), though both spelled ได้, convey two separate meanings. The short vowel \"dai\" () conveys an opportunity has arisen and is placed before the verb. The long vowel \"dai\" () is placed after the verb and conveys the idea that one has been given permission or one has the ability to do something. Also see the past tense below.\n\n\nNegation is indicated by placing ไม่ (\"mai\", not) before the verb.\n\nTense is conveyed by tense markers before or after the verb.\n\nTense markers are not required.\n\nThai exhibits serial verb constructions, where verbs are strung together. Some word combinations are common and may be considered set phrases.\n\nNouns are uninflected and have no gender; there are no articles.\n\nNouns are neither singular nor plural. Some specific nouns are reduplicated to form collectives: เด็ก (\"dek\", child) is often repeated as เด็ก ๆ (\"dek dek\") to refer to a group of children. The word พวก (\"phuak\", ) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (พวกผม, \"phuak phom\", , \"we\", masculine; พวกเรา \"phuak rao\", , emphasised \"we\"; พวกหมา \"phuak ma\", \"(the) dogs\"). Plurals are expressed by adding classifiers, used as measure words (ลักษณนาม), in the form of noun-number-classifier (ครูห้าคน, \"teacher five person\" for \"five teachers\"). While in English, such classifiers are usually absent (\"four chairs\") or optional (\"two bottles of beer\" \"or\" \"two beers\"), a classifier is almost always used in Thai (hence \"chair four item\" and \"beer two bottle\").\n\nSubject pronouns are often omitted, with nicknames used where English would use a pronoun. See informal and formal names for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in honorific registers, and may also make a T–V distinction in relation to kinship and social status. Specialised pronouns are used for those with royal and noble titles, and for clergy. The following are appropriate for conversational use:\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is ตัวเอง (tua eng), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an intensive pronoun, such as ตัวผมเอง (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or ตัวคุณเอง (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate possessive pronoun. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle ของ (khong). For example, \"my mother\" is แม่ของผม (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to แม่ผม (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word พวก (puak) in front of a singular pronoun as in พวกเขา (puak khao) meaning they or พวกเธอ (puak thoe) meaning the plural sense of you. The only exception to this is เรา (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of พวกเรา (puak rao), which is only plural.\n\nThai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:\n\n\nThe particles are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of intonation in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are ครับ (\"khrap\", , with a high tone) when the speaker is male, and ค่ะ (\"kha\", , with a falling tone) when the speaker is female; these can also be used to indicate an affirmative, though the ค่ะ (falling tone) is changed to a คะ (high tone).\n\nOther common particles are:\n\nAs noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word \"eat\" can be กิน (\"kin\"; common), แดก (\"daek\"; vulgar), ยัด (\"yat\"; vulgar), บริโภค (\"boriphok\"; formal), รับประทาน (\"rapprathan\"; formal), ฉัน (\"chan\"; religious), or เสวย (\"sawoei\"; royal), as illustrated below:\n\nThailand also uses the distinctive Thai six-hour clock in addition to the 24-hour clock.\n\nOther than compound words and words of foreign origin, most words are monosyllabic.\n\nChinese-language influence was strong until the 13th century when the use of Chinese characters was abandoned, and replaced by Sanskrit and Pali scripts. However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from Middle Chinese.\n\nLater most vocabulary was borrowed from Sanskrit and Pāli; Buddhist terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Old Khmer has also contributed its share, especially in regard to royal court terminology. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the English language has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms. Many Teochew Chinese words are also used, some replacing existing Thai words (for example, the names of basic numbers; see also Sino-Xenic).\nFrom Middle Chinese or Teochew Chinese.\nFrom Old Khmer.\nThe Portuguese were the first Western-nation to arrive in what is modern-day Thailand in the 16th century during the Ayutthaya period. Its influence in trade, especially weaponry, allowed them to establish a community just outside the capital and practice their faith, as well as exposing and converting the locals to Christianity. Thus, Portuguese words involving trade and religion were introduced and used by the locals.\nThai has undergone various historical sound changes. Some of the most significant changes, at least in terms of consonants and tones, occurred between Old Thai spoken when the language was first written and Thai of present, reflected in the orthography.\n\nOld Thai had a three-way tone distinction on live syllables (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those ending in a stop, i.e. either or the glottal stop which automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).\n\nThere was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all fricative and sonorant consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among stops and affricates. The maximal four-way occurred in labials () and dentals (); the three-way distinction among velars () and palatals (), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.\n\nThe major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant tone split. This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area. All voiced–voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:\nHowever, in the process of these mergers the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions. In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops). An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original ) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.\n\nThe above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai. Modern \"low\"-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology \"low\" reflects the lower tone variants that resulted. Modern \"mid\"-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai—precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3. Modern \"high\"-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops). The three most common tone \"marks\" (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed \"mai ek\" and \"mai tho\") represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then. Note also that since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured. Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern \"falling\" tone.\n\nEarly Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives as distinct phonemes. These were represented by the now-obsolete letters ฃ \"kho khuat\" and ฅ \"kho khon\", respectively. During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops , and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.\n\nAt some point in the history of Thai, a palatal nasal phoneme also existed, inherited from Proto-Tai. A letter ญ \"yo ying\" also exists, which is used to represent a palatal nasal in words borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali, and is currently pronounced at the beginning of a syllable but at the end of a syllable. Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with are also pronounced in modern Thai, but generally spelled with ย \"yo yak\", which consistently represents . This suggests that > in native words occurred in the pre-literary period. It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with were borrowed directly with a , or whether a was re-introduced, followed by a second change > .\n\nProto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as in Li Fang-Kuei (1977). Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled หย, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of (or ), but a few such words are spelled อย, which implies a pronunciation of and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.\n\nThe vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short–long pair (), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short–long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages. More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:\nFurthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai .\n\nThis leads Li to posit the following:\n\nNote that not all researchers agree with Li. Pittayaporn (2009), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel (which he describes as ), occurring only before final velar . He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.\n\nThai descends from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken cross this substantial region and their speakers as \"Yue\". Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in Tai-Kadai language family, has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the \"Song of the Yue Boatman\" (Yueren Ge 越人歌), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the 善说 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan 说苑 or 'Garden of Persuasions'. In the early 80’s the Zhuang linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to modern Zhuang. Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei’s insight but used Thai script for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms viz-à-viz the modern pronunciation. The following is a simplified interpretation of the \"Song of the Yue Boatman\" by Zhengzhang Shangfang quoted by David Holm (2013) with Thai script and Chinese glosses being omitted:\n\nBesides this classical case, various papers in historical linguistics have employed Thai for comparative purposes in studying the linguistic landscape of the ancient region of Southern China. Proto-reconstructions of some scattered non-Sinitic words found in the two ancient Chinese fictional texts, \"Mu tianzi zhuan\" 穆天子傳 (4th c. B.C.) and \"Yuejue shu\" 越絕書 (1st c. A.D.), are used to compare to Thai/Siamese and its related languages in Tai-Kadai language family in an attempt to identify the origins of those words. The following examples are cited from Wolfgang Behr's work (2002):\n\n\n“The Wú say \"yī\" for ‘good’ and \"huăn\" for ‘way’, i.e. in their titles they follow the central kingdoms, but in their names they follow their own lords.”\n\n伊 \"yī\" < MC ʔjij < OC *q(l)ij ← Siamese \"dii\", Longzhou \"dai\", Bo'ai \"nii\" Daiya \"li\", Sipsongpanna \"di\", Dehong \"li\" < proto-Tai *ʔdɛi | Sui \"ʔdaai\", Kam \"laai\", Maonan \"ʔdaai\", Mak \"ʔdaai\" < proto-Kam-Sui/proto-Kam-Tai *ʔdaai 'good'\n\n缓 [huăn] < MC hwanX < OC *wan ← Siamese \"hon\", Bo'ai \"hɔn\", Dioi \"thon\" < proto-Tai *xron| Sui \"khwən-i\", Kam \"khwən\", Maonan \"khun-i\", Mulam \"khwən-i\" < proto-Kam-Sui *khwən 'road, way' | proto-Hlai *kuun || proto-Austronesian *Zalan (Thurgood 1994:353)\n\n\n絕 \"jué\" < MC dzjwet < OC *dzot ← Siamese \"cod\" 'to record, mark' (Zhengzhang Shangfang 1999:8)\n\n\n“The Middle mountains of \"Gū\" are the mountains of the Yuè’s bronze office, the Yuè people call them ‘Bronze \"gū[gū]dú\".”\n\n「姑[沽]瀆」 gūdú < MC ku=duwk < OC *ka=lok\n\n← Siamese \"kʰau\" 'horn', Daiya \"xau\", Sipsongpanna \"xau\", Dehong \"xau\", Lü \"xău\", Dioi \"kaou\" 'mountain, hill' < proto-Tai *kʰau; Siamese \"luuk\" 'classifier for mountains', Siamese \"kʰau\"-\"luuk\" 'mountain' || \"cf.\" OC 谷 \"gǔ\" < kuwk « *k-lok/luwk < *kə-lok/yowk < *lok 'valley'\n\n\n\"...

The Thami refer to their language as \"Thangmi Kham\" or \"Thangmi Wakhe\" while the rest of Nepal refers to it as \"Thāmī\". The majority of these speakers, however, live in Nepal in their traditional homeland of Dolakhā District. In India, the Thami population is concentrated mostly in Darjeeling. The Thangmi language is written using the Devanagari script.\n\nThangmi is spoken in:\n\nEthnic Thami outside Dolakha and Sindhupalcok districts no longer speak Thangmi.\n\nThe Thangmi language seems to have many similarities with other languages in Nepal. For example, Barām, Kiranti and Newar. Studies from Konow (1909), Shafer (1966), Stein (1970), Toba (1990), van Driem (1992) and Turin demonstrate that Thangmi is closely related to the Rai and Newar languages.\n\nThangmi consists of two dialects, Dolakhā (East) and Sindhupālcok (West). They differ in terms of phonology, nominal, and verbal morphology and in lexicon. The majority of the Thangmi speaking population use the Dolakhā dialect while only a handful speak in Sindhupālcok. The Dolakhā dialect offers a more complete verbal agreement system while the Sindhupālcok dialect has a more complex nominal morphology. \nThe Thami population are people who are rich in cultural and traditions. Their language is a large part of who they are and they portray this in their cultural, mostly in music. The Nepal Tham Society (NTS) produced a handful of Thangmi songs that were recorded in 2007. The lyrics were written by Singh Bahadur Thami, Devendra Thami and Lok Bahadur Thami. Here are some examples:\n\nThe following 210-word list of five Thami dialects is from Regmi, et al. (2014).

{"id": "1402534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1402534", "title": "Tim Wise", "text": "Tim Wise\n\nTimothy Jacob Wise (born October 4, 1968) is an American anti-racism activist and writer. Since 1995, he has given speeches at over 600 college campuses across the U.S. He has trained teachers, corporate employees, non-profit organizations and law enforcement officers in methods for addressing and dismantling racism in their institutions.\n\nWise was born in Nashville, Tennessee, to Michael Julius Wise and LuCinda Anne (née McLean) Wise. His paternal grandfather was Jewish (of Russian origin), while the rest of his ancestry is northern European, including some Scottish. Wise has said that when he was about 12 years old his synagogue was attacked by white supremacists. Wise attended public schools in Nashville, graduating from Hillsboro High School in 1986. In high school he was student body vice-president and a member of one of the top high school debate teams in the United States. Wise attended college at Tulane University in New Orleans and received his B.A. there, with a major in Political Science and a minor in Latin American Studies. While a student, he was a leader in the campus anti-apartheid movement, which sought to force Tulane to divest from companies still doing business with the government of South Africa. His anti-apartheid activism was first brought to national attention in 1988, when South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu announced he would turn down an offer of an honorary degree from Tulane after Wise's group informed him of the school's ongoing investments there.\n\nAfter graduating in 1990, Wise started his work as an anti-racism activist after receiving training from the New Orleans-based People's Institute for Survival and Beyond. Wise began his anti-racism work first as a youth coordinator, and then associate director, of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, the largest of the various organizations founded for the purpose of defeating political candidate David Duke when Duke ran for U.S. Senate in 1990 and Governor of Louisiana in 1991.\n\nAfter his work campaigning against David Duke, Wise worked for a number of community-based organizations and political groups in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, including the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice, the Louisiana Injured Worker's Union and Agenda for Children, where he worked as a policy analyst and community organizer in New Orleans public housing.\n\nIn 1995, Wise began lecturing around the country on the issues of racism, criticizing white privilege (his own included) and proposing his solutions. The following year, he returned to his hometown Nashville, and he continued his work around the US, gaining a national reputation for his work in defense of affirmative action.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Wise served as an advisor to the Fisk University Race Relations Institute. Wise received the 2002 National Youth Advocacy Coalition's Social Justice Impact Award. He has appeared on numerous radio and television broadcasts, including \"The Montel Williams Show\", \"Donahue\", \"Paula Zahn NOW\", \"MSNBC Live\", and ABC's \"20/20\", arguing the case for affirmative action and to discuss the issue of white privilege and racism in America.\n\nWise argues that racism in the United States is institutionalized due to past overt racism (and its ongoing effects) along with current-day discrimination. Although he concedes that personal, overt bias is less common than in the past (or at least less openly articulated), Wise argues that existing institutions continue to foster and perpetuate white privilege, and that subtle, impersonal, and even ostensibly race-neutral policies contribute to racism and racial inequality today.\n\nIn multi-racial societies such as the U.S., Wise argues that all people (white or people of color) will have internalized various elements of racist thinking. However just because society has been conditioned this way does not mean that society is committed to racist thinking. Wise argues that members of society can challenge this conditioning and be taught to believe in equality.\n\nIn 2010, \"Utne Reader\" magazine listed Wise as one of the \"25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\".\n\nIn 2013, Wise posted a commentary on his Facebook page describing the hate mail and death threats he receives, and addressing the people who troll his site. Many commenters criticized the commentary as reflecting white privilege, and questioned his role in the discussion of race in the United States. One commenter found Wise's remarks demeaning to anti-racist work done by people of color. Two others compared Wise to Hugo Schwyzer, who was famous in feminist circles but later exposed for misogynistic attitudes. Wise posted a response on Facebook saying in part, \"I won't try and defend the tone of most of my remarks. It was inappropriate. Period. ... I fell into the same kind of vitriolic and sometimes personal attack mode that had gotten me angry in the first place. I shouldn't have. I will strive to do better.\"\n\nWise starred in a 2013 documentary entitled \"White Like Me\", based on the book by Wise of the same name.\n\nAfter living in New Orleans for ten years, Wise relocated to his native Nashville in 1996. In 1998, he married Kristy Cason. Together they have two children. Wise has referred to himself as Jewish and as an anti-Zionist Jew but does not practice Judaism.\n\n\nIn addition to books and essays Wise has produced a DVD titled \"On White Privilege: Racism, White Denial & the Costs of Inequality\" and a double-CD entitled \"The Audacity of Truth: Racism and White Denial in the Age of Obama\".\n\n\n"}
