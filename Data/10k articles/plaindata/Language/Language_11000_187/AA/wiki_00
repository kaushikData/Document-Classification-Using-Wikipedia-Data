It is closely related to languages such as Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and Magahi.\n\nAngika is not listed in the 8th schedule of the constitution of India. Nevertheless, Angika language movements have advocated its inclusion, and a submitted request is currently pending with the Government. Angika is written in the Devanagari script; although the Anga Lipi and Kaithi scripts were used historically. \nAngika shows a regular contrast for animates.\n\nAngika is mainly spoken in eastern Bihar, including Munger, Bhagalpur, and Purnia; and the Santhal Pargana area of Jharkhand. Its speakers number around 15 million people.\n\nAngika was classified as a dialect of Maithili by George A. Grierson in the \"Linguistic Survey of India\" (1903). However, the Angika speakers now assert its status as an independent language. When the proponents of the Maithili language in Bihar demanded use of Maithili-medium primary education in the early 20th century, the Angika speaking people did not support them, and instead favoured Hindi-medium education. In the 1960s and the 1970s, when the Maithili speakers demanded a separate Mithila state, the Angika and Bajjika speakers made counter-demands for recognition of their languages.\n\nMaithili proponents believe that the Government of Bihar and the pro-Hindi Bihar Rashtrabhasha Parishad promoted Angika and Bajjika as distinct languages to weaken the Maithili language movement; many of them still consider Angika to be a dialect of Maithili. People from mainly Maithil Brahmins and Karan Kayasthas castes have supported the Maithili movement, while people from various other castes in the Mithila region have projected Angika and Bajjika as their mother tongues, attempting to break away from the Maithili-based regional identity.\n\nAngika has the status of \"second state language\" in the Indian state of Jharkhand since 2018. It shares this status with 15 other languages, including Maithili.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "86260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86260", "title": "Autograph", "text": "Autograph\n\nAn autograph is a person's own signature or handwriting. The term is used particularly in connection with the collecting of autographs of celebrities; the hobby of collecting autographs is known as \"philography\".\n\nWhat might be considered the oldest \"autograph\" is a Sumerian clay table from about 3100 BC which includes the name of the scribe Gar.Ama. No ancient written autographs have been found, and the earliest one known for a major historical figure is that of El Cid from 1098.\n\n\"Autograph\" can refer to a document transcribed entirely in the handwriting of its author, as opposed to a typeset document or one written by an amanuensis or a copyist. This meaning overlaps that of \"holograph\".\n\nThe word comes from Ancient Greek , \"autós\", \"self\" and , \"gráphō\", \"write\".\n\nSome of the most popular categories of autograph subjects are presidents, military soldiers, athletes, movie stars, artists, social and religious leaders, scientists, astronauts and authors.\n\nSome collectors may specialize in specific fields (such as Nobel Prize winners) or general topics (military leaders participating in World War I) or specific documents (i.e., signers of the Charter of the United Nations; signers of the U.S. Constitution; signers of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; signers of the Charter of the European Common Union; signers of the World War II German or Japanese surrender documents).\n\nSports memorabilia signed by a whole team can often be sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nSome celebrities still enjoy signing autographs for free for fans, keeping it an interesting hobby.\n\nMany people who stand outside premieres, asking for autographs are actually professional autograph traders, who make their living or supplement their income by selling them for full profit, rather than keeping them as a personal souvenir. This is one of the main reasons why some celebrities will only distribute their signatures for a price. Joe DiMaggio was able to command more money on signing fees than he made in his playing career, though he also gave individual autographs. Bill Russell does not sign at all in public, and only sparingly at private sessions. Michael Jordan reportedly did not sign for most of his career because of safety concerns about frenzied attempts to get his signature, which is worth hundreds of dollars. Jordan has frequently signed at more peaceful events, such as golf tournaments. Pete Rose was paid to sign 30 baseballs with the inscription \"I'm sorry I bet on baseball.\" In the 1980s, actor/comedian Steve Martin carried business cards which he handed out to fans requesting an autograph; the cards read \"This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny.\"\n\nRealizing the potential profit in the sale of pop culture autographs, many dealers also would wait for hours for a celebrity to emerge from a location, present several photos for the celebrity to sign and then sell most of them. Michael Jackson's experience was typical; he often signed just a handful of autographs as he rushed from his hotel to his vehicle. Some collectors take note of which celebrities are the most gracious or the least forthcoming. Some dealers would locate a celebrity's home address and write to them repeatedly asking for autographs. The celebrities soon grew tired of the practice and limited their responses. Because of the many autographs a celebrity might sign over time, some check requests against a record of past requests. Boxer George Foreman, for instance, records the names and addresses of every person requesting an autograph to limit such abuses. Some famous people flatly refuse to autograph anything for fans, such as the actors Paul Newman and Greta Garbo, and the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh.\n\nCelebrities sometimes authorized secretaries to sign their correspondence. In the early months of World War II, U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall felt obligated to sign every condolence letter sent to the families of slain soldiers. But as the death rate increased, he was forced to assign an assistant to \"forge\" his signature to the letters. The surrogate signatures were hard to distinguish from the originals. General Douglas MacArthur rarely signed a WWII condolence letter personally and all of his letters to families were signed by one of two assistants who tried hard to duplicate his signature but the forged signatures were distinguished by an unusually high letter \"l\" and a skinny \"D\". During the early stage of the Korean War, MacArthur personally signed condolence letters. As the fatalities increased, the General began to use letters with pre-printed signatures.\n\nIn the 1952 U.S. presidential election, General Dwight D. Eisenhower often had secretaries forge his name to campaign letters and \"personally inscribed\" autographed photographs.\n\nPlayer signatures on baseballs and footballs that are actually signed by coaches and ballboys are called clubhouse signatures.\n\nSince the early 1950s almost all American presidents have had an autopen or robot machine for the automatic signing of a signature as an autograph machine for their letters, photographs, books, official documents, and even memorabilia items such as baseballs and golf balls. Some former presidents even have continued to utilize the autopen after they have left office. The Signa-Signer can even write out in ink an authentically looking handwritten message that has been typed into the machine. One book detailing the use of this machine by President John F. Kennedy (1961–63) is \"The Robot That Helped to Make a President\" by Charles Hamilton.\n\nSince the 1960s, the practice of using an autopen has spread to U.S. Cabinet members, U.S. Senators, some state governors, and many other personalities who have a high volume of correspondence with the public.\n\nAstronaut Alan Shepard acknowledged that NASA used the autopen machine to sign the astronauts' voluminous correspondence. Many large corporations also use these machines for signing business letters. One might think that autopen signatures would constantly match one another. However, even autopen signatures will eventually change as the signature drum becomes worn and thereby alters the signature. Due to these professional imitations, one must be wary of buying presidential or astronaut signatures from unknown sellers.\n\nAutograph collectors enjoy assembling signed historical documents, letters, or objects as a way of capturing a piece of history. However, forgers seek to profit by selling forged items. Sometimes just the signature has been forged, in other instances the entire document has been fabricated. Differentiating forged from authentic autographs is almost impossible for the amateur collector, but a professional may be consulted.\n\nOne method commonly seen on eBay is called \"preprinting\" by many sellers. The item is only a photocopy of an actual autographed photo, usually printed on glossy home photo paper. Since this is almost always disclosed to the buyer, some may not consider these actual forgeries. In October 2012, Chad Richard Baldwin of Gresham, Oregon, was sentenced to two years in prison for the sale of forged Babe Ruth and Beatles autographs. Mr. Baldwin is a highly skilled forger of sports memorabilia.\n\nForgers may go to great lengths to make their forgeries appear authentic. Some use blank end papers from old books upon which to write their fake signatures in an attempt to match the paper of the era in which the personality lived. They have researched ink formulations of the era that they want to replicate. One book that explores the production of impressive fake manuscripts pertaining to Mormons is \"A Gathering of Saints\" by Robert Lindsey.\n\nOne must know the era in which American presidents signed their documents. American presidents signed land grants until President Andrew Jackson (c. 1836) became bored with the time-consuming task. Since then, secretaries of the president have mimicked their masters' signatures on these documents (known as \"proxy\" signatures). Many movie stars have their secretaries sign their letters and photographs for them. When Ronald Reagan was an actor during the 1940s, he had his mother sign his name to much of his fan mail.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Jefferson Davis's wife frequently signed his name to his dictated letters due to his extensive correspondence. As she duplicated his signature so well, she usually placed a period after the signature so that he could discern her signatures from his own.\n\nAll of the Union and Confederate generals from the American Civil War have had their signatures forged. Many were faked during the 1880s, a period that included the fad of aging soldiers in collecting Civil War autographs. Most deceptions were of mere signatures on a small piece of paper, but extensively written letters were forged as well. Autograph collectors should be cautious of \"clipped signatures\". The bogus autograph is glued onto an authentic steel-engraved portrait of the subject. Some steel engravings may have reprinted the autograph of the portrayed subject; this is known as a \"facsimile autograph\", and it may appear to be real.\n\nSome personalities have used a rubber or steel hand-stamp to \"sign\" their documents. American President Andrew Johnson (c.1866) did so during his tenure as a senator prior to assuming the presidency, since his right hand was injured in a train accident. This is why his autograph as president differs from previous autographs. President Warren Harding frequently used a rubber stamp while he was a senator. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt used them, along with President Woodrow Wilson (c.1916). England's King Henry VIII and Pennsylvania colony founder William Penn used a deceiving hand stamp.\n\nJoseph Stalin had several rubber signature stamps which were used on awards and Communist party cards. Nikita Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria, the KGB Chief, used similar stamps.\n\nQuality forgeries have been made for many of Europe's past rulers. The French nobles had their \"secrétaires\" sign their documents. Many forgeries of Napoleon's (c.1800) war orders exist; he was so busy with battle concerns that he barely had enough time to sign promotion orders for generals, so his scribes applied his name to lesser documents.\n\nMany famous scientists, astronauts, Arctic explorers, musicians, poets, and literary authors have had forgeries of their epistles and signatures produced. False signatures of Charles Lindbergh were clandestinely signed onto real 1930-era airmail envelopes bought at stamp shops and then re-sold to unwary buyers; the same has occurred with Amelia Earhart and the Wright brothers. \"Mickey Mouse\" creator Walt Disney (1955) had several of his cartoonists duplicate his artistic signature on replies to children seeking his autograph. (Disney's actual autograph was distinctly different from the way it appears in his cartoons.)\n\nTexan paper currency was signed in ink by Sam Houston, though not handwritten by Houston himself.\n\nThe October 1986 \"Smithsonian\" magazine explored the \"melting timepieces\" artwork of the Spanish painter Salvador Dalí. It quoted one of his secretaries as claiming that she signed the artist's signature to postcard depictions of his paintings. Another article in the April 2005 \"Smithsonian\" noted: \"In 1965 he began selling signed sheets of otherwise blank lithograph paper for $10 a sheet. He may have signed well over 50,000 in the remaining quarter century of his life, an action that resulted in a flood of Dalí lithograph forgeries.\"\n\nSome deceivers cut pages from books that American President Richard Nixon (c.1970) signed on the blank flyleaf, typed his letter of resignation from the presidency on that signed page, and then sold the doctored item as if Nixon had personally signed a scarce copy of the historical document. This practice has expanded to include quotations from George W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Hillary Clinton, John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nForgers buy real American Revolutionary War-era documents and surreptitiously pen a famous patriot's name between other real signatures in a manuscript in hope of deceiving an unsuspecting buyer. Others will use tea or tobacco stains to brown or age their modern missives.\n\nIt has been estimated that over 80 percent of the autographed items of famous American sports players being sold over the Internet are fakes. Baseball legend Babe Ruth, for instance, has had his signature forged on old baseballs, then rubbed in dirt to make them appear to be from the 1930s.\n\nWith the recent enormous growth of autograph sellers on eBay, and the appearance of a multitude of new galleries and retailers offering expensive autographs, casual autograph collectors and one-time buyers have in many instances sought certificates of authenticity issued by the seller at the time of sale. As with any guarantee, these certificates are only as dependable as the seller issuing them, and if the seller is a fraud, then the certificate, and the possibility that the signed item could be considered worthless. Any certificate or similar issued by a seller should always include the seller's full contact details and any details of Association memberships, and these should always be double checked on the Associations website.\nIn many instances, sellers will use a professional authenticator to determine the authenticity of the material they wish to bring to market. The autograph industry is currently contentiously split between two types of authenticators: those who rely upon their professional expertise and experience personally having collected and/or sold large inventories of autographs over a period of many years such as the consultants at AutographCOA.com (ACOA), and \"forensic examiners\" who rely on academic credentials. Disputes have led to court actions, most notably gallery owner American Royal Arts vs. Beatles autograph dealer Frank Caiazzo, often used by autograph sources such as RR Auction.\n\nPotential autograph buyers uncertain of the legitimacy of the seller or authenticator may research both parties, and may check any dealer who claims membership of any association. PADA, the UACC, RACC, and AFTAL include a list of dealers on their websites. This research should not be limited to a seller's or an authenticator's website which could be prejudiced. Some dealers have been known to invent their own association, e.g. \"The Universal Manuscript Society\", to enhance their reputations.\n\nMastro Auctions, a major sports autograph auction house which used a professional authenticator, was sued by a dealer in 2006 (Bill Daniels v. Mastro Auctions, Boone County, Indiana, case #06D01-0502 -PL- 0060). Daniels said that he had bought more than 2,000 signed photographs of athletes from Mastro and claimed that the catalog incorrectly described them as all being in color and 8\" x 10\" in size. Daniels also claimed that some of the autographs on the photographs may have been fakes. He produced two dealers who he said were autograph experts, but Superior Court Judge Matthew C. Kincaid excluded their testimony saying that neither Steve Koschal nor Richard Simon \"possess sufficient skill, knowledge or experience in the fields in which they were asked to render opinions.\" The law for each state is different regarding qualifications to testify. Mr. Simon and Mr. Koschal have both testified in states where their testimony is accepted in court.\n\nUnder British law, the appearance of signatures (not the names themselves) may be protected under copyright law.\n\nUnder United States Copyright Law, \"titles, names [I c...]; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring\" are not eligible for copyright; however, the appearance of signatures (not the names themselves) may be protected under copyright law.\n\nIn autograph-auction catalogues the following abbreviations are used to help describe the type of letter or document that is being offered for sale.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5226029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5226029", "title": "Barbara Johnson", "text": "Barbara Johnson\n\nBarbara Ellen Johnson (October 4, 1947 – August 27, 2009) was an American literary critic and translator, born in Boston. She was a Professor of English and Comparative Literature and the Fredric Wertham Professor of Law and Psychiatry in Society at Harvard University. Her scholarship incorporated a variety of structuralist and poststructuralist perspectives—including deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and feminist theory—into a critical, interdisciplinary study of literature. As a scholar, teacher, and translator, Johnson helped make the theories of French philosopher Jacques Derrida accessible to English-speaking audiences in the United States at a time when they had just begun to gain recognition in France. Accordingly, she is often associated with the \"Yale School\" of academic literary criticism.\n\nBarbara Johnson Barbara was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the only daughter of Gilbert and Priscilla (James) Johnson. She graduated from Westwood High School in 1965, attended Oberlin College from 1965 to 1969, and completed a Ph.D. in French at Yale University in 1977. Her graduate studies occurred during the emergence of the \"Yale School,\" a group of literary critics that included Johnson's thesis director, Paul de Man. The Yale School's characteristic integration of structuralist and poststructuralist theory into the study of literature became an essential feature of Johnson's approach to criticism.\n\nShe was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985 for French Literature. \n\nIn her 1990 essay, \"Writing\" (in \"Critical Terms for Literary Study\"), Johnson outlines the importance of theory to analyses of literature. She argues that the history of writing (\"l'écriture\") is an important philosophical, political, and psychoanalytical concept in twentieth-century French thought. She posits French theorist Roland Barthes’ appropriation of Ferdinand de Saussure’s concept of the sign—encompassing both a \"signifier\" and a \"signified\"—as the foundation of his theory that language is a “structure,” a system of relations governed by a set of rules. Johnson then goes on to describe the central roles played by Derrida and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in destabilizing Barthes' account of the relation between signifier and signified and the “structure” of language. Following Derrida, Johnson argues that reading is not the task of grasping the true single meaning of a text, but of grasping its multiple meanings, which are often unstable and contradictory. This polysemy has allowed feminist and marginalized readers to enter texts at the locations where the author tries to \"dominate, erase, or distort\" the various \"other\" claims that are made through language and reassert their identities.\n\nIn \"The Critical Difference\" (1980), Johnson argues that any model of difference as a polarized difference “between entities (prose and poetry, man and woman, literature and theory, guilt and innocence)” is necessarily founded upon “a repression of differences within entities” (pp. x-xi). In this book, Johnson explores how the unknown and the unknowable function in a text. The “unknown” to which she refers is not something concealed or distant, but a fundamental unknowability that constitutes and underlies our linguistic cognition.\n\nIn one of the articles in \"The Critical Difference\", “Melville’s Fist: The Execution of Billy Budd,” Johnson reads Herman Melville’s novel as a performance of the irreconcilability between the “signifier” and the “signified.” She argues that if a description could perfectly describe its referent and actually “hit” its intended object (just as Billy Budd hits and kills John Claggart), the result would be the annihilation of that object. Language, thus, can only function upon imperfection, instability, and unknowability.\n\nJohnson’s next book, \"A World of Difference\" (1987), reflects a move away from the strictly canonical context of her analyses in \"The Critical Difference\". Johnson wants to take her investigation beyond “the white male Euro-American literary, philosophical, psychoanalytical, and critical canon” that dominates the academy as a whole and her work in particular (p. 2). But she also calls the “sameness” of that white Euro-American literary and critical tradition into question, undertaking a thorough interrogation of its boundaries. In addition, Johnson expands the scope of her literary subjects to include black and/or women writers, such as Zora Neale Hurston, Dorothy Dinnerstein, James Weldon Johnson, and Adrienne Rich. Her subsequent collection, \"The Feminist Difference\" (1998), offers a continued critique of the terms in play throughout feminism’s history and an examination of the differences within and between feminisms.\n\n\"The Wake of Deconstruction\" (1994) approaches the general state of deconstruction in light of the backlash it faced over the course of the 1980s and early '90s. Through the double lenses of Paul de Man’s posthumous Nazi collaboration scandal and the academic community’s reaction to the murder of feminist legal theorist Mary Joe Frug, Johnson discusses allegory, feminism, and the misinterpretation of deconstruction.\n\nIn \"Taking Fidelity Philosophically\" (in \"Difference in Translation\"), Johnson describes translation as an ultimately impossible endeavor because the \"mother\" or original language is already, intrinsically untranslatable from signifier to signified. The more one attempts to translate a work into comprehensibility, the more likely one is to stray from its original ambiguity. Jacques Derrida, with his thoughts on différance, elucidates the complicating but necessary fact of language: that it is foreign to itself. Every attempt to translate sets the language against itself, creating new tensions as it progresses. Translation, though impossible, is also necessary, as it is precisely these tensions that constitute language.\n\nThroughout her work, Johnson emphasizes both the difficulty of applying deconstruction to political action and of separating linguistic contradictions, complexities, and polysemy from political questions. In \"A World of Difference\", she makes a turn to a “real world,” but one which is always left in quotation marks—\"real,\" but nonetheless inseparable from its textual, written aspect. In a chapter of the book entitled, “Is Writerliness Conservative?” Johnson examines the political implications of undecidablility in writing, as well as the consequences of labeling the poetic and the undecidable as politically inert. She writes that, if “poetry makes nothing happen,” poetry also “makes \"nothing\" happen”—the limits of the political are themselves fraught with political implications (p. 30). Harold Schweizer writes in his introduction to \"The Wake of Deconstruction\" that “[i]f interpretive closure always violates textual indeterminacy, if authority is perhaps fundamentally non-textual, reducing to identity what should remain different, Johnson’s work could best be summarized as an attempt to delay the inevitable reductionist desire for meaning” (p. 8).\n\nIn \"Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion\" (in \"The Critical Difference\") and \"Anthropomorphism in Lyric and Law\" (in \"Persons and Things\"), Johnson discusses the recurrence of rhetorical figures of prosopopoeia (an address to a dead or absent person) and anthropomorphism (conferring human attributes on a nonhuman entity) within contemporary disputes about abortion, corporate personhood, and other debates surrounding who or what qualifies as a person. \"Apostrophe\" juxtaposes Romantic poets such as Percy Bysshe Shelley with twentieth-century poems by Gwendolyn Brooks, Lucille Clifton, and Adrienne Rich that deal with women's experiences following abortion. Johnson argues that the analogy between creative writing and giving birth, traditionally employed by male poets like Sidney and Jonson, re-appears in a distorted fashion in women's writing. Johnson's concern with prosopopoeia represents an ongoing elaboration of Paul de Man's work, extending the problems posed in his essays \"Autobiography as De-Facement\" and \"Anthropomorphism and Trope in Lyric\" (in \"The Rhetoric of Romanticism\") to feminist and African-American literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is generally filed along with the complaint. Some states use similar documents for criminal cases as well. \n\nThe purpose of a Case Information Statement is to let the judge and court clerk know what type of case is being brought by the parties, so that they can better prepare for the case to come to trial. Some courts (for example, the New Jersey Superior Court) put different types of cases on different \"tracks\", to place limits on how long discovery they should take.\n\nIf the lawyer filling out the Case Information Statement makes a mistake, or if circumstances change or new information is discovered, the party wishing to amend the statement may do so by making a motion to the judge in charge of the case.\n\nSome courts use the term Cover Sheet for this document, but the content and purpose is the same.

At that time, the party seeking judicial intervention files a RJI (which asks for information similar to a CIS or cover sheet) and files with the court all relevant documents from the party's own version of the case file. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1735184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1735184", "title": "Comity", "text": "Comity\n\nIn law, comity is \"a practice among different political entities (as countries, states, or courts of different jurisdictions)\" involving the \"mutual recognition of legislative, executive, and judicial acts.\"\n\nComity derives from the Latin \"comitas\", courtesy, from \"cemis\", friendly, courteous.\n\nThe doctrine of international comity has been described variously \"as a choice-of-law principle, a synonym for private international law, a rule of public international law, a moral obligation, expediency, courtesy, reciprocity, utility, or diplomacy. Authorities disagree as to whether comity is a rule of natural law, custom, treaty, or domestic law. Indeed, there is not even agreement that comity is a rule of law at all.\" Because the doctrine touches on many different principles, it is regarded as \"one of the more confusing doctrines evoked in cases touching upon the interests of foreign states.\"\n\nThe doctrine of international comity was created by a group of Dutch jurists in the late seventeenth century, most prominently Ulrich Huber. Huber and others sought a way to handle conflicts of law in a way that would reinforce the idea of Westphalian sovereignty. Huber wrote that comitas gentium (\"civility of nations\") required the application of foreign law in certain cases because sovereigns \"so act by way of comity that rights acquired within the limits of a government retain their force everywhere so far as they do not cause prejudice to the powers or rights of such government or of their subjects.\" Huber \"believed that comity was a principle of international law\" but also that \"the decision to apply foreign law itself was left up to the state as an act of free will.\"\n\nThe idea of comity was introduced into English law by Lord Mansfield, a Scottish barrister and jurist. Mansfield viewed the application of comity as discretionary, with courts applying foreign law \"except to the extent that it conflicted with principles of natural justice or public policy.\" Mansfield held in \"Somerset v Stewart\" (King's Bench 1772), for example, that slavery was so morally odious that a British court would not recognize the property rights of an American slaveholder in his slave.\n\nIn the United States, Louisiana attorney Samuel Livermore (who wrote the first American treatise of conflict of laws in 1828) expressly rejected the comity doctrine as formulated by Mansfield and earlier writers, instead arguing that \"courts were bound by international law to apply the same law that a foreign court would apply.\" This idea was rejected by Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court, who agreed with Mansfield and Huber in his \"Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws\". Story's view, which ultimately prevailed, was that the consensual or voluntary application of comity doctrine would foster trust among states, \"localize the effect of slavery,\" and reduce the risk of civil war.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's holding in \"Hilton v. Guyot\" (1895) that the enforcement of a foreign judgment was a matter of comity is viewed as the \"classic\" statement of comity in international law. The Court held in that case:\n\nIn the United States, certain foreign defamation judgments are not recognized under the SPEECH Act (a federal statute enacted in 2010), which supersedes the comity doctrine.

Royal Prof Ungku Abdul Aziz Ungku Abdul Hamid was instrumental in setting up the institution.\n\nIn 1957, DBP moved from Johor Bahru to Kuala Lumpur. Through \"Ordinan Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka 1959\", DBP was granted a charter with its own Board of Governors. With the charter, DBP has the power to form policies regarding the Malay language, responsible to spread the language and is able to go into book publishing business.\n\nOn 31 January 1962, DBP moved to its own building at Jalan Lapangan Terbang Lama (now Jalan Dewan Bahasa). The building's architect was Lee Yoon Thim and the prominent mural was by Ismail Mustam. Later in 1977, it opened offices in Kota Kinabalu and Kuching, taking over the role of Borneo Literature Bureau in Sarawak. Soon after that, DBP had all the books in Iban language and other Bornean languages buried. However, some books were found and rescued. It was later alleged that all the books were burnt. Initially, DBP officials insisted on publishing works in national language (Malay language) or other vernaculars. However, soon after that DBP stated that they cannot publish books in regional languages because this would be against its own policy and is not economically sound in a small market of readers.\n\nThree other offices were established in Bukit Mertajam (1999), Kota Bharu (1999) and Johor Bahru (2003).

The app has about 300 million registered users across the world.\n\nThe project was started at the end of 2009 in Pittsburgh by Carnegie Mellon University professor Luis von Ahn (creator of reCAPTCHA) and his graduate student Severin Hacker, and then developed along with Antonio Navas, Vicki Cheung, Marcel Uekermann, Brendan Meeder, Hector Villafuerte, and Jose Fuentes.\n\nInspiration for Duolingo came from two places. Luis Von Ahn wanted to create another program that served two purposes in one, what he calls a \"twofer\". Duolingo originally did this by teaching its users a foreign language while having them translate simple phrases in documents, though the translation feature has since been removed.\n\nVon Ahn was born in Guatemala and saw how expensive it was for people in his community to learn English. Severin Hacker (born in Zug, Switzerland), co-founder of Duolingo, and Von Ahn believe that \"free education will really change the world\" and wanted to supply the people an outlet to do so.\n\nThe project was originally sponsored by Luis von Ahn's MacArthur fellowship and a National Science Foundation grant. Additional funding was later received in the form of investments from Union Square Ventures and actor Ashton Kutcher's firm, A-Grade Investments.\n\nDuolingo started its private beta on November 30, 2011, and accumulated a waiting list of more than 300,000 users. On June 19, 2012, Duolingo launched for the general public. Due to popular interest, Duolingo has received many investments including a $20 million Series C round of investment led by Kleiner Caufield & Byers and a $45 million Series D round of investment led by Google Capital. Duolingo has 95 staff members, of whom many were Google employees, and operates from an office in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of East Liberty.\n\nOn November 13, 2012, Duolingo released their iOS app through the iTunes App Store. The application is a free download and is compatible with most iPhone, iPod and iPad devices. On May 29, 2013, Duolingo released their Android app, which was downloaded about a million times in the first three weeks and quickly became the #1 education app in the Google Play store. As of 2017, the company had a total funding of USD $108.3 million. Duolingo received a fifth-round $25 million in July 2017 from Drive Capital, with the funds directed toward creating initiatives such as TinyCards and Duolingo Labs.\n\nDuolingo has a freemium business model and it uses advertising in both its Android and iPhone apps. Duolingo courses include periodic advertisements which users can remove by paying a subscription fee. To earn money, Duolingo originally employed a crowd sourced business model, where the content came from organizations (such as CNN and BuzzFeed) that paid Duolingo to translate it.\n\nAs of 2017, Duolingo runs ads on both its mobile and desktop applications.\n\n, 32 courses are available to the public in English, three of which are constructed languages (including two fictional languages). Ordered by number of learners, they are:\n\nThree courses for English speakers are currently in development (ordered by progression percentage towards completion): \n\nLanguages in beta are usually not available to mobile app users. However, Hawaiian, Navajo, and Hungarian are courses released in beta that are available on the apps.\n\nDuolingo offers language courses for speakers of languages other than English, but all available languages offer at least English as a course. The Catalan and Guarani courses are exclusive to Spanish speakers.\n\nAs of November 18, 2018, the following languages are available to speakers of languages other than English:\n<nowiki></nowiki>#<nowiki></nowiki> = course still in development\n(β) = Course still in beta version\nDuolingo uses many services in the Amazon Web Services suite of products, including Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, nearly 200 virtual instances in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). The server backend is written in the programming language Python. A component called the Session Generator was rewritten in Scala by 2017. The frontend was written in Backbone.js and Mustache but is now primarily in React and Redux. Duolingo provides a single-page web application for desktop computer users and also smart phone applications on Android (both Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore), iOS App Store and Windows Phone platforms. 20% of traffic comes from desktop users and 80% from mobile app users.\n\nDuolingo is funded by Union Square Venture Partners ($3.3 million in 2011), New Enterprise Associates ($15 million), Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers ($20 million), Google Capital ($45 million), Ashton Kutcher's A-Grade Investments, and Tim Ferriss.\n\nDuolingo mimics the structure of video games in several ways in order to engage its users. There is a reward system in which users acquire \"lingots\", an in-game currency that can be spent on features such as character customizations or bonus levels. There are public leaderboards in which people can compete against their friends or see how they stack up against the rest of the world. The level system that Duolingo uses is XP (experience points), a numerical system that represents a user's skill level. Badges in Duolingo represent achievements that are earned from completing specific objectives or challenges.\n\nDuolingo provides \"Duolingo for Schools\" with features designed to allow teachers to track their students. In 2012, an effectiveness study of Duolingo was published with the authors concluding that Duolingo usage for Spanish study was more effective than classroom language learning alone, but that this effect was less for more advanced learners. One proposed reason for this is that the direct-translation method that Duolingo primarily uses is more applicable to simpler words and phrases than to complex ones; simpler ones can be translated in a more exact manner from one language to another and thus are more conducive to Duolingo's direct-translation method.\n\nIn 2013, Apple chose Duolingo as its iPhone App of the Year, the first time this honor had been awarded to an educational application. Also, Duolingo won Best Education Startup at the 2014 Crunchies, and was the most downloaded app in the Education category in Google Play in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, Duolingo was announced the 2015 award winner in Play & Learning category by Design to Improve Life. In 2018, Duolingo was named to Fast Company's list of the Most Innovative Companies to CNBC's Disruptor 50 list and one of TIME Magazine's 50 Genius Companies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12630207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12630207", "title": "En primeur", "text": "En primeur\n\nEn primeur or \"wine futures\", is a method of purchasing wines early while the wine (a vintage) is still in the barrel. This offers the customer the opportunity to invest before the wine is bottled. Payment is made at an early stage, a year or 18 months prior to the official release of a vintage. A possible advantage of buying wines \"en primeur\" is that the wines may be considerably cheaper during the \"en primeur\" period than they will be once bottled and released to the market. However, that is not guaranteed and some wines may lose value over time. Wine experts, like Tom Stevenson, recommend buying \"en primeur\" for wines with very limited quantities and will most likely not be available when they are released.\nThe wines most commonly offered \"en primeur\" are from Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rhône Valley and Port, although other regions are adopting the practice.\n\nIn the spring after a year long harvest, merchants and trade organizations will taste barrel samples of wine that are often only 6–8 months old. In the case of Bordeaux, where the final wine is often a blend of several grape varieties, the winemaker will try to craft an approximate blend to sample. The composition of the final wine may differ from the sample depending on how each barrel matures during the aging process. Based on the initial sample, the wines will be giving a preliminary \"score\" or wine rating based on the expected quality of the wine once it is bottled, released and has had time to mature.\n\nAn \"en primeur\" wine gives the owner the right to receive the respective bottles of wines once the producer has completed the maturing phase of the wine. Wine bought \"en primeur\" is often directly placed into custom-free storage holding, 'in bond'. Known as a delicate method of investment, a purchase may ultimately be deemed a loss, or there may be considerable profit. For example, the 1982 vintage of Château Latour, was sold at £250 a case \"en primeur\" in 1983, while valued in 2007 at £9,000, although the major part of this price increase occurred after bottling.\n\nEn primeur can mean the producer is able to benefit from an improved cash flow system and a guaranteed exclusive, potentially high level sale of their product. This concept has existed in Bordeaux for centuries and was only occasionally used in other areas such as Burgundy, Piedmont, Tuscany, Ribera del Duero, and Rioja. In Italy some work is being done to promote the development of an Italian \"en primeur\" market.\n\nFor the consumer, purchasing \"en primeur\" gives them the opportunity to secure wines that may have very limited quantities and be difficult to buy after they are released. As with all investments the consumer is advised to use caution. The incidents of fraud in the \"en primeur\" market have been significant both in the US and in the UK and in the wine investment sector in general, where many have queried the (lack of) requirements to set up an investment firm. In favorable vintages some classified Bordeaux estates can have nearly all of the year's inventory allocated or purchased before the wine is released. The purchase price during the \"en primeur\" period may also be lower than the price the wine will be once it is released.\n\nIn April 2009, the 2008 en primeur from Bordeaux was released, priced at 30% less (on average) when compared to the previous year. This has created a huge buying frenzy within the market and investment opportunity has grown. Subsequently, the record release prices of the 2009 and 2010 vintages tested the resolve of the En Primeur market. Failure to re-adjust prices in the following two years effectively killed demand and many who bought into the 2009s and 10s were facing losses during the following four years. However the market has now turned and buying en primeur has become attractive once more. Indeed, those who bought into top wines of the 2014 vintage are now reporting average ROI of +13.4% with the wines soon to be released in bottle.\n\n"}
{"id": "718116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718116", "title": "Eros (concept)", "text": "Eros (concept)\n\nEros ( or ; \"érōs\" \"love\" or \"desire\") is one of the four ancient Greco-Christian terms which can be rendered into English as \"love\". The other three are \"storge\", \"philia\", and \"agape\". \"Eros\" refers to \"passionate love\" or romantic love; \"storge\" to familial love; \"philia\" to friendship as a kind of love; and \"agape\" refers to \"selfless love\", or \"charity\" as it is translated in the Christian scriptures (from the Latin \"caritas\", dearness). \n\nThe term \"erotic\" is derived from \"eros\". \"Eros\" has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to \"life energy\".\n\nIn the classical world, erotic love was generally referred to as a kind of madness or \"theia mania\" (\"madness from the gods\"). This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological schema involving \"love's arrows\" or \"love darts\", the source of which was often the personified figure of Eros (or his Latin counterpart, Cupid), or another deity (such as Rumor). At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows were to arrive at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' or 'wound' his or her heart and overwhelm him/her with desire and longing (lovesickness). The image of the \"arrow's wound\" was sometimes used to create oxymorons and rhetorical antithesis concerning its pleasure and pain.\n\n\"Love at first sight\" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting, as, for example, in Phaedra's letter to Hippolytus in Ovid's \"Heroides\": \"That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones.\" At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in Paris' letter to Helen of Troy in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: \"...you were my heart's desire before you were known to me. I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound.\"\n\nWhether by \"first sight\" or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors. In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness. Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty—a \"divine curse\" which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her. Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of Artemis the huntress (and sometimes Aphrodite) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of Actaeon).\n\nThe classical conception of love's arrows was developed further by the troubadour poets of Provence during the medieval period, and became part of the European courtly love tradition. The role of a woman's eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Provençal poets, as N.E. Griffin points out:\n\nAccording to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady when encountered by those of her future lover. The love thus generated is conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it passes to take up its abode in his heart.\n\nIn some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a basilisk—a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.\n\nThese images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Boccaccio for example, in his \"Il Filostrato\", mixes the tradition of Cupid's arrow with the Provençal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: \"Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart.\"\n\nThe rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love's dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from The Fairy-Queen:\n\nIf Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment?<br>If a Bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content?<br>Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain,<br>Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain?<br>Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart,<br>That at once it both wounds me, and Tickles my Heart.\n\nThe ancient philosopher Plato developed an idealistic concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, Plato did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. \"Platonic love\" in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. This process is examined in Plato's dialogue the \"Symposium\". Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to \"remember\" beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth.\n\nEros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato's time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a daimon. \n\nIts main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it seems to give, eros continues to be a \"desire to possess\", but nevertheless it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (\"Symposium\" 200-1). For this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (\"Symposium\" 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa.\n\n[...] Nevertheless, eros remains always, for Plato, an egocentric love: it tends toward conquering and possessing the object that represents a value for man. To love the good signifies to desire to possess it forever. Love is therefore always a desire for immortality.\n\nParadoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved's \"inner\" (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.\n\nIn Freudian psychology, eros, not to be confused with libido, is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the ego. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of Thanatos (death instinct or death drive).\n\nIn his 1925 paper \"The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis\", Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the Platonic view of eros, as expressed in the Symposium, than with the common use of the word \"sex\" as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher Schopenhauer as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a \"pansexual\" tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable resistance to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood.\n\nHowever, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Freud to be \"diametrically opposed\" with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then \"falls\" downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is \"sublimated\" upward.\n\nThe philosopher and sociologist Herbert Marcuse appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work \"Eros and Civilization\".\n\nIn Carl Jung's analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is \"logos\", a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung:\nWoman's psychology is founded on the principle of \"Eros\", the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is \"Logos\". The concept of \"Eros\" could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of \"Logos\" as objective interest.\nThis gendering of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung's theory of the anima/animus syzygy of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of \"contrasexual\" (opposite-gendered) elements called the anima (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the \"anima\", which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of individuation for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one's own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the projections that initially blind the conscious ego. \"Taking back the projections\" is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.\n\nIn essence, Jung's concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for \"psychic relatedness\", a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word \"eros\" as a shorthand to designate sexuality.\n\n"}

{"id": "916105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=916105", "title": "Ingrid Jonker", "text": "Ingrid Jonker\n\nIngrid Jonker (19 September 1933 – 19 July 1965) (OIS), was a South African poet. While she wrote in Afrikaans, her poems have been widely translated into other languages. Jonker has reached iconic status in South Africa and is often called the South African Sylvia Plath, owing to the intensity of her work and the tragic course of her turbulent life.\n\nJonker was born on a farm in Douglas, Northern Cape. She was the daughter of Abraham Jonker and Beatrice Cilliers. Her parents separated before she was born, and Jonker’s mother moved back home with her two daughters. Jonker’s grandparents moved to a farm near Cape Town. Five years after the move, her grandfather died, leaving the four women destitute.\n\nIn 1943, when Ingrid was ten years old, Jonker’s mother committed suicide after her descent into depression in the years after her father had thrown his wife and children out of his life in disgrace. Jonker and her older sister Anna were then sent to Wynberg Girls’ High School in Cape Town, where she began writing poetry for the school magazine. They later moved in with their father and his third wife and their children. The two sisters were treated as outsiders, which caused a permanent rift between Jonker and her father.\n\nIngrid Jonker started writing poems when she was six years old and, by the age of sixteen, she had started a correspondence with D.J. Opperman, South African writer and poet, whose views influenced her work greatly.\n\nHer first collection of Afrikaans poems, \"Na die somer\" (“After the summer”) was produced before she was thirteen. Although several publishers were interested in her work, she was advised to wait before going into print. Her first published book of poems, \"Ontvlugting\" (“Escape”), was eventually published in 1956.\n\nIngrid Jonker married Pieter Venter in 1956, and their daughter Simone was born in 1957. The couple moved to Johannesburg, but three years later they separated. Jonker and her daughter then moved back to Cape Town.\n\nHer father, already a writer, editor and National Party Member of Parliament, was appointed chairman of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publications and entertainment. To Abraham Jonker's embarrassment, his daughter was vehemently opposed to the censorship laws he was charged with enforcing and their political differences became public. In a speech in parliament Jonker's father denied her as his daughter.\n\nDuring the same time period she had relationships with two writers, Jack Cope and André Brink. She became pregnant and had an abortion, even though abortion was illegal in South Africa at the time. The depression caused by her father's rejection of her and by her abortion forced Ingrid to enter the Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital in 1961. (Jonker's mother had died at Valkenberg several years before.)\n\nJonker's next collection of poems \"Rook en oker\" (\"Smoke and Ochre\") was published in 1963 after delays caused by her publishers. While the anthology was praised by most South African writers, poets and critics, it was given a cool reception by supporters of the ruling Party.\n\nThereafter, Ingrid Jonker became known as one of the \"Die Sestigers\", a group that also included Breyten Breytenbach, André Brink, Adam Small and Bartho Smit, who were challenging the extreme Afrikaner nationalism of the ruling National Party.\n\n\"Rook en oker\" won Jonker the £1000 \"Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel\" (Afrikaans Press-Booksellers) Literary Award, as well as a scholarship from the Anglo American Corporation. The money helped her to realize her dream of travelling to Europe, where she went to England, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal. She asked Jack Cope to accompany her, but he refused. Jonker then asked André Brink to join her. He accepted and they went to Paris and Barcelona together. During the trip Brink decided against leaving his wife for Jonker and went back to South Africa. Jonker then cut her tour short and returned to Cape Town.\n\nJonker had started writing a new collection of poems just before her death. A selection of these poems was published posthumously in the collection \"Kantelson\" (\"Toppling Sun\"). She then witnessed a shattering event; a black baby was shot and died in his mother’s arms. She underlined from Dylan Thomas; \"after the first death, there is no other\". She wrote \"Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)\" (\"The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)\").\n\nDuring the night of 19 July 1965, Ingrid Jonker went down to the beach at Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town, walked into the sea, and committed suicide by drowning.\n\nAfter Jonker's death, copyrights and control of her literary estate and papers were awarded to Jack Cope by the Master of the Court. He established the Ingrid Jonker Trust. He remained a trustee of the Trust until his death in 1991. Jonker's daughter Simone Venter is the beneficiary. Copyright is still vested in the Trust.\n\nJonker's literary papers went to the National English Literary Museum (NELM) in Grahamstown. Her sister Anna Jonker borrowed these with the intention of writing a biography on her sister. November 2005.\n\nJonker's poetry has been translated from Afrikaans into English, German, French, Dutch, Polish, Hindi and Zulu, among others. She wrote a one-act play \"n Seun na my Hart\" (\"A son after my heart\") about a mother's illusions about her handicapped son. Jonker also wrote several short stories.\n\nThe prestigious Ingrid Jonker Prize for the best debut work of Afrikaans or English poetry was instituted by her friends to honour her legacy after her burial in 1965. This yearly prize, consisting of R1000 and a medal, is awarded alternately to an Afrikaans or English poet who has published a first volume in the previous two years.\n\nNelson Mandela read her poem, \"Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)\" (\"The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)\"), in English translation, during his address at the opening of the first democratically elected Parliament on 24 May 1994.\n\nIn 2001 a documentary about Jonker was produced for Dutch television by Saskia van Schaik: \"Korreltjie niks is my dood\".\n\nIn 2002 the one-woman, interactive play by Ryk Hattingh, \"Opdrag: Ingrid Jonker\" (\"Assignment: Ingrid Jonker\"), was staged at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival starring Jana Cilliers. The play dealt with questions and comments on Jonker’s life, interwoven with her poems and other writing.\n\nIn April 2004 Jonker was posthumously awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by the South African government for \"her excellent contribution to literature and a commitment to the struggle for human rights and democracy in South Africa.\"\n\nA number of her poems have been set to music over the years, beginning with the song cycle \"Vyf liedere\" for soprano and piano by Stefans Grové (1981), and sung by such artists as Laurika Rauch, Anneli van Rooyen and Chris Chameleon.\n\nIn 2005 Chris Chameleon (known better as the lead singer of the South African band Boo!) released the album \"Ek Herhaal Jou\" (\"I Repeat You\"), which consisted of a number of Jonker's poems that he had set to music. The release coincided with the 40th anniversary of Jonker's death. Some of Jonker's poems that inspired Chameleon's songs are \"Bitterbessie Dagbreek\" (\"Bitterberry Daybreak\"), \"Lied van die gebreekte Riete\" (\"Song of the Broken Reeds\") and \"Ontvlugting\" (\"Escape\").\n\nIn 2007 a documentary \"Ingrid Jonker, her Lives and Time\" by Mozambique-born South African film and documentary maker Helena Nogueira was released in South Africa. Hailed as the definitive work on Jonker this is the first literary documentary to receive theatrical release in South Africa.\n\nAlso, in 2007 work was already underway on a feature film about Ingrid Jonker with the working title \"All that Breaks\". Based on a script by Helena Nogueira workshopped at Johannesburg's Market Theatre, the film focusses on three years in the life of Jonker and the \"Sestigers\" who gathered around poet Uys Krige at Clifton in Cape Town. The film is produced by David Parfitt (\"Shakespeare in Love\"), Charles Moore (\"Schindler's List\") and Shan Moodley and is directed by Nogueira.\n\nIn 2011, Dutch actress Carice van Houten played Ingrid Jonker in the biopic \"Black Butterflies\", directed by Paula van der Oest. The film also starred Irish actor Liam Cunningham as Jack Cope and Rutger Hauer as Abraham Jonker. Despite being a fully Dutch production about a poet who spoke and wrote in Afrikaans, \"Black Butterflies\" was filmed entirely in English.\n\nAlso in 2011, South African musician Chris Chameleon released an album of Jonker's works, entitled \"As Jy Weer Skryf\" (\"If You Write Again\").\n\nIn 2012, Nicola Haskins choreographered a dance drama which told the life story of Jonker for the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and then later to be performed at various venues including the University of Pretoria.\n\nJonker's biographer is Petrovna Metelerkamp, who published \"Ingrid Jonker – Beeld van 'n digterslewe\" (\"Ingrid Jonker – Image of a Poet's Life\") in 2003. This book contains new insights into the poet's life, and includes love letters (some unsent) and an as yet unpublished account of the night of Jonker's death by her friend, Bonnie Davidtsz. The proceeds of the book are said to assist Simone Venter (Jonker's daughter) financially. An English, updated version of this biography appeared in 2012: \"Ingrid Jonker - A Poet's Life\".\n\n"}

He learned Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Sanskrit and many other subjects including astronomy, astrology, history etc. In his last years, he was invited to Wardha by Seth Jamnalal Bajaj. He died on 14 August 1941 in Wardha.\n\nBarahath worked to awaken the people of Rajasthan, mostly the Kshatriyas, against British rule by education and organising them. Later he supported and helped the Indian freedom fighters by weapons. In 1903 he had written \"Chetavani ra Chugatiya\" of 13 couplets, to stop the Udaipur State king Fateh Singh to participate in the meeting called by British Viceroy Lord Curzon.

It is often regarded as a verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders. The use of the term \"meh\" shows that the speaker is apathetic, uninterested, or indifferent to the question or subject at hand. It is occasionally used as an adjective, meaning something is mediocre or unremarkable.\n\n\"Meh\" is popularly used as a catch-all answer to any question. It is acceptably interchangeable with most responses.\nAlso considered a non-committal response, \"meh\" can be used when disregarding a question or to refer to something they have no opinion or emotions about. In expressing an opinion, it means the speaker's opinion is that of apathy. However, some may respond with \"meh\" simply to avoid creating an opinion on the matter at all.\n\nThe origin is unknown. Some have speculated that the term's origin is Yiddish because of its similarity to the interjection \"feh\", which appears in the 1936 Yiddish song Yidl Mitn Fidl. In Alexander Harkavy's \"Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary\" the word is treated as a bleating or baa sound. \"Hooray for Yiddish\", by Leo Rosten uses the word \"mnyeh\", which is speculated to be an early variant of \"meh\".\n\nAs early as 1992, \"meh\" appeared in a Usenet posting in a discussion referring to the television series \"Melrose Place\".\n\n\"Meh\"s popularity surged after its use on the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". It was first used in the 1994 episode \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", when a librarian reacts to Lisa's surprise that voting records are not classified. It also appeared later in \"Lisa's Wedding\" after Marge weaves the words \"Hi Bart\" on a loom to try to pique her son's interest in weaving, to which he responds \"meh\". In the 2001 episode \"Hungry, Hungry Homer\", Lisa spells out the word for emphasis (\"M-E-H\"), after Homer tries to interest her (Lisa) and Bart into going to the theme park \"Blockoland\". American lexicographer Benjamin Zimmer wrote in 2006, \"Whatever Yiddish origins the interjection might have had, they have been lost in post-\"Simpsons\" usage.\" Zimmer contacted \"Simpsons\" writer John Swartzwelder, who was responsible for \"Hungry Hungry Homer,\" who said \"I had originally heard the word from an advertising writer named Howie Krakow back in 1970 or 1971 who insisted it was the funniest word in the world.\" Zimmer also contacted the writers of the other two episodes but they could not remember where they had heard the word.\n\nLexicographer Grant Barrett wrote about \"meh\" and \"d'oh\", another \"Simpsons\" catchphrase: \"I suspect they're both just transcribed versions of oral speech, which has any number of single-syllable sounds that mean a variety of things.\"\n\nEven mainstream publications have adopted usage of \"meh\". The word's first mainstream print usage occurred in Canadian newspaper the \"Edmonton Sun\" in 2003: \"Ryan Opray got voted off \"Survivor.\" Meh\". In December 2009, \"meh\" was included in the \"BBC News Online\" list of 20 words which defined the decade. On October 14, 2013 \"ABC News\" posted on their website under headlines: \"US Government Shuts Down, World Says, 'Meh.\"' \"The New York Times's\" \"The One Page Magazine\" now features a \"meh\" list.\n\nA daily deals website from Matt Rutledge called meh.com debuted on July 9, 2014. Rutledge paid $100,000 for the meh.com domain in June 2014.\n\nIn November 2008, the word was added to the \"Collins English Dictionary\", a British publication published by HarperCollins. Cormac McKeown, senior editor for Collins dictionaries, said:\n\n\"This is a new interjection from the US that seems to have inveigled its way into common speech over here\".\n\n\"It was actually spelled out in \"The Simpsons\" when Homer is trying to pry the kids away from the TV with a suggestion for a day trip. They both just reply 'meh' and keep watching TV; he asks again and Lisa says 'We said MEH! M-E-H, meh?!' \"\n\nSam Leith, writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\", described the addition of the word, following suggestions received from the public, as a \"gimmick\", before concluding it was a \"useful\" word.\n\nHarper Collins' definition of \"meh\" included a \"real example\" of usage:\n\nWhen complaints arose over this choice of example, Harper Collins' lexicographer Cormac McKeown, who chose the election reference, insisted that he meant \"no slight to Canada\".\n\n"}

On 3 January 1964, Kim Il-sung issued his teachings on \"A Number of Issues on the Development of the Korean language\" ( \"Josŏnŏrŭl Paljŏn Siki'gi Wihan Myŏt' Kaji Munje\"), and on 14 May 1966 on the topic \"In Rightly Advancing the National Characteristics of the Korean language\" ( \"Josŏnŏŭi Minjokchŏk T'ŭksŏngŭl Olge Sallyŏ Nagal Te Taehayŏ\"), from which the \"Standard Korean Language\" ( \"Josŏnmalgyubŏmjip\") rules followed in the same year, issued by the National Language Revision Committee that was directly under the control of the cabinet. From then on, more important differences came about between the standard language in the North and the South. In 1987, North Korea revised the aforementioned rules further, and these have remained in use until today. In addition, the rules for spacing were separately laid out in the \"Standard Spacing Rules in Writing Korean\" ( \"Josŏnmal Ttŭiyŏssŭgigyubŏm\") in 2000 but have since been superseded by \"Rules for Spacing in Writing Korean\" ( \"Ttŭiyŏssŭgigyujŏng\"), issued in 2003.\n\nSouth Korea continued to use the ' as defined in 1933, until its amendment \"Korean Orthography\" ( '), together with \"Standard Language Regulations\" (), were issued in 1988, which remain in use today.\n\nAs with the Korean phonology article, this article uses IPA symbols in pipes for morphophonemics, slashes for phonemes, and brackets for allophones. Pan-Korean romanized words are largely in Revised Romanization, and North Korean-specific romanized words are largely in McCune-Reischauer. Also, for the sake of consistency, this article also phonetically transcribes as for pan-Korean and South-specific phonology, and as for North-specific phonology.\n\nThe same hangul (\"Chosŏn'gŭl\") letters are used to write the language in the North and the South. However, in the North, the stroke that distinguishes ㅌ from ㄷ is written above rather than inside the letter as in the South.\n\nIn the South, the vowel digraphs and trigraphs ㅐ , ㅒ , ㅔ , ㅖ , ㅘ , ㅙ , ㅚ , ㅝ , ㅞ , ㅟ , ㅢ and the consonant digraphs ㄲ , ㄸ , ㅃ , ㅆ , ㅉ are not treated as separate letters, whereas in the North they are.\nSome letters and digraphs have different names in the North and in the South.\n\nThe names used in the South are the ones found in the \"Hunmongjahoe\" (, 訓蒙字會, published 1527). The names used in the North are formed mechanically with the pattern \"letter + 이 + 으 + letter\". Also for the tensed consonants, in the South, they are called \"double\" (쌍- ) consonants, while in the North, they are called \"strong\" (된- ) consonants.\n\n\nIn the North, consonant vowel digraphs are treated as letters in their own right and are ordered after the end of the simple consonant and vowel letters. In the South, the digraphs come between the basic letters. For example, after comes the diphthong , the combination of and ; or after come the diphthongs , and , which begin with , and so on. Also, the consonant letter ( and ) is placed between and in the North when pronounced , but after all consonants (after ) when used as a placeholder indicating a null initial consonant (for syllables that begin with a vowel).\n\nThe standard languages in the North and the South share the same types and the same number of phonemes, but there are some differences in the actual pronunciations. The South Korean standard pronunciation is based on the dialect as spoken in Seoul, and the North Korean standard pronunciation is based on the dialect as spoken in Pyongyang.\n\nThe following differences are recognised in the consonants. In the Seoul dialect, ㅈ, ㅊ and ㅉ are typically pronounced with alveolo-palatal affricates , , . In the Pyongyang dialect, they are typically pronounced with alveolar affricates , , . Also, and can be pronounced without palatalisation as and in the Pyongyang dialect.\n\nIn Sino-Korean words, some of and all of that come in the beginning of a word are dropped in pronunciation and not written out in the South, but all initial and are written out in the North. For instance, the common last name 이 (often written out in English as Lee, seemingly staying true to the North Korean typography and pronunciation), is written and pronounced as 리 in North Korean. Furthermore, the South Korean word 여자 , meaning woman, is similarly written as 녀자 in North Korea. But as this latter pronunciation was artificially crafted in the 1960s, it is common for older speakers to be unable to pronounce initial and properly, thus pronouncing such words in the same way as they are pronounced in the South.\n\nThe liquid consonant does not come after the nasal consonants and . In this position, is pronounced as rather than . But in North Korea, before vowels , , , and can remain in this context.\n\nThe following differences are recognised in the vowels. The vowel ㅓ is not as rounded in the Seoul dialect as it is in the Pyongyang dialect. If expressed in IPA, it would be or for the one in Seoul dialect and for the one in Pyongyang dialect. Due to this roundedness, speakers of the Seoul dialect would find that ㅓ as pronounced by speakers of the Pyongyang dialect sounds close to the vowel ㅗ . Additionally, the difference between the vowels and is slowly diminishing amongst the younger speakers of the Seoul dialect. It is not well known if this is also happening with the Pyongyang dialect.\n\nThe pitch patterns in the Pyongyang and Seoul dialects differ, but there has been little research in detail. On the other hand, in the \"Chosŏnmal Taesajŏn\" (조선말대사전), published in 1992, where the pitches for certain words are shown in a three-pitch system, a word such as 꾀꼬리 ( – Korean nightingale) is marked as having pitch \"232\" (where \"2\" is low and \"3\" is high), from which one can see some difference in pitch patterns from the Seoul dialect.\n\nIn words in which the word stem ends in ㅣ , ㅐ , ㅔ , ㅚ , ㅟ , ㅢ , in forms where -어 is appended to these endings in the South, but -여 is instead appended in the North. In actual pronunciation, however, the sound often accompanies the pronunciation of such words, even in the South.\n\nIn the South, when the word root of a ㅂ-irregular inflected word has two or more syllables (for example, 고맙다 \"gomapda\"), the ㅂ is dropped and replaced with 우 in the next syllable. When conjugated to the polite speech level, the ㅂ-irregular stem resyllabifies with the 어요 \"-eoyo\" conjugation to form 워요 \"-woyo\" (as in 고맙다 \"gomapda\" → 고마우 \"gomau\" → 고마워요 \"gomaweoyo\"), appearing to ignore vowel harmony. ㅂ is not replaced with 우 in the North (as it also was in the South before the 1988 \"Hangeul Matchumbeop\"). The vowel harmony is kept in both the South and the North if the word root has only one syllable (for example, 돕다 \"topta\"/\"dopda\").\n\nIn word endings where the final consonant is ㄹ , where the South spells -ㄹ까 and -ㄹ쏘냐 to indicate the tensed consonants, in the North these are spelled -ㄹ가 ，-ㄹ소냐 instead. These etymologically are formed by attaching to the adnominal form (관형사형 \"gwanhyeongjahyeong\") that ends in ㄹ, and in the North, the tensed consonants are denoted with normal consonants. Also, the word ending -ㄹ게 used to be spelt -ㄹ께 in the South, but has since been changed in the \"Hangeul Matchumbeop\" of 1988, and is now spelt -ㄹ게 just like in the North.\n\nInitial ㄴ / ㄹ appearing in Sino-Korean words are kept in the North. In the South, in Sino-Korean words that begin with ㄹ which is followed by the vowel sound or the semivowel sound (when ㄹ is followed by one of ㅣ , ㅑ , ㅕ , ㅖ , ㅛ and ㅠ ), ㄹ is replaced by ㅇ ; when this ㄹ is followed by other vowels it is replaced by ㄴ . In the North, the initial ㄹ is kept.\n\nSimilarly, in Sino-Korean words that begin with ㄴ and is followed by the vowel sound or the semi-vowel sound (when ㄴ is followed by one of , , and ), in the South, this ㄴ is replaced by ㅇ , but this remains unchanged in the North.\n\nThese are thus pronounced as written in the North as ㄴ and ㄹ . However, even in the South, sometimes in order to disambiguate the surnames 유 ( \"Yu\" ) and 임 ( \"Im\" ) from 유 ( \"Yu\" ) and 임 ( \"Im\" ), the former may be written or pronounced as 류 \"Ryu\" () and 림 \"Rim\" ().\n\nWhere a Hanja is written or in the South, this is written , in the North (but even in the South, these are pronounced , ).\n\nSome hanja characters are pronounced differently.\n\nAlso in the North, the hanja is usually pronounced as \"su\" , except in the word /원쑤 \"wŏnssu\" (\"enemy\"), where it is pronounced as \"ssu\" . It is thought that this is to avoid the word becoming a homonym with (\"military general\"), written as \"wŏnsu\" .\n\nWhen forming compound words from uninflected words, where the so-called \"sai siot\" is inserted in the South: this is left out in the North, but the pronunciation is the same as in the South.\n\nWhile the general rule is to write out the word stem from which the compound word is formed in its original form, but in cases where the etymological origin is no longer remembered, this is no longer written in original form. This happens both in the North and in the South. However, whether a compound word is seen to have its etymological origin forgotten or not is seen differently by different people:\n\nIn the first example, in the South, the part shows that the etymological origin is forgotten, and the word is written as pronounced as \"olbareuda\", but in the North, the first part is seen to come from \"olt'a\" and thus the whole word is written \"olbarŭda\" (pronounced the same as in the South). Conversely, in the second example, the South spelling catches the word as the combination of \"beot\" and \"kkot\", but in the North, this is no longer recognised and thus the word is written as pronounced as \"pŏtkkot\".\n\nIn the South, the rules of spacing are not very clearcut, but in the North, these are very precise. In general, compared to the North, the writing in the South tends to include more spacing. One likely explanation is that the North remains closer to the Sinitic orthographical heritage, where spacing is less of an issue than with a syllabary or alphabet such as Hangul. The main differences are indicated below.\n\nBefore bound nouns (North: 불완전명사: \"purwanjŏn myŏngsa\"/ \"incomplete nouns\"; South: 의존 명사: \"uijon myeongsa\"/ \"dependent nouns\"), a space is added in the South but not in the North. This applies to counter words also, but the space is sometimes allowed to be omitted in the South.\n\nBefore auxiliaries, a space is inserted in the South but not in the North. Depending on the situation, however, the space may be omitted in the South.\n\nIn the above, in the rules of the South, auxiliaries coming after or an adnominal form allow the space before them to be omitted, but the space after cannot be omitted.\n\nWords formed from two or more words that indicate a single concept in principle are written with spaces in the South and without spaces in the North like Japanese and Chinese.\n\nNote that since the spacing rules in the South are often unknown, not followed, or optional, spellings vary from place to place. For example, taking the word \"gugeo sajeon\", people who see this as two words will add a space, and people who see this as one word will write it without a space. Thus, the spacing depends on how one views what \"one word\" consists of, and so, while spacing is standardised in the South, in reality the standard does not matter much.\n\nIn the North, names of leaders ' (Kim Il-sung), ' (Kim Jong-il) and (Kim Jong-un) are always set off from surrounding text, typically by bolding the characters, increasing the font size, or both.\n\nThe standard language in the South (표준어/ \"pyojuneo\") is largely based on the Seoul dialect, and the standard language (문화어/ \"munhwaŏ\") in the North is largely based on the Pyongyang dialect. However, both in the North and in the South, the vocabulary and forms of the standard language come from \"Sajeonghan Joseoneo Pyojunmal Mo-eum\" 사정한 조선어 표준말 모음 published by the Korean Language Society in 1936, and so there is very little difference in the basic vocabulary between the standard languages used in the North and the South. Nevertheless, due to the difference in political systems and social structure, each country is constantly adding different words to its vocabulary.\n\nThe word \"tongmu\"/\"dongmu\" that is used to mean \"friend\" in the North was originally used across the whole of Korea, but after the division of Korea, North Korea began to use it as a translation of the Russian term товарищ (friend, comrade), and since then, the word has come to mean \"comrade\" in the South as well and has fallen out of use there.\n\nSouth Korea has borrowed a lot of English words, but North Korea has borrowed a number of Russian words, and there are numerous differences in words used between the two coming from these different borrowings. Even when the same English word is borrowed, how this word is transliterated into Korean may differ between the North and the South, resulting in different words being adapted into the corresponding standard languages. For names of other nations and their places, the principle is to base the transliteration on the English word in the South and to base the transliteration on the word in the original language in the North.\n\nThe other differences between the standard languages in the North and in the South are thought to be caused by the differences between the Seoul and Pyongyang dialects.\n\nWords like \"gangnaeng-i\" and \"u\" are also sometimes heard in various dialects in South Korea.\n\nThere are also some words that exist only in the North. The verb \"masŭda\" (to break) and its passive form \"masajida\" (to be broken) have no exactly corresponding words in the South.\n\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics, the two Korean countries decided to play jointly for the Korea women's national ice hockey team. This led to issues with the South Korean athletes communicating with the North Korean athletes since the former uses English-influenced words in their postwar vocabulary, especially for hockey, while the latter uses only Korean-inspired words for their postwar vocabulary.\n\nThe language differences also pose challenges for researchers and for the tens of thousands of people who have defected from the North to the South since the Korean War. The defectors face difficulty because they lack vocabulary, use differing accents, or have not culturally assimilated yet so may not understand jokes or references to pop culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "36153626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36153626", "title": "Peruvian Spanish", "text": "Peruvian Spanish\n\nPeruvian Spanish is a family of dialects of the Spanish language that have been spoken in Peru since 1532. There are four varieties spoken in the country, by about 80% of the population. The four Peruvian dialects are Andean Spanish; Peruvian Coast Spanish; Andean-Costal Spanish or \"neolimeño;\" and Amazonic Spanish.\n\nThe Spanish language first arrived in what today is Peru in 1532. During colonial and early republican times, the Spanish spoken colloquially in the coast and in the cities of the highland possessed strong local features, but as a result of dialect leveling in favor of the standard language, the language of urban Peruvians today is more or less uniform in pronunciation throughout most of the country. Vestiges of the older dialect of the coast can be found in the speech of black Peruvians, which retains Andalusian features such as the aspiration or deletion of final /s/ and the deletion of final /r/. The dialect of Arequipa, Loncco, in its pure form is now extinct, although some elders are familiar with it.\n\nThroughout most of the highland, Quechua continued to be the language of the majority until the mid 20th century. Mass migration (rural exodus) into Lima starting in the 1940s, and into other major cities and regional capitals later on, accompanied by discrimination and the growth of mass media, have reconfigured the linguistic demography of the country in favor of Spanish. The poor urban masses originating in this migration adopted the standardized dialect spoken in the cities, however with traces of Andean pronunciation and a simplified syntax.\n\nAndean Spanish the most common dialect in the Andes (more marked in rural areas) and has many similarities with the \"standard\" dialect of Ecuador and Bolivia.\n\nThe phonology of Andean Peruvian Spanish is distinguished by its slow time and unique rhythm (grave accent), assibilation of and , and an apparent confusion of the vowels with and with . (In reality, they are producing a sound between /e/ and /i/, and between /o/ and /u/.) Furthermore, the \"s\" (originally apical and without aspiration) is produced with more force than that of the coast; this is also generally true of the other consonants, at the loss of the vowels. Other distinctive features are the preservation of , sometimes hypercorrective realization of as , and the realization of velar plosives as a fricative .\n\nThe morphosyntactic characteristics are typical:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastal Spanish is spoken throughout the coast. It has the reputation (in pronunciation) of being one of the \"purest\" dialects in all of coastal Latin America because it does not debuccalize between vowels and retains the fricatives and . It is the characteristic dialect as perceived abroad and has the reputation of being the base of \"normal\" or standard Peruvian Spanish.\n\n\nGeneral Spanish phrases from the Americas are common but there are also phrases that originate in the Lima coastal area, such as frequent traditional terms and expressions; the most ingrained \"quechuaism\" in common speech is the familiar \"calato\", meaning \"naked\".\n\nBorn in the most recent 30–50 years with a mixture of the speech of Andean migrants and the speech of Lima. This dialect is the speech that is most typical of Peru.\n\nThis dialect has the usual Andean syntactics, like lack of agreement in gender and number, the frequent use of diminutives or augmentatives, loísmo, double possessives and ending phrases with \"\"pues\", \"pe\" or \"pue\"\".\n\nAs far as the lexicon is concerned, there are numerous neologisms, influences from Quechua, and slang among the youth often heard in the streets.\n\nThis dialect has developed uniquely, with contact from Andean Spanish and the Spanish of Lima with the Amazonian languages. It has a distinctive tonal structure.\n\nPhonetically it is characterized by:\n\nOn the other hand, the syntactic order most recognized is the prefixation of the genitive:\n\nThere are also disorders of agreement, gender, etc.\n\nThis dialect is spoken in the region of Tumbes.\n"}
{"id": "22392901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22392901", "title": "Romagnol dialect", "text": "Romagnol dialect\n\nRomagnol (also known as \"Rumagnol\") is a group of closely related dialects of the Emilian-Romagnol language spoken in the historical region of Romagna, which is today in the south-eastern part of Emilia-Romagna. The name itself is derived from the Lombard name for the region \"Romania\". It is also spoken outside the region, particularly in the neighboring province of Pesaro-Urbino (part of the Marche region) and in the independent country of San Marino. It is classified as a threatened language, due to older generations having “neglected to pass on the dialect as a native tongue to the next generation”.\n\nWhile contemporaneous with modern Standard Italian, it is technically a member of the Gallo-Italic branch and more comparable to the “northern group” of Italian dialects. This includes the dialects Emilian, Ligurian, Lombard, and Piedmontese. It is sometimes considered a subdialect of a larger Emilian-Romagnol language, which encompasses a broad continuum of dialects spanning the region of Emilia-Romagna.\n\nWest of Romagna, the Emilian language is spoken. The border with Emilian-speaking areas is the Sillaro river, which runs 25 km east from Bologna to the west of (Castel San Pietro Terme). Emilian is spoken, to the east, in Imola, the language is Romagnol. In Emilia-Romagna, Emilian is spoken in all the rest of the region moving from the Sillaro river to the west, up to Piacenza.\n\nThe Reno River is the border between Romagnol and the dialect of Ferrara. Romagnol is spoken also in some villages northwards of the Reno River, such as Argenta, Emilia–Romagna and Filo, where people of Romagnol origin live alongside people of Ferrarese origin. Ferrara goes into Emilian language territory.\n\nOutside Emilia-Romagna, Romagnol is spoken in the Republic of San Marino (\"Sammarinese\"), in the Marecchia Valley, in the Conca Valley (Montefeltro) and in all of the Pesaro e Urbino province.\n\nRomagnol's first acknowledgement outside regional literature was in Dante Alighieri’s treatise \"De vulgari eloquentia\", wherein Dante compares “the language of Romagna” to his native Tuscan dialect. Eventually, in 1629, the author Adriano Banchieri wrote the treatise \"Discorso della lingua Bolognese\", which countered Dante’s claim that the Tuscan dialect was better, arguing his belief that Bolognese (a subdialect of Romagnol that saw wide use in writing) was superior in “naturalness, softness, musicality, and usefulness.” Romagnol received more recognition after Romagna gained independence from the Papal States.\n\nThere is also a large repertoire of folklore legends, myths, and fables in Romagnol, due to its role in local geopolitical history (e.g. Caesar crossing the Rubicon and Theodoric’s conquest and subsequent rule of the Ostrogothic Kingdom). Romagna’s geographic diversity was home to a variety of lifestyles and trade backgrounds, such as “the mountaineers of the Alps, the fisherman of the Adriatic, the farmers of the plains, and the city folk,” which in turn, allowed for a large range of topics and themes present in the literature. Darker themes, such as poverty and pessimism, are also known to be common subjects of Romagnol poetry, fables, and prose.\n\nThe first appearance of a distinct Romagnol literary work is \"Sonetto romagnolo\" by Bernardino Catti, from Ravenna, printed 1502. It is written in a mixture of Italian and Romagnol.\n\nThe first Romagnol poem dates back to the end of 16th century: \"E Pvlon matt. Cantlena aroica\" (Mad Nap), a mock-heroic poem based on Orlando Furioso and written by an anonymous author from . The original poem comprised twelve cantos, of which only the first four survived (1848 lines).\n\nThe first Romagnol poet to win fame was the cleric Pietro Santoni, (Fusignano, 1736–1823). He was the teacher of Vincenzo Monti, one of the most famous Italian poets of his time.\n\nIn 1840 the first Romagnol-Italian Dictionary was published by , printed in Faenza.\n\nThe 20th century saw a flourishing of Romagnol literature. Theatrical plays, poems and books of a high quality were produced. Some of the best known Romagnol authors are:\n\nUnlike Standard Italian, not all nouns end in a theme vowel. Masculine nouns lack theme vowels and feminine nouns typically (but not always) terminate in \"a.\" To form plurals, masculine nouns and adjectives undergo lexically-specified ablaut. In the case of feminine nouns and adjectives, \"a\" becomes \"i\" or deletes if after a consonant cluster or double consonant.\n\nThough both languages derive their lexicon from Vulgar Latin, some words differ in gender.\nItalian and Romagnol share much of the same features when it comes to verbs. Both languages are SVO in simple sentences. Verbs are conjugated according to tense, mood, and person. Romagnol also has 4 conjugations compared to Italian's 3: the 1st, êr; the 2nd, -ér; the 3rd, -ar; and the 4th, -ìr. One marked difference in syntax between Romagnol and Italian is that pronouns are obligatory, and some verbs in Romagnol use a reflexive construction (even if the speaker is not the second argument of the verb) where Italian uses an intransitive construction. \n\nVerbs that are impersonal (lacking a canonical subject) in Romagnol use \"avèr,\" in contrast with Italian which uses \"essere.\" Even though the subject is null, an expletive pronoun inserts itself in the specifier position, much like English's \"it\". \nAdditionally, whereas Standard Italian and other Northern dialects omit the definite article before “singular names and names of relatives,” Romagnol does not do so.\n\nRomagnol has lexical and syntactic uniformity throughout its area. However, its pronunciation changes as one goes from the Po Valley to the hills.\n\nSome words that in Latin were trisyllabic or tetrasyllabic (where \"u\" is not stressed) are reduced in Romagnol to monosyllables. The atonic syllable(s) is/are cut off.\nRomagnol, has an inventory of up to 20 contrastive vowels in stressed position (in comparison to Italian's 7), which are marked in orthography using diacritics on a, i, o, u, and e.\n\nThe absence of an official institution regulating its ortography leads in many cases to ambiguities in the transcription of vowel sounds.\n\nThe following table has the nasal vowels, oral vowels and diphthongs in the northern (around Lugo) variety of Romagnol:\n\nRomagnol, in addition to its larger inventory of vowels, also has more consonants compared to standard Italian. Additionally, consonants bear the following differences compared to Standard Italian:\n"}

As with species, each language is assumed to have evolved from a single parent or \"mother\" language, with languages that share a common ancestor belonging to the same language family.\n\nPopularized by the German linguist August Schleicher in 1853, the tree model has always been a common method of describing genetic relationships between languages since the first attempts to do so. It is central to the field of comparative linguistics, which involves using evidence from known languages and observed rules of language feature evolution to identify and describe the hypothetical proto-languages ancestral to each language family, such as Proto-Indo-European and the Indo-European languages. However, this is largely a theoretical, qualitative pursuit, and linguists have always emphasized the inherent limitations of the tree model due to the large role played by horizontal transmission in language evolution, ranging from loanwords to creole languages that have multiple mother languages. The wave model was developed in 1872 by Schleicher's student Johannes Schmidt as an alternative to the tree model that incorporates horizontal transmission.\n\nThe tree model also has the same limitations as biological taxonomy with respect to the species problem of quantizing a continuous phenomenon that includes exceptions like ring species in biology and dialect continua in language. The concept of a linkage was developed in response and refers to a group of languages that evolved from a dialect continuum rather than from linguistically isolated child languages of a single language.\n\nAugustine of Hippo supposed that each of the descendants of Noah founded a nation and that each nation was given its own language: Assyrian for Assur, Hebrew for Heber, and so on. In all he identified 72 nations, tribal founders and languages. The confusion and dispersion occurred in the time of Peleg, son of Heber, son of Shem, son of Noah.\nAugustine then makes a hypothesis not unlike those of later historical linguists, that the family of Heber \"preserved that language not unreasonably believed to have been the common language of the race ... thenceforth named Hebrew.\" Most of the 72 languages, however, date to many generations after Heber. St. Augustine solves this first problem by supposing that Heber, who lived 430 years, was still alive when God assigned the 72.\n\nSt. Augustine's hypothesis stood without major question for over a thousand years. Then, in a series of tracts, published in 1684, expressing skepticism concerning various beliefs, especially Biblical, Sir Thomas Browne wrote:\n\n\"Though the earth were widely peopled before the flood ... yet whether, after a large dispersion, and the space of sixteen hundred years, men maintained so uniform a language in all parts, ... may very well be doubted.\"\n\nBy then, discovery of the New World and exploration of the Far East had brought knowledge of numbers of new languages far beyond the 72 calculated by St. Augustine. Citing the Native American languages, Browne suggests the \"confusion of tongues at first fell only upon those present in Sinaar at the work of Babel ...\" For those \"about the foot of the hills, whereabout the ark rested ... their primitive language might in time branch out into several parts of Europe and This is an inkling of a tree. In Browne's view, simplification from a larger aboriginal language than Hebrew could account for the differences in language. He suggests ancient Chinese, from which the others descended by \"confusion, admixtion and corruption\". Later he invokes \"commixture and alteration.\"\n\nBrowne reports a number of reconstructive activities by the scholars of the times:\n\"The learned Casaubon conceiveth that a dialogue might be composed in Saxon, only of such words as are derivable from the Greek ... Verstegan made no doubt that he could contrive a letter that might be understood by the English, Dutch, and East Frislander ... And if, as the learned Buxhornius contendeth, the Scythian language as the mother tongue runs throughout the nations of Europe, and even as far as Persia, the community on many words, between so many nations, hath more reasonable traduction and were rather derivable from the common tongue diffused through them all, than from any particular nation, which hath also borrowed and holdeth but at second hand.\"\nThe confusion at the Tower of Babel was thus removed as an obstacle by setting it aside. Attempts to find similarities in all languages were resulting in the gradual uncovering of an ancient master language from which all the other languages derive. Browne undoubtedly did his writing and thinking well before 1684. In that same revolutionary century in Britain James Howell published of \"Epistolae Ho-Elianae\", quasi-fictional letters to various important persons in the realm containing valid historical information. In Letter LVIII the metaphor of a tree of languages appears fully developed short of being a professional linguist's view:\n\"I will now hoist sail for the Netherlands, whose language is the same dialect with the English, and was so from the beginning, being both of them derived from the high Dutch [Howell is wrong here]: The Danish also is but a branch of the same tree ... Now the High Dutch or Teutonick Tongue, is one of the prime and most spacious Maternal Languages of Europe ... it was the language of the Goths and Vandals, and continueth yet of the greatest part of Poland and Hungary, who have a Dialect of hers for their vulgar tongue ... Some of her writers would make this world believe that she was the language spoken in paradise.\"\nThe search for \"the language of paradise\" was on among all the linguists of Europe. Those who wrote in Latin called it the \"lingua prima\", the \"lingua primaeva\" or the \"lingua primigenia.\" In English it was the Adamic language; in German, the \"Ursprache\" or the \"hebräische Ursprache\" if one believed it was Hebrew. This mysterious language had the aura of purity and incorruption about it, and those qualities were the standards used to select candidates. This concept of \"Ursprache\" came into in use well before the neo-grammarians adopted it for their proto-languages. The gap between the widely divergent families of languages remained unclosed.\n\nOn February 2, 1786, Sir William Jones delivered his \"Third Anniversary Discourse\" to the Asiatic Society as its president on the topic of the Hindus. In it he applied the logic of the tree model to three languages, Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, but for the first time in history on purely linguistic grounds, noting \"a stronger affinity, both in the roots of the verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; ...\" He went on to postulate that they sprang from \"some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.\" To them he added Gothic, Celtic and Persian as \"to the same family.\"\n\nJones did not name his \"common source\" nor develop the idea further, but it was taken up by the linguists of the times. In the \"(London) Quarterly Review\" of late 1813-1814, Thomas Young published a review of Johann Christoph Adelung's \"Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde\" (\"Mithridates, or a General History of Languages\"), Volume I of which had come out in 1806, and Volumes II and III, , continued by Johann Severin Vater. Adelung's work described some 500 \"languages and dialects\" and hypothesized a universal descent from the language of paradise, located in Kashmir central to the total range of the 500. Young begins by pointing out Adelung's indebtedness to Conrad Gesner's \"Mithridates, de Differentiis Linguarum\" of 1555 and other subsequent catalogues of languages and \nYoung undertakes to present Adelung's classification. The monosyllabic type is most ancient and primitive, spoken in Asia, to the east of Eden, in the direction of Adam's exit from Eden. Then follows Jones' group, still without a name, but attributed to Jones: \"Another ancient and extensive class of languages united by a greater number of resemblances than can well be altogether accidental.\" For this class he offers a name, \"Indoeuropean,\" the first known linguistic use of the word, but not its first known use. The British East India Company was using \"Indo-European commerce\" to mean the trade of commodities between India and Europe. All the evidence Young cites for the ancestral group are the most similar words: mother, father, etc.\n\nAdelung's additional classes were the Tataric, the African and the American, which depend on geography and a presumed descent from Eden. Young does not share Adelung's enthusiasm for the language of paradise, and brands it as mainly speculative.\n\nYoung's designation, successful in English, was only one of several candidates proposed between 1810 and 1867: indo-germanique (Conrad Malte-Brun, 1810), japetisk (Rasmus Christian Rask, 1815), Indo-Germanisch (Julius Klaproth, 1823), indisch-teutsch (F. Schmitthenner, 1826), sanskritisch (Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1827), indokeltisch (A. F. Pott, 1840), arioeuropeo (Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, 1854), Aryan (Max Müller, 1861) and aryaque (H. Chavée, 1867). These men were all polyglots and prodigies in languages. Klaproth, author of the successful German-language candidate, Indo-Germanisch, who criticised Jones for his uncritical method, knew Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and a number of other languages with their scripts. The concept of a Biblical Ursprache appealed to their imagination. As hope of finding it gradually died they fell back on the growing concept of common Indo-European spoken by nomadic tribes on the plains of Eurasia, and although they made a good case that this language can be deduced by the methods of comparative linguistics, in fact that is not how they obtained it. It was the one case in which their efforts to find the Ursprache succeeded.\n\nThe model is due in its most strict formulation to the Neogrammarians. The model relies on earlier conceptions of William Jones, Franz Bopp and August Schleicher by adding the exceptionlessness of the sound laws and the regularity of the process. The linguist perhaps most responsible for establishing the link to Darwinism was August Schleicher. That he was comparing his \"Stammbaum\", or family tree of languages, to Darwin's presentation of evolution shortly after that presentation, is proved by the open letter he wrote in 1863 to Ernst Haeckel, published posthumously, however. In 1869, Haeckel had suggested he read \"Origin of Species\".\n\nAfter reading it Schleicher wrote \"Die Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft\", \"Darwinism tested by the Science of Language.\" In a scenario reminiscent of that between Darwin and Wallace over the discovery of evolution (both discovered it independently), Schleicher endorsed Darwin's presentation, but criticised it for not inserting any species. He then presented a \"Stammbaum\" of languages, which, however, was not the first he had published.\n\nThe evolution of languages was not the source of Darwin's theory of evolution. He had based that on variation of species, such as he had observed in finches in the Galapagos Islands, who had appeared to be modifications of a common ancestor. Selection of domestic species to produce a new variety also played a role in his conclusions. The first edition of \"Origin of Species\" in 1859 discusses the language tree as though \"de novo\" under the topic of classification. Darwin criticises the synchronic method devised by Linnaeus, suggesting that it be replaced by a \"natural arrangement\" based on evolution. He says:\n\n\"It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I think, be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and dialects. The various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.\"\n\nSchleicher had never heard of Darwin before Haeckel brought him to Schleicher's attention. He had published his own work on the \"Stammbaum\" in an article of 1853, six years before the first edition of \"Origin of Species\" in 1859. The concept of descent of languages was by no means new. Thomas Jefferson, a devout linguist himself, had proposed that the continual necessity for neologisms implies that languages must \"progress\" or \"advance.\". These ideas foreshadow evolution of either biological species or languages, but after the contact of Schleicher with Darwin's ideas, and perhaps Darwin's contact with the historical linguists, Evolution and language change were inextricably linked, and would become the basis for classification. Now, as then, the main problems would be to prove specific lines of descent, and to identify the branch points.\n\nThe old metaphor was given an entirely new meaning under the old name by Joseph Harold Greenberg in a series of essays beginning about 1950. Since the adoption of the family tree metaphor by the linguists, the concept of evolution had been proposed by Charles Darwin and was generally accepted in biology. Taxonomy, the classification of living things, had already been invented by Carl Linnaeus. It used a binomial nomenclature to assign a species name and a genus name to every known living organism. These were arranged in a biological hierarchy under several phyla, or most general groups, branching ultimately to the various species. The basis for this biological classification was the observed shared physical features of the species.\n\nDarwin, however, reviving another ancient metaphor, the tree of life, hypothesized that the groups of the Linnaean classification (today's taxa), descended in a tree structure over time from simplest to most complex. The Linnaean hierarchical tree was synchronic; Darwin envisioned a diachronic process of common descent. Where Linnaeus had conceived ranks, which were consistent with the great chain of being adopted by the rationalists, Darwin conceived lineages. Over the decades after Darwin it became clear that the ranks of Linnaeus' hierarchy did not correspond exactly to the lineages. It became the prime goal of taxonomy to discover the lineages and alter the classification to reflect them, which it did under the overall guidance of the Nomenclature Codes, rule books kept by international organizations to authorize and publish proposals to reclassify species and other taxa. The new approach was called phylogeny, the \"generation of phyla,\" which devised a new tree metaphor, the phylogenetic tree. One unit in the tree and all its offspring units were a clade and the discovery of clades was cladistics.\nGreenberg began writing during a time when phylogenetic systematics lacked the tools available to it later: the computer (computational systematics) and DNA sequencing (molecular systematics). To discover a cladistic relationship researchers relied on as large a number of morphological similarities among species as could be defined and tabulated. Statistically the greater the number of similarities the more likely species were to be in the same clade. This approach appealed to Greenberg, who was interested in discovering linguistic universals. Altering the tree model to make the family tree a phylogenetic tree he said:\n\"Any language consists of thousands of forms with both sound and meaning ... any sound whatever can express any meaning whatever. Therefore, if two languages agree in a considerable number of such items ... we necessarily draw a conclusion of common historical origin. Such genetic classifications are not arbitrary ... the analogy here to biological classification is extremely close ... just as in biology we classify species in the same genus or high unit because the resemblances are such as to suggest a hypothesis of common descent, so with genetic hypotheses in language.\"\nIn this analogy, a language family is like a clade, the languages are like species, the proto-language is like an ancestor taxon, the language tree is like a phylogenetic tree and languages and dialects are like species and varieties. Greenberg formulated large tables of characteristics of hitherto neglected languages of Africa, the Americas, Indonesia and northern Eurasia and typed them according to their similarities. He called this approach \"typological classification\", arrived at by descriptive linguistics rather than by comparative linguistics.\n\nThe comparative method has been used by historical linguists to piece together tree models utilizing discrete lexical, morphological, and phonological data. Chronology can be found but there is no absolute date estimates utilizing this system. \n\nGlottochronology enables absolute dates to be estimated. Shared cognates (cognates meaning to have common historical origin) are calculate divergence times. However the method was found to be later discredited due to the data being unreliable. Due to this historical linguists have trouble with exact age estimation when pinpointing the age of the Indo-European language family. It could range from 4000 BP to 40,000 BP, or anywhere in-between those dates according to Dixon sourced from the rise and fall of language, (Cambridge University Press). As seen in the article here.\n\nPossible solutions for Glottochronology are forthcoming due to computational phylogenetic methods. Techniques such as using models of evolution improves accuracy of tree branch length and topology. There for, using computational phylogenetic methods computational methods enable researchers to analyze linguistic data from evolutionary biology. This further assists in testing theories against each other, such as the Kurgan theory and the Anatolian theory, both claiming origins of Info-European languages. \n\nThe comparative method compares features of various languages to assess how similar one language is to another. The results of such an assessment are data-oriented; that is, the results depend on the number of features and the number of languages compared. Until the arrival of the computer on the historical linguistics landscape, the numbers in both cases were necessarily small. The effect was of trying to depict a photograph using a small number of large pixels, or picture units. The limitations of the Tree Model were all too painfully apparent, resulting in complaints from the major historical linguists.\n\nIn the late 20th century, linguists began using software intended for biological classification to classify languages. Programs and methods became increasingly sophisticated. In the early 21st century, the Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics (CPHL) project, a consortium of historical linguists, received funding from the National Science Foundation to study phylogenies. The Indo-European family is a major topic of study. As of January, 2012, they had collected and coded a \"screened\" database of \"22 phonological characters, 13 morphological characters, and 259 lexical characters,\" and an unscreened database of more. Wordlists of 24 Indo-European languages are included. Larger numbers of features and languages increase the precision, provided they meet certain criteria. Using specialized computer software, they test various phylogenetic hypotheses for their ability to account for the characters by genetic descent.\n\nOne endemic limitation of the tree model is the very founding presumption on which it is based: it requires a classification based on languages.or, more generally, on language varieties. Since a variety represents an abstraction from the totality of linguistic features, there is the possibility for information loss during the translation of data (from a map of isoglosses) into a tree. For example, there is the issue of dialect continua. They provide varieties that are not unequivocally one language or another but contain features characteristic of more than one. The issue of how they are to be classified is similar to the issue presented by ring species to the concept of species classification in biology.\n\nThe limitations of the tree model, in particular its inability to handle the non-discrete distribution of shared innovations in dialect continua, have been addressed through the development of non-cladistic (non-tree-based) methodologies. They include the Wave model; and more recently, the concept of linkage.\n\nAn additional limitation of the tree model involves mixed and hybrid languages, as well as language mixing in general since the tree model allows only for divergences. For example, according to Zuckermann (2009:63), \"Israeli\", his term for Modern Hebrew, which he regards as a Semito-European hybrid, \"demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent.\"\n\nThe purpose of phylogenetic software is to generate cladograms, a special kind of tree in which the links only bifurcate; that is, at any node in the same direction only two branches are offered. The input data is a set of characters that can be assigned states in different languages, such as present (1) or absent (0). A language therefore can be described by a unique coordinate set consisting of the state values for all of the characters considered. These coordinates can be like each other or less so. Languages that share the most states are most like each other.\n\nThe software massages all the states of all the characters of all the languages by one of several mathematical methods to accomplish a pairwise comparison of each language with all the rest. It then constructs a cladogram based on degrees of similarity; for example, hypothetical languages, a and b, which are closest only to each other, are assumed to have a common ancestor, a-b. The next closest language, c, is assumed to have a common ancestor with a-b, and so on. The result is a projected series of historical paths leading from the overall common ancestor (the root) to the languages (the leaves). Each path is unique. There are no links between paths. Every leaf and node have one and only one ancestor. All the states are accounted for by descent from other states. A cladogram that conforms to these requirements is a perfect phylogeny.\n\nAt first there seemed to be little consistency of results in trials varying the factors presumed to be relevant. A new cladogram resulted from any change, which suggested that the method was not capturing the underlying evolution of languages but only reflecting the extemporaneous judgements of the researchers. In order to find the factors that did bear on phylogeny the researchers needed to have some measure of the accuracy of their results; i.e., the results needed to be calibrated against known phylogenies. They ran the experiment using different assumptions looking for the ones that would produce the closest matches to the most secure Indo-European phylogenies. Those assumptions could be used on problem areas of the Indo-European phylogeny with greater confidence.\n\nTo obtain a reasonably valid phylogeny, the researchers found they needed to enter as input all three types of characters: phonological, lexical and morphological, which were all required to present a picture that was sufficiently detailed for calculation of phylogeny. Only qualitative characters produced meaningful results. Repeated states were too ambiguous to be correctly interpreted by the software; therefore characters that were subject to back formation and parallel development, which reverted a character to a prior state or adopted a state that evolved in another character, respectively, were screened from the input dataset.\n\nDespite their care to code the best qualitative characters in sufficient numbers, the researchers could obtain no perfect phylogenies for some groups, such as Germanic and Albanian within Indo-European. They reasoned that a significant number of characters, which could not be explained by genetic descent from the group's calculated ancestor, were borrowed. Presumably, if the wave model, which explained borrowing, were a complete explanation of the group's characters, no phylogeny at all could be found for it. If both models were partially effective, then a tree would exist, but it would need to be supplemented by non-genetic explanations. The researchers therefore modified the software and method to include the possibility of borrowing.\n\nThe researchers introduced into the experiment the concept of the interface, or allowed boundary over which character states would flow. A one-way interface, or edge, existed between a parent and a child. If only one-way edges were sufficient to explain the presence of all the states in a language, then there was no need to look beyond the perfect phylogeny. If not, then one or more contact edges, or bidirectional interfaces, could be added to the phylogeny. A language therefore might have more than one source of states: the parent or a contact language.\n\nA tree so modified was no longer a tree as such: there could be more than one path from root to leaf. The researchers called this arrangement a network. The states of a character still evolved along a unique path from root to leaf, but its origin could be either the root under consideration or a contact language. If all the states of the experiment could be accounted for by the network, it was termed a perfect phylogenetic network.\n\nThe generation of networks required two phases. In the first phase, the researchers devised a number of phylogenies, called candidate trees, to be tested for compatibility. A character is compatible when its origin is explained by the phylogeny generated. In a perfect phylogeny, all the characters are compatible and the compatibility of the tree is 100%. By the principle of parsimony, or Occam's razor, no networks are warranted. Candidate trees were obtained by first running the phylogeny-generation software using the Indo-European dataset (the strings of character states) as input, then modifying the resultant tree into other hypotheses to be tested.\n\nNone of the original candidate trees were perfect phylogenies, although some of the subtrees within them were. The next phase was to generate networks from the trees of highest compatibility scores by adding interfaces one at a time, selecting the interface of highest compatibility, until sufficiency was obtained; that is, the compatibility of the network was highest. As it turned out, the number of compatible networks generated might vary from none to over a dozen. However, not all the possible interfaces were historically feasible. Interfaces between some languages were geographically and chronologically not very likely. Inspecting the results, the researchers excluded the non-feasible interfaces until a list of only feasible networks remained, which could be arranged in order of compatibility score.\n\nThe researchers began with five candidate trees for Indo-European, lettered A-E, one generated from the phylogenetic software, two modifications of it and two suggested by Craig Melchert, a historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist. The trees differed mainly in the placement of the most ambiguous group, the Germanic languages, and Albanian, which did not have enough distinctive characters to place it exactly. Tree A contained 14 incompatible characters; B, 19; C, 17; D, 21; E,18. Trees A and C had the best compatibility scores. The incompatibilities were all lexical, and A's were a subset of C's.\n\nSubsequent generation of networks found that all incompatibilites could be resolved with a minimum of three contact edges except for Tree E. As it did not have a high compatibility, it was excluded. Tree A had 16 possible networks, which a feasibility inspection reduced to three. Tree C had one network, but as it required an interface to Baltic and not Slavic, it was not feasible.\n\nTree A, the most compatible and feasible tree, hypothesizes seven groups separating from Proto-Indo-European between about 4000 BC and 2250 BC, as follows.\n\nTrees B and E offer the alternative of Proto-Germano-Balto-Slavic (northern Indo-European), making Albanian an independent branch. The only date for which authors vouch is the last, based on the continuity of the Yamna culture, the Andronovo Culture and known Indo-Aryan speaking cultures. All others are described as \"dead reckoning.\"\n\nGiven the phylogeny of best compatibility, A, three contact edges are required to complete the compatibility. This is group of edges with the least number of borrowing events:\n\n\nTree A with the edges described above is described by the authors as \"our best PPN.\" In all PPNs, it is clear that although the initial daughter languages became distinct in relative isolation, the later evolution of the groups can be explained only by evolution in proximity to other languages with which an exchange takes place by the wave model.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15571008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15571008", "title": "Voided biaxial slab", "text": "Voided biaxial slab\n\nVoided biaxial slabs are reinforced concrete slabs in which voids reduce the amount of concrete.\n\nWhile concrete has been used for thousands of years, the use of reinforced concrete is usually attributed to Joseph-Louis Lambot in 1848. Joseph Monier, a French gardener, patented a design for reinforced garden tubs in 1868, and later patented reinforced concrete beams and posts for railway and road guardrails.\n\nThe main obstacle with concrete constructions, in case of horizontal slabs, is the high weight, which limits the span. For this reason major developments of reinforced concrete have focused on enhancing the span, either by reducing the weight or overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension.\n\nAn early example is the Pantheon in Rome, built 125 AD. Although not reinforced, coffers were used to reduce the weight.\n\nFocus has been on biaxial slabs and ways to reduce the weight. Several methods have been introduced during the last decades, but with very limited success, due to major problems with shear capacity and fire resistance as well as impractical execution.\n\nFor decades, several attempts have been made to create biaxial slabs with hollow cavities in order to reduce the weight. Most attempts have consisted of laying blocks of a less heavy material like expanded polystyrene between the bottom and top reinforcement, while other types included waffle slabs and grid slabs.\n\nOf these types, only waffle slabs can be regarded to have a certain use in the market. But the use will always be very limited due to reduced resistances towards shear, local punching and fire. The idea of placing large blocks of light material in the slab suffers from the same flaws, which is why the use of these systems has never gained acceptance and they are only used in a limited number of projects in Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nThe geometry of the BubbleDeck slab is identified by ellipsoids of a certain size, placed in a precise modular grid. All geometrical parameters of the slab can be described by a single parameter, the modulus named “a”. Modulus and corresponding deck heights are manufactured in steps (modulus in steps of 25 mm, and effective heights in steps of 50 mm)\n\nIn principle, fixing of the ellipsoids can be made in numerous ways, but using only the reinforcement meshes reduces superfluous material consumption and allows for an optimal geometrical proportion between concrete, reinforcement and voids.\n\nThe voids are positioned in the middle of the cross section, where concrete has limited effect, while maintaining solid sections in top and bottom where high stresses can exist. Hence, the slab is fully functional with regards to both positive and negative bending.\nIn principle, voided biaxial slabs act like solid slabs. Designing is consequently like for solid slabs, but with less load corresponding to the reduced amount of concrete. Investigations according to Eurocodes made at universities in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark, conclude that a voided biaxial slabs acts like as a solid slab.\n\nWhile a true biaxial slab as the BubbleDeck system must be calculated as a solid slab, ribbed slab systems, like the U-boot system, consisting of a grid of orthogonal \"I\" beams, must be calculated as beams.\n\nThe voided biaxial slabs technology is directly incorporated in international standards as the Eurocodes, and various national codes such as the CUR in the Netherlands.\n\nThe main difference between a solid slab and a voided biaxial slab refers to shear resistance. Due to the reduced concrete volume, the shear resistance will also be reduced. For a voided biaxial slabs with spheres the shear resistance is proportional to the amount of concrete, as the special geometry shaped by the ellipsoidal voids acts like the famous Roman arch, enabling all concrete to be effective. This is only valid when considering the voided biaxial slabs technology. Other types of voided biaxial slabs have reduced resistances towards shear, local punching and fire.\n\nIn practice, the reduced shear resistance will not lead to problems, as balls are simply left out where the shear is high, at columns and walls.\n\nAs U-Boot Beton® is made of polypropylene, it is not toxic even if burnt. Moreover,the slab will not explode due to the escaping of over pressurised gas from the feet (4 feet for each formwork) that act as safety valves. Tests run at the CSI laboratory have demonstrated that with a cement cover of 3 cm the structure created with U-Boot Beton® is class REI 180.\n\nAs a voided biaxial slab (with spheres only) acts like a solid slab, the fire resistance is just a matter of the amount of concrete layer. The fire resistance is dependent on the temperature in the rebars and hence the transport of heat. As the top and bottom of the voided biaxial slab is solid, and the rebars are placed in the solid part, the fire resistance can be designed according to demands. Due to the specific shape of the voids, there are no issues with internal pressure. Actual fire tests on slabs made by specific BubbleDeck geometry has been carried out in Europe, Asia and South America.\n\nTests have been carried out in Germany, UK and the Netherlands according to ISO 140-4:1998, ISO\n140-7:1998, ISO 717-1:1997 and ISO 717-2:1997 measuring impact and airborne sound. These tests show that 230 mm and thicker BubbleDeck slabs can meet the national rules.\n\n\nThe BubbleDeck system fulfil these principles:\n\n\nA two way spanning voided biaxial slab construction compared to a traditional two way spanning non voided biaxial slab construction:\n\nA two way spanning biaxial slab construction compared to a one way spanning deck (traditionally a hollow core):\n\nAs this floor type is made of complete prefab elements with no structural coherence, support moments are absent, resulting in increased material consumption.\n\nA two way spanning voided biaxial slab construction with spheres according to the BubbleDeck system, compared to older voided slab constructions:\n\nBenefits include:\n\n8% of global CO emissions are due to cement production. 1 tonne of cement:\n\nDue to the BubbleDeck technology's green credentials, the use of the BubbleDeck system qualifies for LEED points in North America.\n\nLIGHT - THIN - BIDIRECTIONAL\nReduction of weight up to 40%.

These elements comprise the top and bottom reinforcement mesh, sized to suit the specific project, joined together with vertical lattice girders with the void formers trapped between the top and bottom mesh reinforcement to fix their optimum position. This is termed a ‘bubble-reinforcement’ sandwich, which is then cast into bottom layer of 60 mm pre-cast concrete, encasing the bottom mesh reinforcement, to provide permanent formwork within part of the overall finished slab depth.\n\nOn site the individual elements are then ‘stitched’ together with loose reinforcement simply laid centrally across the joints between elements. The splice bars are inserted loose above the pre-cast concrete layer between the bubbles, and purpose made mesh sheets tied across the top reinforcement mesh to join the elements\ntogether. After the site finishing, concrete is poured and cured. This technique provides structural continuity across the entire floor slab – the joints between elements are then redundant without any structural effect – to create a seamless biaxial floor slab.\n\n\nIn 2017 the Bubbledeck system caused controversy due to the collapse of a parking garage at Eindhoven airport in the Netherlands. According to Royal BAM Group, the contractor in charge, the shear strength of the interface between the precast concrete slabs was insufficient. According to the contractor this may be caused due to the high temperatures during construction.\nAfter the incident an investigation was started among buildings using the same flooring system, this led to the closure of several buildings, including the Polak-building of the University of Rotterdam and a school building under construction in Hoeven in the Netherlands.\nAll tested buildings are proven safe, and are reopened.\n\nBelow are some examples of the voided biaxial slabs being used\ny:\n\nUniversity, Utrecht in the Netherlands':\n\nVogaskoli, School in Reykjavik, Iceland:\n\nSogn Arena, Oslo in Norway:\n\nCity Hall and Offices, Glostrup in Denmark:\n\nSome examples:\n\nCity Life Milano Italy\n\nITC Lab (Leed Platinum) Italy\n\nVulcano Buono Italy\n\nBeirut Terraces Lebanon\n\n"}

{"id": "32977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32977", "title": "Writing", "text": "Writing\n\nWriting is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called \"text\", and the recipient of text is called a \"reader\". Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence, record keeping and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.\n\nAs human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. In both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.\n\nH.G. Wells argued that writing has the ability to \"put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death\".\n\nThe major writing systems—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: logographic, syllabic, alphabetic, featural, and ideographic (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, pictographic, is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.\n\nA logogram is a written character which represents a word or morpheme. A vast number of logograms are needed to write Chinese characters, cuneiform, and Mayan, where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—(\"logoconsonantal\" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese \"radicals\", hieroglyphic \"determiners\"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for \"fin\", pronounced \"ka\", was also used to represent the syllable \"ka\" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a \"radical\" with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a \"phonetic\". However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.\n\nThe main logographic system in use today is Chinese characters, used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of China, Japan, and sometimes in Korean despite the fact that in South and North Korea, the phonetic Hangul system is mainly used.\n\nA syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) syllables. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable \"ka\" may look nothing like the syllable \"ki\", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.\n\nSyllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the Linear B script for Mycenaean Greek; Cherokee; Ndjuka, an English-based creole language of Surinam; and the Vai script of Liberia. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. Ethiopic, though technically an abugida, has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.\n\nAn alphabet is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly phonological alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.\n\nAs languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.\n\nIn most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called \"abjads\", derived from the Arabic word for \"alphabet\".\n\nIn most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called \"abugidas\". Some abugidas, such as Ethiopic and Cree, are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called \"syllabics\". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.\n\nSometimes the term \"alphabet\" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the Latin alphabet, although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, Greek is often considered to be the first alphabet.\n\nA featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips (\"labial\" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters \"b\" and \"p\"; however, labial \"m\" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking \"q\" and \"d\" are not labial. In Korean hangul, however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.\n\nAnother featural script is SignWriting, the most popular writing system for many sign languages, where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented iconically. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Tengwar.\n\nHistorians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.\n\nWriting systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.\n\nThe many tools and writing materials used throughout history include stone tablets, clay tablets, bamboo slats, papyrus, wax tablets, vellum, parchment, paper, copperplate, styluses, quills, ink brushes, pencils, pens, and many styles of lithography. The Incas used knotted cords known as quipu (or khipu) for keeping records.\n\nThe typewriter and various forms of word processors have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.\n\nBy definition, the modern practice of history begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of prehistory. The Dispilio Tablet (Greece), Jiahu symbols (China) and Tărtăria tablets (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the 6th millennium BC, are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.\n\nWhile neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.\n\nArchaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat determined the link between previously uncategorized clay \"tokens\", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, Mesopotamian cuneiform. In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added \"a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols\".\n\nThe original Mesopotamian writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC, the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of pictographs. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term cuneiform), at first only for logograms, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken Sumerian. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the East Semitic Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as Elamite, Hattian, Hurrian and Hittite. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for Ugaritic and Old Persian. With the adoption of Aramaic as the 'lingua franca' of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.\n\nOver the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.\nProto-Elamite is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early cuneiform (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly logographic.\n\nLinear Elamite is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably and .\n\nThe Elamite cuneiform script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the Akkadian cuneiform. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.\n\nCretan hieroglyphs are found on artifacts of Crete (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). Linear B, the writing system of the Mycenaean Greeks, has been deciphered while Linear A has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows: Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the Aegean Islands (Kea, Kythera, Melos, Thera), and the Greek mainland (Laconia) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete (Knossos), and mainland (Pylos, Mycenae, Thebes, Tiryns) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.\n\nThe earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called \"oracle bones\", tortoise plastrons and ox scapulae used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late Shang dynasty. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.\nHistorians have found that the type of media used had an effect on what the writing was documenting and how it was used.\n\nIn 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of isolated tortoise-shell carvings dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.\n\nThe earliest known hieroglyphic inscriptions are the Narmer Palette, dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was logographic with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective alphabet.\n\nWriting was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribes. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.\n\nThe world's oldest known alphabet appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC. Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the \"Mistress of turquoise\". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on hieroglyphic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.\n\nIndus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the Indus Valley Civilization (which spanned modern-day Pakistan and North India) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early Harappa after 3500 BC, and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left, and sometimes follows a boustrophedonic style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600, midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an agglutinative language underlies the script.\n\nIn 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in Central Asia that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic script, in which Proto-Canaanite is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The Phoenician writing system was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from Hieratic, Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the Greeks, who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The Cumae alphabet, a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the Etruscan alphabet and its own descendants, such as the Latin alphabet and Runes. Other descendants from the Greek alphabet include Cyrillic, used to write Bulgarian, Russian and Serbian, among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the Aramaic script, from which the Hebrew and the Arabic scripts are descended.\n\nThe Tifinagh script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.\n\nA stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the Cascajal Block, was discovered in the Mexican state of Veracruz and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest Zapotec writing by approximately 500 years. It is thought to be Olmec.\n\nOf several pre-Columbian scripts in Mesoamerica, the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the Maya script. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC. Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.\n\nThe Incas had no known script. Their quipu system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.\n\nThree stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa, in the mid-20th century (1961) in Tărtăria (present-day Alba County, Transylvania), Romania, ancient land of Dacia, inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the Getaes and Thracians.\nOne of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient Greek, as well as in Phoenician, Etruscan, Old Italic and Iberian.\nThe origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence in situ, the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the Cluj museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.\n\nIn the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as technology has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as e-mail and social media. Literacy has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to read and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the writing center and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their socioeconomic status.\n\nOther parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the World Literacy Foundation and International Literacy Foundation, as well as a general push for increased global communication.\n\n\n"}
