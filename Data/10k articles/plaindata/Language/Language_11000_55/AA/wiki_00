{"id": "5481056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5481056", "title": "Analogical modeling", "text": "Analogical modeling\n\nAnalogical modeling (AM) is a formal theory of exemplar based analogical reasoning, proposed by Royal Skousen, professor of Linguistics and English language at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. It is applicable to language modeling and other categorization tasks. Analogical modeling is related to connectionism and nearest neighbor approaches, in that it is data-based rather than abstraction-based; but it is distinguished by its ability to cope with imperfect datasets (such as caused by simulated short term memory limits) and to base predictions on all relevant segments of the dataset, whether near or far. In language modeling, AM has successfully predicted empirically valid forms for which no theoretical explanation was known (see the discussion of Finnish morphology in Skousen et al. 2002). \n\nAn exemplar-based model consists of a general-purpose modeling engine and a problem-specific dataset. Within the dataset, each exemplar (a case to be reasoned from, or an informative past experience) appears as a feature vector: a row of values for the set of parameters that define the problem. For example, in a spelling-to-sound task, the feature vector might consist of the letters of a word. Each exemplar in the dataset is stored with an outcome, such as a phoneme or phone to be generated. When the model is presented with a novel situation (in the form of an outcome-less feature vector), the engine algorithmically sorts the dataset to find exemplars that helpfully resemble it, and selects one, whose outcome is the model's prediction. The particulars of the algorithm distinguish one exemplar-based modeling system from another.\n\nIn AM, we think of the feature values as characterizing a context, and the outcome as a behavior that occurs within that context. Accordingly, the novel situation is known as the \"given context.\" Given the known features of the context, the AM engine systematically generates all contexts that include it (all of its \"supracontexts\"), and extracts from the dataset the exemplars that belong to each. The engine then discards those supracontexts whose outcomes are inconsistent (this measure of consistency will be discussed further below), leaving an \"analogical set\" of supracontexts, and probabilistically selects an exemplar from the analogical set with a bias toward those in large supracontexts. This multilevel search exponentially magnifies the likelihood of a behavior's being predicted as it occurs reliably in settings that specifically resemble the given context.\n\nAM performs the same process for each case it is asked to evaluate. The given context, consisting of n variables, is used as a template to generate formula_1 supracontexts. Each supracontext is a set of exemplars in which one or more variables have the same values that they do in the given context, and the other variables are ignored. In effect, each is a view of the data, created by filtering for some criteria of similarity to the given context, and the total set of supracontexts exhausts all such views. Alternatively, each supracontext is a theory of the task or a proposed rule whose predictive power needs to be evaluated.\n\nIt is important to note that the supracontexts are not equal peers one with another; they are arranged by their distance from the given context, forming a hierarchy. If a supracontext specifies all of the variables that another one does and more, it is a subcontext of that other one, and it lies closer to the given context. (The hierarchy is not strictly branching; each supracontext can itself be a subcontext of several others, and can have several subcontexts.) This hierarchy becomes significant in the next step of the algorithm.\n\nThe engine now chooses the analogical set from among the supracontexts. A supracontext may contain exemplars that only exhibit one behavior; it is deterministically homogeneous and is included. It is a view of the data that displays regularity, or a relevant theory that has never yet been disproven. A supracontext may exhibit several behaviors, but contain no exemplars that occur in any more specific supracontext (that is, in any of its subcontexts); in this case it is non-deterministically homogeneous and is included. Here there is no great evidence that a systematic behavior occurs, but also no counterargument. Finally, a supracontext may be heterogeneous, meaning that it exhibits behaviors that are found in a subcontext (closer to the given context), and also behaviors that are not. Where the ambiguous behavior of the nondeterministically homogeneous supracontext was accepted, this is rejected because the intervening subcontext demonstrates that there is a better theory to be found. The heterogeneous supracontext is therefore excluded. This guarantees that we see an increase in meaningfully consistent behavior in the analogical set as we approach the given context.\n\nWith the analogical set chosen, each appearance of an exemplar (for a given exemplar may appear in several of the analogical supracontexts) is given a pointer to every other appearance of an exemplar within its supracontexts. One of these pointers is then selected at random and followed, and the exemplar to which it points provides the outcome. This gives each supracontext an importance proportional to the square of its size, and makes each exemplar likely to be selected in direct proportion to the sum of the sizes of all analogically consistent supracontexts in which it appears. Then, of course, the probability of predicting a particular outcome is proportional to the summed probabilities of all the exemplars that support it.\n\nGiven a context with formula_2 elements:\n\nThis terminology is best understood through an example. In the example used in the second chapter of Skousen (1989), each context consists of three variables with potential values 0-3\n\nThe two outcomes for the dataset are \"e\" and \"r\", and the exemplars are:\n\nWe define a network of pointers like so:\n\nThe solid lines represent pointers between exemplars with matching outcomes; the dotted lines represent pointers between exemplars with non-matching outcomes.\n\nThe statistics for this example are as follows:\n\nBehavior can only be predicted for a given context; in this example, let us predict the outcome for the context \"3 1 2\". To do this, we first find all of the contexts containing the given context; these contexts are called supracontexts. We find the supracontexts by systematically eliminating the variables in the given context; with \"m\" variables, there will generally be formula_19 supracontexts. The following table lists each of the sub- and supracontexts; means \"not x\", and \"-\" means \"anything\".\nThese contexts are shown in the venn diagram below:\n\nThe next step is to determine which exemplars belong to which contexts in order to determine which of the contexts are homogeneous. The table below shows each of the subcontexts, their behavior in terms of the given exemplars, and the number of disagreements within the behavior:\n\nAnalyzing the subcontexts in the table above, we see that there is only 1 subcontext with any disagreements: \"3 1 \", which in the dataset consists of \"3 1 0 e\" and \"3 1 1 r\". There are 2 disagreements in this subcontext; 1 pointing from each of the exemplars to the other (see the pointer network pictured above). Therefore, only supracontexts containing this subcontext will contain any disagreements. We use a simple rule to identify the homogeneous supracontexts:\nIf the number if disagreements in the supracontext is greater than the number of disagreements in the contained subcontext, we say that it is heterogeneous; otherwise, it is homogeneous.\nThere are 3 situations that produce a homogeneous supracontext:\n\nThe only two heterogeneous supracontexts are \"- 1 -\" and \"- - -\". In both of them, it is the combination of the non-deterministic \"3 1 \" with other subcontexts containing the \"r\" outcome which causes the heterogeneity.\n\nThere is actually a 4th type of homogeneous supracontext: it contains more than one non-empty subcontext and it is non-deterministic, but the frequency of outcomes in each sub-context is exactly the same. Analogical modeling does not consider this situation, however, for 2 reasons:\n\nNext we construct the analogical set, which consists of all of the pointers and outcomes from the homogeneous supracontexts.\nThe figure below shows the pointer network with the homogeneous contexts highlighted.\n\nThe pointers are summarized in the following table:\n4 of the pointers in the analogical set are associated with the outcome \"e\", and the other 9 are associated with \"r\". In AM, a pointer is randomly selected and the outcome it points to is predicted. With a total of 13 pointers, the probability of the outcome \"e\" being predicted is 4/13 or 30.8%, and for outcome \"r\" it is 9/13 or 69.2%. We can create a more detailed account by listing the pointers for each of the occurrences in the homogeneous supracontexts:\n\nWe can then see the \"analogical effect\" of each of the instances in the data set.\n\nAnalogy has been considered useful in describing language at least since the time of Saussure. Noam Chomsky and others have more recently criticized analogy as too vague to really be useful (Ba≈Ñko 1991), an appeal to a \"deus ex machina.\" Skousen's proposal appears to address that criticism by proposing an explicit mechanism for analogy, which can be tested for psychological validity.\n\nAnalogical modeling has been employed in experiments ranging from phonology and morphology (linguistics) to orthography and syntax.\n\nThough analogical modeling aims to create a model free from rules seen as contrived by linguists, in its current form it still requires researchers to select which variables to take into consideration. This is necessary because of the so-called \"exponential explosion\" of processing power requirements of the computer software used to implement analogical modeling. Recent research suggests that quantum computing could provide the solution to such performance bottlenecks (Skousen et al. 2002, see pp 45‚Äì47).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "310156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310156", "title": "Bimetallism", "text": "Bimetallism\n\nBimetallism is the economic term for a monetary standard in which the value of the monetary unit is defined as equivalent to certain quantities of two metals, typically gold and silver, creating a fixed rate of exchange between them.\n\nFor scholarly purposes, \"proper\" bimetallism is sometimes distinguished as permitting that both gold and silver money are legal tender in unlimited amounts and that gold and silver may be taken to be coined by the government mints in unlimited quantities. This distinguishes it from \"limping standard\" bimetallism, where both gold and silver are legal tender but only one is freely coined (e.g. the moneys of France, Germany, and the United States after 1873), and from \"trade\" bimetallism, where both metals are freely coined but only one is legal tender and the other is used as \"trade money\" (e.g. most moneys in western Europe from the 13th to 18th centuries). Economists also distinguish \"legal\" bimetallism, where the law guarantees these conditions, and \"de facto\" bimetallism, where gold and silver coins circulate at a fixed rate.\n\nIn the 19th century, there was a great deal of scholarly debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a gold or silver standard (monometallism). Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates. Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to Gresham's law, and that its replacement by a monometallic standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after technological progress and the South African and Klondike Gold Rushes increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 Nixon shock, since when all of the world's currencies have operated as more or less freely floating fiat money, unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to inconclusively debate the relative use of the metallic standards.\n\nFrom the 7th century BCE, Asia Minor, especially in the areas of Lydia and Ionia, is known to have created a coinage based on electrum, a natural occurring material called electrum, a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver). Before Croesus, his father Alyattes had already started to mint various types of non-standardized electrum coins. They were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years. The unpredictability of its composition implied that it had a variable value which was very hard to determine, which greatly hampered its development.\n\nCroesus (Reigned c.560‚Äìc.546 BC), king of Lydia, who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the \"Croeseid\", the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation,\n\nHerodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:\n\nMany ancient bimetallic systems would follow, starting with Achaemenid coinage. From around 515 BCE under Darius I, the minting of Croesids in Sardis was replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi. The earliest gold coin of the Achaemenid Empire, the Daric, followed the weight standard of the Croeseid, and is therefore considered to be later and derived from the Croeseid. The weight of the Daric would then be modified through a metrological reform, probably under Darius I. \n\nSardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire. Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.\n\nIn 1881, a currency reform in Argentina introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883. Units of gold and silver pesos would be exchanged with paper peso notes at given par values, and fixed exchange rates against key international currencies would thus be established. Unlike many metallic standards, the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed, and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. This convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the Argentine government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.\n\nA French law of 1803 granted anyone who brought gold or silver to its mint the right to have it coined at a nominal charge in addition to the official rates of 5 grams of 90% silver per franc or 3100 francs per kilogram of 90% fine gold. This effectively established a bimetallic standard at the rate which had been used for French coinage since 1785, i.e. a relative valuation of gold to silver of 15.5 to 1. In 1803 this ratio was close to the market rate, but for most of the next half century the market rate was above 15.5 to 1. As a consequence, silver powered the French economy and gold was exported. Then the Forty-Niners went to California and the resulting supply of gold reduced its value relative to silver. The market rate fell below 15.5 to 1, and remained below until 1866. Frenchmen responded by exporting silver to India and importing nearly two-fifths of the world's production of gold in the period from 1848 to 1870. Napoleon III introduced five franc gold coins which provided a substitute for the silver five franc coins which were hoarded, but still maintained the formal bimetallism implicit in the 1803 law.\n\nThe national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on France's bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the Latin Monetary Union(LMU). Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards. The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts. A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard.\n\nMedieval and early modern England used both gold and silver, at fixed rates, to provide the necessary range of coin denominations; but silver coinage began to be restricted in the 18th century, first informally, and then by an Act of Parliament in 1774. After the suspension of metal convertibility from 1797 to 1819, Peel's Bill set the country on the gold standard for the remainder of the century; however advocates of a return to bimetallism did not cease to appear. After the crash of 1825, William Huskisson argued strongly within the Government for bimetallism, as a way to increase credit (as well as to ease trade with South America). Similarly, after the banking crisis of 1847, Alexander Baring headed an external bimetallist movement hoping to prevent the undue restriction of the currency. It was, however, only in the last quarter of the century that the movement for bimetallism gathered real strength, drawing on Manchester cotton merchants and City financiers with Far East interests to offer a serious (if ultimately unsuccessful) challenge to the gold standard.\n\nIn 1787, the United States Constitution established gold and silver as the legal tender of the United States at a floating exchange rate. Then in 1792, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed fixing the silver to gold exchange rate at 15:1, as well as establishing the mint for the public services of free coinage and currency regulation \"in order not to abridge the quantity of circulating medium.\". With its acceptance, of the Coinage Act of 1792 established: \"That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;\" the proportion had slipped by 1834 to sixteen to one. Silver took a further hit with the Coinage Act of 1853, when nearly all silver coin denominations were debased, effectively turning silver coinage into a fiduciary currency based on its face value rather than its weighted value. Bimetallism was effectively abandoned by the Coinage Act of 1873, but not formally outlawed as legal currency until the early 20th century. The merits of the system were the subject of debate in the late 19th century. If the market forces of supply and demand for either metal caused its bullion value to exceed its nominal currency value, it tends to disappear from circulation by hoarding or melting down.\n\nIn the United States, bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the 19th century. During the Civil War, to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a fiat money currency. After the war, in 1873, the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption of specie payments began (without the free and unlimited coinage of silver, thus putting the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.) Farmers, debtors, Westerners and others who felt they had benefited from wartime paper money formed the short-lived Greenback Party to press for cheap paper money backed by silver. The latter element ‚Äì \"free silver\" ‚Äì came increasingly to the fore as the answer to the same interest groups' concerns, and was taken up as a central plank by the Populist movement. Proponents of monetary silver, known as the silverites, referred back to the Fourth Coinage Act as \"The Crime of '73,\" as it was judged to have inhibited inflation, and favoured creditors over debtors. Some reformers, however, like Henry Demarest Lloyd, saw bimetallism as a red herring and feared that free silver was \"the cowbird of the reform movement, likely to push the other eggs out of the nest. Nevertheless the Panic of 1893, a severe nationwide depression, brought the money issue strongly to the fore again. The \"silverites\" argued that using silver would inflate the money supply and mean more cash for everyone, which they equated with prosperity. The gold advocates said silver would permanently depress the economy, but that sound money produced by a gold standard would restore prosperity.\n\nBimetallism and \"Free Silver\" were demanded by William Jennings Bryan who took over leadership of the Democratic Party in 1896, as well as by the Populists, and a faction of Republicans from silver mining regions in the West known as the Silver Republicans who also endorsed Bryan. The Republican Party itself nominated William McKinley on a platform supporting the gold standard which was favored by financial interests on the East Coast.\n\nBryan, the eloquent champion of the cause, gave the famous \"Cross of Gold\" speech at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896 asserting that \"The gold standard has slain tens of thousands.\" He referred to \"a struggle between 'the idle holders of idle capital‚Äô and 'the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;‚Äô and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?\" At the peroration, he said \"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\" However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed to the discovery of the cyanide process by which gold could be extracted from low grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa (Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1887 - with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the Klondike Gold Rush (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent increase in money supply that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters in the business East that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by adoption of the Bryan platform. 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in FDR‚Äôs New Deal program and later the link was broken by Nixon when he closed the gold window.\n\nIn 1992, economist Milton Friedman concluded that abandonment of the bimetallic standard in 1873 led to greater price instability than would have occurred otherwise, and thus resulted in long-term harm to the US economy. His retrospective analysis led him to write that the act of 1873 \"... was a mistake that had highly adverse consequences.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is typically applied to text, grouping words into clusters that are assumed to be semantically related by virtue of their having been embedded in similar contexts.\n\nIn natural language processing, Brown clustering or IBM clustering is a form of hierarchical clustering of words based on the contexts in which they occur, proposed by Peter Brown, Vincent Della Pietra, Peter deSouza, Jennifer Lai, and Robert Mercer of IBM in the context of language modeling. The intuition behind the method is that a class-based language model (also called cluster -gram model), i.e. one where probabilities of words are based on the classes (clusters) of previous words, is used to address the data sparsity problem inherent in language modeling.\n\nJurafsky and Martin give the example of a flight reservation system that needs to estimate the likelihood of the bigram \"to Shanghai\", without having seen this in a training set. The system can obtain a good estimate if it can cluster \"Shanghai\" with other city names, then make its estimate based on the likelihood of phrases such as \"to London\", \"to Beijing\" and \"to Denver\".\n\nBrown groups items (i.e., types) into classes, using a binary merging criterion based on the log-probability of a text under a class-based language model, i.e. a probability model that takes the clustering into account. Thus, average mutual information (AMI) is the optimization function, and merges are chosen such that they incur the least loss in global mutual information.\n\nAs a result, the output can be thought of not only as a binary tree but perhaps more helpfully as a sequence of merges, terminating with one big class of all words. This model has the same general form as a hidden Markov model, reduced to bigram probabilities in Brown's solution to the problem.\nMI is defined as:\n\nFinding the clustering that maximizes the likelihood of the data is computationally expensive. \nThe approach proposed by Brown et al. is a greedy heuristic.\n\nThe work also suggests use of Brown clusterings as a simplistic bigram class-based language model. Given cluster membership indicators for the tokens in a text, the probability of the word instance given preceding word is given by:\n\nThis has been criticised as being of limited utility, as it only ever predicts the most common word in any class, and so is restricted to word types; this is reflected in the low relative reduction in perplexity found when using this model and Brown.\n\nOther works have examined trigrams in their approaches to the Brown clustering problem.\n\nBrown clustering as proposed generates a fixed number of output classes. It is important to choose the correct number of classes, which is task-dependent. The cluster memberships of words resulting from Brown clustering can be used as features in a variety of machine-learned natural language processing tasks.\n\nA generalization of the algorithm was published in the AAAI conference in 2016, including a succint formal definition of the 1992 version and then also the general form. Core to this is the concept that the classes considered for merging do not necessarily represent the final number of classes output, and that altering the number of classes considered for merging directly affects the speed and quality of the final result.\n\nThere are no known theoretical guarantees on the greedy heuristic proposed by Brown et al. (as of February 2018). However, the clustering problem can be framed as estimating the parameters of the underlying class-based language model: it is possible to develop a consistent estimator for this model under mild assumptions.\n\n\n"}

The literal meaning is \"stroke of [the] eye\".\n\nIt is mostly used (in English) in a military context, where the coup d'≈ìil refers to the ability to discern at one glance the tactical advantages and disadvantages of the terrain. For example, the famous king Frederick the Great of Prussia in his 1753 \"Particular Instructions\" devotes special attention to the military coup d'≈ìil, defining it as:\n[T]he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a \"coup d'≈ìil\", without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence.\n\nThe phrase popularly comes from Clausewitz in his tome \"On War\":When all is said and done, it really is the commander's \"coup d'≈ìil\", his ability to see things simply, to identify the whole business of war completely with himself, that is the essence of good generalship. Only if the mind works in this comprehensive fashion can it achieve the freedom it needs to dominate events and not be dominated by them.\n\nNapoleon remarked upon it:There is a gift of being able to see at a glance the possibilities offered by the terrain...One can call it the \"coup d'≈ìil militaire\" and it is inborn in great generals.\n\nAs did Folard and Liddell Hart:\nThe \"coup d'≈ìil\" is a gift of God and cannot be acquired; but if professional knowledge does not perfect it, one can only see things imperfectly and in a fog, which is not enough in these matters where it is important to have a clear eye...To look over a battlefield, to take in at the first instance the advantages and disadvantages is the great quality of a general.\nA vital faculty of generalship is the power of grasping \"instantly\" the picture of the ground and the situation, of relating one to the other, and the local to the general.\n\nThe coup d'≈ìil remains important for officers in modern armies for the positioning of infantry, tanks, artillery etc. It is also important for snipers, or infantry operating weapons like anti-tank weapons, in order to find good concealment, cover and a good field of fire.\n\nIn current-day French, the phrase simply means \"glimpse.\" For example, it is often used in marketing materials in the same way that \"At a glance...\" is used in English to title a product summary.\n\n\n\n"}

He gives the example \"Whom did you see?\" which is grammatically correct but is generally replaced by \"Who did you see?\" Structural symmetry seems to have brought about the change: all other \"wh-\" words are monomorphic (consisting of only one morpheme). The drift of speech changes dialects and, in long terms, it generates new languages. Although it may appear these changes have no direction, in general they do. For example, in the English language, there was the Great Vowel Shift, a chain shift of long vowels first described and accounted for in terms of drift by Jespersen (1860‚Äì1943). Another example of drift is the tendency in English to eliminate the \"-er\" comparative formative and to replace it with the more analytic \"more\". Thus, in some dialects one now regularly hears \"more kind\" and \"more happy\" instead of the prescriptive \"kinder\", \"happier\". In English, it may be the competition of the \"-er\" agentive suffix which has brought about this drift, i.e. the eventual loss of the Germanic comparative system in favor of the newer system calqued on French. Moreover, the structural asymmetry of the comparative formation may be a cause of this change.\n\nThe underlying cause of drift may be entropy: the amount of disorder (differences in probabilities) inherent in all linguistic systems.\n\nAnother underlying cause of drift may be cross-linguistic influence (CLI) in situations of language contact. For example, in Shanghai Chinese (Shanghainese) it has been reported that vowel sounds have gradually changed over time due to the influence of Mandarin Chinese (Yao & Chang, 2016). At a shorter timescale (weeks of intensive exposure to a second language) as well, phonetic changes have been observed in an individual's native language (Chang, 2012, 2013); these changes, termed 'phonetic drift', generally approximate properties of the second language.\n\nCyclic drift is the mechanism of long-term evolution that changes the functional characteristics of a language over time, such as the reversible drifts from SOV word order to SVO and from synthetic inflection to analytic observable as typological parameters in the syntax of language families and of areal groupings of languages open to investigation over long periods of time. Drift in this sense is not language-specific but universal, a consensus achieved over two decades by universalists of the typological school as well as the generativist, notably by Greenberg (1960, 1963), Cowgill (1963), Wittmann (1969), Hodge (1970), Giv√≥n (1971), Lakoff (1972), Vennemann (1975) and Reighard (1978).\n\nTo the extent that a language is vocabulary cast into the mould of a particular syntax and that the basic structure of the sentence is held together by functional items, with the lexical items filling in the blanks, syntactic change is no doubt what modifies most deeply the physiognomy of a particular language. Syntactic change affects grammar in its morphological and syntactic aspects and is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to cyclic drift.\n\nThe view that the genesis of creole languages or other natural languages may be the product of catastrophism is heavily disputed by all authors as incompatible with drift.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "939703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=939703", "title": "Dyscrasia", "text": "Dyscrasia\n\nDyscrasia (or dyskrasia) is a concept from ancient Greek medicine, meaning bad mixture.\n\nThe concept of dyscrasia was developed by the Greek physician Galen (129‚Äì216 AD), who elaborated a model of health and disease as a structure of elements, qualities, humors, organs, and temperaments. Health was understood in this perspective to be a condition of harmony or balance among these basic components, called eucrasia. Disease was interpreted as the disproportion of bodily fluids or four humours: phlegm, blood, and yellow and black bile. The imbalance was called \"dyscrasia\".\n\nTo the Greeks, it meant an imbalance of the four humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and water (phlegm). These humors were believed to exist in the body, and any change in the balance among the four of them was the direct cause of all disease.\n\nThis is similar to the concepts of bodily humors in the Tibetan medical tradition and the Indian Ayurvedic system, which both relate health and disease to the balance and imbalance of the three bodily humors, generally translated as wind, bile, and phlegm. This is also similar to the Chinese concept of yin and yang that an imbalance of the two polarities caused ailment.\n\nIt is still occasionally used in medical context for an unspecified disorder of the blood. Specifically, it is defined in current medicine as a morbid general state resulting from the presence of abnormal material in the blood, usually applied to diseases affecting blood cells or platelets. Evidence of dyscrasia can be present with a WBC (White Blood Cell) count of over 1,000,000.\n\n\"Plasma cell dyscrasia\" is sometimes considered synonymous with paraproteinemia or monoclonal gammopathy.\n\nH2 receptor antagonists such as Famotidine and Nizatidine, in use for treatment of peptic ulcer, are known for causing blood dyscrasia - leading to bone marrow failure in 1 out of 50,000 patients.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "479373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479373", "title": "Eraser", "text": "Eraser\n\nAn eraser, (also called a rubber outside the United States, from the material first used) is an article of stationery that is used for removing writing from paper or skin. Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are vinyl, plastic, or gum-like materials.\n\nAt first, erasers were made to erase mistakes made with a pencil; later, more abrasive ink erasers were introduced. The term is also used for things that remove writing from chalkboards and whiteboards. Ink erasers are denser, allowing them to erase pen marks.\n\nBefore rubber erasers, tablets of wax were used to erase lead or charcoal marks from paper. Bits of rough stone such as sandstone or pumice were used to remove small errors from parchment or papyrus documents written in ink. Crustless bread was used as an eraser in the past; a Meiji-era (1868-1912) Tokyo student said: \"Bread erasers were used in place of rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction on amount. So we thought nothing of taking these and eating a firm part to at least slightly satisfy our hunger. \"\n\nIn 1770 English engineer Edward Nairne is reported to have developed the first widely marketed rubber eraser, for an inventions competition. Until that time the material was known as \"gum elastic\" or by its Native American name (via French) \"caoutchouc\". Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber's erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers. The invention was described by Joseph Priestley on April 15, 1770, in a footnote: \"I have seen a substance excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the mark of black-lead-pencil. ... It is sold by Mr. Nairne, Mathematical Instrument-Maker, opposite the Royal-Exchange.\" In 1770 the word \"rubber\" was in general use for any object used for rubbing; the word became attached to the new material sometime between 1770 and 1778.\n\nHowever, raw rubber was perishable. In 1839 Charles Goodyear discovered the process of vulcanization, a method that would cure rubber, making it durable. Rubber erasers became common with the advent of vulcanization.\n\nOn March 30, 1858, Hymen Lipman of Philadelphia, USA, received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. It was later invalidated because it was determined to be simply a composite of two devices rather than an entirely new product.\n\nErasers may be free-standing blocks (\"block\" and \"wedge eraser\"), or conical caps that can slip onto the end of a pencil (\"cap eraser\"). A \"barrel\" or \"click eraser\" is a device shaped like a pencil, but instead of being filled with pencil lead, its barrel contains a retractable cylinder of eraser material (most commonly soft vinyl). Many, but not all, wooden pencils are made with attached erasers. Novelty erasers made in shapes intended to be amusing are often made of hard vinyl, which tends to smear heavy markings when used as an eraser.\n\nOriginally made from natural rubber, but now usually from cheaper SBR, this type contains mineral fillers and an abrasive such as pumice with a plasticizer such as vegetable oil. They are relatively hard (in order to remain attached to the pencil) and frequently coloured pink.\n\nThe stylized word \"Artgum\" was first used in 1903 and trademarked in the USA in 1907. That type of eraser was originally made from oils such as corn oil vulcanized with sulfur dichloride although may now be made from natural or synthetic rubber or vinyl compounds. It is very soft yet retains its shape and is not mechanically plastic, instead crumbling as it is used. It is especially suited to cleaning large areas without damaging paper. However, they are so soft as to be imprecise in use. The removed graphite is carried away in the crumbles, leaving the eraser clean, but resulting in a lot of eraser residue. This residue must then be brushed away with care, as the eraser particles are coated with the graphite and can make new marks. Art gum erasers are traditionally tan or brown, but some are blue.\n\nHigh-quality plasticized vinyl or other \"plastic\" erasers, originally trademarked \"Mylar\" in the mid-20th century, are softer, non-abrasive, and erase cleaner than standard rubber erasers. This is because the removed graphite does not remain on the eraser as much as rubber erasers, but is instead absorbed into the discarded vinyl scraps. Being softer and non-abrasive, they are less likely to damage canvas or paper. Engineers favor this type of eraser for work on technical drawings due to their gentleness on paper with less smearing to surrounding areas. They often come in white and can be found in a variety of shapes. More recently, very low-cost erasers are manufactured from highly plasticized vinyl compounds and made in decorative shapes.\n\nKneaded erasers have a plastic consistency and are common to most artists' standard toolkit. They can be pulled into a point for erasing small areas and tight detail erasing, molded into a textured surface and used like a reverse stamp to give texture, or used in a \"blotting\" manner to lighten lines or shading without completely erasing them. They gradually lose their efficacy and resilience as they become infused with particles picked up from erasing and from their environment. They are not suited to erase large areas because of their tendency to deform under vigorous erasing.\n\nCommonly sold in retail outlets with school supplies and home improvement products, this soft, malleable putty appears in many colours and under numerous brand names. Intended to adhere posters and prints to walls without damaging the underlying wall surface, poster putty works much the same as traditional kneaded erasers, but with a greater tack and in some circumstances, lifting strength. Poster putty does not erase so much as lighten by directly pulling particles of graphite, charcoal or pastel from a drawing. In this regard, poster putty does not smudge or damage work in the process. Repeatedly touching the putty to a drawing pulls ever more medium free, gradually lightening the work in a controlled fashion. Poster putty can be shaped into fine points or knife edges, making it ideal for detailed or small areas of work. It can be rolled across a surface to create visual textures. Poster putty loses its efficacy with use, becoming less tacky as the material grows polluted with debris and oils from the user's skin.\n\nThe electric eraser was invented in 1932 by Arthur Dremel of Racine, Wisconsin, USA. It used a replaceable cylinder of eraser material held by a chuck driven on the axis of a motor. The speed of rotation allowed less pressure to be used, which minimized paper damage. Originally standard pencil-eraser rubber was used, later replaced by higher-performance vinyl. Dremel went on to develop an entire line of hand-held rotary power tools.\n\nA fibreglass eraser, a bundle of very fine glass fibres, can be used for erasing and other tasks requiring abrasion. Typically the eraser is a pen-shaped device with a replaceable insert with glass fibres, which wear down in use. The fibres are very hard; in addition to removing pencil and pen markings, such erasers are used for cleaning traces on electronic circuit boards to facilitate soldering, removing rust, and many other applications. As an example of an unusual use, a fibreglass eraser was used for preparing an archaeological fossil embedded in a very hard and massive limestone.\n\nFelt chalkboard erasers or blackboard dusters are used to erase chalk markings on a chalkboard. Chalk writing leaves light-coloured particles weakly adhering to a dark surface (e.g., white on black, or yellow on green); it can be rubbed off with a soft material, such as a rag. Erasers for chalkboards are made, with a block of plastic or wood, much larger than an eraser for pen or pencil, with a layer of felt on one side. The block is held in the hand and the felt rubbed against the writing, which it easily wipes off. Chalk dust is released, some of which sticks to the eraser until it is cleaned, usually by hitting it against a hard surface.\n\nVarious types of eraser, depending upon the board and the type of ink used, are used to erase a whiteboard.\n\nDedicated erasers that are supplied with some ballpens and permanent markers are intended only to erase the ink of the writing instrument they are made for; sometimes this is done by making the ink bond more strongly to the material of an eraser than the surface it was applied to.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10402", "title": "Esperanto grammar", "text": "Esperanto grammar\n\nEsperanto is a constructed language. It is designed to have a highly regular grammar, and as such is considered an easy language to learn.\n\nEach part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with \"‚Äëo\"; adjectives with \"‚Äëa\"; present‚Äëtense indicative verbs with \"‚Äëas\", and so on.\n\nIt is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 \"meaning words\", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.\n\nReference grammars include the \"\" () by K√°lm√°n Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien, and the \"Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko\" () by Bertilo Wennergren.\n\nEsperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the indicative has three tenses, and are derived for several aspects, but do not agree with the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects information flow and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.\n\nEsperanto uses the Latin alphabet with six additional lettersƒâ, ƒù, ƒ•, ƒµ, ≈ù, and ≈≠and does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.\n\nZamenhof suggested Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation.\n\nEsperanto has a single definite article, \"la\", which is invariable. It is similar to English \"the\".\n\n\"La\" is used:\n\nThe article is also used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a possessive adjective:\n\nThe article \"la\", like the demonstrative adjective \"tiu\" (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the noun phrase.\n\nThere is no grammatically required indefinite article: \"homo\" means either \"human being\" or \"a human being\", depending on the context, and similarly the plural \"homoj\" means \"human beings\" or \"some human beings\". The words \"iu\" and \"unu\" (or their plurals \"iuj\" and \"unuj\") may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to \"some\" and \"a certain\" than to English \"a\". This use of \"unu\" corresponds to English \"a\" when the \"a\" indicates a specific individual.\n\nThe suffixes \"‚Äëo\", \"‚Äëa\", \"‚Äëe\", and \"‚Äëi\" indicate that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word \"vidi\" (to see) are \"vida\" (visual), \"vide\" (visually), and \"vido\" (vision).\n\nEach root word has an inherent part of speech: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix \"‚Äëo\" indicates an abstraction: \"parolo\" (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root \"paroli\" (to speak); \"belo\" (beauty) from the adjectival root \"bela\" (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix \"‚Äëa\": \"reƒùa\" (royal), from the nominal root \"reƒùo\" (a king); \"parola\" (spoken). The various verbal endings mean \"to be [__]\" when added to an adjectival root: \"beli\" (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean \"to act as\" the noun, \"to use\" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: \"reƒùi\" (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in \"-e\" are derived: \"bele\" (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a prepositional phrase: \"parole\" (by speech, orally); \"vide\" (by sight, visually); \"reƒùe\" (like a king, royally).\n\nThe meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, \"brosi\" (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry \"broso),\" whereas \"kombi\" (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under \"kombi).\" Change the suffix to \"-o,\" and the similar meanings of \"brosi\" and \"kombi\" diverge: \"broso\" is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas \"kombo\" is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal \"kombi\" (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix \"-ilo\" is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: \"kombilo\" (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root \"broso\" (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, \"brosi\" (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix \"-ado\" will change a derived verb back to a noun: \"brosado\" (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix \"-eco,\" as in \"infaneco\" (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal \"-o: belo\" (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as \"beleco\" are acceptable and widely used.\n\nA limited number of basic adverbs do not end with \"-e,\" but with an undefined part-of-speech ending \"-a≈≠\". Not all words ending in \"-a≈≠\" are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in \"-a≈≠\" have other functions, such as \"hodia≈≠\" \"today\" [noun or adverb] or \"ankora≈≠\" \"yet, still\" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as \"nun\" \"now\", \"tro\" \"too, too much\", not counting the adverbs among the correlatives. (See special Esperanto adverbs.)\n\nOther parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions \"(al\" \"to\"), conjunctions \"(kaj\" \"and\"), interjections \"(ho\" \"oh\"), numerals \"(du\" \"two\"), and pronouns \"(mi\" \"I\"‚ÄîThe final \"-i\" found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical \"particles\" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as \"ne\" (not), \"anka≈≠\" (also), \"nur\" (only), \"eƒâ\" (even).\n\nA suffix \"-j\" following the noun or adjective suffixes \"-o\" or \"-a\" makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a countable noun is understood to be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix \"-n,\" which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence \"-ojn\" rhymes with English \"coin,\" and \"-ajn\" rhymes with \"fine.)\"\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they modify are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare \"bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn\" (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb or verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject clauses:\n\nAgreement clarifies the syntax in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:\n\nA predicative adjective does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:\n\nThere are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal \"(vi\" \"you plural\"), demonstrative \"(tio\" \"that\", \"iu\" \"someone\"), and relative/interrogative \"(kio\" \"what\").\nAccording to the fifth rule of the \"Fundamento de Esperanto\":\n\nThe Esperanto personal pronoun system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a reflexive pronoun.\n\nPersonal pronouns take the accusative suffix \"-n\" as nouns do: \"min\" (me), \"lin\" (him), \"≈ùin\" (her). Possessive adjectives are formed with the adjectival suffix \"-a: mia\" (my), \"ƒùia\" (its), \"nia\" (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: \"ni salutis liajn amikojn\" (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: \"la mia\" (mine).\n\nThe reflexive pronoun is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:\n\nThe indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject \"it\" with a passive verb,\nWith \"impersonal\" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:\n\nThe rain is falling by itself, therefore the subject pronoun is omitted.\n\n\"ƒúi\" (\"it\"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an epicene (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender. However, this proposal is not generally accepted.\n\nIn popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:\nWhen speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun \"tiu\" (\"that thing or person that is already known to the listener\") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence\nthe word \"tiu\" would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns \"this\" or \"that\" but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of \"ƒùi\", \"li\" or \"≈ùi.\"\n\nThe demonstrative and relative pronouns form part of the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in \"-o\" (simple pronouns) and \"-u\" (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in \"-n,\" but the genitive case ends in \"-es,\" which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases \"lia domo\" (his house) and \"ties domo\" (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural \"liaj domoj (his houses) and \"ties domoj (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive \"lian domon\" and \"ties domon.\"\n\nAlthough Esperanto word order is fairly free, prepositions must come at the beginning of a noun phrase. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various cases (accusative, dative, \"and so on),\" in Esperanto all prepositions govern the nominative: \"por Johano\" (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is \"replaced\" by the accusative.\n\nPrepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition \"je\" should be used:\n\nAlternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:\n\nNote that although \"la trian\" (the third) is in the accusative, \"de majo\" (of May) is still a prepositional phrase, and so the noun \"majo\" remains in the nominative case.\n\nA frequent use of the accusative is in place of \"al\" (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion (allative construction). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:\n\nThe accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:\n\nBoth \"por\" and \"pro\" often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish \"for a goal\" (looking forward in time, or causing: \"por\") and \"for a cause\" (looking back in time, or being caused by: \"pro\"): To vote \"por\" your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote \"pro\" your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.\n\nThe preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps \"de\", which corresponds to English \"of, from, off,\" and \"(done) by\":\n\nHowever, English \"of\" corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: \"de, el\" (out of, made of), and \"da\" (quantity of, unity of form and contents):\nThe last of these, \"da\", is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.\n\nOccasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare root may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from \"fari\" (to do, to make) we get the preposition \"far\" (done by).\n\nAll verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the indicative mood. The other moods are the infinitive, conditional, and jussive. No aspectual distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of Aktionsart are common.\n\nVerbs do not change form according to their subject. \"I am, we are,\" and \"he is\" are simply \"mi estas, ni estas,\" and \"li estas,\" respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: \"pluvas\" (it is raining); \"estas muso en la domo\" (there's a mouse in the house).\n\nMost verbs are inherently transitive or intransitive. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes \"-ig-\" (the transitivizer/causative) and \"-iƒù-\" (the intransitivizer/middle voice):\n\nThe tenses have characteristic vowels. \"A\" indicates the present tense, \"i\" the past, and \"o\" the future.\n\nThe verbal forms may be illustrated with the root \"esper-\" (hope):\n\nA verb can be made emphatic with the particle \"ja\" (indeed): \"mi ja esperas\" (I do hope), \"mi ja esperis\" (I did hope).\n\nAs in English, Esperanto present tense may be used for generic statements such as \"birds fly\" (\"la birdoj flugas\").\n\nThe Esperanto future is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English \"(I'll give it to you) when I see you\" the verb \"see\" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: \"(Mi donos ƒùin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin\".\n\nEsperanto tense is relative. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a subordinate verb is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, \"John said that he would go\" is in Esperanto \"Johano diris, ke li iros\" (lit., \"John said that he will go\"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as \"John said that he will go\" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.\n\nThe conditional mood is used for such expressions as \"se mi povus, mi irus\" (if I could, I would go) and \"se mi estus vi, mi irus\" (if I were you, I'd go).\n\nThe jussive mood, is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the imperative and subjunctive:\n\nThe verb \"esti\" (to be) is both the copula (\"X is Y\") and the existential (\"there is\") verb. As a copula linking two noun phrases, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with \"esti\" can be semantically important: compare \"hundoj estas personoj\" (dogs are people) and \"personoj estas hundoj\" (people are dogs).\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common to replace \"esti\"-plus-adjective with a verb: \"la ƒâielo estas blua\" or \"la ƒâielo bluas\" (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.\n\nParticiples are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:\ntimes\nThe participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: i, a, o. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing voice, with either nt or t following the vowel (see next section).\n\nThe basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb \"fali\" (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are \"falonta\" (about to fall). As they drop, they are \"falanta\" (falling). After they hit the ground, they are \"falinta\" (fallen).\n\nActive and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb \"haki\" (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is \"hakonta\" (about to chop) and the tree is \"hakota\" (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is \"hakanta\" (chopping) and the tree \"hakata\" (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is \"hakinta\" (having chopped) and the tree \"hakita\" (chopped).\n\nAdjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:\n\nCompound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus \"esti\" (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:\n\nThese are not used as often as their English equivalents. For \"I \"am\" go\"ing\" to the store\", you would normally use the simple present \"mi iras\" in Esperanto.\n\nThe tense and mood of \"esti\" can be changed in these compound tenses:\n\nAlthough such periphrastic constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [\"esti\" + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:\n\nThe active synthetic forms are:\nInfinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably \"-intus\" and \"-atas\", entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.\n\nParticiples may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix \"-a\" with \"-e\" or \"-o.\" This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.\n\nA nominal participle indicates \"one who participates\" in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, \"esperinto\" is a \"hoper\" (past tense), or \"one who had been hoping.\"\n\nAdverbial participles are used with subjectless clauses:\n\nOccasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel \"u (-unt-, -ut-).\" If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be \"hakunta\" and the tree \"hakuta\" (he, the one \"who would chop\", and the tree, the one that \"would be chopped\").\n\nThis can also be illustrated with the verb \"prezidi\" (to preside). Just after the recount of the 2000 United States presidential election:\n\nThe tense-neutral word \"prezidento\" is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb \"prezidi.\"\n\nA statement is made negative by using \"ne\" or one of the negative \"(neni-)\" correlatives. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:\n\nTwo negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.\n\nThe word \"ne\" comes before the word it negates:\n\nThe latter will frequently be reordered as \"ne tion mi skribis\" depending on the flow of information.\n\n\"Wh\" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative \"(ki-\") correlatives. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:\n\nYes/no questions are marked with the conjunction \"ƒâu\" (whether):\n\nSuch questions can be answered \"jes\" (yes) or \"ne\" (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or \"ƒùuste\" (correct) or \"malƒùuste\" (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:\n\nNote that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.\n\nBasic Esperanto conjunctions are \"kaj\" (both/and), \"a≈≠\" (either/or), \"nek\" (neither/nor), \"se\" (if), \"ƒâu\" (whether/or), \"sed\" (but), \"anstata≈≠\" (instead of), \"krom\" (besides, in addition to), \"kiel\" (like, as), \"ke\" (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:\n\nHowever, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from Don Harlow:\n\nInterjections may be derived from bare affixes or roots: \"ek!\" (get going!), from the perfective prefix; \"um\" (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; \"fek!\" (shit!), from \"feki\" (to defecate).\n\nEsperanto derivational morphology uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root \"vid-\" (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: \"see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant\" etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.\n\nThe cardinal numerals are:\n\nThese are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, \"unu\" (and only \"unu\") is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning \"a certain\", and in such cases it may take the plural affix \"-j,\" just as the demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\" does:\nIn such use \"unu\" is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix \"-n\" in the singular, but does in the plural:\nbut\nAdditionally, when counting off, the final \"u\" of \"unu\" may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:\n\nAt numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots \"miliono\" (million) and \"miliardo\" (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A \"billion\" in most English-speaking countries is different from a \"billion\" in most other countries (10 \"vs.\" 10 respectively; that is, a thousand million \"vs.\" a million million). The international root \"biliono\" is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix \"-iliono\" to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix \"-iliardo:\"\n\nNote that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: \"mil homojn\" (a thousand people [accusative]) but \"milionon da homoj\" (a million people [accusative]).\n\nNumerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (\"dudek\" 20, \"dek du\" 12, \"dudek du\" 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix \"-a,\" quantities with the nominal suffix \"-o,\" multiples with \"-obl-,\" fractions with \"‚Äëon‚Äë\", collectives with \"‚Äëop‚Äë\", and repetitions with the root \"‚Äëfoj‚Äë\".\n\nThe particle \"po\" is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the logogram @ is not used (except in email addresses, of course):\n\nNote that particle \"po\" forms a phrase with the numeral \"tri\" and is not a preposition for the noun phrase \"tri pomojn,\" so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.\n\nComparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives \"tiel ... kiel\" (as ... as), the adverbial roots \"pli\" (more) and \"plej\" (most), the antonym prefix \"mal-,\" and the preposition \"ol\" (than):\n\nImplied comparisons are made with \"tre\" (very) and \"tro\" (too [much]).\n\nPhrases like \"The more people, the smaller the portions\" and \"All the better!\" are translated using \"ju\" and \"des\" in place of \"the\":\n\nEsperanto has a fairly flexible word order. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle \"ne\" generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):\nHowever, when the entire clause is negated, the \"ne\" may be left till last:\n\nThe last order reflects a typical topic‚Äìcomment (or theme‚Äìrheme) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, \"ne iris mi\", would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and \"mi\" is given as an example of one who did not go.\n\nCompare:\n\nWithin a noun phrase, either the order \"adjective‚Äìnoun\" or \"noun‚Äìadjective\" may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with \"numeral‚Äìnoun\" and \"demonstrative‚Äìnoun\" being the norm, as in English.\n\nAdjective‚Äìnoun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective‚Äìnoun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:\n\nAdjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:\nChanging the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative \"nenio\" 'nothing':\n\nWith multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun‚Äìnumeral‚Äì(adjective/noun):\n\nHowever, the article \"la\" precedes a noun phrase:\n\nIn prepositional phrases, the preposition is \"required\" to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article \"la\"), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:\n\nConstituent order \"within\" a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.\n\nThe default order is subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject, though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:\nThe expectation of a topic‚Äìcomment (theme‚Äìrheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in \"la katon ƒâasis la hundo\", the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in \"la hundo la katon ƒâasis\", the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in \"ƒâasis la hundo la katon\", the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.\n\nContext is required to tell whether\nmeans the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with\nand\n\nOf course, if it chases the cat in\"to\" the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:\n\nWithin copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. Copulas are words such as \"esti\" 'be', \"iƒùi\" 'become', \"resti\" 'remain', and \"≈ùajni\" 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.\n\nGenerally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:\nHowever, \"la vento sovaƒùa estas\" is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.\n\nIn the sentence above, \"la hundo ƒâasis la katon, kiu estis en la ƒùardeno\" 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the relative pronoun \"kiu\" 'which' is restricted to a position \"after\" the noun 'cat'. In general, relative clauses and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.\n\nAttributive prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (\"la libro de Johano\" 'John's book') as well as \"la kato en la ƒùardeno\" 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither \"*la de Johano libro\" nor \"*la en la ƒùardeno kato\" is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both \"ƒâasis en la ƒùardeno\" and \"en la ƒùardeno ƒâasis\" are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.\n\nRelative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a relative pronoun such as \"kiu\" 'which':\nNote that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs. However, they do agree in number:\n\nOther word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:\n\nCoordinate clauses allow flexible word order, but tend to be iconic. For example, in\nthe inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:\nThis distinction is lost in subordinate clauses such as the relative clauses in the previous section:\nIn written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.\n\nNon-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the conjunction \"ke\" 'that', as in,\n\nEsperanto's vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically Romance or Germanic in origin. The semantics shows a significant Slavic influence.\n\nIt is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is \"song sing sang sung.\" However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as \"cat, cats\" and \"walk, walked\" do in English. (This is the so-called strong‚Äìweak dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as \"pli\", \"plej\", \"plu\" (more, most, further), \"tre\", \"tro\" (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes \"‚Äëas\", \"‚Äëanta\", \"‚Äëata\"; \"‚Äëis\", \"‚Äëinta\", \"‚Äëita\"; \"‚Äëos\", \"‚Äëonta\", \"‚Äëota\"; and \"‚Äëus\".\n\nOther features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the \"-o\" suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‚ÄëEuropean languages such as Russian. More pertinent is the accusative plural in \"-jn\". Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‚ÄëIndo‚ÄëEuropean Hungarian and Turkish languages‚Äîthat is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed \"non-European\" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.\n\nEast Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as \"la ƒâielo bluas\" (the sky is blue) for \"la ƒâielo estas blua\" and \"mia filino belu!\" (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the \"mia filino estu bela!\" mentioned above.\n\nThe Pater noster, from the first Esperanto publication in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:\n\nThe morphologically complex words (see Esperanto word formation) are:\n\n"}
{"id": "371333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371333", "title": "Fijian language", "text": "Fijian language\n\nFijian (\"\") is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-Polynesian family spoken by some 350,000‚Äì450,000 ethnic Fijians as a native language. The 2013 Constitution established Fijian as an official language of Fiji, along with English and Hindi, and there is discussion about establishing it as the \"national language\", though English and Hindi would remain official. Fijian is a VOS language.\n\nStandard Fijian is based on the speech of Bau, which is an East Fijian language.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Fijian are as shown in the following table:\n\nThe consonant written has been described as a prenasalized trill or trilled fricative . However, it is only rarely pronounced with a trilled release; the primary feature distinguishing it from is that it is postalveolar, , rather than dental/alveolar.\n\nThe sounds and occur only in loanwords from other languages. The sounds and only occur for speakers from certain regions of the country.\n\nNote the difference in place of articulation between the voiced-voiceless fricative pairs: bilabial vs. labiodental , and dental vs. alveolar .\n\nThe vowel phonemes are:\n\nIn addition, there is the rising diphthong .\n\nSyllables can consist of a consonant followed by a vowel (CV) or a single vowel (V).\nWord stress is based on moras: a short vowel is one mora, diphthongs and long vowels are two morae. Primary stress is on the penultimate mora of the phonological word. That is, if the last syllable of a word is short, then the penultimate syllable will be stressed, while if the last syllable contains either a long vowel or a diphthong, then it receives primary stress. Stress is not lexical and can shift when suffixes are attached to the root.\nExamples:\n\nThe Fijian alphabet is based on the Latin script and consists of the following letters.\nAmong the consonants, there is almost a one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes:\n\nNote that for phonological reasons ti and di are pronounced , rather than , (cf. Japanese chi kana). Hence, the Fijian name for Fiji, Viti, from an allophonic pronunciation of as .\n\nIn addition, the digraph dr stands for postalveolar , or a prenasalized trill in careful pronunciation, or more commonly for some people and in some dialects.\n\nThe vowel letters a e i o u have roughly their IPA values, . The vowel length contrast is not usually indicated in writing, except in dictionaries and textbooks for learners of the language, where it is indicated by a macron over the vowel in question; Dixon, in the work cited below, doubles all long vowels in his spelling system. Diphthongs are \"ai au ei eu oi ou\" and \"iu,\" pronounced .\n\nThe pronominal system of Fijian is remarkably rich. Like many other languages, it recognises three persons; first person (speaker),\nsecond person (addressee), and third person (all other). There is no distinction between human, non-human, animate, or inanimate. \nFour numbers are represented; singular, dual, paucal, and plural‚Äî'paucal' refers to more than two people who have some relationship, as a family or work group; if none, 'plural' is used. Like many other Oceanic languages, Fijian pronouns are marked for number and clusivity.\n\nEach pronoun can have five forms, but some person-number\ncombinations may have the same form for more than one function, as can be seen\nin the table above.\n\nThe forms are:\n\nCardinal ‚Äì used\nwhen a pronoun occurs as the head of a NP. A cardinal pronoun is usually\npreceded by the proper article \"'o\"',\nexcept when preceded by a preposition:\n\nSubject ‚Äì the\nfirst constituent of a predicate, acts as person marking. Examples can be seen in examples (1) and (2) above: '\"era\"' and '\"au\"', and (3) below: \"'o\"'\n\nObject ‚Äì follows\nthe \"-i\"-final form of a transitive verb:\n\nPossessive suffix\n‚Äì attaches to inalienable nouns, and\n\nPossessive ‚Äì\nprecedes the NP head of the 'possessed' constituent in a possessive\nconstruction.\n\n(For more information on the form and function of these possessive\npronouns, see Possession.)\n\nThe major clausal structure in Fijian minimally includes a\npredicate, which usually has a verb at its head. The initial element\nin the predicate is the subject form pronoun:\n\nThis 'subject marker + verb' predicate construction is\nobligatory, every other constituent is optional. The subject may be expanded\nupon by a NP following the predicate:\nThe subject pronoun constituent of a predicate acts mainly as a person marker.\n\nFijian is a verb‚Äìobject‚Äìsubject language, and the subject pronoun may be translated as its\nequivalent in English, the subject NP of a clause in Fijian follows the verb\nand the object if it is included.\n\nThe social use of pronouns is largely driven by respect and hierarchy. Each of the non-singular second person pronouns can be used for a singular addressee. For example, if one's actual or potential in-laws are addressed, the\n2DU pronoun should be used. Similarly, when a brother or sister of\nthe opposite sex is addressed, the 2PA pronoun should be used, and it can also be used\nfor same-sex siblings when the speaker wishes to show respect. The 2PL pronoun\ncan be used to show respect to elders, particularly the village chief.\n\nPossession is a grammatical term for a special relationship between two entities: a \"possessor\" and a \"possessed\". The relationship may be one of legal ownership, but in Fijian, like many other Austronesian languages, it is often much broader, encompassing kin relations, body parts, parts of an inanimate whole and personal qualities and concepts such as control, association and belonging.\n\nFijian has a complex system of possessive constructions, depending on the nature of the possessor and of the possessed. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on knowing whether the possessor is described by a person or placename; a pronoun; or a common noun (with human or non-human animate, or inanimate reference) and also on whether the possessed is a free noun or a bound noun.\n\nOnly an animate noun may be a possessor in the true possessive constructions shown below, with possession marked on the possessed NP in a number of ways. For personal and place name possessors, the possessive construction may be made by affixing the possessive suffix \"‚Äìi\" to the possessed noun, bound or free. If the possessor is a pronoun, the possessed noun must be marked by one of the pronominal markers which specify person, number and inclusivity/exclusivity (see table). If the possessor is inanimate, the possessive particle \"ni\" is usually placed between the possessed NP and the possessor NP. The particle \"ni\" then indicates association, rather than formal possession, but the construction is still regarded as a possessive construction.\n\nFree nouns can stand alone and need no affix; most nouns in Fijian fall into this class. Bound nouns require a suffix to complete them and are written ending in a hyphen to indicate this requirement. \"Tama-\" (father) and \"tina-\" (mother) are examples of bound nouns. The classes of free and bound nouns roughly correspond with the concept, common in Austronesian languages, of alienable and inalienable possession, respectively. Alienable possession denotes a relationship in which the thing possessed is not culturally considered an inherent part of the possessor, and inalienable possession indicates a relationship in which the possessed is regarded as an intrinsic part of the possessor.\n\nBody parts and kin relations are typical examples of inalienable possession. Inanimate objects are typical examples of alienable possession.\n\nThe alienable nature of free nouns is further marked by prefixes, known as classifiers, indicating certain other characteristics. Some common examples are \"me-\" when the possessed noun is something drinkable, \"ke-\" (or \"‚Äòe\") when the noun is something edible and \"we-\" when the referent of the possessed noun is personal property.\n\nThe word order of a possessive construction for all except inanimate possessors is possessed NP-classifier(CLF) + possessive marker (POSS) + possessor NP.\n\nFor an inanimate possessor, the word order is possessed NP + \"ni\" + possessor NP.\n\nNote that there is some degree of flexibility in the use of possessive constructions as described in this table.\n\n\nThe normal Fijian word order is VOS (verb‚Äìobject‚Äìsubject):\n\nIn May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded. It was not an official language before the adoption of the 1997 Constitution, which made it co-official with English and Fiji Hindi. It is still not a compulsory subject in schools, however; the present Education Minister, Ro Teimumu Kepa, has endorsed calls for it to be made so, as has Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Ovini Bokini. Similar calls came from Misiwini Qereqeretabua, the Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture, and from Apolonia Tamata, a linguistics lecturer at Suva's University of the South Pacific, who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity and as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.\n\nFiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject if the same status be given to Fiji Hindi, a position echoed by Krishna Vilas of the National Reconciliation Committee.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied Islamic law, philosophy, theology, physics and mathematics at the University of Baghdad in the 1950s. In 1956, he prepared a stenciled script on algebra and in 1960, succeeded in publishing the first physics book in Kurdish, including a rich glossary of Kurdish terms pertaining to physics and mathematics. He has translated several literary works, including works of Nikolai Gogol and William Shakespeare into Kurdish. He has also written and published several books on a variety of topics. Most of the books are mainly about topics related to Kurds.\n\nParallel to attending the state schools, he had the opportunity to study Islamic law, philosophy and theology. He studied physics and mathematics at the science faculty at the Teachers' Training Faculty at the University of Baghdad in the first half of the 1950s. From October 1955 to 1961, Nebez was a secondary school teacher of physics and math. For three years, he taught in Iraqi Kurdistan; first in Kirkuk and then in Arbil. Then he taught for three years in Basrah and Baghdad. In the summer of 1956, Nebez travelled to Syria and Lebanon, where he met many Kurdish intellectuals, poets and writers who worked and published in Kurdish. In the summer of 1957, he travelled to Iranian Kurdistan and Tehran. Just like in Lebanon, he also met many intellectuals in Iranian Kurdistan. He met the famous Kurdish cleric and writer, Ayatollah Mohammed Mardokh-i Kurdistani (1885‚Äì1975) whom he agreed with to serve the Kurdish language and culture.\n\nIn 1962, he left for Europe to pursue his studies in pedagogy, Iranology, and Islamic studies. He attended the Universities of Munich, W√ºrzburg and the University of Hamburg. He also studied political science, journalism and law at the Free University of Berlin. In 1965, while a student in Munich, he jointly founded the National Union of the Kurdish Students in Europe (NUKSE) with his partisan friends Brusk Ibrahim and Latif Ali. In 1985, he and other emigrants from Kurdistan, mostly academics, scientists, literates and artists founded the Kurdish Academy of Science and Arts, which was based in Stockholm.\n\nIn the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s Jemal held several positions.

Henning was preparing a dictionary of Khwarazmian when he died, leaving it unfinished.\n\nBefore the advance of Islam in Transoxiana (early 8th century), Khwarazmian was written in a script close to that of Sogdian and Pahlavi with its roots in the imperial Aramaic script. From the few surviving examples of this script on coins and artifacts it has been observed that written Khwarazmian included Aramaic logograms or ideograms, that is Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones.\n\nAfter the advance of Islam, Khwarazmian was written using an adapted version of the Perso-Arabic alphabet with a few extra signs to reflect specific Khwarazmian sounds, such as the letter ⁄Ö, which represents /ts/ and /dz/, as in the traditional Pashto orthography.\n\n\n"}

Both languages belong to the larger Afro-Asiatic family.\n\nThere are three official languages in Djibouti: Somali, Arabic and French. Arabic is of religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of Modern Standard Arabic. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect, also known as \"Djibouti Arabic\". French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 17,000 Djiboutians speak it as a first language.\n\nImmigrant languages include Omani Arabic (38,900 speakers), Amharic (1,400 speakers), Greek (1,000 speakers) and Hindi (600 speakers).\n\nAdditionally, the Somali deaf community in Djibouti uses the Somali Sign Language.\n\nThe Somali language is regulated by the Regional Somali Language Academy, an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 in Djibouti City by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.\n\nNationally, the Latin script is the most widely used orthography for all languages. The Somali alphabet, a modified form of the script, is used to write Somali. In the early 1970s, two Afar intellectuals and nationalists, Dimis and Redo, formalized a similar Afar alphabet.

The language was purportedly once spoken by the Oropom people in northeastern Uganda and northwestern Kenya between the Turkwel River, the Chemorongit Mountains, and Mount Elgon. There is only one article containing any original research on the language, Wilson 1970, which only a handful of other articles discuss. Wilson's article furnishes only a short word list, and was written at a time when the language, if it existed, was nearly extinct. The article was based mainly on the limited memories of two very old women, one \"a child of one of the residual Oropom families that had remained after the break-up of the Oropom here (Matheniko county)\" who \"remembered a few words of the language\", the other an old lady called Akol \"descended from the prisoners taken by the Karimojong on the Turkwel\" who was \"able to furnish many Oropom words\". Under the circumstances, only the barest details of Oropom could be ascertained.\n\nOn this basis, Wilson concluded that it must have had at least two dialects: one spoken around the Turkwel area, containing a significant number of Luo words, and some Bantu words, and one spoken around Matheniko county with fewer Luo words. Both contain Kalenjin loanwords.\n\nWilson ascribed it to the Khoisan group, seemingly based solely on its physical appearance; but this identification is unreliable; Harold Fleming describes it as a \"ridiculous suggestion\". Elderkin 1983 says that \"The Oropom data of Wilson (1970) shows some resemblances to Kuliak, some of which could well be mediated through Nilotic, with which it seems to have more resemblances (F. Rottland, personal communication)... There are many fewer resemblances worth noting with Hadza and only a minimal number with Sandawe.\" He quotes 8 potentially similar words between Oropom and Hadza, and 4 between Oropom and Sandawe. Harold Fleming also notes that \"initial inspection suggests some possible commonality\" between Oropom and the Kuliak languages, a probably Nilo-Saharan relic group found in Northern Uganda among such tribes as the Ik. However, in the absence of further work, Oropom remains an unclassified language.\n\nBernd Heine, who surveyed the area less than ten years after Wilson and found no trace of the language, expressed skepticism that it existed at all. Both Lionel Bender and Roger Blench have opined that the language was made up as a joke. Souag 2004 lists several motives Wilson's informants might have had to fabricate the language, and observes that even in his article, Wilson notes that he had to deal with \"charlatans\" once word got out that he was looking for anyone with knowledge of the language.\n\nThis wordlist, taken from the appendix to Wilson 1970, is based on Akol's memories (and thus is considered by Wilson as belonging to the \"Turkwell dialect\"). He says that he collected words from the other dialect as well, but apparently never published them. The list consists of less than a hundred words, which are likely to be all the vocabulary that will ever be known of the language.\n"}

It is often used by laypeople to evaluate a machine translation system, or to test whether a text is suitable for MT when they are unfamiliar with the target language. Because the resulting text can often differ substantially from the original, RTT can also be a source of entertainment.\n\nTo compare the quality of different machine translation systems, users perform RTT and compare the resulting text to the original. The theory is that the closer the result of the RTT is to the original text, the higher the quality of the machine translation system. One of the problems with this technique is that if there is a problem with the resulting text it is impossible to know whether the error occurred in the forward translation, in the back translation, or in both. In addition it is possible to get a good back translation from a bad forward translation. A study using the automatic evaluation methods BLEU and F-score compared five different free on-line translation programs evaluating the quality of both the forward translation and the back translation and found no correlation between the quality of the forward translation and the quality of the back translation (i.e., a high quality forward translation did not always correspond to a high quality back translation). The author concluded that RTT was a poor method of predicting the quality of machine translation software. This conclusion was reinforced by a more in-depth study also using automatic evaluation methods. A subsequent study which included human evaluation of the back translation in addition to automatic evaluation methods found that RTT might have some ability to predict the quality of a machine translation system not on a sentence by sentence basis but for larger texts.\n\nIt is also suggested that RTT can be used to determine whether a text is suitable for machine translation. The idea being that if RTT results in a text that is close to the original, the text is suitable for MT. If after using RTT, the resulting text is inaccurate, the source text can then be edited until a satisfactory result is achieved. One of the studies looking at RTT as a means of measuring MT system quality also looked at its ability to predict whether a text was suitable for machine translation. It found that using different types of text also did not result in any correlation between the quality of the forward translation and the quality of the back translation. In contrast another study using human evaluation found that there was a correlation between the quality of the forward translation and the back translation and that this correlation could be used to estimate the quality of the forward translation. This correlation could be used to estimate the quality of the forward translation and by simplifying the source text, improve the quality of the forward translation.\n\nAlthough the use of RTT for assessing MT system quality or the suitability of a text for MT is in doubt, it is a way to have fun with machine translation. The text produced from an RTT can be comically bad. At one time websites existed for the sole purpose of performing RTT for fun. Other variations send the text through several languages before translating it back into the original or continue translating the text back and forth until it reaches equilibrium (i.e., the result of the back translation is identical to the text used for the forward translation). RTT as entertainment appeared in Philip K. Dick‚Äôs novel \"Galactic Pot-Healer\". The main character runs book titles and sayings through RTT then has his friends try to guess the original. The Australian television show Spicks and Specks had a contest called \"Turning Japanese\" which used RTT on song lyrics. Contestants needed to correctly guess the title of the song from which the lyrics were taken.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10192349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10192349", "title": "Russophiles of Galicia", "text": "Russophiles of Galicia\n\nRussophiles of Galicia or Moscophiles () were participants in a cultural and political movement largely in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Austria-Hungary (currently western Ukraine). This ideology emphasized that since the Eastern Slavic people of Galicia were descendants of the people of Kievan Rus' (Ruthenians), and followers of Eastern Christianity, that they were thus a branch of the Russian people. The movement was part of the whole Pan-Slavism that was developing in the late 19th century. Russophilia was largely a reaction against Polish (in Galicia) and Hungarian (in Carpathian Ruthenia) cultural suppression that was largely associated with Roman Catholicism.\n\nRussophilia has survived longer among the Rusyn minority, especially those in Carpathian Ruthenia, the Lemkos of south-east Poland, and those in Bukovina.\n\nThe \"Russophiles\" did not always apply the term to themselves, and called themselves Russians, Rusians, Ruthenians or \"Rusyny\" (Rusyns). Some Russophiles coined such terms as \"Obshche-rossy\" (Common Russians) or \"Starorusyny\" (Old Ruthenians) to stress either the differences within their faction, referring to commonness with all Russians, or their unique stand within the whole of the Russian nation.\n\nThe ethnonym \"Ruthenians\" for Ukrainian people had been accepted by both the Russophiles and the Moscophiles for quite a long period of time. The new name \"Ukrainians\" began to be accepted by the Ruthenian Galicians (as opposed to Polonian Galicians) around the 1890s, under the influence of Mykola Kostomarov and the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in central Ukraine.\n\nAfter the fall of the westernmost East Slavic state in 1349, most of the area of what is now Western Ukraine came under the control of Poland and Hungary, with Poland ruling Galicia and Hungary controlling Carpathian Ruthenia. The loss of independence began a period of gradual, centuries-long assimilation of much of the native elite into Polish and Hungarian culture. These elite adopted a national orientation in which they saw the native Rus population of Galicia as a branch of the Polish nation who happened to be of the Eastern Christian faith. They believed that the native language was merely a dialect of Polish, comparable to Mazovian, and that assimilation would be inevitable.\n\nThis process of Polonisation was, however, resented by the peasants, the clergy, and small minority of nobles who retained their East Slavic culture, religion or both. The latter two groups would form the nucleus of native national movements that would emerge with the loosening of Polish and Hungarian control in western Ukraine, which occurred when the entire region came under the control of the Austrian Habsburgs in the course of the Partitions of Poland. The Austrian Emperor emancipated the serfs, introduced compulsory education, and raised the status of the Ruthenian priests to that of their Polish and Hungarian counterparts. Furthermore, they mandated that Ukrainian Catholic seminarians receive a formal higher education (previously, priests had been educated informally by their fathers), and organized institutions in Vienna and Lviv that would serve this function. This led to the appearance, for the first time, of a large educated social class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia. Austrian reforms led to a gradual social mobilization of the native inhabitants of Western Ukraine and the emergence of several national ideologies that reflected the natives' East Slavic culture and were opposed to that of Roman Catholic Poland and Hungary. This development was encouraged by the Austrian authorities because it served to undermine Polish or Hungarian control of the area. The cultural movements included: Russophilia, the idea that Galicia was the westernmost part of Russia and that the natives of Western Ukraine were, like all of the Russian Empire's East Slavic inhabitants, members of one Russian nation; Ruthenianism, the idea that the people of Western Ukraine were a unique East Slavic nation; and Ukrainophilia, the idea that the people of western Ukraine were the same as those of neighbouring lands in the Russian Empire but that both were a people different from Russians ‚Äî Ukrainians.\n\nInitially there existed a fluidity between all three national orientations, with people changing their allegiance throughout their lives, and until approximately the turn of the 20th century members of all three groups frequently identified themselves by the ethnonym Ruthenians (\"Rusyny\"). Initially the most prominent ideology was Ruthenianism, or \"Rutenstvo\". Its proponents, referred to as \"Old Ruthenians\", were mainly wealthier or more influential priests and the remnants of the nobility who had not been Polonised, and were quite loyal to the Habsburgs to whom they owed their higher social standing. While emphasizing their separateness from the Poles in terms of religion and background, these people nevertheless maintained an elitist attitude towards the peasantry. They frequently spoke the Polish language among themselves, and tried to promote a version of Church Slavonic with elements of the local Ukrainian vernacular as well as the Russian language as a literary language for western Ukraine This language was never standardized, however. The language actually spoken by the common people was viewed with contempt. Old Ruthenians rejected both Ukrainophilism and Russophilism. The Ukrainian thinker Mykhailo Drahomanov wrote ironically of them, that \"you Galician intellectuals really do think of creating some kind of Uniate Paraguay, with some kind of hierarchical bureaucratic aristocracy, just like you have created an Austro-Ruthenian literary language!\" Old Ruthenianism dominated Galicia's cultural scene until the mid-19th century, when it was supplanted by Russophilia (many of the proponents of old Ruthenianism eventually became Russophiles).\n\nThe early Galician Russophile Nikolay Kmicykevich wrote an article in 1834 stating that the Russians were the same people from Western Ukraine to Kamchatka, from the White Sea to the Black Sea, and the language they spoke was the same Russian language. He wrote that the standard Russian language was more acceptable for modern writing and that the popular dialects in Ukraine were corrupted by Polish influence. These ideas were stimulated by the Russian pan-Slavist Mikhail Pogodin, who stayed in Lviv (called then \"Lemberg\") in 1835 and 1839‚Äì1840 and who during this time influenced the local Ruthenian intelligentsia. No longer seeing themselves as representatives of a small Ruthenian nation of under three million people, weak in comparison to its neighbours, the Russophiles now saw themselves as the westernmost branch of the Great Russian people. A Russian orientation also played into the Russophile's elitist tendencies, because the Russian literary language which they tried to adopt (many continued to use the Polish language in their daily lives) set the Russophile priests and nobles apart from the Ukrainian-speaking peasants. Politically, the Russophiles came to advocate the idea of a union between a Galician Ruthenia and Russia.\n\nOne of the most active of the Galician Russophiles was the prominent historian, nobleman Denis Zubrytsky, who helped convert many of the Galician elite to his cause. He was also the first to begin writing in standard Russian: as early as 1849 he started his main work, \"The History of the Ancient Galician-Russian Principality\". In a letter to his friend Mikhail Pogodin, Zubrytsky claimed that his stated purpose was to acquaint his Galician people with Russian history and the Russian language. Indeed, the historiography of the medieval Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was largely begun by Galician Russophiles and served as the basis for their nation-building project (in contrast, the Ukrainophiles at that time focused on the history of the Cossacks). In terms of literature and culture, the Russophiles promoted Nikolai Gogol and Ivan Naumovich in contrast to Ukrainophile emphasis on Taras Shevchenko.\n\nIn terms of language, Galician Russophiles were strongly opposed to the adoption of the vernacular Ukrainian language spoken by peasants and instead supported the adoption of standard literary Russian. This opposition was such that they even welcomed the ban on the Ukrainian language in the Russian Empire in 1876. Reflecting their belief that the people of Ukraine played a special role in the greater Russian nation, the leading Russophile thinker Ivan Naumovich declared that the Russian language was derived from \"Little Russian\" and was only being readopted in Galicia. Indeed, Galician Russophiles wrote that one of the reasons for all East Slavs to adopt the Russian language was that the modern Russian language had been created in the 17th and 18th centuries by scholars from Ukraine.\n\nDespite some democratic elements (such as promoting literacy among peasants) Galician Russophilia tended to be antidemocratic and reactionary, placing it at odds with the democratic trends in 19th century society. For example, the Russophile leader Dennis Zubrytsky defended serfdom both before and after the emancipation of Austrian Galician serfs in 1848.\n\nThere were also antisemitic strains in Russophilism. From the 1860s to the 1880s some peasants hoped that the Tsar would come to Galicia and slaughter the Poles and the Jews. During the Russian occupation of Galicia in 1914-1915, a Galician Russophile newspaper spread rumours of anti-Russian Jewish uprisings in order to justify antisemitic pogroms by Russian troops, and Russophiles working within the Russian administration united with right-wing Russian elements in urging the Russian government to solve the \"Jewish question\" by stripping Jews of Russian citizenship, expelling them to Germany and distributing their property (along with that of Poles) among the local Ukrainian (who Moscophiles considered \"Russian\") people. The latter appeals were ignored by the Russian military, who did not want excessive disruptions to the local economy during the war. Russophiles who had been installed by the Russian authorities as mayors in some towns proceeded to shut down Jewish schools.\n\nWestern Ukrainian Russophilia appeared in Carpathian Ruthenia at the end of the 18th century. At this time, several people from the region settled in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and obtained high academic positions. The best known of these was Vasilly Kukolnik (father of Russian playwright Nestor Kukolnik), a member of an old noble family who had studied in Vienna before coming to Russia. Vasilly's pupils included Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia and Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich of Russia, the future emperor Nicholas I of Russia. These √©migr√©s, while adopting a sense of Russian patriotism, also maintained their ties to their homeland and tried to use their wealth to introduce Russian literature and culture to their region. When the Hungarians revolted against the Austrians in 1848, the local East Slavs, antagonistic toward the Hungarians who had dominated them, were deeply moved by the presence of the seemingly invincible Russian troops sent by Nicholas to help crush the rebellion. At this time, Austria supported the Russophile movement as a counterbalance to Polish and Hungarian interests, and under the leadership of the Russophile nobleman Adolf Dobriansky, the people of Carpathian Ruthenia were granted limited autonomy, although the region reverted to Hungarian control after a few years.\n\nIn Galicia, Russophilia emerged as early as the 1830s, when \"Society of scholars\" was organized in Przemy≈õl and was stimulated in part by the presence in Lviv in 1835 and from 1839‚Äì1840 of Russian pan-Slavist Mikhail Pogodin who became acquainted with the local Ruthenian intelligentsia and became an influence on them. However, the movement did not come to dominate western Ukrainian society until the 1850s‚Äì60s. Many proponents of Ruthenianism became disenchanted with Austria and linked themselves with the giant and powerful Russian state. The relative rise of Russia's power in comparison to that of Austria during the 19th century also played a role in such feelings. Events of the 1860s helped to increase pro-Russian feelings in Galicia. Traditionally, the local Ruthenians had a naive belief that the Habsburg Emperor was on their side and that he would defend them against the Polish nobility. From the late 1850s, Austrian courts often sided with (primarily Polish) nobles in land disputes with peasants, during which forests and pastures that the peasants had traditionally been using were deemed the property of the nobles. This led to significant economic hardship for the peasants. While this was happening, the Russian tsar had emancipated the peasants in Russian-ruled Ukraine. In 1863-1864, an insurrection of Polish nobles in areas that included Russian-ruled Ukraine was brutally crushed by the Tsarist government, which in punishing the Polish rebels provided the Ukrainian peasants with relatively favorable compensation. Many Galicians began to approvingly contrast the Tsar's brutal treatment of the Polish nobles with the Austrians' seemingly taking the Polish side in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict. Many of them came to believe that the plight of the Ukrainians was improving more under the Tsars than it was under the Austrians. In the testimony of one Austrian-Ukrainian peasant, \"if there is no justice in Vienna, we will find it in the \"Moskal.\"\" \n\nDuring this time, the poet and scholar Yakiv Holovatsky, a member of \"The Ruthenian Trinity\", joined the Russophile movement. Soon thereafter, the Russophile priests of the St George Cathedral Circle came to dominate the local hierarchy of the Greek Catholic Church, thereby transforming that Church into an instrument of their cause. Russophiles took over Ruthenian academic institutions (such as the Stauropegion Institute, with its printing press and large collection of archives) and the venerable Ruthenian newspaper \"Slovo\" ('The Word'), and under their leadership it became the most widely circulated newspaper among Western Ukrainians. In 1870, the Russophiles formed a political organization, the Ruthenian Council (\"Ruska Rada\") which represented the population of Western Ukraine. From the 1860s until the 1880s Western Ukrainian political, religious, and cultural life came to be dominated by the Russophiles.\n\nWithin a generation of achieving dominance of Western Ukrainian life, however, the Russophiles were eclipsed by the Ukrainophiles, or so-called Populists (\"Narodovtsi\"). Originally coming from the same social stratum as the Russophiles (priests and nobles), but joined by the emerging secular intelligentsia, the Ukrainophiles were from a younger generation who unlike their fathers found enthusiasm for Taras Shevchenko rather than the Tsars, and embraced the peasantry rather than rejected it. This dedication to the people (the \"bottom-up\" approach) would prove successful against the Russophiles' elitist \"top-down\" orientation.\n\nMany factors accounted for the collapse of the Russophile movement. The principal one was likely the Ukrainophiles' incredible capacity for organization. The Populists fanned out throughout the countryside in order to mobilize the masses to their cause. In 1868, the Lviv student Anatole Vakhnianyn organized and became the first head of the Prosvita organization, whose goal was to organize reading rooms and community theatres which became extremely popular among the peasants. In order to help the impoverished peasants, Ukrainophile activists set up co-operatives that would buy supplies in large quantities, eliminate middlemen, and pass the savings onto the villagers. Credit unions were created, providing inexpensive loans to farmers and eliminating the reliance on non-Ukrainian moneylenders. Russophiles belatedly tried to imitate such strategies but could not catch up. By 1914, Prosvita had 3,000 reading rooms while the Russophile version, the Kachkovsky Society (founded in 1874), had only 300. The Ukrainian co-operative union had 900 members, while the rival Russophile one had only 106. Prevented from publishing in the mainstream western Ukrainian newspapers by the Russophiles who controlled them, the Populists created their own. In 1880, \"Dilo\" ('Deed') was founded as a rival to the Russophile \"Slovo\" (\"Word\"), and due to the rising literacy of the Ukrainian population its circulation surpassed that of its older rival.\n\nA second important factor for the success of the Ukrainophiles was the exile from Dnieper Ukraine of a large number of well-educated and talented eastern Ukrainian writers and scholars, such as the writer Panteleimon Kulish, the former professor of Kiev's University of St. Vladimir, economist and philosopher Mykhailo Drahomanov, and especially the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, who headed a newly established department at the University of Lviv. Many of these figures settled or lived for a time in Lviv. In contrast, no prominent Russian intellectuals came to Galicia in order to help the local Russophile cause. This phenomenon led to the ironic observation of Drahomanov that the Ukrainianophiles were actually more in touch with contemporary Russian cultural and intellectual trends than were the Russophiles despite the latter group's love for Russia. Moreover, while educated Ukrainophiles were coming to Galicia from the Russian Empire, local Russophiles in Galicia experienced a \"brain drain\" as many of them left western Ukraine for positions in Russia. Many of classics teachers needed as a result of Russian educational reforms promoted by Dmitry Tolstoy in the 19th century were Galicians. From among the local intelligentsia, Ivan Franko showed the literary potential of the vernacular Ukrainian language. The local declining number of Russophiles could not compete with the talent of these Ukrainophile cultural figures and scholars.\n\nHelp for the Ukrainophile cause from eastern Ukraine also took the form of generous financial assistance from wealthy Ukrainian landowners. Due to restrictions against Ukrainian printing and the Ukrainian language imposed by the tsarist government in eastern Ukraine, eastern Ukrainian noble or Cossacks officer families who had not become Russified sent money to Galicia in order to sponsor Ukrainophile cultural activities there. These people, enjoying gentry status, were generally much wealthier than the priests and priests' sons who dominated the local Galician movements. The amount sent by these private individuals from Russian-ruled Ukraine to Ukrainophile causes likely equalled the subsidies sent by the Russian government to Galician Russophiles. For example, Yelyzaveta Myloradovich, a noblewoman from Poltava, donated 20,000 Austrian crowns to the Shevchenko Scientific Society.\n\nThe Austrian government also contributed significantly to the Ukrainophiles' victory. Initially Austria had supported Russophilia as a counterbalance to the Poles and Hungarians. During the latter part of the 19th century, as Austria-Hungary and Russia became rivals, the Austrian authorities became alarmed by the Russophiles' activities. To maintain the loyalty of the Ukrainian population, the Austrian authorities made concessions to Ukrainian causes, such as expanding the Ukrainian educational system, and in 1893 made the Ukrainophile version of the vernacular Ukrainian language the language of instruction. Doing so effectively shut the Russophiles out of the educational system. During the 1880s the Austrians put many Russophiles on trial for treason or espionage. These trials were widely publicized, and served to discredit the Russophiles among the Ukrainian people, most of whom continued to be loyal to the Austrian Emperor. One of the prosecutors was Kost Levitsky, who later became an important Ukrainian politician. The Austrians also deported an editor of the Russophile newspaper \"Slovo\" and deposed the Russophile head of the Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Joseph Sembratovych.\n\nIn 1899, Count Andrey Sheptytsky became new head of the Greek Catholic Church. A Polonised nobleman from an old Ukrainian family, he adopted the Ukrainian language and a Ukrainophile orientation. Although Sheptytsky did not interfere in priests' personal activities and writings, he slowly purged the Church's hierarchy of Russophiles. Despite drawing some Ukrainophiles' criticism for the slow progression of his changes, under Sheptytsky's leadership the Church gradually ceased being a bastion of Russophilism and instead became a staunchly Ukrainophile one.\n\nLacking support within their community and from the Austrian government, the remaining Russophiles turned to outsiders for support and became more radical in their politics. They founded the Russian National Party, called for complete identification with Russia and promoted the conversion of the western Ukrainian people to Orthodoxy. The Russophiles now largely depended on financing from the Russian government and Russian private sponsors (the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society was established in Saint Petersburg in 1908) and from ultraconservative Galician Polish aristocrats. The Polish ultraconservatives had become alarmed by the social mobilization of the Ukrainian peasants and sought to use the Russophile movement as a way of dividing the Ukrainian community. They were also united with the Russophiles in opposition to a proposed alliance between Ukrainophiles and politically moderate Poles. Polish support provided the Russophiles with some advantages during elections, some advantages for Russophile priests in obtaining parishes, and tolerance towards Russophile political activities. The Russophiles also attempted, with some limited success, to exploit the differences between Ukrainian petty gentry and peasants. The gentry were somewhat more likely to support Russophilia than were peasants. A noble candidate in the elections of 1911, Ivan Kulchytsky, declared \"now we have recovered our sight and shall not allow the bastards to trick us with Ukraine‚Ä¶. You should know that from now on we do not give a damn for Ukraine and have returned to the historical road. From now on we are Russians.\" \n\nHelp from Russian and Polish patrons largely failed to prevent the Russophile decline. By the early 20th century, the Russophiles became a minority in Galicia. Within the Church, they were nicknamed \"bisons,\" in scholar Himka's words an \"ancient, shaggy species on the verge of extinction.\" Of nineteen Ukrainian periodicals published in Galicia in 1899, sixteen were Ukrainophile in orientation, only two were Russophile in orientation and one was neutral. In the 1907 elections to the Viennese parliament, the Ukrainophiles won 22 seats while the Russophiles won five. But the Russophiles, due to Polish interference, won elections to the Galician parliament the same year by taking 11 seats, the Ukrainophiles 10. In 1913, 30 Ukrainophile and only 1 Russophile delegate were sent to the Galician Diet. There were certain regional patterns in the support for Russophilism, in that it was most popular in the extreme western parts of eastern Galicia, particularly in the Lemko region of centred on the city of Przemy≈õl. This region, closest to Polish ethnographic territory, may have been most receptive to Russophilia's radical differentiation of Ukrainians/Ruthenians from Poles.\n\nImmediately before the outbreak of World War I, the Austrian and Hungarian governments held numerous treason trials of those suspected of Russophile subversion. When the Austrians were driven from Galicia in August 1914, they avenged themselves upon suspected Russophiles and their families. Russophiles were punished for allegedly seeking to separate Galicia, Bukovina and parts of northern Hungary from Austria-Hungary and attaching them to Russia, of seeking volunteers for the Russian army, and of organizing a pro-Russian paramilitary group known as the \"Russkie Druzhiny\" ‚Äì a Russophile counterpart to the Ukrainophile pro-Austrian Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. Hundreds of suspected Russophiles were shot, and thirty thousand were sent to the Talerhof concentration camp, where approximately three thousand died of exposure.\n\nThe Russian administration of Galicia lasted from August 1914 until June 1915. Russian Grand Duke Nicholas issued a manifesto proclaiming that the people of Galicia were brothers who had \"languished for centuries under a foreign yoke\" and urged them to \"raise the banner of United Russia.\" During this time, with the help of local Russophiles, the Russian administration, aware that the Ukrainophiles were loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and that they had organized the Ukrainian legion of the Austro-Hungarian army, engaged in a harsh persecution of the Ukrainophile leaders and their ideology. Ukrainian schools were forcibly converted to Russian-language instruction, reading rooms, newspapers, co-operatives and credit unions were closed, and hundreds of community leaders were arrested and exiled under suspicion of collaboration. The popular head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky was arrested and exiled to Russia. Although Nicholas II issued a decree forbidding forceful conversion from Uniatism to Orthodoxy, except in cases where 75% of the parishioners approved, the ultimate goal was the liquidation of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. In addition to its head, hundreds of priests were exiled to Russia and replaced by Orthodox priests, who urged the parishioners to convert to Orthodoxy. The behaviour of the Russian authorities was so heavy-handed that it was denounced as a \"European scandal\" in the Russian Duma by the Russian statesman Pavel Milyukov. The Russians were aided in their suppression of Ukrainian culture by local Russophiles and by Polish anti-Ukrainian figures such as Lviv professor Stanis≈Çaw Grabski. Such actions angered most of the local Ukrainian population.\n\nWhen Austria regained Galicia in June 1915, most of the remaining Galician Russophiles and their families retreated alongside the Russian army in fear of reprisals. Approximately 25,000 of them were resettled near Rostov-on-Don. Among those that did not leave, the Austrians arrested and sentenced to death approximately thirty noted Russophiles, including two members of parliament, Dmytro Markov and Volodymyr Kurylovich (their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment and they were released in 1917)., as well as Metodyj Trochanovskij. Kost Levitsky, a prominent Ukrainophile leader and the future president of the West Ukrainian National Republic, appeared as a prosecutor during the trials against the Russophiles.\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Russia, some Galician Russophiles then fought in the ranks of the White Army, specifically under Lavr Kornilov, in the hope that Galicia would become part of a democratic White Russia.\n\nAfter the collapse of Austria-Hungary the Ukrainians of Galicia proclaimed the West Ukrainian National Republic. Between 70 and 75 thousand men fought in its Ukrainian Galician Army. They lost their war and the territory was annexed by Poland. However, the experience of proclaiming a Ukrainian state and fighting for it significantly intensified and deepened the Ukrainian orientation within Galicia.\n\nThe Russophile movement barely clung on during the interwar period, supported by the Polish government which funded and granted Russophiles some institutions such as the Stauropegion Institute (which was returned to Russophiles in 1922 after it had been given to the Ukrainophiles in 1915) and which subsidized the movement in order to try to divide Ukrainian society. This had little effect beyond the Lemko regions in the extreme west, and since the interwar era, Galicia has been the centre of Ukrainian nationalism.\n\nRussophilia disappeared in western Ukraine during and after Soviet rule.\n\nThe Russophile tradition persisted in the portions of Galicia west of the Dukla Pass, resulting in the formation of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic. Metodyj Trochanovskij continued to espouse the Rusyn national identity, up to the start of World War II. Karpatska Rus', a Rusyn language newspaper published in the United States avoided any suggestion that the Lemkos were a branch of the Ukrainians.\n\nCall for a Lemko autonomous region in Poland persisted at least until 1989, with a Rusyn than a Russian orientation.\n\n\n\n"}

It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action. More specifically, a \"National Geographic\" anthropologist defined \"seny\" as \"a kind of refined good sense and self-realization.\"\n\nThe opposite of \"seny\" is known as rauxa () \"sudden determination or action\".\n\nMany Catalans consider \"seny\" something unique to their culture, a true Catalan symbol. \"Seny\" as a particular characteristic of Catalan society is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the scale of values and social norms of traditional Catalan rural society. The values of \"seny\" were transmitted from generation to generation without much change by the exemplary behaviour of the elder members of the family, as well as in the shape of aphorisms and moral stories. The latter were largely based on Christian values and their examples and illustrations often included animals and plants that were common in rural Catalonia.\n\nThis oral lore caught the attention of Josep Torras i Bages, bishop of Vic at the beginning of the 20th century.\nHe became very interested in the pattern in which the \"seny\" was transmitted from one generation to the other as an oral tradition. Thus he encouraged Josep Abril i Virgili (1869‚Äì1918), a writer, to gather the moral stories and illustrate them in a book that was published as \"Bon seny\" (\"Good sense\"). This more or less representative compilation of moral lessons regarding \"seny\" was illustrated by artist Joan Junceda (1881‚Äì1948). Published in the Catalan language before the Spanish Civil War \"Bon seny\" became rare during General Franco's era, when so much Catalan printed material had been burned and printing in Catalan was severely restricted.\n\nMany of the \"seny\" proverbs that defined traditional Catalan values have lost most of their sense today. The reason is the erosion of Christian values as fundamental in present-day postchristian Catalan society, which sees itself today as a society based largely on secular principles.\n\n\"Seny\" is mentioned in the motto of castells, the Catalan tradition of building human towers, as one of the values of that endeavour: \"For√ßa, equilibri, valor i seny\" (strength, balance, courage, and \"seny\").\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another widely used writing tool is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille.\n\nStyluses were first used by the ancient Mesopotamians in order to write in cuneiform. They were mostly made of reeds and had a slightly curved trapezoidal section. Egyptians (Middle Kingdom) and the Minoans of Crete (Linear A and Cretan Hieroglyphic) made styluses in various materials: reeds that grew on the sides of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and in marshes and down to Egypt where the Egyptians used styluses from sliced reeds with sharp points; bone and metal styluses were also used. Cuneiform was entirely based on the \"wedge-shaped\" mark that the end of a cut reed made when pushed into a clay tablet; from Latin \"cuneus\" = wedge. The linear writings of Crete in the first half of the second millennium BC which were made on clay tablets that were left to dry in the sun until they became \"leather\" hard before being incised by the stylus. The linear nature of the writing was also dictated by the use of the stylus.\n\nIn Western Europe styluses were widely used until the late Middle Ages. For learning purposes the stylus was gradually replaced by a writing slate. From the mid-14th century improved water-powered paper mills produced large and cheap quantities of paper and the wax tablet and stylus disappeared completely from daily life.\n\nThe word \"stylus\" (along with the word \"style\") comes from the Latin word \"stilus\" meaning: \"a stake; a pointed instrument, used by the Romans, for writing upon wax tablets,\" which derives from the Greek word œÉœÑ·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ meaning \"pillar\" and \"stile for writing on waxed tablets.\" A different suggestion is that the word does not derive from the Greek word \"œÉœÑ·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ\", but that it has a common root with the Greek verb \"œÉœÑŒØŒ∂œâ\" (meaning \"mark\"). According to the 1875 London Dictionary of Greek & Roman Antiquities a Stylus is \"an object tapering like an architectural column; a metal instrument resembling a pencil in size and shape, used for writing or recording impressions upon waxed tablets. It signifies:\n\n\"An iron instrument (Ov. Met. IX.521; Martial, XIV.21), resembling a pencil in size and shape, used for writing upon waxed tablets (Plaut. Bacch. IV.4.63; Plin. H.N. XXXIV.14). At one end it was sharpened to a point for scratching the characters upon the wax (Quintil. i.1 ¬ß27), while the other end being flat and circular served to render the surface of the tablets smooth again, and so to obliterate what had been written. Thus, vertere stilum means to erase, and hence to correct, as in the well-known precept saepe stilum vertas (Hor. Sat. 1.10.72; Cic. Verr. II.41).\"\n\nThere exists minor controversy about the correct pluralization of \"stylus\". Some assert that \"stylus\" is a direct loanword from Latin and should be pluralised as \"styli\". However, \"stylus\" is an English word based on the Latin word \"stilus\", and is more appropriately pluralised in English as \"styluses\". Occasionally the pluralisation \"stylii\" is seen.\n\nStyluses are still used in various arts and crafts. Example situations: rubbing off dry transfer letters, tracing designs onto a new surface with carbon paper, and hand embossing. Styluses are also used to engrave into materials like metal or clay.\n\nStyluses are used to make dots as found in folk art and Mexican pottery artifacts. Oaxaca dot art is created using styluses.\n\nModern day devices, such as phones, can often be used with a stylus to accurately navigate through menus, send messages etc. \nToday, the term \"stylus\" often refers to an input tool usually used with touchscreen-enabled devices, such as Tablet PCs, to accurately navigate interface elements, send messages, etc. This also prevents smearing the screen with oils from one's fingers. Styluses may also be used for handwriting; or for drawing using graphics tablets.\n\nMany new phones have a built-in stylus which tucks in behind the back cover. Some styluses may extend and contract into small, pen-like cylinders, which are easy to put away.\n\nStyluses come in both passive and active versions.\nA passive or capacitive stylus is a stylus that acts just like a finger when touching a device screen. There is no electronic communication between a passive stylus and a device. The device cannot tell the difference between a finger and a passive stylus.\n\nAn active stylus includes electronic components that communicate with the touchscreen controller on a device. Active pens are typically used for note taking, on-screen drawing/painting, and electronic document annotation.\nAs before, the stylus is pointed or rounded at one end and is made to fit in the grip of a hand comfortably. These styluses can be found in many different styles.\n\nPalm Rejection: \nSince many modern tablets make use of multi-touch recognition, some stylus and app manufactures have created palm rejection technologies into their products. This works to turn off the multi-touch feature allowing the palm to rest on the tablet while still recognizing the stylus.\n\nHaptic Stylus:\nOther than the types above, a haptic stylus is a stylus that simulates the realistic physical sensations on digital surfaces (e.g., tablet computer, smart phone etc.) which can be felt in handwriting tasks on paper. The sensation is sometimes enhanced by the combination of auditory and tactile illusions, such as RealPen.\n\nA stylus is also an instrument used to scribe a recording into smoked foil or glass. In various scientific instruments this method may be employed instead of a pen for recording as it has the advantage of being able to operate over a wide temperature range, does not clog or dry prematurely, and has nearly negligible friction in comparison to other methods. These characteristics were useful in certain types of early seismographs and in recording barographs that were once used to verify sailplane records. The styluses used in scanning tunneling microscopes have only a single atom at the tip; these are effectively the sharpest styluses possible.\n\n"}

{"id": "9797288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9797288", "title": "Thrackle", "text": "Thrackle\n\nA thrackle is an embedding of a graph in the plane, such that each edge is a Jordan arc\nand every pair of edges meet exactly once. Edges may either meet at a common endpoint, or, if they have no endpoints in common, at a point in their interiors. In the latter case, the crossing must be \"transverse\".\n\nA linear thrackle is a thrackle drawn in such a way that its edges are straight line segments. Every linear thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices, a fact that was observed by Paul Erd≈ës. Erd≈ës observed that, if a vertex \"v\" is connected to three or more edges \"vw\", \"vx\", and \"vy\" in a linear thrackle, then at least one of those edges lies on a line that separates two other edges; without loss of generality assume that \"vw\" is such an edge, with \"x\" and \"y\" lying in opposite closed halfspaces bounded by line \"vw\". Then, \"w\" must have degree one, because no other edge than \"vw\" can touch both \"vx\" and \"vy\". Removing \"w\" from the thrackle produces a smaller thrackle, without changing the difference between the numbers of edges and vertices. On the other hand, if every vertex has at most two neighbors, then by the handshaking lemma the number of edges is at most the number of vertices. Based on Erd≈ës' proof, one can infer that every linear thrackle is a pseudoforest. Every cycle of odd length may be arranged to form a linear thrackle, but this is not possible for an even-length cycle, because if one edge of the cycle is chosen arbitrarily then the other cycle vertices must lie alternatingly on opposite sides of the line through this edge.\n\nMicha Perles provided another simple proof that linear thrackles have at most \"n\" edges, based on the fact that in a linear thrackle every edge has an endpoint at which the edges span an angle of at most 180¬∞, and for which it is the most clockwise edge within this span. For, if not, there would be two edges, incident to opposite endpoints of the edge and lying on opposite sides of the line through the edge, which could not cross each other. But each vertex can only have this property with respect to a single edge, so the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices.\n\nAs Erd≈ës also observed, the set of pairs of points realizing the diameter of a point set must form a linear thrackle: no two diameters can be disjoint from each other, because if they were then their four endpoints would have a pair at farther distance apart than the two disjoint edges. For this reason, every set of \"n\" points in the plane can have at most \"n\" diametral pairs, answering a question posed in 1934 by Heinz Hopf and Erika Pannwitz. Andrew V√°zsonyi conjectured bounds on the number of diameter pairs in higher dimensions, generalizing this problem.\n\nIn computational geometry, the method of rotating calipers can be used to form a linear thrackle from any set of points in convex position, by connecting pairs of points that support parallel lines tangent to the convex hull of the points. This graph contains as a subgraph the thrackle of diameter pairs.\nAn enumeration of linear thrackles may be used to solve the biggest little polygon problem, of finding an \"n\"-gon with maximum area relative to its diameter.\n\nJohn H. Conway has conjectured that, in any thrackle, the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices. Conway himself uses the terminology \"paths\" and \"spots\" (for \"edges\" and \"vertices\" respectively), so Conway's thrackle conjecture was originally stated\nin the form \"every thrackle has at least as many spots as paths.\"\n\nEquivalently, the thrackle conjecture may be stated as \"every thrackle is a pseudoforest.\" More specifically, if the thrackle conjecture is true, the thrackles may be exactly characterized by a result of Woodall: they are the pseudoforests in which there is no cycle of length four and at most one odd cycle.\n\nIt has been proven that every cycle graph other than C has a thrackle embedding, which shows that the conjecture is sharp. That is, there are thrackles having the same number of spots as paths. At the other extreme, the worst-case scenario is that the number of spots is twice the number of paths; this is also attainable.\n\nThe thrackle conjecture is known to be true for thrackles drawn in such a way that every edge is an \"x\"-monotone curve, crossed at most once by every vertical line.\n\n proved that every bipartite thrackle is a planar graph, although not drawn in a planar way. As a consequence, they show that every thrackleable graph with \"n\" vertices has at most 2\"n\"¬†‚àí¬†3 edges. Since then, this bound has been improved several times. First, it was improved to 3(\"n\"¬†‚àí¬†1)/2, and another improvement led to a bound of roughly 1.428\"n\". Moreover, the method used to prove the latter result yields for any Œµ¬†>¬†0 a finite algorithm that either \nimproves the bound to (1¬†+¬†Œµ)\"n\" or disproves the conjecture. The current record is due to , who proved a bound of 1.3984\"n\".\n\nIf the conjecture is false, a minimal counterexample would have the form of two even cycles sharing a vertex. Therefore, to prove the conjecture, it would suffice to prove that graphs of this type cannot be drawn as thrackles.\n\n"}

{"id": "3127278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3127278", "title": "Valentin Rasputin", "text": "Valentin Rasputin\n\nValentin Grigoriyevich Rasputin (; ; 15 March 193714 March 2015) was a Russian writer. He was born and lived much of his life in the Irkutsk Oblast in Eastern Siberia. Rasputin's works depict rootless urban characters and the fight for survival of centuries-old traditional rural ways of life, addressing complex questions of ethics and spiritual revival.\n\nValentin Rasputin was born on 15 March 1937 in the village of Atalanka in Irkutsk Oblast of Russia. His father worked for a village cooperative store, and his mother was a nurse. Soon after his birth, the Rasputin family moved to the village of Atalanka in the same Ust-Uda district, where Rasputin spent his childhood.\nBoth villages, which were located on the bank of the Angara River, do not exist in their original locations any more, as much of the Angara Valley was flooded by the Bratsk Reservoir in the 1960s, and the villages were relocated to higher ground. Later, the writer remembered growing up in Siberia as a difficult, but happy time. \"As soon as we kids learned how to walk, we would toddle to the river with our fishing rods; still a tender child, we would run to the taiga, which would begin right outside the village, to pick berries and mushrooms; since young age, we would get into a boat and take the oars...\"\n\nWhen Rasputin finished the 4-year elementary school in Atalanka in 1948, his parents sent the precocious boy to a middle school and then high school in the district center, Ust-Uda, some 50¬†km away from his home village. He was the first child from his village to continue his education in this way.\n\nRasputin graduated from Irkutsk University in 1959, and started working for local Komsomol newspapers in Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk. He published his first short story in 1961.\n\nAn important point in Rasputin's early literary career was a young writers' seminar in September 1965 in Chita led by Vladimir Chivilikhin (), who encouraged the young writer's literary aspirations and recommended him for membership in the prestigious Union of Soviet Writers. Since then Rasputin has considered Chivilikhin his \"literary godfather\".\n\nIn 1967, after the publication of his \"Money for Maria\", Rasputin was indeed admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers. Over the next three decades, he published a number of novels, many became both widely popular among the Russian reading public and critically acclaimed.\nIn 1980, after researching the Battle of Kulikovo for two years, Rasputin was baptised by an Orthodox priest in nearby Yelets.\n\nRasputin's literary work is closely connected to his activism on social and environmental issues. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Rasputin, called by some the leading figure of the \"Siberian environmental lobby\", took an active part in the campaign for protection of Lake Baikal and against the diversion of Siberian fresh water to Central Asian republics. In the 1990s he participated in the nationalist opposition movement. Having spent most of his adult life in Irkutsk, Rasputin remains one of the leading intellectual figures of this Siberian city.\n\nHe was a guest for many events in the city of Irkutsk, including the unveilings of the monuments to Tsar Alexander III, Alexander Vampilov and Alexander Kolchak. He organized the readers' conference in Irkutsk Central Scientific Library named after Molchanov-Sibirsky.\n\nRasputin's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of S7 Airlines Flight 778, and his wife died six years later. He died in Moscow on 14 March 2015, a day short of his 78th birthday. His funeral service was led by Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, and President Vladimir Putin paid his respects. (In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin's annexation of the Crimea.)\n\nRasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as \"village prose,\" or sometimes \"rural prose\" (–¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–∑–∞). Beginning in the time of the Khrushchev Thaw (–æ—Ç—Ç–µ–ø–µ–ª—å), village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from socialist realism. Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry, espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life, and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects. Rasputin's 1979 novel \"Farewell to Matyora\", which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a hydroelectric dam can be constructed further down the Angara River, was considered the epitome of this genre. The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin's writing style (exceptional even for the village prose writers), and the novel's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization:\n\n\"Once more spring had come, one more in the never-ending cycle, but for Matyora this spring would be the last, the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name. Once more, rumbling passionately, the ice broke, piling up mounds on the banks, and the liberated Angara River opened up, stretching out into a mighty, sparkling flow. Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island‚Äôs upper tip, before cascading down both channels of the riverbed; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens, the first rains soaked the earth, the swifts and swallows flew back, and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life. It had all happened many times before.\" (From Rasputin's novel \"Farewell to Matyora\", translated by Antonina W. Bouis, 1979)\nRasputin's nonfiction works contain similar themes, often in support of relevant political causes. He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale dam building, like the project that flooded his own hometown, and water management projects, like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia. He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense, but in a moral sense as well.\n\nIn \"Siberia, Siberia\" (first published in 1991), Rasputin compares what he considers modern moral relativism with the traditional beliefs of the people of Russkoye Ustye, who believed in reincarnation. According to Rasputin, when burying their dead, the Russkoye Ustye settlers would often bore a hole in the coffin, to make it easier for the soul to come back to be reborn; but if the deceased was a bad person, they would drive an aspen stake through the grave, to keep his soul from ever coming back into the world of living again. The writer is not ambiguous as to which category the souls of the \"modernizers\" should belong:\n\n\"When reflecting on the actions of today's \"river-rerouting\" father figures, who are destroying our sacred national treasures up hill and down with the haste of an invading army, you involuntarily turn to this experience: it would not be a bad idea for them to know that not everything is forgiven at the time of death.\"\nSome critics accused Rasputin of idealizing village life and slipping into anti-modern polemics. The journal \"Voprosy literatury\" published an ongoing debate on the question, \"Is the Village Prose of Valentin Rasputin Anti-Modern?\"\n\nBy the end of perestroika Rasputin became publicly active. He criticized Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms from patriotic and nationalistic positions. His repetition (at the 1st Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union) of Stolypin's statement \"You need great upheavals. We need a great country\" (¬´–í–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω—ã –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ç—Ä—è—Å–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ù–∞–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω–∞ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞¬ª) made it a phrase commonly used by the antiliberal opposition.\n\nHe also signed several open letters, most notably the \"Letter of Russian Writers\" (also known as the \"\") addressed to the President and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and published in the \"Literary Newspaper\" and \"Nash Sovremennik\" in 1990. 74 writers expressed concern regarding the rose of Russophobia in mass media and \"fabrication of the \"Russian fascism\" myth while the Zionist ideology is getting quick rehabilitation and idealization\". The letter was criticized by opponents who labeled the signers as \"antisemits\"; many of them later signed what is considered their answer ‚Äî the \"Letter of Forty-Two\". Rasputin himself argued that his alleged antisemitic statements have been exaggerated and taken out of context. In July, 1991, Rasputin along with 11 other public and political figures signed another open letter \"A Word to the People\".\n\nIn 1992, Valentin Rasputin joined the National Salvation Front (a coalition of radical opposition forces), nominally belonging to its leadership. He later supported the CPRF and its leader, Gennady Zyuganov.\n\n\n\nNon-fiction:\n\n\n\n\n"}
