{"id": "666830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666830", "title": "Angolan Portuguese", "text": "Angolan Portuguese\n\nAngolan Portuguese () is a group of dialects and accents of the Portuguese language used mostly in Angola, where it is an official language. In 2005 it was used there by 60% of the population, including by 20% as their first language. The 2016 CIA \"World Fact Book\" reports that 12.3 million, or 47% of the population, speaks Portuguese as their first language.\nHowever, many parents raise their children to speak only Portuguese, and t.The 2014 census found that 71% speak Portuguese at home, many of them alongside a Bantu language, breaking down to 85% in urban areas and 49% in rural areas. \n\nThere are different stages of Portuguese language in Angola in a similar manner to other Portuguese-speaking African countries. Some closely approximate Standard Portuguese pronunciation and are associated with upper class and younger generations of urban background.\n\nVernacular accents share similarities with Brazilian Portuguese and these similar features have historical reasons. The contemporary Standard European Portuguese is the preferred pronunciation, as such it has become a transitional dialect somewhat midway between the European and Brazilian varieties. In its phonology, Angolan Portuguese is not significantly influenced by the local languages. The standard phonology in Angola is the European standard, like in Portugal and the rest of Africa. But there are some phonological features similar to Brazilian dialect, such as that is pronounced as a nasal palatal approximant , which nasalizes the vowel that precedes it, and dropping of word-final ( and ), especially for people who speak Portuguese as their second language. It is also commonly seen as the African accent of Portuguese, and when dubbing an African character in cartoons and TV and film productions, Portuguese usually mimic an Angolan accent. Many Angolan Portuguese speakers grew up as, or had parents who were, speakers of African languages such as Umbundu, so the phonological influence of these local African languages on this form of Portuguese would be strong.\n\nAlthough most of the vocabulary is the same as in Portugal or Brazil, there are some differences, many due to the influence of several languages spoken in Angola. Each area has different lexicon originating from the distinctive languages. In the capital, Luanda, a very standard Portuguese is spoken, and tribal culture and languages are practically nonexistent. Still, there are several Kimbundu influences. This lexicon is not used in documents or business, for example, as it is mostly seen as slang, but there are exceptions. Most of this lexicon is mostly used by younger Angolans and Portuguese, similarly to younger African-Americans in the US.\n\nYounger Luandese, who speak primarily Portuguese, have even a wider lexicon of slang. It does not correspond to a dialect, but a sociolect. Because of immigration and because of the slang's novelty, the younger generations in Portugal often adopt its use. Angolans in Lisbon also have a tendency to create new words for use socially and as group expressions, and often even newcomers from Angola cannot understand them. The newcomers are known as \"exportados\" (\"exported ones\").\nThe following list has Luandese followed by Standard Portuguese:\n\nExamples of words borrowed from Kimbundu, for instance, into Angolan Portuguese include:\n\nMany words of Angolan origin have reached other countries or regions where Portuguese is used. Among these words are \"bunda\" (backside or \"bottom\"); \"fubá\" (a maize flour); \"moleque\" (\"kid\"); and several others. Also included are words not native to other regions, such as \"kizomba\", \"kilapanda\", \"kilapanga\", \"ngoma\", and \"kuduro\". But regardless of the loanwords from Bantu languages in the lexicon, it must not be considered a Portuguese creole because the grammar and lexicon are truly Portuguese-based. \nIn Brazilian Portuguese, there are a large number of words, whose origin lie in Angolan languages. Various aspects of Brazilian culture – \"samba\", \"candomblé\" and \"capoeira\" – all bear linguistic traces of this contact. \nIn Portugal, Angolan Portuguese has had a large influence on the vernacular of the younger population, contributing significant amounts of lexicon. Examples include:\nand numerous other examples. Many of these words and expression made their way to Portugal during the period of decolonisation in the 1970s, with the arrival of so-called \"retornados\", white Angolans who left the newly independent nation. This influence was reinforced by more recent immigration of black Angolans as a result of the Angolan civil war. These words were even brought to Brazil by white Angolan refugees during and after independence.\n\n\n"}

In colonised or subjugated countries, bourgeois revolutions often take the form of a war of national independence. The English, French, and American revolutions are considered the archetypal bourgeois revolutions, in that they attempted to clear away the remnants of the medieval feudal system, so as to pave the way for the rise of capitalism. The term is usually used in contrast to \"proletarian revolution\", and is also sometimes called a \"bourgeois-democratic revolution\".\n\nAccording to one version of the two-stage theory, bourgeois revolution was asserted to be necessary step in the move toward socialism. In this view, countries that had preserved their feudal structure, like Russia, would have to establish capitalism via a bourgeois revolution before being able to wage a proletarian revolution. At the time of the Russian Revolution, the Mensheviks asserted this theory, arguing that a revolution led by bourgeoisie was necessary to modernise society, establish basic freedoms, and overcome feudalism, which would establish the conditions necessary for socialism.\n"}
{"id": "1983765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983765", "title": "Byline", "text": "Byline\n\nThe byline on a newspaper or magazine article gives the name of the writer of the article. Bylines are commonly placed between the headline and the text of the article, although some magazines (notably \"Reader's Digest\") place bylines at the bottom of the page to leave more room for graphical elements around the headline.\n\nThe dictionary defines a byline as \"a printed line of text accompanying a news story, article, or the like, giving the author's name.\"\n\nA typical newspaper byline might read:\nBob Dylan<br>\"Enterprise Correspondent\"\n\nA byline can also include a brief article summary that introduces the author by name:\nPenning a concise description of a long piece has never been as easy as often appears, as \"Staff Writer\" John Smith now explains:\n\nMagazine bylines and bylines on opinion pieces often include biographical information on their subjects. A typical biographical byline on a piece of creative nonfiction might read\nJohn Smith is working on a book, \"My Time in Ibiza\", based on this article. He is returning to the region this summer to gather material for a follow-up essay.\"\n\nBylines were rare before the late 19th century. Before then, the most similar practice was the occasional \"signed\" or \"signature\" article. The word \"byline\" itself first appeared in print in 1926, in a scene set in a newspaper office in \"The Sun Also Rises\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nOne of the earliest consistent uses of the idea was for battlefield reporting during the American Civil War. In 1863, Union General Joseph Hooker required battlefield reporters to sign their articles so that he would know which journalist to blame for any errors or security violations.\n\nThe practice became more popular at the end of the 19th century, as journalists became more powerful and popular figures. Bylines were used to promote or create celebrities among some yellow journalists during this time. Proponents of signed articles believed that the signature made the journalist more careful and more honest; publishers thought it made papers sell better.\n\nHowever, the increasing use of bylines was resisted by others, including the publisher–owner of \"The New York Times\", Adolph Ochs, who believed that bylines interfered with the impersonal nature of news and decreased the sense of institutional responsibility for an article's content. Bylines remained rare in that newspaper for several more decades.\n\nThe first Associated Press wire services story with a byline appeared in 1925, and the practice became commonplace shortly afterwards.\n\nSince the 1970s, most modern newspapers and magazines have attributed almost all but their shortest articles and their own editorial pieces to individual reporters or to wire services.\n\nAn exception is the British weekly \"The Economist\", which publishes nearly all material except blog posts anonymously. \"The Economist\" explains this practice as being traditional and reflective of the collaborative nature of their reporting.\n\nArticles that originate from press agency journalists are sometimes incorrectly attributed to newspaper staff. Dominic Ponsford of the \"Press Gazette\" gives the following examples:\n\nPonsford also highlights cases in which newspapers byline fictional authors for pieces that attack other newspapers: for example the \"Daily Express\"s use of \"Brendon Abbott\".\n\n"}

{"id": "580879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=580879", "title": "Cheek kissing", "text": "Cheek kissing\n\nCheek kissing is a ritual or social kissing gesture to indicate friendship, family relationship, perform a greeting, to confer congratulations, to comfort someone, to show respect, or to indicate sexual or romantic interest. \n\nCheek kissing is very common in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and Latin America.\nIn other countries including the U.S. and Japan, cheek kissing is common as well at an international meeting between heads of state and First Ladies or members of royal and the Imperial families.\n\nDepending on the local culture, cheek kissing may be considered appropriate among family members as well as friends and acquaintances: a man and a woman, two women, or two men. The last is less socially accepted in many cultures,\n\nIn Eastern Europe, male–female and female–female cheek kissing is a standard greeting among friends, while male–male cheek kisses are less common. Eastern European communist leaders often greeted each other with a socialist fraternal kiss on public and state occasions.\n\nIn a cheek kiss, both persons lean forward and either lightly touch cheek with cheek or lip with cheek. Generally the gesture is repeated with the other cheek, or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, the number of kisses is usually one, two, three or four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.\n\nCheek kissing is used in many cultures with slightly varying meaning and gesture. For example, cheek kissing may or may not be associated with a hug. The appropriate social context for use can vary greatly from one country to the other, though the gesture might look similar.\n\nIn cultures and situations where cheek kissing is the social norm, the failure or refusal to give or accept a kiss is commonly taken as an indicator of antipathy between the people, and to dispel such an implication and avoid giving offense may require an explanation, such as the person has a contagious disease such as a cold.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the cheek kiss may involve one or both cheeks. According to the March 8, 2004 edition of \"Time\" magazine, \"a single [kiss] is [an] acceptable [greeting] in the United States, but it's mostly a big-city phenomenon.\" Occasionally, cheek kissing is a romantic gesture.\n\nCheek kissing of young children by adults of both sexes is perhaps the most common cheek kiss in North America. Typically, it is a short, perfunctory greeting, and is most often done by relatives.\n\nGiving someone a kiss on the cheek is also a common occurrence between loving couples.\nCheek kissing between adults, when it occurs at all, is most often done between a man and woman who know each other well, such as between relatives or close friends. In this case, a short hug (generally only upper-body contact) or handshake may accompany the kiss. Likewise, hugs are common but not required. A hug alone may also suffice in both of these situations, and is much more common. Particularly in the southeastern United States (Southern), elderly women may be cheek kissed by younger men as a gesture of affection and respect.\n\nIn Québec, cheek kissing is referred to in the vernacular (Québécois) as \"un bec\" (\"\"donner un bec\") or \"la bise\" (\"faire la bise\"\"). Whether francophone or other, people of the opposite sex often kiss once on each cheek. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, although men will often refrain. Two people introduced by a mutual friend may also give each other \"un bec\".\n\nImmigrant groups tend to have their own norms for cheek kissing, usually carried over from their native country. In Miami, Florida, an area heavily influenced by Latin American and European immigrants, kissing hello on the cheek is the social norm. In parts of New England influenced by Franco-American or French Canadian cultures, cheek kissing is popular.\n\nIn Latin America, cheek kissing is a universal form of greeting between a man and a woman or two women.\n\nIt is not necessary to know a person well or be intimate with them to kiss them on the cheek. When introduced to someone new by a mutual acquaintance in social settings, it is customary to greet him or her with a cheek kiss if the person being introduced to them is a member of the opposite sex or if a woman is introduced to another woman. If the person is a complete stranger, i.e. self-introductions, no kissing is done. A cheek kiss may be accompanied by a hug or another sign of physical affection. In business settings, the cheek kiss is not always standard upon introduction, but once a relationship is established, it is common practice.\n\nAs with other regions, cheek kissing may be lips-to-cheek or cheek-to-cheek with a kiss in the air, the latter being more common.\n\nIn the Southern Cone countries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay it is common (almost standard) between male friends to kiss \"a la italiana\", i.e. football players kiss each other to congratulate or to greet.\n\nAs in Southern Europe, in Argentina and Uruguay men kissing men is common but it varies depending on the region, occasion and even on the family.\n\nCheek kissing is a standard greeting throughout Southern Europe between friends or acquaintances, but less common in professional settings. In general, men and women will kiss the opposite sex, and women will kiss women. Men kissing men varies depending on the country and even on the family, in some countries (or areas like Southern Italy) men will kiss men; in others only men of the same family would consider kissing.\n\nGreece is an example of a country where cheek kissing highly depends on the region and the type of event. For example, in most parts of Crete, it is common between a man and a woman who are friends, but is very uncommon between men unless they are very close relatives. In Athens it is commonplace for men to kiss women and women to kiss other women on the cheek when meeting or departing. It is uncommon between strangers of any sex, and it may be considered offensive otherwise. It is standard for children and parents, children and grandparents etc., and in its \"formal\" form it will be two kisses, one on each cheek. It may be a standard formal form of greeting in special events such as weddings.\n\nHowever, in Portugal and Spain, usually, women kiss both men and women, and men only kiss women (so, 2 men rarely kiss). In Portuguese families men rarely kiss men (except between brothers or father and son) , the handshake is the most common salutation between them. However, men kissing may occur in Spain as well particularly when congratulating close friends or relatives. Cheek to cheek and the kiss in the air are also very popular. Hugging is common between men and men and women and women; when the other is from the opposite sex, a kiss may be added.\nIn Italy (especially in the South or the Center) it is common for men to kiss men, especially relatives or friends.\n\nIn Spain, it is very common to kiss both cheeks (double kiss), man-woman and woman-woman only.\n\nIn most South European countries, kissing is initiated by leaning to the left side and joining the right cheeks and if there's a second kiss, changing to the left cheeks. In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join the left cheeks and then switch to the right cheeks.\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, cheek kissing is also very commonplace, with your nationality being ascertainable by the number of kisses on each cheek. Typically, Croats and Bosniaks will kiss once on each cheek, for two total kisses, whereas Serbs (be they from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia or Montenegro) will kiss three times, typically starting at the right cheek. In Serbia and Montenegro, it is also not uncommon for men to kiss each other on the cheek three times as a form of greeting, usually for people they have not encountered in a while, while male-female and female-female kissing is also standard.\n\nIn Bulgaria cheek kissing is practiced to a far lesser extent compared to ex-Yugoslavia and is usually seen only between very close relatives or sometimes between close female friends. Kissing is usually performed by people of the opposite sex and between two women. Men kissing is rare even between close friends and is sometimes treated offensive.\n\nIn Romania, cheek kissing is commonly used as a greeting between a man and a woman or two women, once on each cheek. Men usually prefer handshakes among themselves, though sometimes close male relatives may also practice cheek kissing.\n\nIn France, where the custom is called \"faire la bise\", the cheek kiss came under scrutiny during the H1N1 epidemic of 2009. A popular French joke states that you may recognize the city you are in by counting the number of cheek kisses, as it varies across the country. It is very common, in the southern parts of France, even between males, be they relatives or friends, whereas in the north (Langue-d'oïl France), it is less usual for two unrelated males to perform ′\"la bise\"′.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, cheek kissing is a common greeting between relatives and friends (in the Netherlands slightly more so in the south). Generally speaking, women will kiss both women and men, while men will kiss women but refrain from kissing other men, instead preferring to shake hands with strangers. In the Netherlands and the Dutch part of Belgium usually three kisses are exchanged. The same number of kisses is found in Switzerland. In Francophone Belgium, the custom is usually one or three kisses, and is also common between men who are friends.\n\nIn Northern European countries such as Sweden and Germany, hugs are preferred to kisses. It is customary in many regions to only have kisses between women and women, but not men and women, who only shake hands or hug (more familiar) instead.\n\nAlthough cheek kissing is not as widely practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as in other parts of Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is commonplace, however a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some dependant on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.\n\nIn Pakistan women may kiss female family and close friends, while men typically hug and shake hands with close family and friends when meeting. \n\nIn Pashtun and Baloch culture in Pakistan both men and women may kiss close family members on both cheeks. In Gilgit Baltistan - family members may kiss on cheeks followed by a kiss on the hand.\n\nIn the Philippines, cheek kissing or \"beso\" (also \"beso-beso\", from the Spanish for \"kiss\") is a common greeting. The Philippine cheek kiss is a cheek-to-cheek kiss, not a lips-to-cheek kiss. The cheek kiss is usually made once (right cheek to right cheek), either between two women, or between a woman and a man. Amongst the upper classes, it is a common greeting among adults who are friends, while for the rest of the population, however, the gesture is generally reserved for relatives. Filipinos who are introduced to each other for the first time do not cheek kiss unless they are related.\n\nIn certain communities in Indonesia, notably the Manado or Minahasa people, kissing on the cheeks (twice) is normal among relatives, including males.\n\nIn parts of Central, South, and East Asia with predominantly Buddhist or Hindu cultures, or in cultures heavily influenced by these two religions, cheek kissing is largely uncommon and may be considered offensive, although its instances are now growing.\n\nCheek kissing in Israel is widely common. It is typical for individuals to cheek kiss twice (one time on each cheek) when greeting and when saying goodbye, regardless of gender. It consists of cheek to cheek contact and the sound of a kiss to the air.\n\nCheek kissing in the Arab world is relatively common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between a male and female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities in some of the more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.\n\nCheek kissing in Turkey is also widely accepted in greetings. Male to male cheek kissing is considered normal in almost every occasion, but very rarely for men who are introduced for the first time. Some men hit each other's head on the side instead of cheek kissing, possibly as an attempt to masculinize the action. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare for women who are introduced for the first time. A man and a woman could cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.\n\nCheek kissing in Iran is relatively common between friends and family. Cheek kissing between individuals of the same sex is considered normal. However, cheek kissing between male and female in public is considered to be a punishable crime by the government, but it is known to occur among some young Iranians.\nIn 2014, Leila Hatami, a famous Iranian actress, kissed the president of Cannes Gilles Jacob on the red carpet. Responses ranged from criticism by the Iranian government to support from Iranian opposition parties. Former president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad kissed the mother of former President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez at his funeral.\n"}

{"id": "7737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737", "title": "Clairvoyance", "text": "Clairvoyance\n\nClairvoyance (; from French \"clair\" meaning \"clear\" and \"voyance\" meaning \"vision\") is the alleged ability to gain information about an object, person, location, or physical event through extrasensory perception. Any person who is claimed to have such ability is said accordingly to be a clairvoyant () (\"one who sees clearly\").\n\nClaims for the existence of paranormal and psychic abilities such as clairvoyance have not been supported by scientific evidence published in high impact factor peer reviewed journals. Parapsychology explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is not accepted by the scientific community. Parapsychology, including the study of clairvoyance, is an example of pseudoscience.\nPertaining to the ability of clear-sightedness, clairvoyance refers to the paranormal ability to see persons and events that are distant in time or space. It can be divided into roughly three classes: precognition, the ability to perceive or predict future events, retrocognition, the ability to see past events, and remote viewing, the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.\n\nThroughout history, there have been numerous places and times in which people have claimed themselves or others to be clairvoyant.\n\nA number of Christian saints were said to be able to see or know things that were far removed from their immediate sensory perception as a kind of gift from God, including Columba of Iona, Padre Pio and Anne Catherine Emmerich. Jesus Christ in the Gospels is also recorded as being able to know things that were far removed from his immediate human perception.\n\nIn other religions, similar stories of certain individuals being able to see things far removed from their immediate sensory perception are commonplace, especially within pagan religions where oracles were used. Prophecy often involved some degree of clairvoyance, especially when future events were predicted.\n\nIn most of these cases, however, the ability to see things was attributed to a higher power and not thought of as an ability that lay within the person himself.\n\nIn Jainism, clairvoyance is regarded as one of the five kinds of knowledge. The beings of hell and heaven (devas) are said to possess clairvoyance by birth. According to Jain text Sarvārthasiddhi, \"this kind of knowledge has been called \"avadhi\" as it ascertains matter in downward range or knows objects within limits\".\n\nThe earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the Marquis de Puységur, a follower of Franz Mesmer, who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others. Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the spiritualist period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.\n\nEarly researchers of clairvoyance included William Gregory, Gustav Pagenstecher, and Rudolf Tischner. Clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by Charles Richet. Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them. The subject was reported to have been successful in a series of 133 trials but the results dropped to chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge. J. M. Peirce and E. C. Pickering reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23,384 trials which did not obtain above chance scores.\n\nIvor Lloyd Tuckett (1911) and Joseph McCabe (1920) analyzed early cases of clairvoyance and came to the conclusion they were best explained by coincidence or fraud. In 1919, the magician P. T. Selbit staged a séance at his own flat in Bloomsbury. The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle attended the séance and declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine.\n\nA significant development in clairvoyance research came when J. B. Rhine, a parapsychologist at Duke University, introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analyzing data, as part of his research into extrasensory perception. A number of psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine's experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded \"There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.\" Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results. It was revealed that Rhine's experiments contained methodological flaws and procedural errors.\n\nEileen Garrett was tested by Rhine at Duke University in 1933 with Zener cards. Certain symbols that were placed on the cards and sealed in an envelope, and she was asked to guess their contents. She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a psychic energy called \"energy stimulus\" and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order. The parapsychologist Samuel Soal and his colleagues tested Garrett in May, 1937. Most of the experiments were carried out in the Psychological Laboratory at the University College London. A total of over 12,000 guesses were recorded but Garrett failed to produce above chance level. In his report Soal wrote \"In the case of Mrs. Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest confirmation of Dr. J. B. Rhine's remarkable claims relating to her alleged powers of extra-sensory perception. Not only did she fail when I took charge of the experiments, but she failed equally when four other carefully trained experimenters took my place.\"\n\nRemote viewing also known as remote sensing, remote perception, telesthesia and travelling clairvoyance is the alleged paranormal ability to perceive a remote or hidden target without support of the senses.\n\nA well known study of remote viewing in recent times has been the US government-funded project at the Stanford Research Institute during the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In 1972, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the \"viewers\" or \"percipients\") could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or \"targets\". In the early studies, a human \"sender\" was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term remote viewing was coined to describe this overall process. The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on remote viewing was published in \"Nature\" in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success. After the publication of these findings, other attempts to replicate the experiments were carried out with remotely linked groups using computer conferencing.\n\nThe psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff's remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute. In a series of 35 studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates. Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues. James Randi has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.\n\nIn 1980, Charles Tart claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff's experiments revealed an above-chance result. Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues. Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote \"considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart's failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues.\"\n\nIn 1982 Robert Jahn, then Dean of the School of Engineering at Princeton University wrote a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective. His paper included numerous references to remote viewing studies at the time. Statistical flaws in his work have been proposed by others in the parapsychological community and within the general scientific community.\n\nAccording to scientific research, clairvoyance is generally explained as the result of confirmation bias, expectancy bias, fraud, hallucination, self-delusion, sensory leakage, subjective validation, wishful thinking or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences and not as a paranormal power. Parapsychology is regarded by the scientific community as a pseudoscience. In 1988, the US National Research Council concluded \"The committee finds no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years, for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.\"\n\nSkeptics say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear. They also contend that those who believe in paranormal phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons. According to David G. Myers (\"Psychology,\" 8th ed.):\n\nThe search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem & Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem & others, 2001; Milton & Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).One skeptic, magician James Randi, has a longstanding offer—now U.S. $1 million—\"to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions\" (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi's offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing. \"People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist.\" Susan Blackmore, \"Blackmore's first law\", 2004.\n\nClairvoyance is considered hallucination by mainstream psychiatry.\n\n\n"}

The lead is fabricated by adding a dry water-soluble permanent dye to powdered graphite—used in standard graphite pencils—before binding the mixture with clay.\n\nCopying pencils were introduced in the 1870s and were originally marketed for copying documents, especially for making permanent copies of a permanent original. This was achieved by creating a hand-written document using a copying pencil, laying a moist tissue paper over the document and pressing down with a mechanical press. The water-soluble dye in the writing would be transferred in its mirror image to the tissue paper, which could then be read in verso by holding it up to a light source. According to conservationist Liz Dube, \"By the 1870's, letter copying books became the ubiquitous copying tool for businesses. These volumes contained hundreds of leaves of thin tissue paper, often high quality Japanese papers, bound together for the purpose of bearing copies of outgoing correspondence and other business documents.\"\n\nThe most commonly used dye was aniline, which produced a stain that was bright purple, mauve, or some color in between, depending upon the manufacturer. Since the aniline dye was poisonous to humans, many injuries and illness related to copying pencils were reported in the medical literature, especially in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, better copying methods had become available. Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an indelible pencil, a precursor to the ball-point pen. When used dry, it left a slightly purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased. When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing. The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the fountain-pen: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks. Furthermore, for producing copies using carbon paper, copying pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and fountain-pens (whose nibs could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).\n\nCopying pencils saw extended use in World War I in the completion of a wide range of paperwork. However, with the advent of refined ball-point pen technology in the 1930s, their use gradually died off in much of the world. They saw longer use in some places. In countries like India and the Soviet Union, they were commonly used for writing addresses on registered mail parcels, which were required by law to be wrapped in cloth—usually plain white or unbleached calico—and secured with twine and sealing wax. For writing an address on cloth, a moistened copying pencil was preferred to a pen, whose nib could easily get caught in the weave. During their heyday, copying pencils were also associated, across the world, with the image of a railway conductor, who famously carried one tucked behind an ear.\n\nIn Italy and other countries, their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referenda. The signs written with copying pencil cannot be tampered without leaving clear traces on the paper.\n\nIndelible pencils were the cause of significant health risks due to the presence of aniline dyes. Exposure to aniline dyes could lead to eczema, acne and carcinoma. Penetration of the dye from the pencil lead into the body commonly leads to severe and debilitating effects such as fever, anaemia, elevated white cell count, gastro-intestinal upset, kidney and liver damage, anorexia and necrosis of the tissue surrounding the wound. Such risks are not associated with ordinary graphite pencils. While these symptoms may appear after a couple of days they often develop only after weeks have passed since the injury was sustained. Surgery is required to remove the dye and the infected tissue and \"the necrotizing action may be so severe and extensive amputation is necessary\".\n\n"}
{"id": "274165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274165", "title": "Dead space (physiology)", "text": "Dead space (physiology)\n\nIn physiology, dead space is the volume of air which is inhaled that does not take part in the gas exchange, either because it (1) remains in the conducting airways, or (2) reaches alveoli that are not perfused or poorly perfused. In other words, not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Mammals breathe in and out of their lungs, wasting that part of the inhalation which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur.\n\nBenefits do accrue to a seemingly wasteful design for ventilation that includes dead space. \n\nIn humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O and CO levels. In adults, it is usually in the range of 150 mL.\n\nDead space can be increased (and better envisioned) by breathing through a long tube, such as a snorkel. Even though one end of the snorkel is open to the air, when the wearer breathes in, they inhale a significant quantity of air that remained in the snorkel from the previous exhalation. Thus, a snorkel increases the person's dead space by adding even more \"airway\" that doesn't participate in gas exchange.\n\nThe \"total\" dead space (also known as physiological dead space) is the sum of the anatomical dead space plus the alveolar dead space.\n\nAnatomical dead space is that portion of the airways (such as the mouth and trachea to the bronchioles) which conducts gas to the alveoli. No gas exchange is possible in these spaces. In healthy lungs where the alveolar dead space is small, Fowler's method accurately measures the anatomic dead space by a nitrogen washout technique.\nThe normal value for dead space volume (in mL) is approximately the lean mass of the body (in pounds), and averages about a third of the resting tidal volume (450-500 mL). In Fowler's original study, the anatomic dead space was 156 ± 28 mL (n=45 males) or 26% of their tidal volume. Despite the flexibility of the trachea and smaller conducting airways, their overall volume (i.e. the anatomic dead space) changes little with bronchoconstriction or when breathing hard during exercise.\n\nBirds have a disproportionately large anatomic dead space (they have a longer and wider trachea than mammals the same size), reducing the airway resistance. This adaptation does not impact gas exchange because birds flow air through their lungs - they do not breathe in and out like mammals.\n\nAlveolar dead space is sum of the volumes of those alveoli which have little or no blood flowing through their adjacent pulmonary capillaries, i.e., alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused, and where, as a result, no gas exchange can occur. Alveolar dead space is negligible in healthy individuals, but can increase dramatically in some lung diseases due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n\nJust as dead space \"wastes\" a fraction of the inhaled breath, dead space \"dilutes\" alveolar air during exhalation. By quantifying this dilution it is possible to measure anatomical and alveolar dead space, employing the concept of mass balance, as expressed by Bohr equation. \n\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide (CO) in healthy alveoli is known. It is equal to its concentration in arterial blood since CO rapidly equilibrates across the alveolar–capillary membrane. The quantity of CO exhaled from the healthy alveoli will be diluted by the air in the conducting airways and by air from alveoli that are poorly perfused. This dilution factor can be calculated once the CO in the exhaled breath is determined (either by electronically monitoring the exhaled breath or by collecting the exhaled breath in a gas impermeant bag (a Douglas bag) and then measuring the mixed gas in the collection bag). Algebraically, this dilution factor will give us the physiological dead space as calculated by the Bohr equation:\n\nWhen the poorly perfused alveoli empty at the same rate as the normal alveoli, it is possible to measure the alveolar dead space. In this case, the end-tidal sample of gas (measured by capnography) contains CO at a concentration that is less than that found in the normal alveoli (i.e. in the blood): \n\nA different maneuver is employed in measuring anatomic dead space: the test subject breathes all the way out, inhales deeply from a 0% nitrogen gas mixture (usually 100% oxygen) and then breathes out into equipment that measures nitrogen and gas volume. This final exhalation occurs in three phases. The first phase has no nitrogen, and is the air that entered the lung only as far as the conducting airways. The nitrogen concentration then rapidly increases during the brief second phase and finally reaches a plateau, the third phase. The anatomic dead space is equal to the volume exhaled during the first phase plus half that exhaled during the second phase. (The Bohr equation is used to justify the inclusion of half the second phase in this calculation.)\n\nThe depth and frequency of our breathing is determined by chemoreceptors and the brainstem, as modified by a number of subjective sensations. When ventilated, the patient breathes at a rate and tidal volume that is dictated by the machine.\nBecause of dead space, taking deep breaths more slowly (e.g. ten 500 ml breaths per minute) is more effective than taking shallow breaths quickly (e.g. twenty 250 ml breaths per minute). Although the amount of gas per minute is the same (5 L/min), a large proportion of the shallow breaths is dead space, and does not allow oxygen to get into the blood.\n\nMechanical dead space is dead space in an apparatus in which the breathing gas must flow in both directions as the user breathes in and out, increasing the necessary respiratory effort to get the same amount of usable air or breathing gas, and risking accumulation of carbon dioxide from shallow breaths. It is in effect an external extension of the physiological dead space.\n\nIt can be reduced by:\n\n\nArend Bouhuys. 1964. \"Respiratory dead space.\" in \"Handbook of Physiology.

In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.\n\nFor example, an intensional definition of the word \"bachelor\" is \"unmarried man\". This definition is valid because being an unmarried man is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for being a bachelor: it is necessary because one cannot be a bachelor without being an unmarried man, and it is sufficient because any unmarried man is a bachelor.\n\nThis is the opposite approach to the extensional definition, which defines by listing everything that falls under that definition – an extensional definition of \"bachelor\" would be a listing of all the unmarried men in the world.\n\nAs becomes clear, intensional definitions are best used when something has a clearly defined set of properties, and they work well for terms that have too many referents to list in an extensional definition. It is impossible to give an extensional definition for a term with an infinite set of referents, but an intensional one can often be stated concisely – there are infinitely many even numbers, impossible to list, but the term \"even numbers\" can be defined easily by saying that even numbers are integer multiples of two.\n\nDefinition by genus and difference, in which something is defined by first stating the broad category it belongs to and then distinguished by specific properties, is a type of intensional definition. As the name might suggest, this is the type of definition used in Linnaean taxonomy to categorize living things, but is by no means restricted to biology. Suppose one defines a miniskirt as \"a skirt with a hemline above the knee\". It has been assigned to a \"genus\", or larger class of items: it is a type of skirt. Then, we've described the \"differentia\", the specific properties that make it its own sub-type: it has a hemline above the knee.\n\nIntensional definition also applies to rules or sets of axioms that define a set by describing a procedure for generating all of its members. For example, an intensional definition of \"square number\" can be \"any number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself\". The rule—\"take an integer and multiply it by itself\"—always generates members of the set of square numbers, no matter which integer one chooses, and for any square number, there is an integer that was multiplied by itself to get it.\n\nSimilarly, an intensional definition of a game, such as chess, would be the rules of the game; any game played by those rules must be a game of chess, and any game properly called a game of chess must have been played by those rules.\n\nAn extensional definition of a concept or term formulates its meaning by specifying its extension, that is, every object that falls under the definition of the concept or term in question.\n\nFor example, an extensional definition of the term \"nation of the world\" might be given by listing all of the nations of the world, or by giving some other means of recognizing the members of the corresponding class. An explicit listing of the extension, which is only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets, is a type of \"enumerative definition\".\n\nExtensional definitions are used when listing examples would give more applicable information than other types of definition, and where listing the members of a set tells the questioner enough about the nature of that set. \n\nThis is similar to an ostensive definition, in which one or more members of a set (but not necessarily all) are pointed out as examples. The opposite approach is the intensional definition, which defines by listing properties that a thing must have in order to be part of the set captured by the definition.\n\n"}

From the Australian mobile phone industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other English language countries, as business jargon for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The logic behind is believed to be a method used by Australian mobile phone companies to recover a component of the carriage charges they incur in completing a call to a subscriber being the termination rates, based on the price terms and conditions for the mobile terminating access service (MTAS). The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing these arrangements.\n\nThe expression is also beginning to find its way into other businesses as a synonym to \"start fee\". The taxi expression is also being used in Hong Kong, New Zealand, and some other countries, but hasn't been used there as a general synonym for start fee.\n\nThe origin is a taxi expression for the minimum charge for hiring a taxi, to which the rate per kilometre or mile and a rate per minute is usually then added up to a minimum taxicab road speed. \nWhen the passenger steps inside the taxicab, the flagfall condition is triggered and the taxicab driver can start the taximeter. Even if the passenger has not yet instructed the driver where to take them, the driver is entitled to the flagfall and the rate per minute component (even if the taxi is not moving). \nThe term, \"Flagfall\" dates back to the old mechanical taximeters, which were equipped with a flag-like lever that could be seen from outside the cab. When the \"flag\" was up and visible, the cab was not occupied. When a passenger stepped in, the driver turned the lever down - the \"flag fall\" - and the taximeter started counting. In Australia, once the taximeter is counting, there are orange tariff indicator lights on the taxi head sign which light up to show the taxicab is hired.\n\n\n"}

Intensive formations, for example, existed in Proto-Indo-European, and in many of the Semitic languages.\n\nIntensives are generally used as adverbs.

An example in common usage today is \"the heck\"; as in \"What the heck is going on here?\" \"The heck\" can be left out of the sentence without changing the meaning; however, the sentence is less intense without it.

Once he became a lawyer (1878), he returned to Majorca to take up varying posts in the Island's judiciary. Simultaneously, he was a militant of the liberal party of his friend Antoni Maura when he commenced a political career that would culminate in his appointment as a representative of the 'Corts' [Courts] (1893). After a short stay in Madrid, he returned home to the Balearic Islands and abandoned all political activities.\n\nFrom an early age he had combined his studies and, later on, his professional occupation, with his interest in writing. At the age of eighteen he had published his poems in both Catalan and Spanish in magazines like 'El Isleño', 'Museo Balear' or 'Revista Balear'. However, his literary interest would become stronger during the time spent in Barcelona, where he had come into contact with the literary activities of the 'Renaixença' cultural movement (magazines, literary contests, conferences, readings…). At 23 he would win an extraordinary prize at the Barcelona 'Jocs Florals' [Floral Games].\n\nJoan Alcover was to gain recognition as a poet, and he would soon become the kind of person who, extremely fond of literature, would use his literary ability in order to gain social prestige. Thus, his house would become the base for reputed talks with the prestigious Majorcan intellectuals. Little by little he ceased to write in Catalan, preferring to write his poetry in Spanish. His first poetry books 'Poesías' [Poetries] (1887), 'Nuevas poesías' [New poetries] (1892), 'Poemas y armonías' [Poetries and harmonies] (1894) and 'Meteoros. Poemas, apólogos y cuentos' [Meteors. Poems, apologues and stories] (1901), reflect this tendency to be monolingual, even though he would include some poems in Catalan in the first two titles. However, the other two titles would be entirely written in Spanish. This is poetry inspired by the Romantic, which imitates other poets', such as Bécquer and Campoamor, having intense expression of the poetical voice, yet straining to avoid rhetorical excesses and pomposity. His books were well received by critics who afforded him a title in circles which supported the official culture.\n\nHowever, misfortune played a decisive role in both his life and literary career. In 1887, just six years after he had wed, Alcover lost his wife, Rosa Pujol Guarch, with whom he had had three children, Pere, Teresa and Gaietà. In 1891 he married Maria del Haro Rosselló, with whom he had two more children, Maria and Pau. Of the five children, he would only be outlived by the last one: in 1901 Teresa died from tuberculosis; in 1905, Pere died from typhoid; in 1919 both Maria and Gaietà perished on the same day. This sequence of misfortunes drove him to a deep nervous breakdown which would lead him to heighten his intellectual research, deriving of more natural and sincere forms of expression. His poetry would progressively start to change, beginning with its medium, that is the language in which it was written. Between 1899 and 1903 Alcover would hesitate whether to continue writing in Spanish, or return to Catalan: he would eventually decide to fully embrace Catalan.\n\nIn fact his personal circumstances would overlap with other collective conditions: in the Majorca of the time, Romantic literature was in decline, the island was becoming modernised, cultural ties had started to emerge with Catalonia and political Catalanism was starting to gain prominence in the island. All this moved him to broaden his literary horizons, to join a wider movement and to make ties, mainly due to his friendship with Santiago Rusiñol and Josep Carner, with the Principalities’ cultural activity. This move guided him towards a new perception of art and literature, whose sense was no longer ingeniousness and the entertaining easy game, but a social involvement: he believed that poetry must have a resonance and that it must serve a useful purpose in the collective from which it drew its inspiration and whom it served.\n\nIn 1904 he gave a seminar at Barcelona’s Athenaeum entitled ‘Humanització de l’art’ [Humanising of art], which constituted his most important declaration about the art of lyrical composition. In this text he defended the belief that a poet's involvement should be aesthetically exposed in a clear and intelligible poetry, in a well presented form. However, he expressed his dislike for an intellectualised poetry and those so called literary schools and trends that were based upon mere artifice. He therefore positioned himself half way between a spontaneous type of poetry, like that written by Joan Maragall, and a lyricism constructed upon perfect form, but sentimentally arid, like that written by the Parnassian poets. In accordance with the turn of the centuries' views about truth and life, Alcover would pursue a poetry style tied to life's experience which was able to deeply connect with the reader's sense of humanity.\n\nThe book that best exemplifies his lyrical theory is 'Cap al tard' [When it is getting late] (1909), which is written entirely in Catalan: in this collection of unrelated poems we see a lyrical voice split into different people, describing many landscapes which are typically Majorcan, in order to express their anaemic state, feelings and emotions, as well as the poet’s own artistic conception. Alcover did this by using forms and ideas taken from popular imaginary, like those we find in the poem ‘Balanguera’, which would be adapted to music by Amadeu Vives and become Majorca’s present-day hymn. The section entitled ‘Elegies’ [Elegies] is, without doubt, one of the high points of the book: here the poet demonstrates, from a slightly detached angle, the fatherly suffering he had experienced, even though, it must be said, he transcends this pain by turning it into an emotion that can be universally felt. In ‘Poemes bíblics’ [Biblical poems] (1918), which would be his final book of poems, he again uses different poetical persons, but this time they are of biblical inspiration, and he does not achieve the same degree of excellence that he had reached in the previous volume.\n\nHis status as an intellectual, like that of Miquel Costa Llobera, was recognised and acclaimed by many writers of the time, and especially by those of the 'escola mallorquina' [Majorcan School]. He was a member of the 'Acadèmia de Bones Lletres' [Academy of Good Letters] (1913), President of the Barcelona 'Jocs Florals' [Floral Games] (1916) and a member of the 'Institut d'Estudis Catalans' [Institute of Catalan Studies] (1916).\n\n"}

{"id": "3472397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3472397", "title": "Lactate threshold", "text": "Lactate threshold\n\nLactate inflection point (LIP), is the exercise intensity at which the blood concentration of lactate and/or lactic acid begins to exponentially increase. It is often expressed as 85% of maximum heart rate or 75% of maximum oxygen intake. When exercising at or below the LT, any lactate produced by the muscles is removed by the body without it building up.\n\nThe onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) is often confused with the lactate threshold. With a higher exercise intensity the lactate production exceeds at a rate which it cannot be broken down, the blood lactate concentration will show an increase equal to 4.0mM; it then accumulates at the muscle and then moves to the bloodstream.\n\nRegular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which prevent lactate levels from rising. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1α which alters the isoenzyme composition of the LDH complex and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.\n\nThe lactate threshold is a useful measure for deciding exercise intensity for training and racing in endurance sports (e.g., long distance running, cycling, rowing, long distance swimming and cross country skiing), but varies between individuals and can be increased with training.\n\nInterval training uses different work and rest periods allowing the body to temporarily exceed the lactate threshold at a high intensity, and then recover (reduce blood-lactate). This type of training uses the ATP-PC and the lactic acid system whilst exercising, which provides the most energy when there are short bursts of high intensity exercise followed by a recovery period. Interval training can take the form of many different types of exercise and should closely replicate the movements found in the sport being trained for. Interval training can be adjusted to the individual, however it is important to consider the intensity of each interval, duration or distance of each interval, length of rest/recovery, number of repetitions, frequency of training and recovery type.\n\nFartlek and interval training are similar, the main difference being the structure of the exercise. Fartlek is a Swedish word, meaning speed play. This type of training is a combination of continuous (generally aerobic) and interval training (generally anaerobic), involving consistent changes of pace/intensity throughout the session.\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between lactate threshold and lactic acid. Aerobic training will not help with lactic acid tolerance, however, it will increase the lactate threshold. The body will build a better tolerance to the effects of lactic acid over time during training. Anaerobic training improves the muscles’ alkaline reserves, allowing the muscles’ ability to work in the presence of increased lactic acid. Training at or slightly above the intensity where this occurs improves the lactate threshold.\n\nYour muscles are producing lactate even at rest, usually about 0.8-1.5 mmol/L. Although the lactate threshold is defined as the point when lactic acid starts to accumulate, some testers approximate this by crossing the lactate threshold and using the point at which lactate reaches a concentration of 4 mmol/L of lactate. Another way to measure lactate levels non-invasively is using Near-infrared spectroscopy. There are wearable NIRS sensors for professionals, so they can monitor their lactate levels real-time. Accurately measuring the lactate blood concentration involves taking blood samples (normally a pinprick to the finger, earlobe or thumb) during a ramp test where the exercise intensity is progressively increased.\n\nA number of Garmin running and cycling devices estimate user lactate threshold non-invasively via a combined analysis of heart rate and heart rate variability data provided by Firstbeat Technologies.\n\nBlood samples are a popular way of measuring the lactate blood concentration, however there are many factors that may affect the sample. Every individual has a different health status, thus the results from the blood lactate response can vary from factors prior to exercise such as the glycogen status of the participant and ambient temperature. “Furthermore, the lactate concentration measured may vary depending on the sampling site sweat contamination, and the accuracy of the lactate analyser.” There are many factors that may give this test a false reading; it is important that an individual takes these into consideration, to receive an accurate test.\n\nThe aerobic threshold (AeT or AerT) is sometimes defined as the exercise intensity at which blood lactate concentrations rise above resting levels. Anaerobic threshold (AnT) is sometimes defined equivalently to the lactate threshold(LT); as the exercise intensity beyond which blood lactate concentration is no longer linearly related to exercise intensity, but increases with both exercise intensity \"and\" duration. The blood lactate concentration at the anaerobic threshold is called the \"maximum steady-state lactate concentration\" (MLSS).\n\nAeT is the exercise intensity at which aerobic energy pathways start to operate, considered to be around 65-85% of an individual's maximum heart rate. Some have suggested this is where blood lactate reaches a concentration of 2 mmol/litre (at rest it is around 1). The anaerobic energy system increases the ability to produce blood lactate during maximal exercise, resulting from an increased amount of glycogen stores and glycolytic enzymes.\n\n"}
{"id": "10790932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10790932", "title": "Languages of Brunei", "text": "Languages of Brunei\n\nThere are a number of languages spoken in Brunei. The official language of the state of Brunei is Standard Malay, the same Malaccan dialect that is the basis for the standards in Malaysia and Indonesia. This came into force on 29 September 1959, with the signing of Brunei 1959 Constitution.\n\nMalay is specified as the national language of Brunei in the constitution of 1959, and its central role in the country is reinforced in the national MIB philosophy (\"Melayu Islam Beraja\", 'Malay Islamic Monarchy').\n\nWhile the variety of Malay that functions as the national language is not specified, it is generally assumed to be a variety of Standard Malay that is similar to the standard varieties promoted in Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nIn fact, the use of Standard Malay and Brunei Malay can be described under the concept of diglossia, with Standard Malay taking the H(igh) role and being used in formal domains such as teaching and official speeches, while Brunei Malay functions in a L(ow) role, being used in informal domains such as between friends and in local shops.\n\nIn terms of pronunciation, the Standard Malay of Brunei is rhotic, so there is an [r] at the end of words such as \"besar\" ('big'), and it has [a] rather than [ə] at the end of words such as \"saya\" ('I') and \"utara\" ('north').\n\nThe local dialect, Melayu Brunei (Brunei Malay), is the most widely spoken language. It is spoken by about 266,000 people. About 84% of its words are cognate with Standard Malay, while 94% are reported to be cognate with Kedayan.\n\nBrunei Malay is also spoken as a lingua franca in some parts of East Malaysia such as the Federal Territory of Labuan, the districts of Limbang and Lawas (Sarawak) and the districts of Sipitang, Beaufort, Kuala Penyu and Papar (Sabah). In Brunei, use of Brunei Malay is expanding at the expense of the other indigenous minority languages in Brunei, most of which are under threat of extinction.\n\nSome of the phonological features of Brunei Malay are: /h/ cannot occur in initial position, and there are only three vowels, /i,a,u/. For its syntax, if has been claimed that the verb often occurs in initial position, and there is a distinct set of modal verbs.\n\nEnglish is widely used as a business and official language and it is spoken by a majority of the population in Brunei, though some people have only a rudimentary knowledge of the language. There is one daily English language newspaper, \"Borneo Bulletin\".\n\nThe bilingual system of education was introduced in 1985, with the first three years taught in Malay while English was the medium of instruction for most subjects from the fourth year of primary school onward, so all school children have had substantial exposure to English since then. In 2008, the new SPN21 education system was introduced, and from then on, maths and science have been taught in English from the start of primary school, so the role of English is even more firmly established.\n\nThe language of the courts is mainly English, though, just as in Malaysia, code-switching between English and Malay is common.\n\nOne result of the promotion of both English and Malay in Brunei is that minority languages, such as Tutong and Dusun, tend to get squeezed out. Noor Azam has described the situation using the Malay proverb: \"Gajah berperang, pelanduk mati di tengah-tengah\". ('When elephants fight, the mouse-deer between them dies.')\n\nSome features of the pronunciation of English in Brunei are: the TH sound at the start of words such as \"thin\" and \"think\" tends to be pronounced as [t]; vowel reduction is mostly avoided in function words such as \"of\" and \"that\"; and there is an increasing incidence of rhoticity.\n\nThe Chinese minority in Brunei speak a number of Chinese varieties. The main varieties of Chinese spoken include Hokkien, Cantonese and Hakka.\n\nMandarin is the language of instruction in some Chinese schools, and there are also some radio broadcasts in Mandarin. Mandarin is also used as the lingua franca among the Chinese community.\n\nApart from Brunei Malay and Kedayan, the latter which may be considered a dialect of Malay, five indigenous minority ethic groups are officially recognised in Brunei, each with their own language: Tutong, Belait, Dusun, Bisaya, and Lun Bawang ('Murut'). Each of these five minority languages is threatened with extinction, though it has been reported that Murut (which is spoken mostly in the enclave of Temburong) is relatively healthy, partly because it receives some support across the Malaysian border in Lawas, where it is known as Lun Bawang.\n\nIban is also quite widely spoken in Temburong, and there is a small community of Penan speakers living in a longhouse along the Belait River.\n\nArabic is the language of the Quran and is used by Islamic scholars in Brunei. The official religion of Brunei is Islam and as such, all adherents of the faith possess some proficiency in reading and speaking Arabic.\n\nArabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools. All Islamic children are required by law to attend an Ugama School ('Religious School') for three hours five days per week from the ages of 7 till 15, and the curriculum of these schools promotes the learning of Arabic as well as skill using Jawi, the Arabic-based script for representing Malay. \n\nIn addition to the Ugama Schools, as of 2004, there were six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei.\n\nThe Indian minority in Brunei originates mostly from southern India. They are joined by a relatively large expatriate community, estimated at about 7500, from India. Tamil is mainly spoken by Indians in Brunei.\n\nThere is also a contingent of Nepali soldiers of the Gurkha Reserve Unit in Sungai Akar camp and 1st and 2nd Battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles stationed in Seria, Brunei. The language spoken by most of these soldiers is Gurkhali. There are Gurkhali languages services provided by Radio Television Brunei and the British Forces Broadcasting Service.\n\nBesides the expatriate Indians, Brunei also has a large expatriate community of Filipino, Indonesian, Dutch and English-speaking origins. Betawi, Javanese, Sundanese, Ambonese and Batak languages are also spoken by immigrants from Indonesia.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of Anantrao and Indirabai Khare.\n\nAnantrao was a progressive thinker and educator, and Indirabai was a capable woman who successfully managed a dairy business for 25 years. Balutai later wrote a semi-biographical novel \"Kharemaster\" (खरेमास्तर) after her father.\n\nIn her teens, Balutai's parents sent her to stay in the hostel of the school for girls which Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve had started a few years earlier in Hingane, then in the outskirts of Pune. After finishing her education in that school, she graduated before her age 20 from the women's college which Karve had also started. At both of those institutions, progressive ideas of Karve and his teaching colleagues like Vaman Malhar Joshi highly influenced her thinking.\n\nAfter college education, Balutai joined the teaching staff of Pune's Kanya Shala, which again was a girls' school being run under Karve's guidance. In 1936, she left that high school in the position of its headmistress to take up a government job as an administrator of a \"settlement\" for certain tribes identified as \"criminal\" tribes by the British government ruling over India at that time.\n\nShe met and married Vishram Bedekar in 1938, and took the name Malati Vishram Bedekar.\n\nShe left the government job in 1940 to take up writing, voluntary social services, and participation in socialist political activities.\n\nShe chaired a \"parallel\" \"Sahitya Sammelan\" (साहित्य सम्मेलन) which was held around 1980 in protest against excessive government meddling in the main Marathi Sahitya Sammelan (मराठी साहित्य सम्मेलन).\n\nBedekar wrote \"Kalyanche Nishwas\" (कळ्यांचे निःश्वास) --a collection of short stories—and \"Hindolyawar\" (हिंदोळ्यावर) --a novel—both in 1933 under the pen name \"Vibhavari Shirurkar\" (विभावरी शिरूरकर). In the two works, she discussed issues such as extramarital cohabitation, a woman's right to set up her own household alone, and dowry. The works were far too bold for the Indian society of the 1930s, and after their publication, there was a storm of outrage about them, they having been written by an unknown author under a pen name. (A few years later, before her marriage, Bedekar had revealed in a public speech that \" 'Vibhavari Shirurkar' was me --Balutai Khare.\")\n\nIn 1950, Bedekar wrote her effective novel \"Bali\" (बळी) (The Victim) as based on her observations for three years about the extremely harsh daily lives of the so-called \"criminal \" tribes confined to the \"settlement\" area behind barbed wires by the British government in pre-independence India. (By the time \"Bali\" got published, the government of independent India had abolished the same year, 1950, the concept of \"settlement\" area behind barbed wires for \"criminal' tribes.)\n\nWhile her novel \"Wiralele Swapna\" (विरलेले स्वप्न) contained a compilation of pages from the imaginary diaries of two lovers, her novel \"Shabari\" (शबरी) was the story of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage.\n\n\nA translation of \"Kharemaster\" (खरेमास्तर) was later published in English.\n"}

According to the legend, the single vote of Frederick Muhlenberg, the first ever Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, prevented German from becoming an official language of the United States.\n\nThe kernel of truth behind this legend is a vote in the United States House of Representatives in 1794, after a group of German immigrants asked for the translation of some laws into German. This petition was debated by the House of Representatives without a decision made and a vote to adjourn and consider the recommendation at a later date was defeated by one vote, 42 to 41. There was no vote on an actual bill, merely a vote on whether or not to adjourn. Because the motion to adjourn did not pass, the matter was dropped. It was from this roll call on adjournment that the “German missed becoming the official language of the USA by one vote” legend sprang. \n\nMuhlenberg (of German descent himself, who had not voted in the roll call) was later quoted as having said \"the faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be.\"\nThe United States has no statutory official language; English has been used on a \"de facto\" basis, owing to its status as the country's predominant language. At times various states have passed their own official language laws.\n\nThe legend has a long history, and led to a number of analyses and articles published from the late 1920s into the early 1950s explaining why the story was not true. The story was dubbed the \"Muhlenberg legend\" by at least the late 1940s. Nevertheless, the legend persists.\n\nFor example, in 1987, a letter from a former election official in Missouri emphasized the importance of voting in an Ann Landers column. He included a list of events allegedly decided by one vote from his local election manual, including that “in 1776, one vote gave America the English language instead of German.\" (In fact, versions of this error-filled list long predate the 1987 Ann Landers mention.) This led to another round of news stories again pointing out that this was a myth. Oblivious to corrections of this sort, Ann Landers ran the same list again in November 1996. A chorus of dismayed responses caused Landers to clear up the matter in a subsequent column. According to one letter writer, who begged Landers to \"stomp out that piece of fiction wherever you encounter it,\" the myth gained traction in the 1930s due to the work of Nazi propagandists. \n\nAnother version of the myth, which puts the vote in 1774 by the Continental Congress, appeared in \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" as early as 1930. Ripley's included the myth in a 1982 book as well. Ripley's version credits the story to an alleged letter by Heinrich Melchior Muhlenberg published in Halle in 1887.\n\nMost accounts credit Franz von Löher as the source of the legend. Löher was a German visitor to the United States who published the book \"Geschichte und Zustände der Deutschen in Amerika\" (\"History and Achievements of the Germans in America\") in 1847. Löher seemingly placed the crucial vote only in Pennsylvania, to make German the official language of that state, not the United States as a whole. (Philadelphia was where the U.S. Congress sat at the time, but it was also the capital of Pennsylvania. To further confuse matters, Muhlenburg did serve as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House before serving in that title for the U.S. Congress.) According to Löher, the vote was tied, and Muhlenberg cast the tie-breaking vote for English.\n\n\n"}

He received India's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna in 1963 for his scholarly work that spanned more than 40 years of active academic research that resulted in 6,500 pages of \"History of Dharmaśāstra\". The historian Ram Sharan Sharma says: \"Pandurang Vaman Kane, a great Sanskritist wedded to social reform, continued the earlier tradition of scholarship. His monumental work entitled the \"History of the Dharmasastra\", published in five volumes in the twentieth century, is an encyclopaedia of ancient social laws and customs. This enables us to study the social processes in ancient India.\"\n\nDr. Kane is famous for his magnum opus in English, \"History of Dharmaśāstra\", subtitled \"Ancient and Mediaeval Religions and Civil Law in India.\" This work researched the evolution of code of conduct in ancient and mediaeval India by looking into several texts and manuscripts compiled over the centuries. It was published in five volumes; the 1st volume was published in 1930 and the last, in 1962. It runs to a total of more than 6,500 pages. Dr. Kane used the resources available at prestigious institutes such as the Asiatic Society of Mumbai and Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, among others. The work is known for its expanse and depth – ranging across diverse subjects such as the \"Mahabharata\", the Puranas and Chanakya – including references to previously obscure sources. The richness in the work is attributed to his in-depth knowledge of Sanskrit. His success is believed to be an outcome of his objective study of the texts instead of deifying them.\n\nKane wrote the book \"Vyavaharamayukha\" and was in the process of writing an introductory passage on the \"History of Dharmaśāstra\" for this book so that the reader would get an overall idea apart from the subject of the book. One thing led to another and this project snowballed into the major work that it is. All the same, he was categorical in saying that it is difficult to find an English equivalent of the word \"Dharma.\" His output in the form of writings across the three languages of English, Sanskrit and Marathi spans nearly 15,000 pages.\n\n‘\"History of Poetics’\" was one of his other great books. Apart from Theology and Poetry, he wrote a great deal on other topics too, which included Astrology, Cultural and Geographical history of India-Maharashtra-Konkan- Vidarbha, Marathi language, its grammar, language & handwriting, economics of \"Kautilya\" (Chanakya), Mathematics, Dramatics, etc. There are in all 198 publications by his name. They include 39 texts, 115 articles, 44 books, introductions and reviews. \n\nDr. Kane was rewarded as Mahamahopadhyaya (Etymology: Maha+Maha+Upadhyay = The greatest among the great teachers), usually shortened to MM as a prefix in the writings that refer to him. He served as the vice-chancellor of the University of Mumbai. His services were requisitioned and enlisted for establishing Kurukshetra University in Indic studies. He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi award in 1956 for \"History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. IV\" for his research under the Sanskrit translation category. He was also an honorary member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.\n\nHe was nominated to the Rajya Sabha as a member of Parliament for his distinguished record in the field of academics. The highest accolade bestowed upon him was the Bharat Ratna in 1963.\n\nKane believed that the constitution of India made a complete break with the traditional ideas prevalent in India by engendering a false notion among the people that they have rights but no obligations.\n\nGiven the encyclopaedic and authoritative nature of his work, it is often used in debates in Polity. One such issue that cropped up during Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was whether ancient Indians ate beef and both the groups quoted extensively from Kane's work to support their viewpoint. This issue became important as Hindus traditionally revere the cow as a mother and hence eating of beef is prohibited. Another such issue was whether the girls in the ancient times had the right to wear the yajnopavita (sacred thread), as the upanayana ceremony was restricted only to the men in the recent past.\n\nTo commemorate him, the Asiatic Society of Mumbai has established the Mm. Dr. P.V. Kane Institute for Post Graduate studies and Research in 1974 to promote, encourage and facilitate research in oriental studies. Also, MM Dr. P.V. Kane Gold Medal is given once every three years to a scholar for outstanding contribution to the study of Vedic, Dharmashastra or Alankara Literature.\n\nDharmasastra and Dharma\n\n\n"}

Parataxical integration exists when two people, usually intimate with each other (i.e. parents and children, spouses, romantic partners, business associates), are reciprocally reactive to each other’s seductions, judgmental inaccuracies, hostile comments, and manipulations or other \"triggering\" behaviors. One says or does something causing the other to react, setting off a cyclical \"ping-pong\", \"tit-for-tat\", \"you-get-me-and-I-get-you-back\" oscillation of verbal and/or behavioral reactions.\n\nThe concept first appeared in Sullivan's \"The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry\", published in 1953. It was developed further by his protégé, Lorna Smith Benjamin, in her \"Interpersonal Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders\" (1996). Benjamin saw parataxical integration as typical in the interpersonal behavior of couples with unresolved autonomy (i.e. separation, boundary) and identity issues. Erik Erikson had himself described the unconscious, reciprocal reactivation (without using Sullivan’s terms) in his essay, “The Problem of Ego Identity,” and in \"Identity and Anxiety\", by Stein \"et al\". (1960).\n\nThough the term itself is not used in much of the professional peer-reviewed literature, the interpersonal manifestation to which it refers appears regularly in the case study literature of the \"family systems\" school of psychologists, including Don D. Jackson, Jay Haley, Gregory Bateson, Virginia Satir, and Salvador Minuchin. Parataxical integrations are also presented in similar studies reported by Ronald D. Laing, Aaron Esterson, and anthropologist Jules Henry, largely during the 1950s and 1960s. Harold Searles and Charles McCormack describe manifestations of parataxical integration in their works on borderline personality disorders in the 1980s and 2000s.\n\nPaul Watzlawick \"et al\". describes the concept in his book, \"Change\", noting, \"... the circularity of their interaction makes it undecidable ... whether a given action is the cause or effect of an action by the other party ... either party sees its actions as determined and provoked by the other's actions ...\".\n\nRodger Garrett also employs the concept in his millennial-era work on borderline personality disorder and family of origin etiology, typically using the term “reciprocal reactivity” along with it.\n\nReciprocal reactivity was studied by Gary Sperduto \"et al\". in the 1970s, and it is clear from the abstract of his paper (see below) that his definitional terminology equated to that of Sullivan.\n\nNumerous mass-market psychology authors, many writing about the topic of \"co-dependence,\" including Melody Beattie, Pia Mellody, Anne Wilson Schaef, and Barry & Janae Weinhold, describe the interpersonal manifestation without using Sullivan’s term \"per se\". Co-dependence expert Pia Mellody describes the behavioral manifestations of parataxical integration at length in an audio presentation available online.\n\n L.

{"id": "65145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65145", "title": "Paulo Coelho", "text": "Paulo Coelho\n\nPaulo Coelho de Souza (; ; born 24 August 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist. He is best known for his novel \"The Alchemist\". In 2014, he uploaded his personal papers online to create a virtual Paulo Coelho Foundation.\n\nPaulo Coelho was born in Brazil and attended a Jesuit school. As a teenager, Coelho wanted to become a writer. \nUpon telling his mother this, she responded, \"My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?\" At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith. Coelho later remarked that \"It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me.\"\nAt his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s. \n\nUpon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. In 1974, Coelho was arrested for \"subversive\" activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.\n\nIn 1980 Coelho married artist Christina Oiticica. Together they had previously spent half the year in Rio de Janeiro and the other half in a country house in the Pyrenees Mountains of France, but now the pair reside permanently in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nIn 1986, Coelho walked the 500-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain, a turning point in his life. On the path, Coelho had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in \"The Pilgrimage\". In an interview, Coelho stated \"[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water – to use the metaphor in \"The Alchemist\", I was working, I had a person whom I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer.\" Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.\n\nIn 1996, he founded the Paulo Coelho Institute, which provides support to children and the elderly. \n\nCoelho posts up to three times a week at his blog, and has millions of fans on both Facebook and Twitter. He discussed his relationship with readers through social media platforms with \"The Wall Street Journal\" in August 2014. Another development came in November 2014, when he finished uploading around 80,000 documents-manuscripts, diaries, photos, reader letters, press clippings-and created a virtual Paulo Coelho Foundation, together with the physical foundation which is based in Geneva.\n\nIn 1982, Coelho published his first book, \"Hell Archives\", which failed to make a substantial impact. In 1986 he contributed to the \"Practical Manual of Vampirism\", although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it \"of bad quality.\" After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986, Coelho wrote \"The Pilgrimage\" that was published in the year 1987. The following year, Coelho wrote \"The Alchemist\" and published it through a small Brazilian publishing house who made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint. He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book \"Brida\", \"The Alchemist\" took off. HarperCollins decided to publish the book in 1994. Later it became an international bestseller.\n\nWhile trying to overcome his procrastination of launching his writing career, Coelho said, \"If I see a white feather today, that is a sign that God is giving me that I have to write a new book.\" Coelho found a white feather in the window of a shop, and began writing that day. Since the publication of \"The Alchemist\", Coelho has generally written at least one novel every two years. Three of them – \"The Pilgrimage\", \"Hippie\", \"The Valkyries\" and\" Aleph\" – are autobiographical, while the majority of the rest are broadly fictional. Other books, like \"Maktub\", \"The Manual of the Warrior of Light\" and \"Like the Flowing River\", are collections of essays, newspaper columns, or selected teachings. His work has been published in more than 170 countries and translated into eighty languages. Together, his books have sold in the hundreds of millions.\nOn 22 December 2016, Coelho was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 2 in the list of 200 most influential contemporary authors.\n\nReaction to his writing has not been without controversy, however. Though he was raised in a Catholic family, and describes himself as of that faith even now, his stance has been described as incompatible with the Catholic faith, because of its New Age, pantheist and relativist contents. And whatever his sales, reviews of Coelho's later work consistently note its superficiality.\n\n\"The Pilgrim – Story of Paulo Coelho\" is the international title for the film \"Não Pare na Pista\", a movie about Coelho's life. A co-production between Brazil’s Dama Filmes, led by Carolina Kotscho and Iôna de Macedo, Angélica Huete’s Babel Films in Spain and directed by Daniel Augusto. Ravel and Júlio Andrade play the young and old Coelho, and other cast members include international names such as Fabiana Gugli, Nancho Novo and Paz Vega. Those working on the film include Pedro Almodovar’s regular art director Antxón Gómez and Oscar-winning make-up artists Montse Ribé and David Marti.\n\nDe Macedo told Screen: \"The film tells the story of a man who has a dream. It's a little like Alice in Wonderland – he's someone who is too big for his house.\" The film, shot in Portuguese, had its premiere in Brazilian Theaters on 2014, was internationally distributed by Picture Tree on 2015, according to Variety.\n\nOn May 1, 2018 it was announced the Coelho signed for a TV series based on the characters of his novels \"The Devil and Miss Prym\", \"Brida\" and \"The Witch of Portobello\".\n\n"}

After the battle of Badr in 624 CE, al-Harith was captured and, in retaliation, Muhammad ordered his execution in hands of Ali. Some sources characterise Qutayla as Nadr's sister (\"ukht\"), others as his daughter (\"bint\"), though the most popular claim seems to be that she was his sister (hence the title of this article). Her full name appears in some sources, for example, as Qutayla ukht al-Nuḍar b. al-Ḥarīth b. ‘Alqama b. Kalda b. ‘Abd Manāf b. ‘Abd al-Dār b. QuṠayy al-Qurashiyya al-‘Abdariyya. There was also a tradition, attested in one medieval source, al-Jāḥiẓ in his \"Kitāb al-Bayān wa ’l-tabyīn\", that she was actually called Laylā.\n\nTo Qutayla is attributed the following elegy for Nadr, in which she upbraids Muhammad for the execution. According to some commentaries, Muhammad's response to this was 'Had I heard her verses before I put him to death, I should not have done so'.\n\n'Although doubt has been expressed regarding their authenticity ... these verses, frequently cited and highly appreciated, have perpetuated alNadr's memory'. Whatever its origin, the poem attributed to Qutayla is among the poems most frequently cited in the medieval Arabic anthologies known as \"ḥamāsāt\", being noted for their moving quality. In the assessment of Nadia Maria El Cheikh, 'Qutayla’s poem reflects the new Islamic ethos conveying the dramatic tension of a particular moment in Islamic religious history. She does not call for vengeance but for a modification of behavior, a kind retroactive display of restraint and forbearance'.\n"}

The Pomo languages have been grouped together with other so-called Hokan languages. Southern Pomo is unique among the Pomo languages in preserving, perhaps, the greatest number of syllables inherited from Proto-Pomo (the proto-language from which all seven Pomo languages descend).\n\nThe speakers of Southern Pomo were never a unified political group; rather, they were spread across a number of villages and spoke slightly different dialects. Southern Pomo speakers did not have a name for their language or themselves. As the southernmost of the Pomo, the speakers of the language were the first to suffer the ravages of Spanish and, later, U.S. invasion. Southern Pomo speakers were used by the Spanish to construct the last of the California missions. The damage done during the Spanish colonial period was compounded by the United States control of California. Only the northernmost populations of Southern Pomo speakers, those of the Dry Creek and Cloverdale dialects, survived to be recorded by the time linguists began to collect data on the language.\n\nAt least four modern rancherias (the California term for small Indian reservations) include members whose ancestral language was Southern Pomo: Dry Creek, Cloverdale, Lytton and Graton. In 2012 there was one fluent speaker, from Dry Creek, one rememberer, and a handful of people who learned some vocabulary as children.\n\nA small amount of data was collected by early researchers such as Samuel Barrett; however, extensive work was not carried out until Abraham M. Halpern, in the 1940s, collected a number of Southern Pomo words and texts as part of a larger effort to collect data on all the Pomo languages. Halpern published one article, \"Southern Pomo h and ʔ and Their Reflexes\", which dealt with aspects of Southern Pomo phonology. Halpern's unpublished notes are currently housed at the University of California, Berkeley. Robert L. Oswalt, who wrote a grammar of the related Kashaya (Southwestern Pomo) language, began to collect Southern Pomo data approximately twenty years after Halpern's fieldwork. Oswalt eventually published one glossed and translated text, \"Retribution for Mate-Stealing: A Southern Pomo Tale\", as well as a number of other articles which included Southern Pomo data together with data from other Pomo languages. Though Oswalt did a large amount of work on a Southern Pomo dictionary, it has never been completed.\n\nSouthern Pomo has a rich sound system with aspirated, unaspirated, ejective and voiced stops. It has a total of 28 consonants (plus the pseudo-consonant ). The vowel system, in contrast, contains only five qualities: . All phonemes, both consonants and vowels, can occur long. The full consonant inventory is laid out below.\n\nIn 2011 the Dry Creek Rancheria Band of Pomo Indians hired Dr. Neil Alexander Walker to develop a language restoration program for Southern Pomo, one that is currently active and includes classes, a mobile application, signage placed on ancestral lands, summer youth day camps focused on traditional Pomo foods, and aids such as posters and coloring books. As of 2012, fewer than three first-language speakers are known to survive, none younger than 90. There is currently a core group of heritage speakers from several tribes who are seriously involved in learning the language.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "524392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524392", "title": "Species diversity", "text": "Species diversity\n\nSpecies diversity is the number of different species that are represented in a given community (a dataset). The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Species diversity consists of three components: species richness, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity and species evenness. Species richness is a simple count of species, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity is the genetic relationship between different groups of species,whereas species evenness quantifies how equal the abundances of the species are.\n\nSpecies diversity in a dataset can be calculated by first taking the weighted average of species proportional abundances in the dataset, and then taking the inverse of this. The equation is:\n\nThe denominator equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted generalized mean with exponent \"q\" - 1. In the equation, \"S\" is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the \"i\"th species is formula_2. The proportional abundances themselves are used as weights.\nThe equation is often written in the equivalent form:\n\nThe value of \"q\" defines which kind of mean is used. \"q\" = 0 corresponds to the weighted harmonic mean, which is 1/S because the formula_2 values cancel out. \"q\" = 1 is undefined, except that the limit as \"q\" approaches 1 is well defined:\n\"q\" = 2 corresponds to the arithmetic mean. As \"q\" approaches infinity, the generalized mean approaches the maximum formula_2 value. In practice, \"q\" modifies species weighting, such that increasing \"q\" increases the weight given to the most abundant species, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance. Consequently, large values of \"q\" lead to smaller species diversity than small values of \"q\" for the same dataset. If all species are equally abundant in the dataset, changing the value of \"q\" has no effect, but species diversity at any value of \"q\" equals species richness.\n\nNegative values of \"q\" are not used, because then the effective number of species (diversity) would exceed the actual number of species (richness). As \"q\" approaches negative infinity, the generalized mean approaches the minimum formula_2 value. In many real datasets, the least abundant species is represented by a single individual, and then the effective number of species would equal the number of individuals in the dataset. \n\nThe same equation can be used to calculate the diversity in relation to any classification, not only species. If the individuals are classified into genera or functional types, formula_2 represents the proportional abundance of the \"i\"th genus or functional type, and \"D\" equals genus diversity or functional type diversity, respectively.\n\nOften researchers have used the values given by one or more diversity indices to quantify species diversity. Such indices include species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, and the complement of the Simpson index (also known as the Gini-Simpson index).\n\nWhen interpreted in ecological terms, each one of these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(\"D\"), and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/\"D\" and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/\"D\" and quantifies the probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.\n\nDepending on the purposes of quantifying species diversity, the dataset used for the calculations can be obtained in different ways. Although species diversity can be calculated for any dataset where individuals have been identified to species, meaningful ecological interpretations require that the dataset is appropriate for the questions at hand. In practice, the interest is usually in the species diversity of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species, but a sample of the relevant individuals has to be obtained. Extrapolation from the sample to the underlying population of interest is not straightforward, because the species diversity of the available sample generally gives an underestimation of the species diversity in the entire population. Applying different sampling methods will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest, and the species diversity of each set may be different. When a new individual is added to a dataset, it may introduce a species that was not yet represented. How much this increases species diversity depends on the value of \"q\": when \"q\" = 0, each new actual species causes species diversity to increase by one effective species, but when \"q\" is large, adding a rare species to a dataset has little effect on its species diversity.\n\nIn general, sets with many individuals can be expected to have higher species diversity than sets with fewer individuals. When species diversity values are compared among sets, sampling efforts need to be standardised in an appropriate way for the comparisons to yield ecologically meaningful results. Resampling methods can be used to bring samples of different sizes to a common footing. Species discovery curves and the number of species only represented by one or a few individuals can be used to help in estimating how representative the available sample is of the population from which it was drawn.\n\nThe observed species diversity is affected not only by the number of individuals but also by the heterogeneity of the sample. If individuals are drawn from different environmental conditions (or different habitats), the species diversity of the resulting set can be expected to be higher than if all individuals are drawn from a similar environment. Increasing the area sampled increases observed species diversity both because more individuals get included in the sample and because large areas are environmentally more heterogeneous than small areas.\n\n"}

Misregistration causes gaps or white-space on the final printed work. Correcting this involves creating overlaps (spreads) or underlaps (chokes) of objects during the print process.\n\nMisregistration in the graphical workflow may be caused by human error, inaccuracies in the image setter, the film-to-plate or film-to-film copying steps or instability of the image carrier (e.g., stretch in film or plate), the press or the final media.\n\nThese issues can be minimized, but not eliminated - any mechanical process produces some degree of error. The gaps showing up as a result can, however, be hidden by creating overlaps between two adjacent colors.\n\nIn general, prepress software provides some level of trapping, via application default values. Additional trapping may be necessary.\n\nManual traps can be applied at several stages in the workflow, using vector-based or raster-based adjustments. The choice depends on the type of output (packaging applications including flexo-printing have other requirements than commercial printing on offset systems) and the degree of interactivity or automation.\n\nIn-RIP trapping moves the trapping to the Raster image processor (RIP) trapping at the last moment. The process is automatic, although it is possible to set up \"zones\" to allow different rules for different areas, or to disable trapping for areas already manually trapped.\n\nWhen the two colors in question are spot colors, trapping is always needed: from the moment the artwork is imaged on film or plate, the colors are handled separately and are printed on two different printing units. The same approach applies if one of the colors is a spot color and the other a process color.\n\nTrapping becomes more difficult if both colors are process colors and each is to be printed as a combination of the basic printing colors cyan, magenta, yellow and black. In this case, the trapping decision depends on the amount of ‘common’ color.\n\nAnother factor that influences the visibility of the traps is the direction of the trap. The decision as to which color should be spread or choked is usually based upon their relative luminance. The lighter (higher luminance) color is spread into the darker. This responds to the way the human eye perceives color: darker colors define shapes, therefore distortion of the lighter color results in less visible distortion overall. The lightness or darkness of a color is defined as its neutral density.\n\nA major exception to this is the case when opaque (colors that completely obscure colors printed beneath them) spot colors are used. Other colors, regardless of their relative luminance, are always trapped to (spread under) these spot colors. If several of these spot colors are used (a common practice in the packaging market), the order of printing layers rather than luminance is the decisive element: the first color to be printed is spread under the next color.\n\nThinner traps are less visible. Therefore, the trap width is set to a strict minimum, dictated by the maximum amount of misregistration of the entire workflow up to the press. When printing at 150 lpi, traps are usually between 1/150 and 1/300 inch (0.48 pt and 0.24 pt, 0.16 mm and 0.08 mm). These values are usually multiplied by 1.5 or 2 when one of the colors is black. The trap is not visible since the lighter color is spread underneath the—almost—opaque black. For the same reason, in many cases, black ink is set to \"overprint\" colors in the background, eliminating the more complex process of spreading or choking. Since black is a dark color, white gaps caused by misregistration are more visible. On top of that, in wet-in-wet offset printing, black is the first color to be printed, causing relatively more distortion, thus increasing the risk of visible misregistration.\n\nWhen a trap between two colors is created, it contains the sum of the two colors in question when at least one of them is a spot color. When the two colors are process colors, the trap contains the highest value of each of the CMYK components. This trap color is always darker than the two abutting colors. In some cases, more specifically when the two colors are pastel-like colors, this might result in a trap that is perceived as too visible. In this case, reducing the amount of color in the trap may help. However, the trap should never be lighter than the darkest color since this would have the same effect as misregistration—creating a light colored ‘gap’ between the two colors. Trap color reduction is not recommended when solid spot colors are used. In that case, reduction would cause the spot color in the trap to be printed, not as a solid, but as a screened tint.\n\nTrapping towards a rich black (a black with a support screen of another color added to it to give it a ‘deeper’ look and making it more opaque—often called \"undercolor\"), follows the same rules as trapping to a ‘normal’ black.\n\nBlends or ‘vignettes’ offer special challenges to trapping. The lighter part of a blend needs to spread into the background, while the darker part needs to be choked. If a trap over the full length of the blend is needed, this produces a visible ‘staircase’ effect. The solution is to use a sliding trap: a trap that gradually changes both color and position. The trap can slide all the way. This might unacceptably distort the original artwork. Often, the sliding factor is set to a point where the neutral densities of blend and background reach an appropriate difference.\n"}

An avoidable pattern is one for which there are infinitely many words no part of which match the pattern.\n\nZimin words are an example of unavoidable patterns. These are formed by inserting a new letter between two instances of the previous Zimin word, i.e., the first Zimin word A is used to create the second Zimin word ABA, which in turn creates ABACABA and then ABACABADABACABA and so on.\n\nIt is unavoidable that any string, containing two unique characters, that is five or more characters long will contain a pattern of the form ABA (the second Zimin word). Using three unique characters any string containing 29 or more characters will contain a pattern of the form ABACABA\n\nLet \"A\" be an alphabet of letters and \"E\" a disjoint alphabet of pattern symbols or \"variables\". Elements of \"E\" are patterns. For a pattern \"p\", the pattern language is that subset of \"A\" containing all words \"h\"(\"p\") where \"h\" is a non-erasing semigroup morphism from the free monoid \"E\" to \"A\". A word \"w\" in \"A\" matches or meets \"p\" if it contains some word in the pattern language as a factor, otherwise \"w\" avoids \"p\".\n\nA pattern \"p\" is avoidable on \"A\" if there are infinitely many words in \"A\" that avoid \"p\"; it is unavoidable on \"A\" if all sufficiently long words in \"A\" match \"p\". We say that \"p\" is \"k\"-unavoidable if it is unavoidable on every alphabet of size \"k\" and correspondingly \"k\"-avoidable if it is avoidable on an alphabet of size \"k\".\n\nThere is a word \"W\"(\"k\") over an alphabet of size 4\"k\" which avoids every avoidable pattern with less than 2\"k\" variables.\n\n\nThe avoidability index of a pattern \"p\" is the smallest \"k\" such that \"p\" is \"k\"-avoidable, or ∞ if \"p\" is unavoidable. For binary patterns (two variables \"x\" and \"y\") we have:\n\nA square-free word is one avoiding the pattern \"xx\". An example is the word over the alphabet {0,±1} obtained by taking the first difference of the Thue–Morse sequence.\n\n"}

It arose in the 1930s and 1940s, with contact between Japanese colonists and the native Atayal people of southern Yilan County, Taiwan. The vocabulary of a speaker born in 1974 was 70% Japanese and 30% Atayal, but the grammar of the creole does not closely resemble either of the source languages.\n\nIt is incomprehensible to both Japanese and Atayal native speakers. The creole was identified in 2006 by Chien Yuehchen and Sanada Shinji, however its existence is still largely unknown. It was named by Sanada and Chien for its location. The official language of Taiwan, Mandarin, threatens the existence of Yilan Creole.\n\nYilan Creole is a creole language that is considered to be part of the Japonic language family. The superstratum and substratum languages of the creole are Japanese and Atayal, respectively. It has possibly been used as the first language among the Atayal and Seediq people since the 1930s.\n\nThe island of Taiwan was annexed by Japan under the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895 until 1945. Control over the island lasted about fifty years. During the latter period of this time, Imperial Japan enforced Taiwanese assimilation to Japanese language and culture. As a result of this contact between the Atayal and Japanese languages, Yilan Creole surfaced. Taiwanese people began attending schools taught in Japanese where all non-Japanese languages were banned, and by 1944 over 77% of Taiwanese were capable in speaking Japanese. Language reforms, name changes, and laws regarding social customs were among the reforms instilled by the Japanese Imperial government. Many are still competent in Japanese today where it is sometimes used as a lingua franca. Although China attempted to rid influence of Japan in Taiwan after the surrender of Japan in 1945, the impact on language and culture in Taiwan is still largely evident.\n\nAtayal features surfaced in the Japanese language spoken in Taiwan, eventually becoming a pidgin before it fully developed into a creole, and the language is now currently the only known Japanese-based creole on the island, and possibly in the world.\n\nThe creole is spoke in Yilan County in Eastern Taiwan, mainly in Tungyueh Village, Chinyang Village, Aohua Village, and Hanhsi Village, with evidence of differences varieties of the creole found in each. Although the exact number of Yilan Creole speakers is unknown, it is likely less than the total population of the four villages, which is 3,000. One estimate is 2,000 to 3,000 speakers of Yilan Creole currently exist. While the creole is currently used among all generations, younger generations are receiving less exposure to it, causing the language to become endangered. While older speakers may not be fluent in Mandarin, younger generations are consistently using Mandarin more.\n\nJapanese language still has some influence in Taiwan society today. Japanese based Internet sites in Japanese are viewed by Taiwanese, with “few other countries [producing] as much information in Japanese as Taiwan”. Evidence of Japanese signboards, particularly with the use of the Japanese hiragana character の (pronounced “no”) may be seen in Taiwan. Taiwanese citizens who received Japanese education during the annexation of the nation still speak Japanese fluently today. There are three generations of Yilan Creole speakers, with the older and middle generations using the creole significantly more than the younger generation.\n\nIn Tungyueh Village, younger generations seem to have lost the Yilan Creole, while there are still fluent younger generation speakers of the Creole in Aohua. After a push for preserving a more traditional and pure sense of Atayal heritage, the Yilan Creole that is imbued with Japanese features was removed from language examinations. This further instilled a tendency toward Mandarin and a push away from Yilan Creole in young speakers. While older generations prefer to speak Japanese or Yilan-Creole with people of the same age, they will often use Atayal or Mandarin mixed with Yilan Creole when speaking with younger generations; younger generations will similarly prefer Mandarin with same-age speakers, but may use Yilan Creole with older generations.\n\nDue to the migration of Japanese from the western part of the Japan to Taiwan in the early half of the twentieth century, with seventy percent of Taiwan’s immigrants being from western Japan, Yilan Creole acquired some of the regional dialects of western Japan. However, these regional dialects are still used unconsciously.\n\nYilan Creole has the following twenty-two consonants from Japanese and Atayal. The orthography is given in angle brackets where it differs from the IPA symbol.\n\nJapanese consonants that Yilan Creole has inherited include the voiced stops [b], [d] and [g], voiced alveolar fricative [z], alveo-palatal fricative [ɕ], alveolar affricate [ts], and alveo-palatal affricates [tɕ] and [dʑ]. It does not have the bilabial fricative [Φ] and uvular nasal [N] found in Japanese, however.\n\nAtayal Consonants the Yilan Creole has inherited include the glottal stop [ʔ], alveolar liquid [l], velar fricative [x], and the liquid [l]. It does not have the uvular stop [q] of Atayal. Some other features that Yilan Creole adopted from Atayal are the consonants [t] and [k] can occur word-finally, velar nasal [ŋ] can appear in the word-initial also word-final position, and fricatives [s], [x] and [h] can occur in word-final position. In some Japanese-based words, [l] has taken place of [r], such as \"suware\" ‘to sit’ becoming \"suwale\" ‘to sit’ in Yilan Creole. The phoneme [l] similarly does this with [d] in many Japanese based words.\n\nYilan Creole vowels consist of [a], [i], [u], [e] and [o] which derive from both Japanese and Atayal, but also [ə] which derives specifically from Atayal. However, [u] in Yilan Creole resembles the rounded [u] of Atayal instead of the unrounded [ɯ] in Japanese.\n\nLong consonants and vowels from Japanese words are often shortened in Yilan Creole, where \"gakkô\" ‘school’ in Japanese becomes \"gako\" ‘school’ in Yilan Creole.\n\nStress in Yilan Creole falls on the final syllable as it does in the Atayal language.\n\nAlthough Yilan Creole verbs derive from Japanese and Ayatal, verb conjugation patterns uniquely differ in some aspects. Tense is noted through the use of affixes and temporal adverbs together. Ayatal based verbs will still use Japanese affixation. Some processes of negation in Yilan Creole use Japanese derived forms to accommodate the realis mood that is part of Atayal grammar.\n\nThe word order of Yilan Creole is SOV. It follows Japanese sentence structure, however, there is evidence of Mandarin-based SVO sentences as well, particularly in younger speakers.\n\nIn Yilan Creole, phonological forms of words are derived from Japanese, while the semantic properties are derived from Atayal. According to a study on Yilan Creole in Tungyueh Village by Zeitoun, Teng, and Wu, “the proportion of Atayal-derived words in the Yilan Creole basic vocabulary is 18.3%, and that of Japanese-derived words is 35.6%. Both Atayal-derived words and Japanese-derived words can be used for 33.8% of the items”. Mandarin and Southern Min words also exist, but far less. Older generation speakers tend to use Atayal and Japanese variants more often than younger generational speakers, who prefer Mandarin variants, when they exist. Mandarin based words lose their tone in Yilan Creole.\n\nMany Atayal words relating to nature, animals, and plants survived in the creole. Vocabulary of most concepts such as these related to traditional Atayal and Seediq life and culture are retained in Yilan Creole.\n\nThe verb suffix \"–suru\" in Yilan Creole', derived from the Japanese verb ‘to do’, is similar to its Japanese counterpart, except in that it is a bound morpheme while the Japanese \"-suru\" can stand alone as a free morpheme. Also, Yilan Creole –\"suru\" can attach to nouns, adjectives, and, among young generational speakers, verbs. However, older generation speakers do not accept verbs + -\"suru\" combinations.\n\nAnother affix in Yilan Creole is the Japanese derived –\"rasyeru\" for causative forms. However, while Japanese inflection differs between consonant versus vowel ending verbs, the Yilan Creole suffix does not.\n\nThere are four types of compound words in Yilan Creole:\n\nType 1: Atayal-derived word + Atayal-derived word (e.g., \"hopa\"-\"la’i\")\n\nType 2: Atayal-derived word + Japanese-derived word (e.g., \"hopa\"-\"tenki\")\n\nType 3: Japanese-derived word + Atayal-derived word (e.g., \"naka\"-\"lukus\", \"kako\"-\"balay\")\n\nType 4: Japanese-derived word + Japanese-derived word (e.g., \"naka\"-\"pangcyu\", \"unme\"-\"zyoto\")\n\nWhile Type 1 compound words occur in Atayal, Japanese does not have occurrences of Type 4 compound words in its own language, suggesting that Type 2, 3, and 4 compound words are creations of Yilan Creole.\n\nA chart detailing Yilan Creole pronouns:\n\nThe forms of pronouns are Japanese derived. However, in comparison to both Atayal and Japanese, Yilan Creole has a simplified pronominal system. The creole distinguishes pronouns between person and number. Yilan does not distinguish between case, bound or free pronouns, nor inclusive versus exclusive pronouns as Atayal does. It also does not distinguish between gender and degree of politeness as Japanese does.\n\nDemonstratives in Yilan Creole derive from Japanese.\n\nAdjectives and adverbs in Yilan Creole derive from both Japanese and Atayal. Ayatal adjectives are primarily used for colors and subjective feelings. Unlike Japanese, adjectives in the creole languages are not inflected and tense is expressed through temporal adverbs. Adjectives in Yilan Creole may also act as adverbs when modifying verbs. For example, the word \"lokah\" ‘good, strong’ “functions as an adjective when describing \"anta\" ‘you’ in the phrase \"lokah anta\" ‘ you (are) strong’ … while \"lokah\" functions as an adverb as in \"lokah benkyo\" ‘to study hard’”.\n\nThe writing system of Yilan creole uses the Kunrei-shiki Romanization, as well as the Atayal writing system used in Taiwan. Atayal uses latin script as its writing system.\n\n"}
