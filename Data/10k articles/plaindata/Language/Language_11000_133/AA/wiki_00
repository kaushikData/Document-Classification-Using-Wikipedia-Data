{"id": "418355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418355", "title": "Babbling", "text": "Babbling\n\nBabbling is a stage in child development and a state in language acquisition during which an infant appears to be experimenting with uttering articulate sounds, but does not yet produce any recognizable words. Babbling begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant's repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech-like. Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age, though babbling may continue for some time afterward. Babbling can be seen as a precursor to language development or simply as vocal experimentation. The physical structures involved in babbling are still being developed in the first year of a child's life. This continued physical development is responsible for some of the changes in abilities and variations of sound babies can produce. Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions, developmental delays, and hearing impairments may interfere with a child's ability to babble normally. Though there is still disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species.\n\nBabbling is a stage in language acquisition. Babbles are separated from language because they do not convey meaning or refer to anything specific like words do. Human infants are not necessarily excited or upset when babbling, they may also babble spontaneously and incessantly when they are emotionally calm.\n\nThe sounds of babbling are produced before an infant begins to construct recognizable words. This can be partly attributed to the immaturity of the vocal tract and neuromusculature at this age in life. Infants first begin vocalizing by crying, followed by cooing and then vocal play. These first forms of sound production are the easiest for children to use because they contain natural, reflexive, mostly vowel sounds.\n\nBabbling is assumed to occur in all children acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear are the result of the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.\n\nThe consonants that babbling infants produce tend to be any of the following : . The following consonants tend to be infrequently produced during phonological development : . The complexity of the sounds that infants produce makes them difficult to categorize, but the above rules tend to hold true regardless of the language to which children are exposed.\n\nIf babbling occurs during the first year of life, it can typically be concluded that the child is developing speech normally. As the baby grows and changes, his/her vocalizations change as well.\n\nInfants follow a general timeline of vocal developments in childhood. This timeline provides a general outline of expected developments from birth to age one. Babbling usually lasts 6–9 months in total. The babbling period ends at around 12 months because it is the age when first words usually occur. However, individual children can show large variability and this timeline is only a guideline.\n\nFrom birth to 1 month, babies produce mainly pleasure sounds, cries for assistance, and responses to the human voice.\n\nAround 2 months, babies can distinguish between different speech sounds, and can make “goo”ing sounds \n\nAround 3 months, babies begin (making elongated vowel sounds \"oooo\" \"aaaa\"), and will respond vocally to speech of others. They continue to make predominantly vowel sounds.\n\nAround 4 months, babies may vary their pitch, and imitate tones in adult speech.\n\nAround 5 months, babies continue to experiment with sound, imitating some sounds made by adults.\n\nAround 6 months, babies vary volume, pitch and rate. When infants are 6 months old they are finally able to control the opening and closing of the vocal tract, and upon obtaining this ability, infants begin to distinguish between the different sounds of vowels and consonants. This age is often distinguished as the beginning of the canonical stage. During the canonical stage, the babbling involves reduplicated sounds containing alternations of vowels and consonants, for example, \"baba\" or \"bobo\". Reduplicated babbling (also known as canonical babbling) consists of repeated syllables consisting of consonant and a vowel such as \"da da da da\" or \"ma ma ma ma\".\n\nAround 7 months, babies can produce several sounds in one breath, they also recognize different tones and inflections in other speakers.\n\nAround 8 months, babies can repeat emphasized syllables. They imitate gestures and tonal quality of adult speech. They also produce variegated babbling. Variegated babbles contain mixes of consonant vowel combinations such as \"ka da by ba mi doy doy\". Variegated babbling differs from reduplicated babbling in terms of the variation and complexity of syllables that are produced.\n\nAround 9-10 months, babies can imitate non speech sounds, and speech-like sounds if they are in the child's repertoire of sounds. Infant babbling begins to resemble the native language of a child. The final stage is known as conversational babbling, or the \"jargon stage\". Usually occurring by about ten months of age, the jargon stage is defined as \"pre-linguistic vocalizations in which infants use adult-like stress and intonation\". The general structure of the syllables that they are producing is very closely related to the sounds of their native language and this form of babbling significantly predicts the form of early words.\n\nAround 11 months, babies imitate inflections, rhythms, and expressions of speakers.\n\nBy 12 months, babies typically can speak one or more words. These words now refer to the entity which they name; they are used to gain attention or for a specific purpose. Children continue to produce jargon babbles beyond their first words.\n\nManual babbling is structurally identical to vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants who grow up with a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, he or she will still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.\n\nAll babies imitate with their hands the movements that they see. Typical gestures for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially. In addition, infants who grow up with a sign language begin to make gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.\n\nAfter it was established that infants could babble with their hands and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go through a number of stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble is also one of the first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.\n\nChildren are able to produce signs correctly, which is important since many articulation tendencies of manual babbling transfer to the children’s early sign production. Children acquire signs for the same concepts as speaking children's words, and in the same stage of development.\n\nTwo hypotheses have been devised in order to explain how babbling is related to language development. \nContemporary research supports the notion that babbling is directly related to the development of language as discussed in The Continuity Hypothesis. \n\nThe human mouth moves in distinct ways during speech production. When producing each individual sound out loud, humans use different parts of their mouths, as well as different methods to produce particular sounds. During the beginnings of babbling, infants tend to have greater mouth openings on the right side. This finding suggests that babbling is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain. The larynx, or voicebox, is originally high in the throat which allows the baby to continue to breathe while swallowing. It descends during the first year of life, allowing the pharynx to develop and facilitates the production of adult-like speech sounds.\n\nReduplicated babbling (such as bababa) involves a rhythmic opening and closing of the jaw. According to the Frame Dominance Theory, when the mandible (jaw) is elevated, a consonant sound will be produced. When the mandible is lowered, a vowel-like sound is produced. Therefore, during a reduplicated sequence of sounds, the consonant and vowels are alternated as the mandible elevates and depresses. The opening and closing of the mouth alone will not produce babbling, and phonation (or voicing) is necessary during the movement in order to create a meaningful sound. Other important oral structures involved in articulation, such as the tongue, lips and teeth remain in a stable resting position during babbling. Sometimes during the babbling period, the motions can be made without any vocalization at all. Signing infants produce manual babbling through similar rhythmic alternations, but they perform with their hands instead of their mouths. As a baby goes beyond the reduplicated sequences of babbling, they exhibit equal sized mouth or hand openings on the right and left sides.\n\nTypically by 6 months of age, all normally developing children will babble. However, infants with certain medical conditions or developmental delays may exhibit a delay or an absence of babbling. For example, infants who have had a tracheotomy typically do not babble because they are unable to phonate. Following decannulation, it has been found that these infants do produce more vocalizations, but the sounds or syllables are not as diverse as those found in typically developing infant's canonical babbling behaviour. Infants with severe apraxia may not babble, and may fail to produce first words. Communication by infants with apraxia may instead be in the form of grunting and pointing. Infants with autism may show a delay in babbling, and in some cases it may be completely absent. Babbling in children with autism tends to occur less frequently than in typically developing children, and with a smaller range of syllables produced during the canonical babbling stage. Babbling may also be delayed in individuals who are born with Down syndrome. The canonical stage may emerge 2 months later for individuals with Down syndrome compared to other infants, although, when produced, it is similar to babbling in typically developing infants.\n\nResearch has been conducted to determine whether or not infants with impaired hearing can demonstrate typical vocal sounds. Babbling can appear at the same age and in similar forms in hearing and deaf child, however, further continuation of babbling and speech development depends upon the ability for the child to hear themselves. For this reason, deaf children stop babbling vocally earlier than hearing children. Babbling should appear if the child is exposed to language, but vocal babbling can be delayed or non-existent for deaf children. It is not clear whether spoken language can develop fully without auditory experience. Deaf children are not only significantly delayed in spoken language development in comparison to their hearing counterparts, but they also produce fewer noises. This suggests that auditory experience is necessary in spoken language development. Some researchers have taken these findings as evidence against the hypothesis that language is an innate human capability.\n\nA number of solutions have been used for hearing-impaired humans to gain auditory experience, one of which is hearing aids; they can be used to help infants reach babbling stages earlier. Cochlear implants have also been tested. Once the surgical implantation is complete, an infant has the opportunity to experience spoken language input. Once language has been heard, the infant begins to babble and speak in rhythmic patterns just as hearing infants do.\n\nThough there is disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species. Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal babbling is restricted by physiological development.\n\nNot only are songbird and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, they also are similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities can be traced back to Charles Darwin and his studies. Avian and mammalian brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may even be a gene that is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species' call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which is why this early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.\n\nYoung male songbirds produce varieties of immature songs that are referred to as babbling because the immature songs precede those that are fully developed. As with humans, if these songs are reinforced with positive social feedback, they are more likely to recur. Since the females do not sing songs, they are in charge of providing the feedback. If females provide more social signals as feedback, males will develop more mature songs at a faster rate than other male birds. Young birds require reinforcement from adults in order to finalize their songs. Another relation to human infants is that the amount of vocalizations is not key, but rather the quality of the sounds that is retained and resembles the final produce of language.\n\nThe physiology of the animal is important. The properties of the ear and vocal tract, as well as the brain regions used in analyzing and processing information are critical determinants of how song is interpreted and later produced. In studies using isolated birds that have not had exposure to song, they produce an abnormal ‘isolate song’ that nevertheless contains species-specific aspects. This shows that the neural pathways have predetermined features that allow for such a phenomenon to occur. The pathways are able to allow for plasticity of the songs that can be learned in the future.\n\nThere is an important phase in development when song learning is best accomplished. This phase is called the ‘sensitive period’ and the amount of change that a songbird experiences in adulthood varies by species. Young birds have a production phase after a listening phase of development. The production of song is called ‘subsong’ where vocalizations resemble that of an adult as time passes. Memory for songs is able to form before the period where learning to sing occurs. Social interaction is important in vocal learning where non-singing females can even influence an infant through feedback.\n\nPygmy marmosets have been studied and found to produce complex vocalizations 2–3 weeks after birth. Both sexes are capable of creating calls at a rate of 3 calls/second and each bout of calls can last up to 6 or 7 minutes. A normal series of calls by a pygmy marmoset contains approximately 10 different call types. This variety of call forms produced by this creature is comparable to babbling in human infants for a number of reasons. Like reduplicative babbling in humans, the call is often repeated several times before a new sequence of sounds is produced. The vocalizations gain attention from caregivers and provide practice for future vocal behavior. For these reasons, pygmy marmoset calls are seen as babbling behavior.\n\nThere are a total of 16 call types in pygmy marmoset babbling language. Different calls serve different survival functions such as when desiring food, social interaction or during times of alarm. As human infants have, marmoset babies have higher rates of social interaction when producing babbling sounds. During the juvenile age, marmosets often regress back to babbling stages if a new infant is born. It is suggested that their production of babbling calls increases because they are seeking attention and social interaction. Another babbling occurrence during the juvenile age is the addition of territorial calls and mild threat vocalizations. Although babbling is important for practising adult calls during the juvenile age, babbling decreases with age in pygmy marmosets. Overall, babbling progresses through a series of stages from infancy to adulthood and slowly leads to the construction of adult calls.\n\nBabbling-like behavior in songbirds, humans and some nonhuman primates has been previously researched, but it has not been researched until recently in non-primate mammals. The sac-winged bat (\"Saccopteryx bilineata\") is a social creature and the vocalizations that it produces depend on the social situation that the animal is in. This bat has a large repertoire of vocalizations with males being more vocal than females. Echolocation pulses, barks, chatters, and screeches are used in various social situations including courtship and territorial defense. Infants produce isolation calls if their mothers are absent, but the pups also produce vocalizations that mirror those of adults. Both sexes of infants babble, even though as an adult, the vocalizations are solely produced by males. Social context, mothers, and surrounding bats do not influence pups because the multiple vocalizations are combined regardless of the situation. Since there is not a social aspect correlated with the vocalizations, the productions of the sounds suggest that the pups vocalize for training. The pups repeat and combine adult vocalizations so that they resemble babbling in what humans, other primates and some songbirds do as infants. However, while human babbling increases social interactions, there are no social responses to babbling in bats. Babbling is common in infants that have a large repertoire of adult vocalizations to learn and this is seen in the pups of sac-winged bat.\n\n"}

They are notable for evolving from a pictographic system to a partially alphabetic syllabic script in the space of 14 years, from 1896 to 1910. Bamum type was cast in 1918, but the script fell into disuse around 1931. A project began around 2007 to revive the Bamum script.\n\nIn its initial form, Bamum script was a pictographic mnemonic aid (proto-writing) of 500 to 600 characters. As Njoya revised the script, he introduced logograms (word symbols). The sixth version, completed by 1910, is a syllabary with 80 characters. It is also called \"a-ka-u-ku\" after its first four characetrs. The version in use by 1906 was called \"mbima\".\n\nThe script was further refined in 1918, when Njoya had copper sorts cast for printing. The script fell into disuse in 1931 with the exile of Njoya to Yaoundé, Cameroon.\n\nAt present, Bamum script is not in any significant use. However, the Bamum Scripts and Archives Project is attempting to modernize and revive the script. The project is based in the old Bamum capital of Foumban.\n\nThe initial form of Bamum script, called Lewa (\"book\"), was developed in 1896–1897. It consisted of 465 pictograms (511 according to some sources) and 10 characters for the digits 1–10. The writing direction could be top-to-bottom, left-to-right, or bottom-to-top. (Right-to-left was avoided because that was the direction of the Arabic script used by the neighboring Hausa people.)\n\nThe second system, called Mbima (\"mixed\"), was developed in 1899–1900. It was a simplification of the first; Njoya omitted 72 characters but added 45 new ones. The writing direction was left-to-right in this and all subsequent phases.\n\nThe third system, called Nyi Nyi Nfa' after its first three characters, was developed around 1902. This simplification omitted 56 characters, leaving 371 and 10 digits. \nNjoya used this system to write his \"History of the Bamun People\" and in correspondence with his mother.\n\nThe fourth system, called Rii Nyi Nsha Mfw' after its first four characters, was developed around 1907–1908. It has 285 characters and 10 digits and is a further simplification of the previous version.\n\nThe fifth system, called Rii Nyi Mfw' Men, was also developed around 1907–1908. It has 195 characters and 10 digits and was used for a Bible translation. These first five systems are closely related: All were progressively simplified pictographic protowriting with logographic elements.\n\nThe sixth system, called A Ka U Ku after its first four characters, was developed around 1910. It has 82 characters and 10 numbers. This phase marks a shift to a full syllabic writing system able to distinguish 160 syllables. It was used to record births, marriages, deaths, and court rulings.\n\nThe seventh and final system, called Mfemfe (\"new\") or A Ka U Ku Mfemfe, was developed around 1918. It has only 80 characters, ten of which double as both syllables and digits. Like the previous system, missing syllables are written using combinations of similar syllables plus the desired vowel, or with a diacritic.\n\nThe 80 glyphs of modern Bamum are not enough to represent all of the consonant-vowel syllables (C V syllables) of the language. This deficiency is made up for with a diacritic or by combining glyphs having CV and V values, for CV. This makes the script alphabetic for syllables not directly covered by the syllabary. Adding the inherent vowel of the syllable voices a consonant: + = , + = , + = , + = , + = , + = . \n\nThe two diacritics are a circumflex (\"ko'ndon\") that may be added to any of the 80 glyphs, and a macron (\"tukwentis\") that is restricted to a dozen. The circumflex generally has the effect of adding a glottal stop to the syllable, for instance is read , though the vowel is shortened and any final consonant is dropped in the process, as in and . Prenasalization is also lost: , , . Sometimes, however, the circumflex nasalizes the vowel: , , , , , (loss of NC as with glottal stop). Others are idiosyncratic: (simple loss of NC), (vowel change), , , , , , , , , , , , , , .\n\nThe macron is a 'killer stroke' that deletes the vowel from a syllable and so forms consonants and NC clusters () that can be used for syllable codas. Consonantal is used both as a coda and to prenasalize an initial consonant. The two irregularities with the macron are , read as , and , read as . \n\nThe script has distinctive punctuation, including a 'capitalization' mark (\"\"), visually similar to an inverted question mark, for proper names, and a decimal system of ten digits; the old glyph for ten has been refashioned as a zero.\n\nThe last ten base characters in the syllabary are used for both letters and numbers:\n\nHistorically, was used for \"ten\" but was changed to \"zero\" when decimal mathematics were introduced.\n\nBamum's 88 characters were added to the Unicode standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2. Bamum Unicode character names are based on the International Phonetic Alphabet forms given in \"L’écriture des Bamum\" (1950) by Idelette Dugast and M.D.W. Jeffreys:\n\nThe Unicode block for Bamum is U+A6A0–U+A6FF:\n\nHistorical stages of Bamum script were added to Unicode in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0. These are encoded in the Bamum Supplement block as U+16800–U+16A3F. The various stages of script development are dubbed \"Phase-A\" to \"Phase-E\". The character names note the \"last\" phase in which they appear. For example, is attested through Phase C but not in Phase D.\n\n\n"}

An estimate of fair market value may be founded either on precedent or extrapolation. Fair market value differs from the intrinsic value that an individual may place on the same asset based on their own preferences and circumstances.\n\nSince market transactions are often not observable for assets such as privately held businesses and most personal and real property, FMV must be estimated. An estimate of fair market value is usually subjective due to the circumstances of place, time, the existence of comparable precedents, and the evaluation principles of each involved person. Opinions on value are always based upon subjective interpretation of available information at the time of assessment. This is in contrast to an \"imposed value\", in which a legal authority (law, tax regulation, court, etc.) sets an absolute value upon a product or a service.\n\nAn eminent domain taking, in lieu of a property sale, would not be considered a fair market transaction since one of the parties (in this case, the seller) was under undue pressure to enter into the transaction. Other examples of sales that would not meet the test of fair market value include a liquidation sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, distressed sale, and similar types of transactions.\n\nIn United States tax law, the definition of \"fair market value\" is found in the United States Supreme Court decision in the \"Cartwright\" case:\n\nThe term \"fair market value\" is used throughout the Internal Revenue Code among other federal statutory laws in the USA including Bankruptcy, many state laws, and several regulatory bodies. In litigation in many jurisdictions in the United States, the fair market value is determined at a hearing. In certain jurisdictions, the courts are required to hold fair market hearings, even if the borrowers or the loans guarantors waived their rights to such a hearing in the loan documents.\n\nFair market value is not explicitly defined in the Income Tax Act. That said, Mr. Justice Cattanach in \"Henderson Estate, Bank of New York v. M.N.R.\", (1973) C.T.C. 636 at p. 644 articulates the concept as follows:\nThe statute does not define the expression \"fair market value\", but the expression has been defined in many different ways depending generally on the subject matter which the person seeking to define it had in mind. I do not think it necessary to attempt an exact definition of the expression as used in the statute other than to say that the words must be construed in accordance with the common understanding of them. That common understanding I take to mean the highest price an asset might reasonably be expected to bring if sold by the owner in the normal method applicable to the asset in question in the ordinary course of business in a market not exposed to any undue stresses and composed of willing buyers and sellers dealing at arm's length and under no compulsion to buy or sell. I would add that the foregoing understanding as I have expressed it in a general way includes what I conceive to be the essential element which is an open and unrestricted market in which the price is hammered out between willing and informed buyers and sellers on the anvil of supply and demand. These definitions are equally applicable to \"fair market value\" and \"market value\" and it is doubtful if the word \"fair\" adds anything to the words \"market value.\"\nIn concert with this decision, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) lists the following working definition in its on-line dictionary:\nFair market value generally means the highest price, expressed in dollars, that a property would bring in an open and unrestricted market between a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed, and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other.\nAs the definition indicates, the Canadian and American concepts of fair market value are very similar. One obvious difference is that the Canadian working definition refers to \"the highest price\" whereas the American definition merely mentions \"the price.\" It is debatable whether or not the presence of the word \"highest\" distinguishes the Canadian from the American definition.\n"}

Many of his essays on the latter topic have since been collected in \"Leaves from an Epigrapher's Notebook\".\n\nCross was the son of Frank Moore Cross, a long-time pastor of Ensley Highland Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama. One of his uncles, the Rev. Laurance L. Cross, was Mayor of Berkeley, California from 1947 to 1955.\n\nCross graduated from Ensley High School in 1938. He received a BA from Maryville College in 1942 and a BD from McCormick Theological Seminary, where he was awarded the Nettie F. McCormick Fellowship in Old Testament Studies, in 1946. Cross went on to study under William F. Albright, the founding father of Biblical Archaeology, at Johns Hopkins University, where he received a PhD in 1950. He also received an MA at Harvard in 1958. Cross was awarded a DPhil from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1984 and a DSc from the University of Lethbridge in 1990.\n\nFrom 1949–1950 Cross was a Junior Instructor in Semitic languages at Johns Hopkins University. He was subsequently an instructor in Biblical History at Wellesley College from 1950–1951, an instructor in Old Testament at McCormick Theological Seminary 1951–1953, and an Associate Professor at the same institution from 1954-1957.\n\nCross was appointed Associate Professor in Old Testament at Harvard Divinity School in 1957. One year later, he was appointed Harvard University's Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages, the third oldest university chair in the United States. He would hold this position from 1958–1992, then becoming Hancock Professor Emeritus. Cross was Curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum from 1958–1961 and Director of the Museum from 1974–1987.\n\nCross was a Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies (1971–1972), a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1978–1979), a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Member of the American Philosophical Society.\n\nDuring his tenure at Harvard, Cross supervised more than a hundred dissertations, with the result that many of today's senior scholars in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern studies are his former students. Among the most prominent of these are Emanuel Tov, John J. Collins, Jo Ann Hackett, John Huehnergard, William G. Dever, P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., Peter Machinist, Lawrence Stager, Bruce Waltke, Richard Elliott Friedman, Hector Avalos, and Mark S. Smith.\n\nBeginning June 1953, Cross was a member of the international committee responsible for editing the Dead Sea Scrolls, which had been discovered at Qumran. Cross first heard of the scrolls in late 1948 while a student at Johns Hopkins University, when he was shown pictures of the Isaiah Scroll by Albright, who would later nominate Cross to the Scrolls editorial team. On joining the team he was immediately allocated 61 Biblical manuscripts from Cave 4 at Qumran to prepare for publication. Initially, this involved cleaning the manuscripts in the Palestine Archaeological Museum where they were being worked on in the 'Scrollery'. As with several others on the team, Cross was financially supported between 1954 and 1960 by a John D Rockefeller subsidy. Cross was one of only two American scholars on the scroll-publication team, and he has since been recognized as a founder of Qumran studies. His general introduction to the topic is \"The Ancient Library of Qumran\", the third edition of which was published in 1995.\n\nCross died in Rochester, New York in October 2012 after a long illness. He was 91.\n\nIn 1980, Cross received the Percia Schimmel Prize in Archaeology from the Israel Museum and the William Foxwell Albright Award in Biblical Scholarship. In 1991 he was awarded the Medalla de Honor de la Universidad Complutense (University of Madrid), the Gratz College Centennial Award in 1998 and a Lifetime Award in Textual Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture in 2004.\n\nCross was an Honorary Member of the Israel Exploration Society and the British Society for Old Testament Study. He was a trustee of the American Schools of Oriental Research (1973–1991), and an Honorary Trustee from 1991; a Trustee of the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center (1979–1996) and a Lifetime Honorary Trustee from 1997; and a Trustee of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation since 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

In many ways it meant the opposite of the New Soviet man, someone characterized by the following:\nAccording to Leszek Kolakowski, the \"Short course\" history of the CPSU(b) played a crucial role in forming the key social and mental features of the Homo Sovieticus as a \"textbook of false memory and double thinking\". Over the years, Soviet people were forced to continuously repeat and accept constantly changing editions of the \"Short course\", each containing a slightly different version of the past events. This inevitably led to forming \"a new Soviet man: ideological schizophrenic, honest liar, person always ready for constant and voluntary mental self-mutilations\".\n\nSince 1991 interest has extended to the phenomenon of \"homo post-sovieticus\".\n\n\n"}

The term combines the two concepts of intrapreneurship and bricolage. Intrapreneurship uses principles and strategies from the discipline of entrepreneurship and applies them within the confines of an organization rather than initiating new ones. Borrow from the French word for \"makeshift job\", bricolage is a type of art using whatever media is at hand. In the context of intrapreneurial bricolage, intrapreneurs find innovative ways to work with a scarcity of resources.\n\nIn The Savage Mind, French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss discussed 'bricolage' as having roots in the French idea of a worker who uses his hands inventively to accomplish what other workers cannot. In his description of this jack-of-all-trades, Lévi-Strauss explains that there is no requirement for skills and tools to be highly specialized. Instead, this 'bricoleur' is flexible enough to be able to use minimal resources for multiple applications.\n\nOne of the key principles of IB is finding utility in resources commonly overlooked. These resources can be divided into tangible and intangible assets. Often these assets are overlooked because they are obscured, dispersed or underutilized. Some examples of hidden assets include:\n\n\nMeasuring the success of IB initiatives is an essential part of the concept. One deliverable for IB is the generation of new products or services during specific times of scarcity in the organization's life cycle.

{"id": "580642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=580642", "title": "Job (professional wrestling)", "text": "Job (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling slang, a job is a losing performance in a wrestling match. It is derived from the euphemism \"doing one's job\", which was employed to protect kayfabe. The term can be used a number of ways. When a wrestler is booked to lose a match it is described as \"a job\". The act itself is described with the verb jobbing, while the act of booking (rather than being booked) to job is called jobbing out. To lose a match fairly (meaning without any kayfabe rules being broken) is to job cleanly. Wrestlers who routinely (or exclusively) lose matches are known as jobbers. A regular jobber skilled at enhancing the matches he loses, as opposed to a mediocre local rookie or part-timer, is called a carpenter. In the post-kayfabe era the term has taken on a negative connotation, leading to the use of the neutral term \"enhancement talent\".\n\nA job which is presented as being the result of an extremely close, entertaining match, or underhanded tactics on the part of an opponent, will not necessarily tarnish a wrestler's reputation, especially if the situation is presented as one where the wrestler \"deserved\" to win but was cheated. At other times a high-profile loss, particularly one which makes the wrestler in question look weak, foolish, or otherwise damages their reputation, might signify certain behind-the-scenes events that have real-life implications on a wrestler. Such a job may mark the end of a push, a departure from the company, or a loss of faith in the wrestler as a marketable commodity. As a result, it may also mark a downward slide in a wrestler's career. This is especially the case when the wrestler is beaten very easily, or squashed.\n\nSometimes, jobbing is presented to a wrestler because of the problems and bad working relationship that the wrestler and the owner of the promotion actually have. At other times, it is a requirement of a wrestler's on-the-job training, learning how to perform in front of a live audience while helping make the more established wrestlers look credible.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has referred to jobbers as \"lovable\", \"adorable\" \"losers\". Sometimes they euphemistically use the term \"local competitor\".\n\nJobber is a professional wrestling term used to describe a wrestler who is routinely defeated by main eventers, mid-carders, or low-carders. Most promoters do not use the term because of the negative connotation. Jobbers have been used since the 1950s, and they were popular in promotions of the United States and Canada around this time.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) made greatest use of full-time jobbers during their syndicated television shows in the 1980s and early 1990s, \"Superstars of Wrestling\", \"Wrestling Challenge\" and \"All-Star Wrestling\". Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi were the wrestlers most prominently identified with this role; other wrestlers who performed mainly as jobbers during this period included \"Leaping\" Lanny Poffo, Brady Boone, Tiger Chung Lee, Barry O, Reno Riggins, Duane Gill, Barry Hardy, Jack Foley, Scott Casey, Dangerous Danny Davis (also wrestling as Mr. X), The Shadows (Randy Colley, and Jose Luis Rivera), Los Conquistadores (Jose Luis Rivera and José Estrada Sr.), Iron Mike Sharpe, Von Krus, S.D. Jones, George South, Dusty Wolfe, Mario Mancini, Tim Horner, Sonny Rogers, Brian Costello, Red Tyler, and Tom \"Rocky\" Stone. Many of these wrestlers also did work matches against each other at larger arena cards at venues such as Madison Square Garden and were usually more competitive against their opponents, with several of these wrestlers gaining victories. In some cases, a number of these wrestlers had main-event matches at some point (such as Sharpe receiving matches against then-WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund or Danny Davis working in six-man tag tag-team matches with The Hart Foundation, usually against Tito Santana and the British Bulldogs (during the \"dishonest referee\" angle)) before being pushed toward the bottom of the roster's hierarchy; others, such as Mick Foley, would later become main-event wrestlers. Some were given gimmicks of their own, such as Poffo (a poet laureate as a face and as a snobbish intellectual, known as \"The Genius\", who also read poems as a heel) and Lombardi (\"The Brooklyn Brawler\", a smug, tough-talking brawler).\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (WCW), just like the WWE, made huge use of jobbers during the late 1980s and 1990s. Jobbers like Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker, Bobby Walker, Joe Gomez, The Gambler, The Roadblock and Trent Knight lost the majority of their matches. However, they usually scored clean victories against other pure jobbers. Wrestlers who worked as jobbers for WWE were also employed as jobbers in WCW during this period.\n\nThe American Wrestling Association (AWA) also made moderate use of jobbers in their shows. In independent promotions jobbers rarely appear, but when they do, it is mostly in squash matches.\n\nA jobber may not necessarily lose, only make the superstar look powerful - or at least make another wrestler interfering with the match to look more powerful. One example is Jimmy Jacobs: employed by WWE as a jobber for a time, Jacobs wrestled Eddie Guerrero during the latter's last heel run. Though Jacobs was squashed, he actually won by disqualification when Guerrero beat him with a chair. Another example of a jobber winning was when \"The Kid\" suddenly won an upset over Razor Ramon on the May 17, 1993 episode of \"Raw\". He then renamed himself the \"1-2-3 Kid\". This win (and the Kid) were worked into Ramon's feud with Ted DiBiase, with DiBiase taunting Ramon repeatedly over losing to a nobody until he too was pinned by the Kid. On the September 20, 1993 episode of \"Raw\", I.R.S. was pinned with a rollup by P.J. Walker thanks to Ramon's interference.\n\nJobbers can also get recognition on social media after appearing on a major promotion, giving them exposure they wouldn't receive otherwise. While being interviewed by Byron Saxton before his match against Braun Strowman in 2016, independent wrestler Johnny Knockout said he wanted to wrestle Strowman because \"he likes big, sweaty men\". The unexpected response led to Knockout eventually trending on Twitter ahead of other events on that night's \"Raw\".\n\nHeels and some faces used to abuse and humiliate jobbers during or after a match: Jake Roberts would allow his pet snake slither over his opponents once he pinned them; Brutus Beefcake would cut their hair off (on those sporting long hair or a mullet); Big Boss Man would cuff them to the ropes and beat them with a baton; Ted DiBiase would put them under the Million Dollar Dream and then stuff a hundred dollar bill in their mouths; Lex Luger, under his \"Narcissitic\" gimmick, would make them stand up by holding them by the hair and make them look at themselves in a mirror; the Islanders would chew some fruit (usually pineapple) and then spit it over their chests, and so on. Some jobbers like Trent Knight, Cougar Jay, Tim Parker, Reno Riggins, Tommy Angel, Bob Emory, Ricky Nelson, Curtis Thompson, the Mulkey Brothers, Kenny Kendall, Red Tyler, Eddie Jackie, among others, grew to become household names to fans due to this, and fans would expect to see the humiliating act after the match. Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts got Bob Emory's and Trent Knight's heads inside the sack where he kept his python snake; Dick Murdoch smashed the aforementioned Emory against a podium and then hit him with a piece of wood, Kenny Kendall got hogtied twice by Bunkhouse Buck at the end of a match, Reno Riggins was made to put a woman's dress on.\n\nA slightly higher position is \"jobber to the stars\" (also known as a \"glorified jobber\"), which is a wrestler who defeats pure jobbers and mid-carders but who consistently lose to top-level or up-and-coming stars. For example, Dolph Ziggler in the WWE is widely considered to have these traits. This often happens to popular faces and sometimes heels towards the end of their careers. Many of these jobbers to the stars are \"heels\" (villains) who routinely beat up on \"nice guy\" jobbers (\"faces\") so as to build up a reputation of being reasonably capable competitors (which makes the stars all the more impressive when they in turn defeat them easily) as well as to earn the contempt of the audience who enjoy seeing them finally get their comeuppance when they take on the tougher wrestlers. Heels can also be jobbers, such as Steve Lombardi during the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1980s, Lombardi teamed with Barry Horowitz, to form a heel team. However, Lombardi and Horowitz ended up losing most of their matches in the WWE. In addition, Triple H was given the role of \"jobbing to the stars\" by WWF owner Vince McMahon in the summer of 1996 as punishment for the .\n\nThere are times, however, when a jobber will prove their skill, determination, and/or loyalty to the business, and move beyond jobber status. Curt Hennig and Eddie Gilbert, who served as high-level jobbers during their initial WWE runs, later became main-eventers. Billy Kidman initially started out as a jobber in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), before moving up the ranks to become a champion in both the WCW and WWE. Paul Roma, who started as a jobber for the WWE in the 1980s, gained enough popularity in WCW to win that promotion's Tag Team Titles with partners such as Paul Orndorff and Arn Anderson, the latter as part of the Four Horsemen; however, in Roma's case, he went downhill again some time later. The brothers the Hardy Boyz began their careers in WWE as jobbers for a few years, before receiving their first push as legitimate contenders in the tag division.\n\nSometimes the opposite will occur, as was in the case of \"Iron\" Mike Sharpe, who started as a normal wrestler in the independent circuit and the WWE, and eventually ended up being a heel jobber. Another example is Siva Afi, who was a successful main-eventer/mid-carder in the independent circuit, including challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to a 60-minute time limit draw in front of 20,000 people, eventually ended up being a jobber in the WWF, which eventually led to other local promotions to give him a jobber position. A tag-team known as The Undertakers that did well on the independent circuit became jobbers when they joined the WWF in 1992 and became known as Double Trouble.\n\nSometimes, jobbing may be used as a gimmick. While in ECW, Al Snow began referring to jobbing on-screen as part of his gimmick. He subsequently formed a stable called The J.O.B. Squad, composed of prominent jobbers. In World Championship Wrestling, the tendency of the Armstrongs, (particularly Brad Armstrong) to lose matches was referred to as the \"Armstrong curse\". On average, however, Brad Armstrong was more of a jobber to the stars, while his brothers were pure jobbers for the most part, though Brian Armstrong would find the greatest success of the brothers in WWE as the Road Dogg. In 2003, after he returned from his neck injury, Chris Kanyon did a jobber angle, in which his gimmick was \"Who's Better Than Kanyon? Nobody\". He ended up jobbing to opponents on \"WWE Velocity\". A jobber angle involved Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), whose continual losses during the end of 2008 – including embarrassing losses in which he was pinned by roll-ups from mid-level WWE superstars – cost him the signing bonus he received when he joined WWE.\n\n"}

Finn, attempts to redefine literacy as the term exists within the education field. In his professional life, Finn served as an Associate Professor Emeritus of the Graduate School of Education from the University of Buffalo. He also and co-chairs a committee of Urban Education through the University of Buffalo that helps provide support for the schools and school districts in Buffalo, NY. His book outlines the differences between 'domesticating' and 'liberating' education, and offers advice on how to fix the discrepancy between upper and lower class schools. Finn references studies conducted by other published authors within the field of education, including Jean Anyon and James Gee.\n\nFinn outlines different socioeconomic levels at which schools exist, and dissects the educational practices that are common for each. These types of schools include executive elite, affluent professional, middle class, and working class schools. Working class schools are characterized by work being seen as a procedure, with the dominant theme as resistance. Middle class schools are characterized by work as getting the right answer, with a dominant theme of possibility. Affluent professional schools are characterized by work being carried out as creative activity carried out independently, with a dominant theme of individualism with a minor theme of humanitarianism. Executive elite schools are characterized by the dominant theme of excellence.\n\nThis section outlines the difference between immigrant and involuntary minorities. Finn introduces the concept of oppositional identities observed by John Ogbu, which states that some students, such as those from working-class backgrounds, see their cultures are directly opposed to what is being taught in the classroom. Finn illustrates that students with oppositional identities find it more challenging to self advocate for their education than those who do not have them.\n\nThis section discusses the dynamics between lower, middle, and upper class students and the ways they use language. Lower class students were often noted to use implicit language, middle and upper class students use explicit language. Finn also argues that all students regardless of their socioeconomic status should have access to empowering education.\n\nFinn discusses how a community comes together to form a discourse. Students get their primary discourse from their family but in the larger society students will develop a secondary discourse. Students with oppositional identities often have trouble acquiring the dominant discourse.\n\nIn chapter ten, Finn introduces the four types of literacy. There is performative, functional, informational, and powerful literacy. These literacies exist within society.\n\nChapter eleven reviews the history of schooling in America. After reviewing the beginnings of the educational system, Finn explains that Corresponding Societies questioned authority and exercised power to learn, discuss, evaluate, conclude, formulate, and exchange. This is more like literacy “with an attitude” than a defeated form of literacy expressed earlier in the book. The chapter continues by going through the history of Corresponding Societies until settling on that this ultimately became an education for domestication.\n\nIn chapter twelve, Finn discusses New Literacies by giving an example of a classroom that uses it. In New Literacies, communication is indistinct and expression is emphasized over correctness. \"Gatekeeping\" is a mode of correctness that often deters from the content of what the student is trying to communicate. Finn argues then that the approach of New Literacies could help this problem. Finn then discusses ways that New Literacies is difficult to employ in the classroom. An ideal classroom to promote democracy would be similar to that of New Literacies.\n\nFrom chapters thirteen to twenty, Finn claims to offer solutions to the problems he poses in the text’s earlier chapters. He bases much of his proposed solution on the work of Paulo Freire. Friere suggests that problems should be diagnosed and eliminated through activism. Based upon this, Finn recommends Frieian motivation in the classroom, or the idea of teachers teaching students to stand up for themselves. He provides research that supports this thesis, as well as exemplar organizations that are already using this type of education.\n\nWhen the book was first published, education scholars had mixed reviews. Some, like John M. Watkins, note that the book holds to strong ideals that cannot be enacted. In his review, Watkins states that \"Literacy with an Attitude\" is \"passionate\" and \"urgent\". He says that Finn does not present himself at a distance from the subject. Instead, Watkins states that this book should be read by those who are worried about the failure of schools in their attempts to \"Educate all our citizens into a powerful democratic discourse\". However, Watkins believes that we will not be able to utilize Finn's advice. He states that he does not believe that we have the will and that we will not be able to \"help working-class children develop literacy with an attitude\".\n\nThroughout his review, Watkins repeatedly mentions his \"discomfort\" that occurred while reading \"Literacy with an Attitude.\" Watkins attributes this \"discomfort\" to the direct nature of Finn's writing. Watkins states that the most uncomfortable moment was Finn's personal anecdote of \"his own painful realizations of the extent to which public education has betrayed him\".\n\nIn contrast, Honey Halpern notes that the book presents great contributions to the education community. In her review, Halpern states that Finn's book opened up \"new and perceptive ways of looking at familiar situations\" in education. Throughout her review, she notes that Finn's identification of politics in education is outwardly insightful. Halpern argues that the change that Finn is looking for is possible through aligning curriculum with powerful literacy. She concludes by urging that all teachers learn about the effective ways to help middle class students become literate.\n\n\"Literacy with an Attitude\" has been accepted by others in the education field, including Donna E. Alvermann, a professor of Literacy at the University of Georgia, who has served as the director of the National Reading Research Center, and has published extensively on literacy and popular culture. Alvermann referenced Finn’s discussion of “domesticating education” in her article “Reading adolescents’ reading identities: Looking back to see ahead,” to point out the flaws of the “deprivation approach” an approach to literacy that suggests struggling readers are disadvantaged. She says that when students are thought of this way, they often receive domesticating education and social inequality. For that reason, the label “struggling reader” should be avoided.\n\nRosalie Romano, an education professor at Western Washington University, explained in her review that Finn's argument on teaching powerful literacy as a matter of justice is significant to societal challenges to \"our environment, to our infrastructure, to our social systems, and to our public institutions\". The approach to literacy that she approaches in response to \"Literacy with an Attitude\" is one of engagement and purpose in a democratic society.\n\nCritiques of \"Literacy with an Attitude\" come from Whiting in his outline of the book; he states that although Finn has a well put together argument, he does not provide readers with practical and applicable solutions to enact.\n\nFinn’s book influenced the research for the book \"Urban Education with an Attitude\", which seeks to empower and reform the individuals that are ingrained in urban education curriculum. The authors use the basic principles of Finn’s \"Literacy with an Attitude\" to model their solutions for the problems that circulate in urban education. Romano states that his idea of powerful literacy can be translated to teaching social activism throughout American history and its purposes. His research on working class schools and their deficiencies is often cited and referred to in the education community in articles that advocate for change.\n"}
{"id": "9015481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9015481", "title": "Macedonian grammar", "text": "Macedonian grammar\n\nThe grammar of Macedonian is, in many respects, similar to that of some other Balkan languages (constituent languages of the \"Balkan sprachbund\"), especially Bulgarian. Macedonian exhibits a number of grammatical features that distinguish it from most other Slavic languages, such as the elimination of case declension, the development of a suffixed definite article, and the lack of an infinitival verb, among others.\n\nThe first printed Macedonian grammar was published by Gjorgjija Pulevski in 1880.\nThe Macedonian orthography (правопис, \"pravopis\") encompasses the spelling and punctuation of the Macedonian language.\n\nThe modern Macedonian alphabet was developed by linguists in the period after the Second World War, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, though a similar writing system was used by Krste Misirkov in the late 19th century. The Macedonian language had previously been written using the Early Cyrillic alphabet and later using Cyrillic with local adaptations from either the Serbian or Bulgarian alphabets.\n\nThe following table provides the upper and lower case forms of the Macedonian alphabet, along with the IPA value for each letter:\n\nThe cursive version of the alphabet is slightly different:\n\nPunctuation (интерпункција, \"interpunkcija\") marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type (syntactic use), abbreviations, et cetera.\n\nMarks used in Macedonian include periods (.), question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), commas (,), semicolons (;), colons (:), dashes (–), hyphens (-), ellipses (...), different types of inverted commas and quotation marks ( ‚‘, „“), brackets ((), [], {}) (which are for syntactical uses), as well as apostrophes (',’), solidi (/), equal signs (=), and so forth.\n\nThe canonical word order of Macedonian is SVO (subject–verb–object), but word order is variable. Word order may be changed for poetic effect (inversion is common in poetry).\n\nGenerally speaking, the syntactic constituents of the language are::\n\nWords, even though they represent separate linguistic units, are linked together according to the characteristics they possess. Therefore, the words in Macedonian can be grouped into various groups depending on the criteria that is taken into consideration. Macedonian words can be grouped according to the meaning they express, their form and their function in the sentence. As a result of that, there are three types of classification of the Macedonian words: \"semantic\", \"morphological\" and \"syntactic classification\".\n\nAccording to the semantic classification of the words, in the language there are eleven word classes: \"nouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, particles, interjections and modal words\".\n\nNouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns and verbs belong to the \"open word class\", whereas the prepositions, adverbs, conjunctions, particles, interjections and modal words belong to the \"closed word class\". This is the morphological classification of the words. Finally, there are two large groups according to the syntactic classification. The larger part of the words belong to group of \"lexical words\", and such words are: nouns, adjectives, numbers, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and modal words. The prepositions, conjunctions, particles and interjections belong to the group of \"function words\".\n\nMacedonian nouns (именки, \"imenki\") belong to one of three genders (\"masculine\", \"feminine\" and \"neuter\") and are inflected for number (\"singular\" and \"plural\"), and marginally for case. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.\n\nThe Macedonian nominal system distinguishes two numbers (\"singular\" and \"plural\"), three genders (\"masculine\", \"feminine\" and \"neuter\"), case and definiteness. Definiteness is expressed by three definite articles pertaining to the position of the object (\"unspecified\", \"proximate\" and \"distal\") which are suffixed to the noun.\n\nThe article (член, \"člen\") is postfixed, as in Bulgarian, Albanian and Romanian. In Macedonian there is only the definite article. One feature that has no parallel in any other standard Balkan language is the existence of three definite articles pertaining to position of the object: \"medial and/or unspecified\", \"proximal\" (or \"close\") and \"distal\" (or \"distant\").\n\nExamples:\n\nMacedonian lost the traditional (Slavic) grammatical cases during its development and became an analytic language. The case endings were replaced with a complex system of prepositions; however, there are still some traces left of the vocative case in contemporary Macedonian. The vocative case is formed by adding the endings '–o' (for feminine nouns), '–u' (for masculine monosyllabic nouns), and '–e' (for masculine polysyllabic nouns). For example, пријател ('friend') takes the form of пријателе ('friend!'). The vocative is used almost exclusively for singular masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nMacedonian pronouns decline for case ('падеж'), i.e., their function in a phrase as subject (ex. јас 'I'), direct object (него 'him'), or object of a preposition (од неа 'from her').\n\nBased on their meaning and their function in a sentence, pronouns fall into one of the following categories:\n\nMacedonian has a complex system of verbs (глаголи, \"glagoli\"). Generally speaking Macedonian verbs have the following characteristics, or categories as they are called in the Macedonistics: tense, mood, person, type, transitiveness, voice, gender and number.\n\nAccording to the categorization, all Macedonian verbs are divided into three major subgroups: \"a-subgroup, e-subgroup\" and \"i-subgroup\". Furthermore, the e-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: a-, e- and i-subgroups. This division is done according to the ending (or the last vowel) of the verb in the simple present, singular, third person.\n\nThe Macedonian simple verb forms are:\n\nThe Macedonian complex verb forms are:\n\nThe Present tense (сегашно време, \"segašno vreme\") is used to express present actions and actions that overlap with the moment of speaking and this meaning is expressed with the use of imperfective verbs. Besides that, the Present tense can be formed with the perfective verbs as well, but then it is not true present action, but more likely future in the past. Besides the present action, with the forms of present tense there is possibility to express:\n\nThe forms of the Present simple in Macedonian are made by adding suffixes to the verb stems. In the following tables are shown the suffixes that are used in Macedonian and one example for each verb subgroup.\n\nHere are some examples where the usage of Present tense in Macedonian is applied:\n\nThe imperfect, or referred to as 'past definite incomplete tense' (минато определено несвршено време,\"minato opredeleno nesvršeno vreme\"), is used to express past actions where the speaker is a witness of it or took participation in it. In order to express such an action or state, imperfective verbs are used. Also, there is a possibility to express an action with perfective verbs, but then before the verb there should be some of these prepositions or particles: ако (\"ako\", 'if'), да (\"da\", 'to') or ќе (\"ḱe\", 'will'). It is important to mention that when perfective verbs are used, then there is expression of conditional mood, past-in-the-future or other perfective aspects, but not witnessed past actions. Besides the basic usage of the Imperfect, with this tense in Macedonian can be expressed and:\n\nThe suffixes used to make the Imperfect are:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - \n\nAs an exemplification of the mentioned usages, here are some sentences:\n\nThe aorist, also known as 'past definite complete tense' (минато определено свршено време, \"minato opredeleno svršeno vreme\"), is a verb form that is used to express past finished and completed action or event, with or without speakers participation in it. The duration of the action that is expressed with the aorist can be long or short. For aorist, in Macedonian are used perfective verbs, but sometimes, though very rarely, in non-standard folk speech there may be usage of imperfective verbs. Besides this basic usage, the aorist also can be used to express:\n\nThe formation of the aorist for most verbs is not complex, but there are numerous small subcategories which must be learned. While all verbs in the aorist (except \"сум\") take the same endings, there are complexities in the aorist stem vowel and possible consonant alternations. \n\nThe following tables show the paradigm of the aorist for all three major verb subgroups and their divisions:\n\nIn the following section are given some examples about the mentioned usage above:\n\nThe Macedonian tense минато неопределено свршено време (\"minato neopredeleno svršeno vreme\", 'past indefinite complete tense'), or referred to as 'perfect of perfective verbs', functions similarly as the English Present perfect simple. The forms of the Macedonian present perfect are formed with the forms of 'to be' in present tense plus the L-form of the conjuncted verb, which is always perfective. Important to note is that for third person singular there is no presence of the verb 'to be'. This form of the Macedonian perfect is sometimes called 'sum-perfect'. The declination of one perfective verb in Macedonian looks as the following one, which is the verb прочита (\"pročita\", 'read'):\n\nAs an example of this tense, the sentence \"I have read the book\" is taken and translated in Macedonian:\n\nMacedonian developed an alternative form of the sum-perfect, which is formed with the auxiliary verb 'to have' and a verbal adjective in neutral, instead of the verb 'to be' and verbal l-form. This is sometimes called 'ima-perfect'.\n\nThere is a slight difference in meaning between 'sum-perfect' and 'ima-perfect'.\n\nThe English tense 'Present perfect continuous' functions similarly as the Macedonian tense минато неопределено несвршено време (\"minato neopredeleno nesvršeno vreme\", 'past indefinite incomplete tense') or known as 'perfect of imperfective verbs'. This perfect tense is formed similarly as the perfect of perfective verbs i.e. with the present tense forms of 'to be' and the L-form of the conjuncted verb, but this time the verb is imperfective. Important to note is that for third person singular there is no presence of the verb 'to be'. The declination of one imperfective verb in Macedonian looks as the following one, which is the verb \"чита\" (read):\n\nAs an example of this tense, the sentence \"I have been reading the book\" is taken and translated in Macedonian:\n\nLike the perfect of perfective verbs, Macedonian also developed an alternative form of the sum-perfect, which is formed with the auxiliary verb 'to have' and a verbal adjective in neutral, instead of the verb 'to be' and verbal l-form. This is sometimes called 'ima-perfect'.\n\nThere is also a slight difference in meaning between 'sum-perfect' and 'ima-perfect' regarding perfect of imperfective verbs. Ima-perfect usually denotes resultative meaning.\n\nWith the forms of future tense in Macedonian are expressed actions that are planned to happen in future. Usually, when we speak about future, we mean expressing events that should happen soon, however, there is a special form in Macedonian to express future events from past perspective, or event that happened after some other event and this is treated as separate tense called 'Future-in-the-past'.\n\nThe simple future tense is formed by adding the clitic ќе (\"ḱe\", 'will') to the inflected present tense form of the verb. In this respect, both Macedonian and Bulgarian differ from other South Slavic languages, since in both the clitic is fixed, whereas in Serbo-Croatian it inflects for person and number . The negative form of the future tense in Macedonian is made by adding the particles нема да (\"nema\" + \"da\") or just не (\"ne\") before the verb pattern, whereas the interrogative form is made by adding the question word дали (\"dali\"), also before the verb pattern. When we use the negative form \"nema da\", there is not presence of the clitic \"ḱe\". Usually, \"ḱe\" in English is translated with the modal verb 'will', and vice versa. When an event is expressed with the use of \"ḱe\", then it is considered normal future, but there is a stronger future event as well which is made with the construction: има (\"ima\", 'have') + да ('da', 'to') + present simple form of the verb.\n\nBesides the main usage, the future tense is used to express:\n\nSome of these mentioned rules, can be recognized in the following examples:\n\nFuture-in-the-past is expressed by means of the same clitic ќе (ḱe, 'will') and a past tense forms of the verb:\n\nAn interesting fact is that a past tense form of the verb can be used in a future sense as well, although this construction is mostly limited to older speakers.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn this respect, Macedonian is different from Bulgarian: Macedonian is consistent in the use of \"ќе\" as a clitic, whereas the equivalent Bulgarian construction involves the inflection of the clitic for tense, person and number as a regular verb (щях да дойда, 'I would [have] come'; щеше да дойде, 'he would [have] come').\n\nAdjectives (придавки, \"pridavki\") agree with nouns in gender, number and definiteness with their noun and usually appear before it.\n\nAdjectives have three degrees of comparison (степенување на придавки, \"stepenuvanje na pridavki\") – positive, comparative and superlative. The positive form is identical to all the aforementioned forms. The other two are formed regularly, by prepending the particle \"по\" and the word \"нај\" directly before the positive to form the comparative and superlative, respectively, regardless of its comprising one or two words.\n\nMacedonian only has one adjective that has an irregular comparative – \"многу\".\n\nA subtype of the superlative – the absolute superlative – also present in some other South Slavic languages and Romance languages (such as Italian and Spanish), expresses the highest quality without comparison. It is formed by prefixing the particle пре (\"pre\") to an adjective, roughly corresponding to the English 'very + adjective' or 'too + adjective' combinations.\n\nPrepositions (предлози, \"predlozi\") are part of the closed word class that are used to express the relationship between the words in a sentence. Since Macedonian lost the case system, the prepositions are very important for creation and expression of various grammatical categories. The most important Macedonian preposition is на (\"na\", 'of', 'on' or 'to'). Regarding the form, the prepositions can be: simple (\"vo, na, za, do, so, niz, pred, zad,\" etc.) and complex (\"zaradi, otkaj, nasproti, pomeǵu,\" etc.). Based on the meaning the preposition express, they can be divided into:\n\nHaving in mind the fact that the preposition \"на\" is the most frequently used in the language, it may be used to express different meaning:\n\nThe particles (честички, \"čestički\") are closed word class that have grammatical function. The particles are used to determine other words, form some grammatical categories and emphasize some words or phrases. Regarding the function of the particles, they can be divided into the following groups: \n\nThe Macedonian numbers (броеви, \"broevi\") have gender and definiteness. The first ten cardinal and ordinal numerals in the Macedonian are:\n\nThe group of words that are used in the language as one unit, word construction, are called phraseological units or in Macedonian \"фразеологизми\" (\"frazeologizmi\"). The phraseological units have special linguistic characteristics and meaning. Within one sentence, the words may be joined together in order to create units of various types. For instance, the word \"nut\" can be combined with many adjectives, such as \"big nut\", \"small nut\" etc. Moreover, the word \"nut\" can be combined with other parts of speech as well, such as with verbs as in the sentence \"I ate a nut\". \n\nThese types of combinations are led by the general principles of the phraseology, which states that the words in the sentences can be freely combined. Within these combinations or collocations, each word keeps its original meaning, so the meaning of the whole construction is equal to the meaning of its constituents.\n\nBesides the word construction with loose connections, in Macedonian there are word constructions that are not freely combined, which means they are permanently combined together. As an illustration of these two types of connections are the following sentences, where the noun phrase \"hard nut\" is used:\n\nIn the first sentence, \"hard nut\" is a common collocation, where the words are connected freely and can be changed with other words in different contexts. On the other hand, in the second sentence the noun phrase \"hard nut\" (i.e. \"a hard nut to crack\") is an expression that means \"strong, unbreakable\" and the words are in strong connection and they are not changed with other words. If these words are changed, the meaning of the phrase will be lost.\n\nMacedonian onomastics () is a part of Macedonistics that studies the names, surnames and nicknames of the Macedonian language and people. This is relatively new linguistic discipline. In Macedonia, and in the Macedonistics in general, it developed during the 19th century, where the first few research results have been provided. The Onomastics for a long period of time has been considered as part of various different scientific disciplines, such as Geography, History or Ethnography, until it became a discipline on its own in the 20th century. The Macedonian Onomastics, generally speaking, is divided into \"toponomastics\" and \"anthroponomastics\".\n\n\n\n"}

The stamps vary from country to country, and while some are normal stamps with a personalised label on the left attached by perforations, elsewhere the stamps are more properly regarded as one-piece personalised meter stamps with a colourful design next to the indicia. Stamps produced by Zazzle.com for the United States, for instance, are one-piece, self-adhesive with die cut margins to emulate perforations, and visually very similar to normal United States postage stamps, except for the addition of an IBI (information-based indicia; encoded by black and white little squares) along one edge. Also, a numeric serial number appears next to IBI.\n\nExamples given by postal authorities who offer this service usually depict family members, pets or other uncontroversial subjects but users quickly realised that they could place almost any image in its space. For instance, there have been attempts to publicise missing persons, promote political causes such as Tamil independence, or to place the image of criminals or other controversial individuals on its stamps. The rules of most countries generally prohibit such things, however, stamp producers may not spot every attempt to circumvent their rules, particularly when it is not obvious who or what is being depicted, or that the image has some political or other significance.\n\nThe Austrian Postal Service has permitted personalisation of postage stamps. In Austria the denomination of personalised stamps can now be changed as well.\n\nRoyal Mail has permitted personalisation of labels adjoining their stamps. The stamps are produced in small sheets known as smilers sheets.\n\nIn the United States, personalized stamps – also known as customized postage – are technically a form of meter labels and are governed by the United States Postal Service. As \"a form of meter labels\", they are not supposed (\"they are not required\") to be cancelled for postal purposes. Instead, a scanning machine at the post office is supposed to scan and void the postal value of that personalized stamp. For philatelic purposes, the postmarking of a personalized stamp is permitted, and it is harmless to USPS. In fact, a visible postmark is a further protection of revenue for USPS, since a postmarked personalized stamp is far less likely to be re-affixed on a mail piece for another mailing. While consumers may find that customized postage is available in a number of retail and online outlets, the USPS has authorized different companies to handle selected aspects of the program.\n\n\nPitney Bowes, Stamps.com, Zazzle.com and Fuji offer USPS-approved personalised postage via Stamp Expressions, PhotoStamps and ZazzleStamps and Yourstamps.com respectively.\n\nConsumers and businesses may also print their own postage using a small, specialized, printer, such as the Pitney Bowes Stamp Expressions Printer. Recent innovations include postal kiosks, where consumers can download an image at their local convenience store.\n\nAlthough most postal regulations permit the exclusion of \"objectionable\" pictures on the stamps, in 2004 The Smoking Gun managed to create personalised stamps featuring the Rosenbergs, Jimmy Hoffa, Ted Kaczynski, Monica Lewinsky's dress, Slobodan Milošević and Nicolae Ceauşescu using the service offered by stamps.com. The firm subsequently revised its policies.\n\nIn 2006 Ed Owens of REACT Consulting Group, a lobbyist for the Hunters Heritage Council, complained to the U.S. Postmaster General when Zazzle.com refused to create a personalised stamp that promoted hunters as conservationists. The stamp would have borne the legends \"$1.7 Billion for Conservation Annually\" and \"Sportsmen... America's First Conservationists\". The creation of the stamp was refused because, Zazzle said, it \"Incorporates material that is primarily partisan, or political, in nature.\" REACT Consulting cited stamps created for the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) which it said were also partisan and political but which had been accepted for production. Zazzle eventually withdrew the HSUS stamps.\n\nPersonalized stamps or Prisma (\"Prangko Identitas Milik Anda\" - Your Identity Stamp, but also Indonesian term for a prism) was launched in Indonesia in 2003. Not all kind of picture could be displayed in a Prisma stamp. The guideline stated only the following were allowed in a Prism stamp: face picture of one or more persons, writing or signatures, logo/symbol/slogans, picture made by other people, advertisement of a product or service.\n\n"}

From 1919 to 1922, he was a high school teacher in Serbia. From 1925, he worked at the Universal Esperanto Association in Geneva at its biggest work, the \"Bibliography of the International Language\" (\"Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo\") which was published in 1929.\n\nHe spent the end of his life in Southern France where he died of drowning.\n\nHe joined the Esperanto movement in 1903. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Esperanto\" of 1933, \"he was one of the most competent regarding the dictionary technique.\" Over sixteen years, he worked on twelve dictionaries; among them are the great Russian dictionary of the Imperial Academy. His other well-known dictionaries are the \"Ornithological Eight-language Dictionary\" (1911) and the \"Small Russian-Esperanto dictionary and the Illustrated Dictionary of the Russian Language\" (760 pages and 2000 pictures). In 1929, his \"Bibliography of the International Language\" (\"Bibliografio de Internacia Lingvo\") was published.\n\nIn 1913, he proposed the creation of the \"Universal Card Encyclopedia\" (\"Universala Slipa Enciklopedio, USE\") which, according to his idea, could be updated by adding cards for each subject.\n\nHe also wrote a great number of scientific articles and original literature in Esperanto.\n\nIn France he worked on \"La Vindiania\", a thesis on the origin of the Indo-European languages and on a complete philosophy of life, which he named biosophy (in Esperanto - \"Biozofio\"). However, his works remained in the manuscript form and circulated among his friends, and only one book was actually published in 1946 in Arras.\n\nStojan created a number of international auxiliary languages, most of which were never published:\n\n\nHe possibly created these projects as fictional languages, simply for his amusement; but in his time, the concept did not exist.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These natural extensions are claimed to be clairvoyance (vision), clairsentience (feeling), claircognisance (factual knowing) and clairaudience (hearing) and the resulting statements made during such an attempt. The term is commonly associated with paranormal-based consultation given for a fee in such settings as over the phone, in a home, or at psychic fairs. Though psychic readings are controversial and a focus of skeptical inquiry, a popular interest in them persists. Extensive experimentation to replicate psychic results in laboratory conditions have failed to find any precognitive phenomena in humans. Psychic reading is pseudoscience. A cold reading technique allows psychics to produce seemingly specific information about an individual from social cues and broad statements.\n\nThere are many types of psychic readings practiced. Although psychic readings might not incorporate the use of any tools, a professional psychic may have one or more specialized areas of expertise. Some of the more common readings include Tarot reading, email psychic reading, palm reading, psychometry, aura readings, or astrological readings.\n\nAstrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. The position of the stars, planets, sun and moon when one is born are believed to have affect one's personality, shape how relationships work in one's life and predict future events such as one's economic success.\n\nAura readings involve the observation and interpretation of auras. The aura is purported to be a field of subtle, luminous radiation surrounding a person.\nPsychics have offered aura readings for many years. They claim to have a unique ability to see or sense individual’s auras, however no evidence has ever been provided to substantiate this claim.\n\nCartomancy is fortune-telling or divination using a deck of cards. See also Tarot reading below.\n\nCleromantic readings usually involve casting small objects and reading them by their position, orientation, and mutual proximity. There are numerous variants used throughout the world.\n\nA distant reading, \"traveling clairvoyance\", or \"remote perception\" can be conducted without the reader ever meeting the client. This includes letters, telephone, text messaging, email, chat, and webcam readings.\n\nCorrespondence readings are usually done via letters, later emails and filling in special forms on psychic websites.\n\nTelephone readings are live readings where both psychic and client hear each other by connecting via premium rate telephone line. In the last years, with restrictions on premium rate numbers, more common are pre-paid callbacks, in which case client leaves his/her credit card details over the phone to an operator, after which gets a call on a specified phone number. Telephone readings became most popular with the growth of live advice TV shows as main means of advertising, and is commonly used by companies rather than individual psychics, due to high setup costs.\n\nSMS and chat readings is a quick question-and-answer format of reading allowing exchange of basic information between psychic and client.\n\nWebcams and online video communication may also be used for this type of reading.\n\nLithomancy readings usually involve especially suitable gems or stones that are immersed in water, or tossed as a set and read by mutual proximity. Its origins are unknown, and there are numerous different methodologies used by various cultures throughout the world. A recently more common variant is crystallomancy also known as crystal gazing. Using quartz as a crystal ball it is stereotypically depicted as gypsy fortune telling.\n\nNumerology is defined as the study of the occult meanings of numbers and their influence on human life. It is essentially a reading of an individual based specifically upon numerical values such as their date of birth, letters in their names, etc. Numerology can be used in psychic readings.\n\nPalmistry is another popular method of psychic readings, involving characterization and foretelling of one's future through the study of the lines, shapes, wrinkles and curves on the palm. Palmistry does not require psychic ability, as it generally uses cold reading abilities and previous knowledge of the subject.\n\nPsychometry is a form of psychic reading in which the reader claims to obtain details about another through physical contact with their possessions. Psychometry readers often ask the subject for their favorite and most meaningful objects, such as wedding rings, glasses, car keys, etc., for the reading. The belief is that objects which are in close proximity to a person for extended periods of time hold some of that person's 'energy'. This method has been used in attempts to locate missing persons.\n\nRunes are the letters of a set of related alphabets used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Lati alphabet. There is evidence to suggest that they also had magical or divinatory uses. In modern settings, stones or tablets with runes inscribed on them are cast on a mat or cloth to discern future events or path a problem or issue will take. Runes are also used by some witches and other practitioners of divination.\n\nTarot cards have been greatly popularized, but can be often regarded solely as entertainment. Traditional decks are available in chain bookstores. New decks also frequently appear in New Age bookstores. Though not requiring psychic abilities, Tarot cards can be used as a psychic or cold reading tool and Tarot readings are common at psychic fairs.\n\nSkeptics have challenged the veracity of the claims of psychic readings, largely through disclosure of the methods. Psychologist Richard Wiseman's 2011 book \"Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There\" noted the tricks of the trade, and Wiseman noted in a podcast appearance that the disclosure generated negative feedback from the psychic community.\n"}

Rebounds are generally considered to be a major part of the game, as they often lead either to a possession change or to a second (and often better) opportunity to score by the side whose initial attempt failed.\n\nIn sports such as basketball and netball, the term is also used as either noun or verb to describe the successful retrieval of the ball in that circumstance.\n\nIn sports that have an assigned goalkeeper or goaltender, after that player makes a save, they may (and if they are able, usually should) then retain immediate possession of the ball or puck themselves, thus preventing a rebound from occurring.\n\nIn basketball, rebounds are divided into two categories: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gain possession of the loose ball. Generally, most rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (in other words, closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Often these are grouped under the heading Rebounds per game which denotes the average number of rebounds a player or team averages for a series or season.\n"}
{"id": "10511206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10511206", "title": "Register complex", "text": "Register complex\n\nIn linguistics, a register complex is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.\n\nFor instance, in a system where pitch, voice quality and stress timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like \"Pai\" (as in the English word \"Pie\") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, \"Pai\" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.\n\nMany register languages are tonal. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in Bantu languages and throughout Africa. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the Kru languages, though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. Burmese, Khmer and possibly Vietnamese are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.\n"}

The language is built on a strong substratum of German, but contains numerous words from other languages, notably from various German dialects, including Yiddish, as well as from Romany languages, notably Sintitikes. There are also significant influences from Judæo-Latin, the ancient Jewish language spoken in the Roman Empire. \"Rotwelsch\" has also played a great role in the development of the Yeniche language. In form and development, it closely parallels the commercial speech (\"shopkeeper language\") of German-speaking regions.\n\nBecause of its development as a means of conveying information about goods and transactions, \"Rotwelsch\" has no terms for abstractions. For example, it has no direct translations for the seasons such as spring and autumn. Instead, it uses \"Bibberling\" (literally, \"shiver-ling\") and \"Hitzling\" (literally, \"heat-ling\") in place of season names.\n\nOther vocabulary examples, compared to their German counterparts, include:\n\n\nVariants of Rotwelsch, sometimes toned down, can still be heard among travelling craftspeople and funfair showpeople as well as among vagrants and beggars. Also, in some southwestern and western locales in Germany, where travelling peoples were settled, many Rotwelsch terms have entered the vocabulary of the vernacular, for instance in the municipalities of Schillingsfürst and Schopfloch.\nA couple of Rotwelsch words have entered the colloquial language, for example, \"aufmucken\", \"Bau\", \"berappen\". \"Baldowern\" or \"ausbaldowern\" is very common in Berlin dialect; \"Bombe\" is still used in German prison jargon. \"Bock haben\" is also still used all around Germany. The Manisch dialect of the German city of Gießen is still used, although it was only spoken fluently by approximately 700-750 people in 1976.\n\nJosef Ludwig Blum from Lützenhardt (Black Forrest) wrote from war prison:\n\n„[E]s grüßt Dich nun recht herzlich Dein Mann, viele Grüße an Schofel und Bock. Also nochmals viel Glück auf ein baldiges Wiedersehen in der schönen Heimat. Viele Grüße an Mutter u. Geschwister sowie an die Deinen.“\n\nBock and Schofel are persons? The control let pass the words. This code words \"Schofel\" („bad“) and \"Bock\" („hunger“) change the meaning.\n\nA variant of Rotwelsch was spoken by some American criminal groups in the 1930s and '40s, and harpist Zeena Parkins' 1996 album \"Mouth=Maul=Betrayer\" made use of spoken Rotwelsch texts.\n\nAn example of Rotwelsch is found in Gustav Meyrink's \"Der Golem\" and reads as follows:\n\"An Beindel von Eisen recht alt.\"\n\"An Stranzen net gar a so kalt.\"\n\"Messinung, a' Räucherl und Rohn,\"\n\"und immerrr nurr putzen.\"\n\"Und stoken sich Aufzug und Pfiff,\"\n\"und schmallern an eisernes G'süff.\"\n\"Juch,\"\n\"Und Handschuhkren, Harom net san.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4672294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4672294", "title": "Sanskrit grammar", "text": "Sanskrit grammar\n\nThe grammar of the Sanskrit language has a complex verbal system, rich nominal declension, and extensive use of compound nouns. It was studied and codified by Sanskrit grammarians from the later Vedic period (roughly 8th century BCE), culminating in the Pāṇinian grammar of the 6th century BCE.\n\nSanskrit grammatical tradition (\"vyākaraṇa\", one of the six Vedanga disciplines) began in late Vedic India and culminated in the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" of Pāṇini, which consists of 3990 sutras (ca. 5th century BCE). About a century after Pāṇini (around 400 BCE), Kātyāyana composed vārtikas (explanations) on the Pāṇinian sũtras. Patañjali, who lived three centuries after Pāṇini, wrote the \"Mahābhāṣya\", the \"Great Commentary\" on the Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vārtikas. Because of these three ancient Sanskrit grammarians this grammar is called \"Trimuni Vyākarana\". Jayaditya and Vāmana wrote a commentary named Kāśikā in 600 CE. 's (12th century AD) commentary on Patañjali's also exerted much influence on the development of grammar, but more influential was the \"Rupāvatāra\" of Buddhist scholar Dharmakīrti which popularised simplified versions of Sanskrit grammar.\n\nThe most influential work of the Early Modern period was \"Siddhānta-Kaumudī\" by (17th century) and its various derivate versions by Varadarāja.\nEuropean grammatical scholarship began in the 18th century with Jean François Pons and others, and culminated in the exhaustive expositions by 19th century scholars such as Otto Boehtlingk, William Dwight Whitney, Jacob Wackernagel and others.\n\nSanskrit has ten classes of verbs divided into two broad groups: athematic and thematic. The thematic verbs are so called because an \"a\", called the theme vowel, is inserted between the stem and the ending. This serves to make the thematic verbs generally more regular. Exponents used in verb conjugation include prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and reduplication. Every root has (not necessarily all distinct) zero, guṇa, and vṛddhi grades. If V is the vowel of the zero grade, the guṇa-grade vowel is traditionally thought of as a + V, and the vṛddhi-grade vowel as ā + V.\n\nSanskrit has ten tenses (plus one used in the Vedas, the \"leT\"). The verb tenses (a very inexact application of the word, since more distinctions than simply tense are expressed) are organized into four 'systems' (as well as gerunds and infinitives, and such creatures as intensives/frequentatives, desideratives, causatives, and benedictives derived from more basic forms) based on the different stem forms (derived from verbal roots) used in conjugation. There are four tense systems:\n\nThe present system includes the present tense and the imperfect (past imperfective), the optative and imperative moods, as well as some of the remnant forms of the old subjunctive. The tense stem of the present system is formed in various ways. The numbers are the native grammarians' numbers for these classes.\n\nThe perfect system includes only the perfect. The stem is formed with reduplication as with the present system.\n\nThe perfect system also produces separate \"strong\" and \"weak\" forms of the verb—the strong form is used with the singular active, and the weak form with the rest.\n\nThe aorist system includes aorist proper (with past indicative meaning, e.g. \"abhūḥ\" \"you were\") and some of the forms of the ancient injunctive (used almost exclusively with \"mā\" in prohibitions, e.g. \"mā bhūḥ\" \"don't be\"). The principal distinction of the two is presence/absence of an augment – \"a-\" prefixed to the stem. The aorist system stem actually has three different formations: the simple aorist, the sibilant aorist, and the reduplicating aorist, which is semantically related to the causative verb.\n\nThe future system is formed with the suffixation of \"sya\" or \"iṣya\" and guṇa. Verbs then conjugate as though they were thematic verbs in the present system. The imperfect of the future system is used as a conditional.\n\nEach verb has a grammatical voice, whether active, passive or middle. There also is an impersonal voice, which can be described as the passive voice of intransitive verbs. Sanskrit verbs have an indicative, an optative and an imperative mood. Older forms of the language had a subjunctive, though this had fallen out of use by the time of Classical Sanskrit.\n\nConjugational endings in Sanskrit convey person, number, and voice. Different forms of the endings are used depending on what tense stem and mood they are attached to. Verb stems or the endings themselves may be changed or obscured by sandhi.\n\nPrimary endings are used with present indicative and future forms. Secondary endings are used with the imperfect, conditional, aorist, and optative. Perfect and imperative endings are used with the perfect and imperative respectively.\n\nSanskrit is a highly inflected language with three grammatical genders: masculine ( \"puṃliṅga\"), feminine ( \"strīliṅga\"), and neuter ( \"napuṃsakaliṅga\"); and three numbers: singular ( \"ekavacanam\"), dual ( \"dvivacanam\"), and plural ( \"bahuvacanam\"). It has eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, and locative.\n\nThe number of actual declensions is debatable. Pāṇini identifies six \"kārakas\" corresponding to the nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, locative, and ablative cases. Pāṇini defines them as follows (Ashtadhyayi, I.4.24 – 54):\n\n\nThe genitive (\"sambandha\") and vocative (\"sambodhana\") cases are not equivalent to any kāraka in 's grammar.\n\nIn this article they are divided into five declensions. The declension to which a noun belongs to is determined largely by form.\n\nThe basic scheme of suffixation is given in the table below—valid for almost all nouns and adjectives. However, according to the gender and the ending consonant/vowel of the uninflected word-stem, there are predetermined rules of compulsory \"sandhi\" which would then give the final inflected word. The parentheses give the case-terminations for the neuter gender, the rest are for masculine and feminine gender. Both Devanagari script and IAST transliterations are given.\n\nThe final (s) characters in the above table are theoretical. In Classical Sanskrit, all of them become (ḥ) when the word is at the end of a sentence, and, if the word is followed by another in a sentence, the rules of sandhi for final \"-ḥ\" are applied.\n\nA-stems () comprise the largest class of nouns. As a rule, nouns belonging to this class, with the uninflected stem ending in short-a (), are either masculine or neuter. Nouns ending in long-A () are almost always feminine. A-stem adjectives take the masculine and neuter in short-a (), and feminine in long-A () in their stems. This class is so big because it also comprises the Proto-Indo-European o-stems.\n\nṛ-stems are predominantly agental derivatives like \"dātṛ\" 'giver', though also include kinship terms like \"pitṛ\" 'father', \"mātṛ\" 'mother', and \"svásṛ\" 'sister'.\n\nThe numbers from one to ten are:\n\nAll numbers in Sanskrit can be declined in all the cases. Numbers above four are only declined in the plural. ' is declined like a pronominal adjective, though the dual form does not occur. ' appears only in the dual. ' and ' are declined irregularly:\n\nSanskrit pronouns are declined for case, number, and gender. Many pronouns have alternative enclitic forms. The first and second person pronouns are declined for the most part alike, having by analogy assimilated themselves with one another. Ablatives in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable -\"tas\"; thus \"mat\" or \"mattas\", \"asmat\" or \"asmattas\". Sanskrit does not have true third person pronouns, but its demonstratives fulfil this function instead by standing independently without a modified substantive.\n\nThere are four different demonstratives in Sanskrit: \"tat\", \"etat\", \"idam\", and \"adas\". \"etat\" indicates greater proximity than \"tat\". While \"idam\" is similar to \"etat\", \"adas\" refers to objects that are more remote than \"tat\". \"eta\", is declined almost identically to \"ta\". Its paradigm is obtained by prefixing \"e-\" to all the forms of \"ta\". As a result of \"sandhi\", the masculine and feminine singular forms transform into ' and '.\n\nThe enclitic pronoun \"ena\" is found only in a few oblique cases and numbers. Interrogative pronouns all begin with \"k-\", and decline just as \"tat\" does, with the initial \"t-\" being replaced by \"k-\". The only exception to this are the singular neuter nominative and accusative forms, which are both \"kim\" and not the expected \"*kat\". For example, the singular feminine genitive interrogative pronoun, \"of whom?\", is \"\". Indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the participles \"api\", \"cid\", or \"cana\" after the appropriate interrogative pronouns. All relative pronouns begin with \"y-\", and decline just as \"tat\" does. The correlative pronouns are identical to the \"tat\" series.\n\nIn addition to the pronouns described above, some adjectives follow the pronominal declension. Unless otherwise noted, their declension is identical to \"tat\".\n\nOne other notable feature of the nominal system is the very common use of nominal compounds, which in the later literary language may be huge (10+ words) as in some modern languages such as German and Finnish. Nominal compounds occur with various structures, however morphologically speaking they are essentially the same. Each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection. The four principle categories of nominal compounds are:\n\nClassical Sanskrit distinguishes about 36 phonemes. There is, however, some allophony and the writing systems used for Sanskrit generally indicate this, thus distinguishing 48 sounds. The sounds are traditionally listed in the order vowels (\"Ac\"), diphthongs (\"Hal\"), anusvara and visarga, plosives (Sparśa) and nasals (starting in the back of the mouth and moving forward), and finally the liquids and fricatives, written in IAST as follows:\nAn alternate traditional ordering is that of the Shiva Sutra of .\n\nIt should be understood that, while the script used here is Devanagari, this has no particular importance. It just happens currently to be the most popular script for Sanskrit. The form of the symbols used to write Sanskrit has varied widely geographically and over time, and notably includes in modern times the Tamil and other modern Indian scripts. What is important is that the adherence to the phonological classification of the symbols elucidated here has remained constant in Sanskrit since classical times. It should be further noted that the phonology of modern Indian languages has evolved, and the values given to Devanagari symbols in, e.g. Hindi, differ somewhat from those of Sanskrit.\n\nFurther information: and IPA vowel chart with audio \n\nThe vowels of Classical Sanskrit written in Devanagari, as a syllable-initial letter and as a diacritic mark on the consonant (), pronunciation transcribed in IPA, IAST, and approximate equivalent in English:\n\nThe long vowels are pronounced twice as long as their short counterparts. Also, there exists a third, extra-long length for most vowels. This lengthening is called \"pluti\"; the lengthened vowels, called \"pluta\", are used in various cases, but particularly in the vocative. The \"pluti\" is not accepted by all grammarians. The vowels and continue as allophonic variants of Proto-Indo-Iranian , and are categorised as diphthongs by Sanskrit grammarians even though they are realised phonetically as simple long vowels.\n\nAdditional points:\n\nFurther information: and IPA pulmonic consonant chart with audio \n\nIAST and Devanagari notations are given, with approximate IPA values in square brackets.\n\nThe table below shows the traditional listing of the Sanskrit consonants with the (nearest) equivalents in English (as pronounced in General American and Received Pronunciation or the Indian English pronunciation if specified), French and Spanish. Each consonant shown below is deemed to be followed by the neutral vowel schwa (), and is named in the table as such.\n\nIn the earlier language, was pronounced as the labio-velar approximant , but it later developed into a labio-dental sound. To an English speaker's ear, this sound may be interpreted as the English \"v\" or the English \"w\", depending on context and precise articulation. Moreover, the Sanskrit व has a considerable range of articulation depending on position. . It is nonetheless understood in the Sanskrit writing system, as well as by speakers of modern Indian languages, as one and the same phoneme.\n\nVedic Sanskrit has pitch accent; some syllables have a high tone, and the following syllable is a falling tone, though through ellipsis a falling tone may occur elsewhere.\n\nThe Sanskrit vowels are as discussed in the section above. The long syllabic l (ḹ) is not attested, and is only discussed by grammarians for systematic reasons. Its short counterpart ḷ occurs in a single root only, kḷp \"to order, array\". Long syllabic r (ṝ) is also quite marginal, occurring in the genitive plural of r-stems (e.g. \"mātṛ\" \"mother\" and \"pitṛ\" \"father\" have gen.pl. \"mātṝṇām\" and \"pitṝṇām\"). i, u, ṛ, ḷ are vocalic allophones of consonantal y, v, r, l. There are thus only 5 invariably vocalic phonemes: a, ā, ī, ū, ṝ.\n\nVisarga ḥ is an allophone of r and s, and anusvara ṃ, Devanagari of any nasal, both in pausa (i.e., the nasalised vowel). The exact pronunciation of the three sibilants may vary, but they are distinct phonemes. Voiced sibilants, such as z , ẓ , and ź as well as its aspirated counterpart źh , were inherited by Proto-Indo-Aryan from Proto-Indo-Iranian but lost around or after the time of the Rigveda, as evidenced due to ḷh (an aspirated retroflex lateral consonant) being metrically a cluster (that was most likely of the form ẓḍh; aspirated fricatives are exceedingly rare in any language). The retroflex consonants are somewhat marginal phonemes, often being conditioned by their phonetic environment; they do not continue a PIE series and are often ascribed by some linguists to the substratal influence of Dravidian or other substrate languages. The nasal is a conditioned allophone of ( and are distinct phonemes—aṇu 'minute', 'atomic' [nom. sg. neutr. of an adjective] is distinctive from anu 'after', 'along'; phonologically independent /ŋ/ occurs only marginally, e.g. in prāṅ 'directed forwards/towards' [nom. sg. masc. of an adjective]). There are thus 31 consonantal or semi-vocalic phonemes, consisting of four/five kinds of stops realised both with or without aspiration and both voiced and voiceless, three nasals, four semi-vowels or liquids, and four fricatives, written in IAST transliteration as follows: k, kh, g, gh; c, ch, j, jh; ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh; t, th, d, dh; p, ph, b, bh; m, n, ṇ; y, r, l, v; ś, ṣ, s, h or a total of 36 unique Sanskrit phonemes altogether.\n\nThe phonological rules which are applied when combining morphemes to a word, and when combining words to a sentence, are collectively called \"sandhi\" \"composition\". Texts are written phonetically, with sandhi applied (except for the so-called \"padapāṭha\").\n\n (lit. 'adjacent imposition'), (also known as ', 'stoppage', ' or ') is the incomplete articulation, or \"\"represssing or obscuring\", of a plosive or, according to some texts, a semi-vowel (except r), which occurs before another plosive or a pause. It was described in the various Prātiśākhyas as well as the '. These texts are not unanimous on the environments that trigger abhinidhana, nor on the precise classes of consonants affected.\n\nOne ancient grammarian, ' (in 6.12), states that only occurred when a consonant was doubled, whereas according to the text of the ' it was obligatory in this context but optional for plosives before another plosive of a different place of articulation. The ' and the ' agree on the observation that abhinidhana occurs only if there is a slight pause between the two consonants and not if they are pronounced jointly. Word-finally, plosives undergo abhinidhāna according to the and the '. The latter text adds that final semivowels (excluding r) are also incompletely articulated. The ' 2.38 lists an exception: a plosive at the end of the word will not undergo and will be fully released if it is followed by a consonant whose place of articulation is further back in the mouth. The ' states that the consonants affected by abhinidhāna are the voiceless unaspirated plosives, the nasal consonants and the semivowels ' and \"\".\n\nAccording to Siddheshwar Varma, these differences may indicate geographical variation. It is not clear whether abhinidhana was present in the early spoken Sanskrit or it developed at a later stage. In Prakrit and Pāli abhinidhana was carried a step forward into complete assimilation, as for example to .\n\nBecause of Sanskrit's complex declension system, the word order is free. In usage, there is a strong tendency toward subject – object – verb (SOV), which was the original system in place in Vedic prose. However, there are exceptions when word pairs cannot be transposed.\n\nIn the introduction to his celebrated translation of Vidyakara's 'Subhashitaratnakosha', Daniel H.H. Ingalls describes some peculiar characteristics of the Sanskrit language. He refers to the enormous vocabulary of Sanskrit, and also of the presence of a larger choice of synonyms in Sanskrit than any other language he knew of. Further, he writes, just as there exist a vast number of synonyms for almost any word in Sanskrit, there also exist synonymous constructions. Ingalls writes that in elementary Sanskrit examinations he would ask his students to write in Sanskrit the sentence 'You must fetch the horse' in ten different ways. Actually, Ingalls explains, it is possible to write the sentence in Sanskrit in around fifteen different ways 'by using active or passive constructions, imperative or optative, an auxiliary verb, or any of the three gerundive forms, each of which, by the way, gives a different metrical pattern'. Ingalls emphasizes that while these constructions differ formally, emotionally they are identical and completely interchangeable. He comments that in any natural language this would be impossible. Ingalls uses this and other arguments to show that Sanskrit is not a natural language, but an 'artificial' language. By 'artificial', he explains he means it was learned after some other Indian language had been learned by simple conditioning. Ingalls writes: 'Every Indian, one may suppose, grew up learning naturally the language of his mother and his playmates. Only after this and if he belonged to the priesthood or the nobility or to such a professional caste as that of the clerks, the physicians, or the astrologers would he learn Sanskrit. As a general rule, Sanskrit was not the language of the family. It furnished no subconscious symbols for the impressions which we receive in childhood nor for the emotions which form our character in early adolescence.'\n\n\n\n"}

The tightness of the grouping (the proximity of all the shots to each other) is a measure of the precision of a weapon, and a measure of the shooter's consistency and skill. On the other hand, the grouping displacement (the distance between the calculated group center and the intended point of aim) is a measure of accuracy.\n\nTightness of shot groupings are calculated by measuring the distance between bullet holes on the target (center-to-center) in length measurements such as millimeters or inches. Often that measurement is converted into angular measurements, such as milliradians (mils) or minutes of angle (MOAs), which expresses the size of shot spreads regardless of the target distance. Thus, by using angular measurements, one can reliably compare the relative tightness of shot groupings fired at different distances.\n\nFor firearms that shoot one round at a time, a shot grouping test can be used to measure the accuracy of the entire shooting system: the weapon's mechanical precision and the uniformity of the ammunition. The weapon is fixed into position on a test mount, and aimed at a target. Multiple shots using rounds from the same type and batch are fired to observe how the weapon groups the shots. If a person holds the weapon and shoots it, the grouping measures the combination of the person's skill and the weapon's accuracy.\n\nIn shotgun shooting, the grouping is also called the \"pattern\". The pattern is the spread of shots from a single shotshell, measured as the smallest circle containing all the shots on the target. The barrel of a shotgun is designed to deliver a wide or narrow scattering, depending on the expected use. Shooting at close range indicates a cylinder bore barrel to deliver a wide grouping, while for hunting at longer distances such as 50 yards or meters, a choke is recommended for to constrict the scattering for a tighter grouping.\n\nIn archery, a shot grouping is the result of one person shooting multiple arrows at a target. A tight grouping indicates consistency in the archer's form.\n\nMean point of impact (MPI) is the calculated center of the grouping, which is the average center of all the shots, and is not necessarily located at a hole in the target. The process of mechanically readjusting the gunsight’s point of aim to match the MPI is called sighting in or “zeroing” the aim. The size of the grouping is described as the diameter of the smallest circle that can be drawn to contain all the shots.\n\nA \"flier\" is a shot from the same shooting session that is farther from the general grouping, considered to be the outlier of the group. Such shots may be the result of an unexpected gust of wind causing drifting, a muscular flinch of the shooter at the time of the trigger pull, a problem with the firearm mechanism, or inconsistency in the ammunition. Single fliers may be discounted when evaluating large groupings, but if fliers occur often, then the problem should be traced to its origin.\n\nWhile target shooting with a handgun, if a grouping is consistently off-center then the shooter is instructed to alter the body angle or the stance, rather than shifting the arm, wrist or hand, which should remain in position.\n\nWhen using SI units, shooting accuracy is more easily measured in milliradians by measuring the group size in millimeters (or in centimeters and multiplying by a factor of 10) and dividing by the range measured in meters.\n\nSince shot grouping are small angles, the linear formula above can be used as a good approximation for group sizes in mils. The error of assuming that 0.1 mil equals 1 cm at 100 meters is about 1 × 10 (or 0.00001 %).\n\nWhen using imperial units, shooting accuracy is more easily measured in minutes of arc (symbol ′, sometimes called \"minutes of angle\" or \"MOA\" for short) by measuring the group size in inches, multiplying by a factor of 100 and dividing by the range measured in yards.\n\nThe linear formula above for measuring group sizes in arcminutes is less precise than using milliradians together with metric units, but can still be a good approximation depending on the demands for precision. The error of assuming that 1′ equals 1\" at 100 yd is about 4.5 %.\n\nWhen shooting at a target 100 yards away, 1′ is a circle of approximately 1.047 inches in diameter, while at 100 meters, 1′ is approximately a 29.1 millimeter circle. The arcminute is an arc-based measurement, with 1′ equal to one minute of one degree. The two-dimensional circle surrounding a shooter always has 21,600 arcminutes because there are 60 minutes in each degree, and 360 degrees in the circle.\n\nA big-game hunting rifle is considered accurate if its shots fall within 1.5′ (≈ 0.5 mil), while a rifle intended for small animals is expected to have an accuracy of 1′ or less (under 0.3 mil, also known as \"sub-MOA\"). Handguns are typically less accurate; at a shooting distance of 25 yd, a grouping is considered acceptable for self-defense if the shots fall within a circle of 4 to 5 inches, which is 15′ to 19′ (equivalent to a grouping of 100-150 mm at 25 meters, which is 4-6 mils), representing the shot pattern needed to hit the vital organs of a human target. Expensive and well-machined match-grade pistols demonstrate a higher accuracy than normal handguns, capable of groupings of 1.25 inches at 25 yards, which is about 5′ (equivalent to about 30 mm at 25 meters, which is 1.2 mil).\n\nWith the increased element of human skill in archery, a grouping on target is more a measure of the archer's skill. If an archer is not getting a consistent grouping, then their basic form needs work. If an archer's arrows are grouping on target but off center, this shows consistent basic form, with better results achievable after slight adjustments.\n\nOn the equipment side, bow stabilizers have been used since the 1960s by tournament competitors and by bow hunters to counteract the torque of shooting the arrow. A tighter grouping may be achieved with such a stabilizer, which adds mass extending outward on a moment arm, usually mounted perpendicular to the bow riser, aligned with the arrow path.\n"}

{"id": "3198513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3198513", "title": "Sonsorolese language", "text": "Sonsorolese language\n\nThe Sonsorolese language is a Micronesian language spoken in Palau, originally on the islands composing the state of Sonsorol, and spreading through migration elsewhere in the country. It is very close to Tobian.\n\nSonsorolese is mostly spoken in the Palau archipelago, particularly in Sonsorol, Pulo Anna, and the Merir Islands (ethnologue.com). The language is one of the two indigenous languages spoken in the area and is actually the most spoken in the area, especially in Palau (sonsorol.com).\nAs the language being established in Palau, Palau has a little history of how it became what it is today. The country was settled in the early BC era from the Philippines and Indonesia (Wikipedia). The area became part of the Spanish–American War and in the end the Spanish gave up their territory of Palau and some of the other islands to the Germans. Later down the road the Japanese took the land and then gave up to the United States during World War 2.\n\nThere are about 360 speakers spread out within 60 islands. Some linguists believe that the language is fading little by little. The population started to fall due to an influenza epidemic that the Germans caused . Most speakers of Sonsorol are bilingual, with their second language being English, to be able to communicate with others outside their island sonsorol.com. The language is an official language for the areas where it is spoken. Some sister languages of Sonsorol are Ulithian, Woleaian, and Satawalese. The language is part of the Austronesian language family.\n\n\n\nIn Sonsorolese, there are 19 consonants. These consonants are: /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /c/, /k/, /g/, /m/, /n/, /f/, /v/, /j/, /x/, /ɣ/, /r/, /w/, /s/, /ŋ/, and /ʟʲ/.\n\nConsonants that are plosive and labial are p and b. T and d are dental-alveolar and plosive. The consonant c is palatal and plosive. K and g are velar and plosive consonants. The consonant that is nasal and dental-alveolar is n. F and v are fricative and labio-dental. The consonant that is fricative and dental-alveolar is s. J is a fricative and palatal consonant. The consonants x and ɣ are fricative and velar. R is rolled and a dental-alveolar consonant. Lastly, w is a continuant and labial consonant (Capell, 1969).\n\nSonsorolese has 5 vowels which are; /o/, /e/, /a/, /u/, and /i/. The vowels that are in the front for frontness are /i/, /e/, and /a/. The back frontness vowels are /u/ and /o/. As for the height of the vowels, /i/ and /u/ is high, /e/ and /o/ is mid, and /a/ is low. There are many exceptions to the vowel usage depending on where the vowel is placed and the consonants used before and after the vowel. The vowel /i/ sometimes is drawn back in frontness, which produces a different sound. /E/ is considered as a chiefly vowel and is rare. The only time you will see the vowel used is when it is in the body of a word. The vowel /a/ developed a velar fricative that involves either a /x/ or /y/ in front of the vowel. /O/ is mostly used in diphthongs and a variety of French influenced words. And lastly the vowel /u/ is to lip-round the word that is being pronounced.\n\nThe language does allow diphthongs. Some of them are /ae/, /ai/, /ao/, and /au/. Some of the diphthongs are considered to be difficult to pronounce and some do elongate the vowel sound. An example of the diphthong /ae/ is mae, which means breadfruit in English (Capell, 1969).\n\nFurtive vowels are unique and are only in a few languages. Sonsorolese is one of the few languages that have furtive vowels. The vowels become furtive when one does not hear the vowel being pronounced. The vowel is “whispered” or silent when pronouncing certain words (Capell, 1969). Capell stated that there are 3 ways that furtive vowels occur, which are; “as finals, after a consonant, after a full, generally long vowel, and before a consonant, when they are acoustically similar to falling diphthongs, after non-final consonants a furtive /i/ or /u/ produces palatalization or velarisation (respectively) of the consonants.”\n\nSonsorolese is usually a spoken language, but is occasionally written to the writer's preference. Many of the sounds are like that in Tobian and Woleaian. A couple of dialects include the pronunciation of \"d\", which is common at the beginning of words and similar to ; \"r\" is pronounced as in Spanish, as opposed to English; also, \"l\" is always pronounced with tongue touching the back roof of the mouth and sounds something like a combination of the and sounds. For that reason, some Sonsorolese prefer to spell their els as . As in Woleaian, silent vowels are usually found at the end of Sonsorolese words. For example, in \"Dongosaro\", the native name for Sonsorol island, the final \"-o\" is silent.\n\nSonsorolese’s basic word order when constructing a sentence is a subject, object, verb (SOV) order.\n\nAn example of the use of the SOV word order is:\nEtai maho tipel= I am not happy. \nEtai (I) is our subject, maho (happy) is our object, and tipel (not) is our adverb for this example sentence. \nAs for asking questions, the word order does stay the same and there are many examples from sonsorol.com. \nEmaho tipomu = are you happy?\n\nThere is full reduplication in the Sonsorol language.\nEx. Orange = Hulu\nOranges= Huluhulu\n\nSonsorolese numeral system is a base 10 system. The numeral system can go up to 1,000, which is “da ngaladi” (sonsorol.com).\n\n\n\nThere are many resources and materials that deal with the Sonsorol language, which includes newspapers, small textbooks, dictionary, YouTube videos, and blogs. Without any of these documentations of the language, the language may have a lesser chance of surviving. As the school system improves in Palau, there will be more textbooks being produced in the language to provide a resource to learn the language. YouTube videos help give exposure of the language and culture, which can be a good way to preserve.\n\nSonsorol language is considered endangered, but the language is becoming stronger because of intergenerational transmission. In Palau, schools are being built one by one for the younger generation to attend school to learn the language (sonsorol.com). Though the number of speakers is low, the language is increasing its number of speakers. Native speakers are attempting to preserve and keep the language alive by intergenerational transmission. The construction of schools is making a large impact in preserving speakers of the younger generation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38523090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38523090", "title": "Statistical learning in language acquisition", "text": "Statistical learning in language acquisition\n\nStatistical learning is the ability for humans and other animals to extract statistical regularities from the world around them to learn about the environment. Although statistical learning is now thought to be a generalized learning mechanism, the phenomenon was first identified in human infant language acquisition.\n\nThe earliest evidence for these statistics learning abilities comes from a study by Jenny Saffran, Richard Aslin, and Elissa Newport, in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone speech. Each stream was composed of four three-syllable “pseudowords” that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing “pseudowords” as opposed to “nonwords” from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together and which ones only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning is thought to be one way that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words.\n\nSince the initial discovery of the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition, the same mechanism has been proposed for elements of phonological acquisition, and syntactical acquisition, as well as in non-linguistic domains. Further research has also indicated that statistical learning is likely a domain-general and even species-general learning mechanism, occurring for visual as well as auditory information, and in both primates and non-primates.\n\nThe role of statistical learning in language acquisition has been particularly well documented in the area of lexical acquisition. One important contribution to infants' understanding of segmenting words from a continuous stream of speech is their ability to recognize statistical regularities of the speech heard in their environments. Although many factors play an important role, this specific mechanism is powerful and can operate over a short time scale.\n\nIt is a well-established finding that, unlike written language, spoken language does not have any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them. This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear. One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them. For example, in the phrase \"pretty baby,\" children are more likely to hear the sounds \"pre\" and \"ty\" heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds \"ty\" and \"ba\" together. In an artificial grammar learning study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task. This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated.\n\nTo determine if young children have these same abilities Saffran Aslin and Newport exposed 8-month-old infants to an artificial grammar. The grammar was composed of four words, each composed of three nonsense syllables. During the experiment, infants heard a continuous speech stream of these words . Importantly, the speech was presented in a monotone with no cues (such as pauses, intonation, etc.) to word boundaries other than the statistical probabilities. Within a word, the transitional probability of two syllable pairs was 1.0: in the word \"bidaku\", for example, the probability of hearing the syllable \"da\" immediately after the syllable \"bi\" was 100%. Between words, however, the transitional probability of hearing a syllable pair was much lower: After any given word (e.g., \"bidaku\") was presented, one of three words could follow (in this case, \"padoti\", \"golabu\", or \"tupiro\"), so the likelihood of hearing any given syllable after \"ku\" was only 33%.\n\nTo determine if infants were picking up on the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword made up of the same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as \"dapiku\" and \"tilado\" that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable \"ku\" never followed the syllable \"pi\".\n\nTo look more closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport conducted another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as \"kupado\"). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.\n\nThis result has been the impetus for much more research on the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition and other areas (see ). In a follow-up to the original report, Aslin, Saffran, and Newport found that even when words and part words occurred equally often in the speech stream, but with different transitional probabilities between syllables of words and part words, infants were still able to detect the statistical regularities and still preferred to listen to the novel part-words over the familiarized words. This finding provides stronger evidence that infants are able to pick up transitional probabilities from the speech they hear, rather than just being aware of frequencies of individual syllable sequences.\n\nAnother follow-up study examined the extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.\n\nA related finding indicates that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities from a single set of input, suggesting that they are able to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this indicates that infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.\n\nDespite the large role that statistical learning appears to play in lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn to segment words. Statistical learning studies are generally conducted with artificial grammars that have no cues to word boundary information other than transitional probabilities between words. Real speech, though, has many different types of cues to word boundaries, including prosodic and phonotactic information.\n\nTogether, the findings from these studies of statistical learning in language acquisition indicate that statistical properties of the language are a strong cue in helping infants learn their first language.\n\nThere is much evidence that statistical learning is an important component of both discovering which phonemes are important for a given language and which contrasts within phonemes are important. Having this knowledge is important for aspects of both speech perception and speech production.\n\nSince the discovery of infants’ statistical learning abilities in word learning, the same general mechanism has also been studied in other facets of language learning. For example, it is well-established that infants can discriminate between phonemes of many different languages but eventually become unable to discriminate between phonemes that do not appear in their native language; however, it was not clear how this decrease in discriminatory ability came about. Maye et al. suggested that the mechanism responsible might be a statistical learning mechanism in which infants track the distributional regularities of the sounds in their native language. To test this idea, Maye et al. exposed 6- and 8-month-old infants to a continuum of speech sounds that varied on the degree to which they were voiced. The distribution that the infants heard was either bimodal, with sounds from both ends of the voicing continuum heard most often, or unimodal, with sounds from the middle of the distribution heard most often. The results indicated that infants from both age groups were sensitive to the distribution of phonemes. At test, infants heard either non-alternating (repeated exemplars of tokens 3 or 6 from an 8-token continuum) or alternating (exemplars of tokens 1 and 8) exposures to specific phonemes on the continuum. Infants exposed to the bimodal distribution listened longer to the alternating trials than the non-alternating trials while there was no difference in listening times for infants exposed to the unimodal distribution. This finding indicates that infants exposed the bimodal distribution were better able to discriminate sounds from the two ends of the distribution than were infants in the unimodal condition, regardless of age. This type of statistical learning differs from that used in lexical acquisition, as it requires infants to track frequencies rather than transitional probabilities, and has been named “distributional learning.”\n\nDistributional learning has also been found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants who were exposed to a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast. Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.\n\nIn a review of the role of distributional learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired. However, it does seem clear that this type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing.\n\nA related finding regarding statistical cues to phonological acquisition is a phenomenon known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to the same category as the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.\n\nA statistical learning device has also been proposed as a component of syntactical acquisition for young children. Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.\n\nLater studies expanded these results by looking at the actual behavior of children or adults who had been exposed to artificial grammars. These later studies also considered the role of statistical learning more broadly than the earlier studies, placing their results in the context of the statistical learning mechanisms thought to be involved with other aspects of language learning, such as lexical acquisition.\n\nEvidence from a series of four experiments conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located in the middle of the sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.\n\nTogether these studies suggest that infants are able to extract a substantial amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language. Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or in the middle of the sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.\n\nIn a similar study, Saffran found that adults and older children (first and second grade children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language which had no cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present. Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.\n\nAlthough the number of studies dealing with statistical learning of syntactical information is limited, the available evidence does indicate that the statistical learning mechanisms are likely a contributing factor to children’s ability to learn their language.\n\nMuch of the early work using statistical learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language, consistent with the process of language acquisition for monolingual speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are bilingual. More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who speak more than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple artificial languages simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages. Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two artificial languages, adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were “congruent”—when the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent—a syllable that appeared in the middle of a word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language—and spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries.\n\nSimilar work replicates the finding that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in this case). In their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.’s paradigm, and participants did learn the first artificial language to which they had been exposed better than the second, although participants’ performance was above chance for both languages.\n\nWhile statistical learning improves and strengthens multilingualism, it appears that the inverse is not true. In a study by Yim and Rudoy it was found that both monolingual and bilingual children perform statistical learning tasks equally well.\n\nAntovich and Graf Estes found that 14 month old bilingual children are better than monolinguals at segmenting two different artificial languages using transitional probability cues. They suggest that a bilingual environment in early childhood trains children to rely on statistical regularities to segment the speech flow and access two lexical systems.\n\nA statistical learning mechanism has also been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated with one of those objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times over the course of the training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis is that learners in this type of task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge at the end of the training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word \"vash\" she might hypothesize that \"vash\" refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word \"vash\". If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word \"vash\" 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of \"vash\" (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of \"vash\") and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that \"vash\" referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.\n\nTo distinguish between these two possibilities, Trueswell et al. conducted a series of experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.\n\nOverall, these results, along with similar results from Medina et al., indicate that word meanings may not be learned through a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, which ask participants to hypothesize a mapping even on the first occurrence (i.e., not cross-situationally). However, when the propose-but-verify mechanism has been compared to a statistical learning mechanism, the former was unable to reproduce individual learning trajectories nor fit as well as the latter.\n\nAdditionally, statistical learning by itself cannot account even for those aspects of language acquisition for which it has been shown to play a large role. For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition. Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable to take advantage of the statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon of statistical learning was first discovered in the context of language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.. Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).\n\nFurther evidence for domain general statistical learning was suggested in a study run through the University of Cornell Department of Psychology concerning visual statistical learning in infancy. Researchers in this study questioned whether domain generality of statistical learning in infancy would be seen using visual information. After first viewing images in statistically predictable patterns, infants were then exposed to the same familiar patterns in addition to novel sequences of the same identical stimulus components. Interest in the visuals was measured by the amount of time the child looked at the stimuli in which the researchers named “looking time.” All ages of infant participants showed more interest in the novel sequence relative to the familiar sequence. In demonstrating a preference for the novel sequences (which violated the transitional probability that defined the grouping of the original stimuli) the results of the study support the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy.\n"}

He is known for his works on developing nations in Africa and the Saharan countries, China, India, Latin America and Australia. In the 1960s, partly inspired by the works of Hermann Hesse, Lindqvist spent two years in China.

These topics are not uncontroversial. His 1992 book \"Exterminate all the Brutes\" argued that the Nazi quest for \"Lebensraum\" had at its core been an application of the expansionist and racist principles of imperialism and colonialism, but for the first time applied against fellow Europeans rather than against the distant and dehumanized peoples of the Third World. The book encouraged historians to research the effect of atrocities in colonial times on Nazi thought.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "476564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476564", "title": "Thracian language", "text": "Thracian language\n\nThe Thracian language () is an extinct Indo-European language, spoken in ancient times in South-east Europe by the Thracians. The Thracian language either belonged to the satem group of Indo-European languages, or was a centum language that had been strongly influenced by satem languages.\n\nA contemporary, neighboring language, Dacian is usually regarded as closely related to Thracian. However, there is insufficient evidence, regarding both languages, to enable the nature of this relationship to be decided.\n\nThe point at which Thracian became extinct is a matter of dispute. However, it is generally accepted that Thracian was still in use in the 6th century AD: Antoninus of Piacenza wrote in 570 that there was a monastery in the Sinai, at which the monks spoke Greek, Latin, Syriac, Egyptian and Bessian – a Thracian dialect. \n\nOther theories about Thracian remain controversial. \nThese are among many competing hypotheses regarding the classification and fate of Thracian.\n\nThe Thracian language was spoken in what is now Bulgaria, Romania, Republic of Macedonia, Northern Greece, European Turkey and in parts of Bithynia (North-Western Asiatic Turkey).\n\nEastern Serbia is usually considered by paleolinguists to have been a Daco-Moesian language area. Moesian (after Vladimir Georgiev et al.) is grouped with Dacian.\n\nLittle is known for certain about the Thracian language, since no phrase beyond a few words in length has been satisfactorily deciphered, and the sounder decipherments given for the shorter phrases may not be completely accurate. Some of the longer inscriptions may indeed be Thracian in origin but they may not reflect actual Thracian language sentences, but rather jumbles of names or magical formulas.\n\nEnough Thracian lexical items have survived to show that Thracian was a member of the Indo-European language family and that it was a satemized language by the time it is attested.\nBesides the aforementioned inscriptions, Thracian is attested through personal names, toponyms, hydronyms, phytonyms, divine names, etc. and by a small number of words cited in Ancient Greek texts as being specifically Thracian.\n\nOther ancient Greek lexical items were not specifically identified as Thracian by the ancient Greeks but are hypothesized by paleolinguists as being or probably being of Thracian origin. Other lexical items are hypothesized on the basis of local anthroponyms, toponyms, hydronyms, oronyms, etc. mentioned in primary sources (see also List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia, List of Dacian plant names) .\n\nBelow is a table showing both words cited as being Thracian in classical sources, and lexical elements that have been extracted by paleolinguists from Thracian anthroponyms, toponyms, etc. In this table the closest cognates are shown, with an emphasis on cognates in Bulgarian, Albanian, Baltic, Slavic, Greek, and substratum and/or old-layer words in the Eastern Romance languages: Romanian, Aromanian, et cetera. See also the List of reconstructed Dacian words.\n\nSignificant cognates from any Indo-European language are listed. However, not all lexical items in Thracian are assumed to be from the Proto-Indo-European language, some non-IE lexical items in Thracian are to be expected.\n\nThere are 23 words mentioned by ancient sources considered explicitly of Thracian origin and known meaning\nAn additional 180 Thracian words have been reconstructed.\n\nThe proposed Thracian words in the Ancient Greek lexicon are not numerous. They include the \"parth-\" element in Parthenon; \"balios\" (\"dappled\"; < PIE \"*bhel-\", \"to shine\", Bul. \"bel/bial\" (бял) \"white\" or \"bljaskav\" 'bright, shiny'; Pokorny also cites Illyrian as a possible source, the non-Greek origin is argued on phonological grounds), \"bounos\", \"hill, mound\".\n\nThe Thracian horseman hero was an important figure in Thracian religion, mythology, and culture. Depictions of the Thracian Horseman are found in numerous archaeological remains and artifacts from Thracian regions. From the Duvanli ring and from cognates in numerous Indo-European languages, \"mezēna\" is seen to be a Thracian word for \"horse\", deriving from PIE \"*mend-\". Another Thracian word for \"horse\" is hypothesized, but it looks certain, there is no disagreement among Thracologists: \"aspios\", \"esvas\", \"asb-\" (and some other variants; < PIE \"*ekwo\" , the Thracian showing a satem form similar to Sanskrit \"áśva-\", \"horse\", Avestan \"aspa\", \"horse\", Ossetic \"jäfs\", Prussian \"aswinan\" ‘mare milk’, Lithuanian \"ašvíenis\" ‘stallion’, ašvà, dial. ešvà ‘mare’), from \"Outaspios\", \"Utaspios\", an inscription associated with the Thracian horseman. \"Ut-\" based on the PIE root word \"ud-\" (meaning \"up\") and based on several Thracic items, would have meant \"upon\", \"up\", and \"Utaspios\" is theorized to have meant \"On horse(back)\", parallel to ancient Greek \"ephippos (epi-hippos)\".\n\nThe early Indo-European languages had more than one word for horse; for example Latin had \"equus\" from PIE \"*ekwo-\" and \"mannus\" (\"a pony\") from another IE root, later receiving \"cabalus\" as a loanword.\n\nIn many cases in current Thracology, there is more than one etymology for a Thracian lexical item. For example, Thracian \"Diana Germetitha\" (\"Diana\" is from Latin while the epithet \"Germetitha\" is from Thracian) has two different proposed etymologies, \"Diana of the warm bosom\" (Olteanu; et al.?) or \"Diana of the warm radiance\" (Georgiev; et al.?). In other cases, etymologies for the Thracian lexical items may be sound, but some of the proposed cognates are not actually cognates, thus confusing the affinity of Thracian.\n\nOnly four Thracian inscriptions of any length have been found. The first is a gold ring found in 1912 in the village of Ezerovo, Bulgaria; the ring was dated to the 5th century BC. On the ring an inscription is found written in a Greek script and consisting of 8 lines, the eighth of which is located on the edge, the rim, of the rotating disk; it reads:\n\nDimitar Dechev (Germanised as \"D. Detschew\") separates the words thus\ni.e.\nproposing the following translation\n\nA second inscription, hitherto undeciphered, was found in 1965 near the village of Kyolmen, Varbitsa Municipality, dating to the sixth century BC. Written in a Greek alphabet variant, it is possibly a tomb stele inscription similar to the Phrygian ones; Peter A. Dimitrov's transcription thereof is:\n\ni.e.\n\nA third inscription is again on a ring, found in Duvanli, Kaloyanovo Municipality, next to the left hand of a skeleton. It dates to the 5th century BC. The ring has the image of a horseman with the inscription surrounding the image. It is only partly legible (16 out of the initial 21)\ni.e.\n\nThe meaning of the inscription is 'Horseman Eusie protect!'\n\nThese are the longest inscriptions preserved. The remaining ones are mostly single words or names on vessels and other artifacts.\n\nThe Thracian language in linguistic textbooks is usually treated either as its own branch of Indo-European, or is grouped with Dacian, together forming a Daco-Thracian branch of IE. Older textbooks often grouped it also with Illyrian or Phrygian. The belief that Thracian was close to Phrygian is no longer popular and has mostly been discarded. The Thraco-Illyrian grouping has also been called into question. Daco-Thracian or Thraco-Dacian is the main hypothesis.\n\nNo definite evidence has yet been found that demonstrates that Thracian or Daco-Thracian belonged on the same branch as Albanian or Baltic or Balto-Slavic or Greco-Macedonian or Phrygian or any other IE branch. For this reason textbooks still treat Thracian as its own branch of Indo-European, or as a Daco-Thracian/Thraco-Dacian branch.\n\nThe generally accepted clades branched from the Proto-Indo-European language are, in alphabetical order, the Proto-Albanian language, Proto-Anatolian language, Proto-Armenian language, Proto-Balto-Slavic language, Proto-Celtic language, Proto-Germanic language, Proto-Greek language, Proto-Indo-Iranian language, Proto-Italic language, and the Proto-Tocharian language. Thracian, Dacian, Phrygian, Illyrian, Venetic, and Paeonian are fragmentarily attested and cannot be reliably categorized.\n\nNote: Asterisk indicates reconstructed IE sound. \"M\" is a cover symbol for the row of voiced stops (mediae), \"T\" for unvoiced stops (tenues) and \"TA\" for aspirated stops (tenues aspiratae). ∅ indicates zero, a sound that has been lost.\n\nThraco-Dacian has been hypothesized as forming a branch of Indo-European along with Baltic.\n\nFor a big number of the 300 Thracian geographic names there are cognates within the Baltic toponymy, most similarities between Thracian and Balto-Slavic personal and geographic names were found, especially Baltic. According to Duridinov the \"most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian\" \"the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression\". According to him there are occasional similarities between Slavic and Thracian because Slavic is related to Baltic, while almost no lexical similarities within Thracian and Phrygian were found. This significant relatedness show close affinity and kinship of Thracian with Baltic. The following table shows the cognates:\n\n\"Cognates of Thracian and Baltic place names\"\nAccording to Skordelis, when Thracians were subjected by Alexander the Great they finally assimilated to Greek culture and became as Greek as Spartans and Athenians, although he considered the Thracian language as a form of Greek. According to Crampton (1997) most Thracians were eventually Hellenized or Romanized, with the last remnants surviving in remote areas until the 5th century. According to Marinov the Thracians were likely completely Romanized and Hellenized after the last contemporary references to them of the 6th century. This theory holds as the main factor of immediate assimilation the Christianization of the Roman Empire.\n\nA quick extinction would intensely contrast the avoidance of Hellenization at least by Albanian and Aromanian till the present, possibly with the help of isolated mountainous areas.\n\nAnother author considers that the interior of Thrace have never been Romanized or Hellenized (Trever, 1939). This was followed also by Slavonization. According to Weithmann (1978) when the Slavs migrated, they encountered only a very superficially Romanized Thracian and Dacian population, which had not strongly identified itself with Imperial Rome, while Greek and Roman populations (mostly soldiers, officials, merchants) abandoned the land or were killed. Because Pulpudeva survived as Plovdiv in Slavic languages, not under Philippopolis, some authors suggest that Thracian was not completely obliterated in the 7th century.\n\nThe latest known use described by Symeon the Metaphrast in a biography of Saint Theodosius the Cenobiarch (423-529), where he claimed that Thracian language was spoken in a monastery, build on Mount Sinai just then, when Theodosius was there:\n\"There were four churches belonging to it, one for each of the three several nations of which his community was chiefly composed, each speaking a different language; the fourth was for the use of such as were in a state of penance, which those that recovered from their lunatic or possessed condition before-mentioned, were put into, and detained till they had expiated their fault. The nations into which his community was divided were the Greeks, which was by far the most numerous, and consisted of all those that came from any provinces of the empire; the Armenians, with whom were joined the Arabians and Persians; and, thirdly, the Bessi, who comprehended all the northern nations below Thrace, or all who used the Runic or Sclavonian tongue. Each nation sung the first part of the mass to the end of the gospel in their own church, but after the gospel all met in the church of the Greeks, where they celebrated the essential part of the sacrifice in Greek, and communicated all together...\"\n\n\n\n"}

In 1956 his \"Your Most Enchanted Listener\" was published; in 1972, his \"Living With Change: The Semantics of Coping,\" a collection of selected portions of transcriptions of hundreds of his talks, organized by Dorothy Moeller, provided further general semantic insights. He also published many articles in his lifetime, in journals, including \"ETC: A Review of General Semantics\". [1] Neil Postman acknowledges the influence of \"People in Quandaries\" in his own excellent general semantics book \"Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk\" (1976, Delacorte, New York):\n\nPatricia Zebrowski, University of Iowa assistant professor of speech pathology and audiology, notes, \"The body of data that resulted from Johnson's work on children who stutter and their parents is still the largest collection of scientific information on the subject of stuttering onset. Although new work has determined that children who stutter are doing something different in their speech production than non-stutterers, Johnson was the first to talk about the importance of a stutterer's thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and feelings. We still don't know what causes stuttering, but the 'Iowa' way of approaching study and treatment is still heavily influenced by Johnson, but with an added emphasis on speech production.\" \n\nOne of the most thorough single Web site collections of material regarding Wendell Johnson is https://web.archive.org/web/20071013204006/http://www.uiowa.edu/~cyberlaw/oldinav/wjhome.html. It contains links to his Who's Who in America entry and c.v., bibliographies, excerpts from his writing, audio of his general semantics lectures, articles by others about Johnson, and an excerpt from Robert Goldfarb, editor, \"Ethics: A Case Study from Fluency\" (2005).\n\nAttacks on the 1930s master's thesis, and the journalistic labeling as a \"Monster Study\", contributed to controversy. On the one hand, speech research scientists Nicoline Grinager Ambrose and Ehud Yairi are critical of the \"conclusions\" that Mary Tudor drew from her data, but believe that no harm was done to the subjects and that there was no intention to do harm. Others felt the study was unethical by today's standards but fell within the bounds of those standards in 1939.\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Schwartz concludes in Chapter 6 of the book that the study \"was unfortunate in Tudor and Johnson's lack of regard for the potential harm to the children who participated and in their selection of institutionalized children simply because they were easily available. The deception and the apparent lack of debriefing were also not justifiable.\" Other authors concur claiming the orphan experiment was not within the ethical boundaries of acceptable research. The University of Iowa paid a settlement to some of the surviving subjects of over $900,000 in 2007.\n\n\n"}
