The unpleasant nature of such silences is associated with feelings of anxiety as the participants feel pressure to speak but are unsure of what to say next. \nIn conversation, average pause length varies by language, culture and context. An awkward silence may occur if a pause has exceeded, for instance, a length generally accepted for demarcating a subject change or the end of a turn. It may be preceded by an ill-considered remark or an imbalance in which one of the participants makes minimal responses. Alternatively, the tension may arise from an expectation that speech is expected in the setting, such as a classroom or presentation.\n\nWhen Europeans communicate with Japanese, a period of meaningful silence is sometimes misinterpreted as an awkward silence. Awkward silences may occur when Japanese are confronted with a direct question as the loss of face when making an unwelcome admission tends to make them reluctant to say phrases like \"I don't know\".\n\nAwkward silences may result from a faltering conversation in which the participants have completed what they wanted to say. To avoid such a conclusion, it has been recommended that the participants actively close the conversation by summarising what was said and thanking the others for their contributions.\n\nWhen prolonged conversation is expected, people may be put at ease and conversation facilitated by contriving topics. In a social setting where people are meeting for the first time, the organiser of the gathering may propose an icebreaker or conversation opener such as a round of introductions. Conversation pieces, such as novel trinkets or artworks, may be used to stimulate continued conversation. In an online setting or virtual reality, an automated agent may be used to monitor and stimulate flagging conversation by suggesting topics.\n\nIn the film \"Pulp Fiction\", Mia and Vincent discuss uncomfortable silences after a pause in their conversation at Jackrabbit Slim's:\n\n\"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" features a running gag of an awkward pause between Craig Ferguson and guests.\n"}

The Apostolic Library in the Vatican holds the only known copy of the book. Dr. Thoma Qendro prepared the Biblical text from Buzuku's \"Missal\" for the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society's reprint in 2010.\n\nEarlier attempts have been recorded such as the 18th century Elbasan Gospel Manuscript.\n\nVangjel Meksi translated the New Testament in 1821 with the support of the British and Foreign Bible Society. This work was edited by bishop Gregory IV of Athens. The book of Matthew was published in 1824 and the full New Testament in 1827, in both a full volume and a split two-volume set because \"the Albanians had the custom of carrying their books with them near their heart.\" An Albanian Translation of the Transcript was done by Dr. Thoma Qendro. The book was printed and published in spring of 2016 by SHBSHA.\n\nKostandin Kristoforidhi translated the New Testament into Albania's two dialects as well as portions of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, The Psalms, The Proverbs, and Isaiah). His work was also supported by the British and Foreign Bible Society. These works are being reprinted by the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society in a ten volume set which includes Kristoforidhi's Albanian Grammar (1882) and manuscript facsimiles.\n\nDon Simon Filipaj worked with the Belgrade office of the United Bible Societies (UBS) to produce a Bible translation in Albanian. The New Testament was published in 1977, which makes it the first New Testament in modern Albanian. One of the translation Consultants was Dayrell Oakley-Hill who had served in Albania with the Gendarmerie in the 1930s. In 1994, Drita re-produced Dom Simon Filipaj's Bible which includes the Apocrypha. The version is used by Albanian Roman Catholic churches.\n\nIn 1993, European Christian Mission produced the first bound copy of the entire Bible in Albanian, prepared by Stephen Etches. Bible smuggler Brother Andrew came personally to Albania to present this Bible to the country's president and people. This version which was a dynamic equivalent translation similar to the English Good News Bible or German Gute Nachricht translation is now out of print. In 2003 this was reprinted by the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society.\n\nIn 1993, the Albanian Bible Society finished work on a translation of the complete Old Testament and by 1994 they finished the entire Bible. The Society had been preparing literature with Biblical content since 1974 and originally published its Bible with the name \"Lajmi i Mirë\" (LIM). The work was translated from the Italian text of the \"Textus Receptus\"-based \"Nuova Diodati\" Revision 1991 and checked against the original languages and the English King James Version. By 2002 the Society produced a revision of the New Testament which was \"completely revised and compared in detail with the original text.\" This version continues to circulate widely among evangelical churches and is presented in various formats including the \"Bibla e Studimit\" (The New Thompson Study Bible, Albanian version 2009). In websites and apps this version is accessed as \"ALBB Albanian Bible.\" This text is copyright the Albanian Bible Society (ABS) although it is misleadingly labelled as public domain on various websites.\n\nThis translation was published by Botime Çabej MÇM. According to the version's foreword, the textual basis is the \"Textus Receptus\" but also makes use of Nestle-Aland's \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" for several passages. Lea Plumbi-Frenzcke translated it with the help of Biblical Greek scholars. The literary editing was done by Gjergj Zheji. The language is slightly Tosk and the proper names reflect that (\"Joani\" instead of \"Gjoni\", etc.). The stated purpose of this translation was to make a faithful, word-for-word translation that is understandable for the Albanian people.\n\nIn 2000, Albanian linguist Vladimir Dervishi (1958-2010) produced a New Testament translation called the CHC (Christian Heritage College) Version and is based on Nestle-Aland's \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" with comparisons from the \"Textus Receptus\".\n\nIn 2000, the Jehovah's Witnesses' \"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures\" was released in Albanian (\"Shkrimet e Shenjta Përkthimi Bota e Re\"); the entire \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\" in Albanian was released in 2005. This version is not accepted by Albanian Christians who do not belong to the Jehovah's Witness denomination, being viewed as \"a distortion of the New Testament.\"\n\nIn 2007, Shërbimi Informues Biblik (SHIB) produced a text of the New Testament reportedly based on the 1912 German Luther Bibel. It was translated into Albanian by Marcel Steiner and edited by Kujtim Drizari, and called \"Besëlidhja e Re, Zëri i Zotit\".\n\nIn 2007, the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society (or \"Shoqëria Biblike,\" a division of the United Bible Societies) produced a new translation of the New Testament based on \"The Greek New Testament, Fourth Revised Edition\" by the UBS. It was printed with a short concordance and names index. The Old Testament translated from Hebrew is now near completion. As reflected in its title, the introduction to the version states that it is \"the fruit of the co-operative work of all the Christian confessions present in Albania\" i.e. Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. In websites and apps this version is accessed as \"AL Së bashku\". The Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania also engages in reproducing the earliest known Albanian versions or portions of the Bible.\n\n"}

She was one of twenty-two children fathered by the writer Henry Brooke, author of \"Gustavus Vasa\"; only she (and perhaps one other sibling) survived childhood.\n\nFrom an early age she was attracted to books. While the rest of her family was sleeping, Brooke would go down to the study where she would spend hours reading.\n\nCharlotte Brooke was educated by her father Henry Brooke, and she immersed herself in reading history and literature at an early age. She was part of the first generation of the Protestant Anglo-Irish settler class who took a strong interest in the Irish language and Gaelic history; her primary interest in Irish language and literature was generated by her hearing it being spoken and recited by the laborers in County Cavan and on the County Kildare estates where her family had moved around 1758. She was led to the study of the Irish language, and in less than two years she found herself in love with it. From reading Irish poetry and admiring its beauties, she proceeded to translate it into English, one of her earliest efforts being a song and monody by Carolan, which appeared in Joseph Cooper Walker's 'Historical Memoirs of Irish Bards.'\n\nBrooke, who was frail herself, took care of her father after her mother died in 1773. Meanwhile, the family had moved back to county Cavan, where they began living in a house they named Longfield which had been built near the Rantavan estate. A few years after Henry Brooke died in 1783, Charlotte Brooke ran into money troubles, after a model industrial village set up in County Kildare by her cousin Captain Robert Brooke went bankrupt (1787). Walker and other members of the recently created Royal Irish Academy sought to make an income for her, but Charlotte realized she had to rely on her writings and translations.\n\nIn 1792, Brooke had taken up a life with friends in Longford, sharing a cottage due to her lack of income. On March 29, 1793, Charlotte Brooke passed of a malignant fever.\n\nBrooke wrote:\n\n\nShe sought to preserve the work of Irish poets, which she believed would be lost if not translated.

In , he tells his listeners, \"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\"\n\nThis scripture was cited at the end of Puritan John Winthrop's lecture or treatise, \"A Model of Christian Charity\" delivered on March 21, 1630 at Holyrood Church in Southampton before his first group of Massachusetts Bay colonists embarked on the ship \"Arbella\" to settle Boston. Winthrop warned his fellow Puritans that their new community would be \"as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us\", meaning, if the Puritans failed to uphold their covenant with God, then their sins and errors would be exposed for all the world to see: \"So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world\". Winthrop's lecture was forgotten for nearly two hundred years until the Massachusetts Historical Society published it in 1838. It remained an obscure reference for more than another century until Cold War era historians and political leaders made it relevant to their time for false reasons, mistakenly crediting Winthrop's text as the foundational document of the idea of American exceptionalism.\n\nOn 9 January 1961, President-Elect John F. Kennedy quoted the phrase during delivered to the General Court of Massachusetts:\n\nOn November 3, 1980, Ronald Reagan referred to the same event and image in his Election Eve Address \"A Vision for America\"\n\nand in his January 11, 1989, farewell speech to the nation:\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama also made reference to the topic in his commencement address on June 2, 2006 at the University of Massachusetts Boston:\n\nIn 2016, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney incorporated the idiom into a condemnation of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign:\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Texas Senator Ted Cruz used the phrase during his speech announcing the suspension of his campaign. President Barack Obama also alluded to President Ronald Reagan's use of the phrase during his speech at the Democratic National Convention the same year, as he proposed a vision of America in contrast to that of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2017, former FBI Director James Comey used the phrase in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn Australian politics, the similar phrase \"the light on the hill\" was famously used in a 1949 conference speech by then Prime Minister Ben Chifley, and as a consequence this phrase is used to describe the objective of the Australian Labor Party.

He is well known for his work in numismatics and for compiling critical editions of ancient Sanskrit texts. His father, Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi, had studied ancient Indian texts with a particular emphasis on Buddhism and its literature in the Pali language. Damodar Kosambi emulated him by developing a keen interest in his country's ancient history. Kosambi was also a Marxist historian specialising in ancient India who employed the historical materialist approach in his work. He is particularly known for his classic work \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\".\n\nHe is described as \"the patriarch of the Marxist school of Indian historiography\". Kosambi was critical of the policies of then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, which, according to him, promoted capitalism in the guise of democratic socialism. He was an enthusiast of the Chinese revolution and its ideals, and, in addition, a leading activist in the World Peace Movement.\n\nAfter a few years of schooling in India, in 1918, Damodar and his elder sister, Manik travelled to Cambridge, Massachusetts with their father, the eminent Buddhist and Pali scholar, Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi.\nThe latter was tasked by Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman of Harvard University to complete compiling a critical edition of Visuddhimagga, a book on Buddhist philosophy, which was originally started by Henry Clarke Warren. There, the young Damodar spent a year in a Grammar school and then was admitted to the Cambridge High and Latin School in 1920. He became a member of the Cambridge branch of American Boy Scouts.\n\nIt was in Cambridge that he befriended another prodigy of the time, Norbert Wiener, whose father Leo Wiener was the elder Kosambi's colleague at Harvard University.\n\nKosambi excelled in his final school examination and was one of the few candidates who was exempt on the basis of merit from necessarily passing an entrance examination essential at the time to gain admission to Harvard University. He enrolled in Harvard in 1924, but eventually postponed his studies, and returned to India. He stayed with his father who was now working in the Gujarat University, and was in the close circles of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn January 1926, Kosambi returned to the US with his father, who once again studied at Harvard University for a year and half. Kosambi studied mathematics under George David Birkhoff, who wanted him to concentrate on mathematics, but the ambitious Kosambi instead took many diverse courses excelling in each of them. In 1929, Harvard awarded him the Bachelor of Arts degree with a . He was also granted membership to the esteemed Phi Beta Kappa Society, the oldest undergraduate honours organisation in the United States. He returned to India soon after.\n\nHe obtained the post of professor at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), teaching German alongside mathematics. He struggled to pursue his research on his own, and published his first research paper, \"Precessions of an Elliptic Orbit\" in the \"Indian Journal of Physics\" in 1930.\n\nIn 1931, Kosambi married Nalini from the wealthy Madgaonkar family. It was in this year that he was hired by mathematician André Weil, then Professor of Mathematics at Aligarh Muslim University, to the post of lecturership in mathematics at Aligarh. His other colleagues at Aligarh included Vijayraghavan. During his two years stay in Aligarh, he produced eight research papers in the general area of Differential Geometry and Path Spaces. His fluency in several European languages allowed him to publish some of his early papers in French, Italian and German journals in their respective languages.\n\nIn 1933, he joined the Deccan Education Society's Fergusson College in Pune, where he taught mathematics for the next 12 years. In 1935, his eldest daughter, Maya was born, while in 1939, the youngest, Meera.\n\nIn Pune, while teaching mathematics and conducting research in the field, he started his interdisciplinary pursuit. In 1944 he published a small article of 4 pages titled 'The Estimation of Map Distance from Recombination Values' in \"Annals of Eugenics\", in which he introduced what later came to be known as Kosambi map function.\n\nOne of the most important contributions of Kosambi to statistics is the widely known technique called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Although it was originally developed by Kosambi in 1943, it is now referred to as the Karhunen–Loève expansion. In the 1943 paper entitled 'Statistics in Function Space' presented in the \"Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society\", Kosambi presented the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition some years before Karhunen (1945) and Loeve (1948). This tool has found application to such diverse fields as image processing, signal processing, data compression, oceanography, chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. Unfortunately this most important contribution of his is barely acknowledged in most papers that utilise the POD method. In recent years though, some authors have indeed referred to it as the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve decomposition.\n\nIt was his studies in numismatics that initiated him into the field of historical research. He did extensive research in difficult science of numismatics. His evaluation of data was by modern statistical methods. He made a thorough study of Sanskrit and ancient literature, and he started his classic work on the ancient poet Bhartṛhari. He published his critical editions of Bhartrihari's Śatakatraya and Subhashitas during 1945–1948.\n\nIt was during this period that he started his political activism, coming close to the radical streams in the ongoing Independence movement, especially the Communist Party of India. He became an outspoken Marxist and wrote some political articles.\n\nIn 1945, Homi J. Bhabha invited Kosambi to join the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) as Professor of Mathematics, which he accepted. After independence, in 1948–49 he was sent to England and to the USA as a UNESCO Fellow to study the theoretical and technical aspects of computing machines. In London, he started his long-lasting friendship with Indologist and historian A.L. Basham. In the spring semester of 1949, he was a visiting professor of geometry in the Mathematics Department at the University of Chicago, where his colleague from his Harvard days, Marshall Harvey Stone, was the chair. In April–May 1949, he spent nearly two months at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, discussing with such illustrious physicists and mathematicians as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann, Marston Morse, Oswald Veblen and Carl Ludwig Siegel amongst others.\n\nAfter his return to India, in the Cold War circumstances, he was increasingly drawn into the World Peace Movement and served as a Member of the World Peace Council. He became a tireless crusader for peace, campaigning against the nuclearisation of the world. Kosambi's solution to India's energy needs was in sharp conflict with the ambitions of the Indian ruling class. He proposed alternative energy sources, like solar power. His activism in the peace movement took him to Beijing, Helsinki and Moscow. However, during this period he relentlessly pursued his diverse research interests, too. Most importantly, he worked on his Marxist rewriting of ancient Indian history, which culminated in his book, \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\" (1956).\n\nHe visited China many times during 1952–62 and was able to watch the Chinese revolution very closely, making him critical of the way modernisation and development were envisaged and pursued by the Indian ruling classes. All these contributed to straining his relationship with the Indian government and Bhabha, eventually leading to Kosambi's exit from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1962.\n\nHis exit from the TIFR gave Kosambi the opportunity to concentrate on his research in ancient Indian history culminating in his book, \"The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India\", which was published in 1965 by Routledge, Kegan & Paul. The book was translated into German, French and Japanese and was widely acclaimed. He also utilised his time in archaeological studies, and contributed in the field of statistics and number theory. His article on numismatics was published in February 1965 in Scientific American.\n\nDue to the efforts of his friends and colleagues, in June 1964, Kosambi was appointed as a Scientist Emeritus of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) affiliated with the Maharashtra \"Vidnyanvardhini\" in Pune. He pursued many historical, scientific and archaeological projects (even writing stories for children). But most works he produced in this period could not be published during his lifetime. On 29 June 1966, he died in Pune. He was posthumously decorated with the \"Hari Om Ashram Award\" by the government of India's University Grant Commission in 1980.\n\nHis friend A.L. Basham, a well-known indologist, wrote in his obituary:\n\nAs a historian, Kosambi revolutionised Indian historiography with his realistic and scientific approach. He understood history in terms of the dynamics of socio-economic formations rather than just a chronological narration of \"episodes\" or the feats of a few great men – kings, warriors or saints. In the very first paragraph of his classic work, \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\", he gives an insight into his methodology as a prelude to his life work on ancient Indian history:\n\nAccording to A. L. Basham, \"\"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\" is in many respects an epoch making work, containing brilliantly original ideas on almost every page; if it contains errors and misrepresentations, if now and then its author attempts to force his data into a rather doctrinaire pattern, this does not appreciably lessen the significance of this very exciting book, which has stimulated the thought of thousands of students throughout the world.\"\n\nProfessor Sumit Sarkar says: \"Indian Historiography, starting with D.D. Kosambi in the 1950s, is acknowledged the world over – wherever South Asian history is taught or studied – as quite on a par with or even superior to all that is produced abroad. And that is why Irfan Habib or Romila Thapar or R.S. Sharma are figures respected even in the most diehard anti-Communist American universities. They cannot be ignored if you are studying South Asian history.\"\n\nIn his obituary of Kosambi published in \"Nature\", J. D. Bernal had summed up Kosambi's talent as follows: \"Kosambi introduced a new method into historical scholarship, essentially by application of modern mathematics. By statistical study of the weights of the coins, Kosambi was able to establish the amount of time that had elapsed while they were in circulation and so set them in order to give some idea of their respective ages.\"\n\nKosambi is an inspiration to many across the world, especially to Sanskrit philologists and Marxist scholars. He is one of the few along with James Mill and Vincent Smith, who has so deeply influenced the writing of Indian history. The Government of Goa has instituted the annual D.D. Kosambi Festival of Ideas since February 2008 to commemorate his birth centenary.\n\nHistorian Irfan Habib said, \"D. D. Kosambi and R.S. Sharma, together with Daniel Thorner, brought peasants into the study of Indian history for the first time.\"\n\nKosambi was an atheist.\n\nIndia Post issued a commemorative postage stamp on 31 July 2008 to honour Kosambi.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the papers listed below, Kosambi wrote two books in mathematics, the manuscripts of which have not been traced. The first was a book on path geometry that was submitted to Marston Morse in the mid-1940s and the second was on prime numbers, submitted shortly before his death. Unfortunately, neither book was published.

If male, the submissive partner may be called a \"sissy\". Feminization may occur without a partner as a component of solo masturbation and/or through interactions with an online community.\n\nFeminization is usually achieved via cross-dressing, where the male is dressed in female attire, ranging from just wearing female undergarments to being fully dressed in very feminine attire, including make-up, hairdress and nail polish. Some males take on tasks, behaviours and roles that are overtly feminine, and adopt female mannerisms and postures in tasks such as sitting, walking, and acting in a feminine manner. This emasculation may be coupled with punishments such as spanking or caning to gain cooperation and heighten submission of submissive male. Begging and pleading to stop the feminization may be part of the fantasy.\n\nCostumes are sometimes very domestic, suggestive of servitude or ageplay. The clothes may be from those of a traditional submissive female role, such as schoolgirl, secretary or a \"sissy\" maid, or others, such as a princess.\n\nForced feminization may also include the male receiving anal sex from a female using a strap-on dildo (sometimes called pegging), or penetration from a male, or group of males. Butt plugs and other anal-penetrative toys may also be used. Anal sex is used because it may be perceived to be feminine due to its traditional use on women in heterosexual relationships, or due to the passive and submissive nature of being penetrated, whereas the typical male role may be judged to be more active/dominant. Alternatively, the feminized male may be \"forced\" to perform oral sex on a male.\n\nAnother common practice in feminization is orgasm control, often through the use of a chastity belt. Also encountered in feminization are the following: erotic humiliation, bondage, petticoating, cuckoldry, leather, latex/pvc, infantilism, corporal punishment, etc.\n\nFeminization can also involve the conversion of a masculine name into a feminine name such as \"Stephen\" into \"Stephanie\", \"Joseph\" into \"Josephine\", or \"Daniel\" into \"Danielle\", as part of a constructed feminine persona. The submissive male may also be given feminine name that is different from his male name, referred to as \"a good girl\", or insulted and degraded with derogatory terms usually applied to women, such as \"slut\" or \"whore\".\n\nIn particular, a very common theme in feminization is \"sissy maid\" training. In a typical scenario, a male submissive, or sissy maid, is dressed in an often sexy and frilly maid uniform to help enhance the sexual thrill. The activities the sissy is made to perform range from mundane household tasks that a real maid would perform, to degrading tasks that invoke erotic humiliation. The \"sissy maid\" might also be instructed to perform sexual acts, however, these acts usually place the sissy in submissive or passive role.\n\n\n"}

Ideally, the hook is placed under the backbone. Gaffs are used when the weight of the fish exceeds the breaking point of the fishing line or the fishing pole. A gaff cannot be used if it is intended to release the fish unharmed after capture, unless the fish is skilfully gaffed in the lip, jaw, or lower gill using a thin gaff hook. \n\nA \"flying gaff\" is a specialized type of gaff used for securing and controlling very large fish. The hook part of the gaff (the head) detaches when sufficient force is used, somewhat like a harpoon's dart. The head is secured to the boat with a length of heavy rope or cable.\n"}

She grew up in the United States and studied at Radcliffe College. She bears the title baroness van Zuylen as wife of the Dutch baron since they got married in 1956 in Boston. Although they divorced in 1987, Gabrielle retained the name Van Zuylen.\n\nThe Van Zuylen couple bought the property Haras de Varaville in Normandy in 1964. The property consisted of a 17th-century stable and ruins of castles that burned down in 1937. They asked the American architect Peter Harden to build a new home in a modern style. The garden was created and designed by the British landscape architect Russell Page. Gabrielle van Zuylen later wrote the book \"The Gardens of Russell Page\", which is about his influence in landscape architecture. The Garden Writers Association of America named this work ‘best book on gardens’.\n\nShe became a specialist on the construction of gardens and published several works about the subject, especially about historic gardens. Her books appeared mostly in French and English and some were also published or translated in other languages. She was a member of the , Les Amateurs de Jardins and was a Chevalier of the Order of Agricultural Merit. She was also a gardener.\n\nAn interview between Van Zuylen and Éditions Gallimard took place on the occasion of the publication of (UK ed. – \"The Garden: Visions of Paradise\"), a heavily illustrated pocket book belonging to the collection \"Découvertes Gallimard\", which gives a concise history of the gardens, from antiquity to the modern day.\n\nVan Zuylen described that pleasure is the primary purpose of a garden, the gardens have always been called \"pleasure gardens\". There are also three main functions of the garden: the sacred – \"sacred enclosure\", the place blessed by gods; the power – the great gardens of Cyrus in Persia were wonderful paradises, but also masterful demonstrations of power; the domestic – the small, useful and popular city gardens.\n\nThe Romans were the first to have the aesthetic concern of nature, for them, the garden was the counterpart of architecture. In the Middle Ages, the garden also played a very important role, but in another sense: it was walled, protected from the outside. It was the secret garden, the garden of delights, allegory and theatre of love. The large classical gardens of the monarchy at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles, the gardens \"à la française\". In the eighteenth-century England, on the contrary, with the landscape gardens developed by the large landowners which are far from the court. The garden is truly a mirror, the counterpart of the social, political and artistic history of a civilisation.\n\nVan Zuylen explains in the book the origin and meaning of a number of historical terms:\nIt is natural using French sources in an English garden book, especially with regard to the medieval gardens, such as the frescoes from the Palais des Papes in Avignon and illustrations from the Bibliothèque nationale de France. But the author didn't forget to include some German sources, with being one of them.\n\nIt goes without saying that the glory of classical French garden culture and the dynasties of famous garden designers are discussed: Claude and Jacques Mollet (inventor of the parterres de broderie), André Le Nôtre (known for the gardens of Vaux-le-Vicomte, Versailles and the Jardin du Luxembourg).\n\nA less well known figure, Peter Joseph Lenné, a 19th-century Prussian gardener and landscape architect who worked in Potsdam and Berlin (Klein Glienicke, Pfaueninsel and Tiergarten).\n\nFollowing the Viennese Prater as the first public park, Napoleon III commissioned around 1850 the prefect of the Seine department, baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann to direct the renovation of Paris. Haussmann worked with the engineer Adolphe Alphand and the gardener Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, they changed the closed hunting forest Bois de Boulogne into a recreation park for the Parisian public. At the same time, Frederick Law Olmsted designed the Central Park in New York City.\n\nThen in the modern times, the beloved gardens of Gertrude Jekyll (Munstead Wood), Vita Sackville-West (Sissinghurst Castle Garden) and Major Lawrence Johnston (Hidcote Manor Garden). The current canon of the good garden: a formal structure in combination with an informal planting, especially the perennials.\n\nVan Zuylen closes her book with a reflection: \n\n"}

He was born in the Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Gomel Region of Belarus) to a Chassidic Chabad family. Already in his childhood, he was recognized for his particularly sharp and analytical mind. When Zeiltin turned 15, his father died and he decided to become a Hebrew teacher.\n\nHis exit from the world of the Yeshiva exposed him to the works of the scholars of the Enlightenment. He began studying in earnest the works of both Jewish philosophers (Maimonides, Gersonides, Spinoza etc.) and non-Jewish ones such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and others.\n\nDuring this period in his life, he began questioning his religious beliefs and eventually drifted toward secularism.\n\nZeitlin also grew close to the territorialist movement and lent his support to the \"Uganda proposal\". Zeitlin was of the opinion that it would be impossible to settle in Palestine without removing the half a million Palestinian Arabs and so the Zionist proposals would fail.\n\nHe was a practical territorialist and his writings took on more urgency after the notorious pogroms in Kishinev and Homel.\n\nAfter World War I, Zeitlin gradually drifted back toward tradition and began leading an Orthodox lifestyle. The reason(s) for this drastic change in his life is not completely clear but may have had something to do with the suffering of Jews during the war.\n\nAt the same time, Zeitlin remained independent and unconventional in his beliefs and actions. He did not, for instance, hesitate to eulogize his former friend the great writer and thinker Yosef Haim Brenner, who was an ardent secularist.\n\nWhen the Nazis began liquidating Polish Jewry in 1942, Zeitlin was 71 years old. He was killed by Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto while holding a book of the Zohar and wrapped in a prayer shawl and phylacteries. Most of his family was also killed; the only survivor was his elder son Aaron.\n\nHis sons, Aaron Zeitlin (1898-1973) and Elchanan Zeitlin (1900-1942), were also Yiddish writers.\n\n"}
{"id": "25084169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25084169", "title": "José Rizal", "text": "José Rizal\n\nJosé Protasio Rizal Mercado y Realonda, widely known as José Rizal\n(; June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896), was a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.\n\nHe was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of after the Philippine Revolution, inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to Philippine independence.\n\nHe is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero. He was the author of the novels \"Noli Me Tángere\" and \"El filibusterismo\", and a number of poems and essays.\n\nJosé Rizal was born in 1861 to Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos in the town of Calamba in Laguna province. He had nine sisters and one brother. His parents were leaseholders of a \"hacienda\" and an accompanying rice farm by the Dominicans. Both their families had adopted the additional surnames of \"Rizal\" and \"Realonda\" in 1849, after Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa decreed the adoption of Spanish surnames among the Filipinos for census purposes (though they already had Spanish names).\n\nLike many families in the Philippines, the Rizals were of mixed origin. José's patrilineal lineage could be traced back to Fujian in China through his father's ancestor Lam-Co, a Chinese merchant who immigrated to the Philippines in the late 17th century. Lam-Co traveled to Manila from Amoy, China, possibly to avoid the famine or plague in his home district, and more probably to escape the Manchu invasion. He finally decided to stay in the islands as a farmer. In 1697, to escape the bitter anti-Chinese prejudice that existed in the Philippines, he converted to Catholicism, changed his name to Domingo Mercado and married the daughter of Chinese friend Augustin Chin-co. On his mother's side, Rizal's ancestry included Chinese, Japanese and Tagalog blood. His mother's lineage can be traced to the affluent Florentina family of Chinese mestizo families originating in Baliuag, Bulacan. José Rizal also had Spanish ancestry. His grandfather was a half Spaniard engineer named Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo.\n\nFrom an early age, José showed a precocious intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, on the advice of his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as \"José Protasio Rizal\". Of this, he later wrote: \"My family never paid much attention [to our second surname Rizal], but now I had to use it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!\" This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason.\n\nDespite the name change, José, as \"Rizal\" soon distinguished himself in poetry writing contests, impressing his professors with his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages, and later, in writing essays that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the pre-colonial Philippine societies. Indeed, by 1891, the year he finished his \"El Filibusterismo\", this second surname had become so well known that, as he writes to another friend, \"All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution! Good! I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name...\"\n\nRizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Biñan, Laguna, before he was sent to Manila. As to his father's request, he took the entrance examination in Colegio de San Juan de Letran but he then enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and graduated as one of the nine students in his class declared \"sobresaliente\" or outstanding. He continued his education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila to obtain a land surveyor and assessor's degree, and at the same time at the University of Santo Tomas where he did take up a preparatory course in law. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the medical school of Santo Tomas specializing later in ophthalmology.\n\nWithout his parents' knowledge and consent, but secretly supported by his brother Paciano, he traveled alone to Madrid, Spain in May 1882 and studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid where he earned the degree, \"Licentiate in Medicine\". He also attended medical lectures at the University of Paris and the University of Heidelberg. In Berlin, he was inducted as a member of the Berlin Ethnological Society and the Berlin Anthropological Society under the patronage of the famous pathologist Rudolf Virchow. Following custom, he delivered an address in German in April 1887 before the Anthropological Society on the orthography and structure of the Tagalog language. He left Heidelberg a poem, \"A las flores del Heidelberg\", which was both an evocation and a prayer for the welfare of his native land and the unification of common values between East and West.\n\nAt Heidelberg, the 25-year-old Rizal, completed in 1887 his eye specialization under the renowned professor, Otto Becker. There he used the newly invented ophthalmoscope (invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to later operate on his own mother's eye. From Heidelberg, Rizal wrote his parents: \"I spend half of the day in the study of German and the other half, in the diseases of the eye. Twice a week, I go to the bierbrauerie, or beerhall, to speak German with my student friends.\" He lived in a Karlstraße boarding house then moved to Ludwigsplatz. There, he met Reverend Karl Ullmer and stayed with them in Wilhelmsfeld, where he wrote the last few chapters of \"Noli Me Tángere\".\n\nRizal was a polymath, skilled in both science and the arts. He painted, sketched, and made sculptures and woodcarving. He was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most famous works were his two novels, \"Noli Me Tángere\" and its sequel, \"El filibusterismo\". These social commentaries during the Spanish colonization of the country formed the nucleus of literature that inspired peaceful reformists and armed revolutionaries alike. Rizal was also a polyglot, conversant in twenty-two languages.\n\nRizal's multifacetedness was described by his German friend, Dr. Adolf Bernhard Meyer, as \"stupendous.\" Documented studies show him to be a polymath with the ability to master various skills and subjects. He was an ophthalmologist, sculptor, painter, educator, farmer, historian, playwright and journalist. Besides poetry and creative writing, he dabbled, with varying degrees of expertise, in architecture, cartography, economics, ethnology, anthropology, sociology, dramatics, martial arts, fencing and pistol shooting. He was also a Freemason, joining Acacia Lodge No. 9 during his time in Spain and becoming a Master Mason in 1884.\n\nJosé Rizal's life is one of the most documented of 19th century Filipinos due to the vast and extensive records written by and about him. Almost everything in his short life is recorded somewhere, being himself a regular diarist and prolific letter writer, much of the material having survived. His biographers, however, have faced difficulty in translating his writings because of Rizal's habit of switching from one language to another.\n\nThey drew largely from his travel diaries with their insights of a young Asian encountering the West for the first time. They included his later trips, home and back again to Europe through Japan and the United States, and, finally, through his self-imposed exile in Hong Kong.\n\nShortly after he graduated from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University), Rizal (who was then 16 years old) and a friend, Mariano Katigbak, came to visit Rizal's maternal grandmother in Tondo, Manila. Mariano brought along his sister, Segunda Katigbak, a 14-year-old Batangueña from Lipa, Batangas. It was the first time they met and Rizal described Segunda as \"rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at times and languid at others, rosy–cheeked, with an enchanting and provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of a sylph; her entire self diffused a mysterious charm.\" His grandmother's guests were mostly college students and they knew that Rizal had skills in painting. They suggested that Rizal should make a portrait of Segunda. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil sketch of her. Unfortunately for him, Katigbak was engaged to Manuel Luz.\n\nFrom December 1891 to June 1892, Rizal lived with his family in Number 2 of Rednaxela Terrace, Mid-levels, Hong Kong Island. Rizal used 5 D'Aguilar Street, Central district, Hong Kong Island, as his ophthalmologist clinic from 2 pm to 6 pm. This period of his life included his recorded affections of which nine were identified. They were Gertrude Beckett of Chalcot Crescent, Primrose Hill, Camden, London, wealthy and high-minded Nelly Boustead of the English and Iberian merchant family, last descendant of a noble Japanese family Seiko Usui (affectionately called O-Sei-san), his earlier friendship with Segunda Katigbak, Leonor Valenzuela, and eight-year romantic relationship with a distant cousin, Leonor Rivera (popularly thought to be the inspiration for the character of María Clara in \"Noli me tangere\").\n\nIn one recorded fall from grace he succumbed to the temptation of a 'lady of the camellias'. The writer, Maximo Viola, a friend of Rizal's, was alluding to Dumas's 1848 novel, \"La dame aux camelias\", about a man who fell in love with a courtesan. While the affair was on record, there was no account in Viola's letter whether it was more than one-night and if it was more a business transaction than an amorous affair.\n\nLeonor Rivera is thought to be the inspiration for the character of María Clara in \"Noli Me Tángere\" and \"El Filibusterismo\". Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 16 years of age. Their correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell.\n\nThe correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept him focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera's mother did not favor Rizal. A letter from Mariano Katigbak dated June 27, 1884, referred to Rivera as Rizal's \"betrothed\". Katigbak described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal's departure, frequently sick because of insomnia.\n\nWhen Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera and her family had moved back to Dagupan, Pangasinan. Rizal was forbidden by his father Francisco Mercado to see Rivera in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger because at the time Rizal was already labeled by the \"criollo\" elite as a \"filibustero\" or subversive because of his novel \"Noli Me Tángere\". Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of Rivera's uncomplaining fidelity. Rizal asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure from the Philippines. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, although Rizal kept sending letters to Rivera. The reason for Rivera's year of silence was the connivance between Rivera's mother and the Englishman named Henry Kipping, a railway engineer who fell in love with Rivera and was favored by Rivera's mother. The news of Leonor Rivera's marriage to Kipping devastated Rizal.\n\nHis European friends kept almost everything he gave them, including doodlings on pieces of paper. In the home of a Spanish liberal, Pedro Ortiga y Pérez, he left an impression that was to be remembered by his daughter, Consuelo. In her diary, she wrote of a day Rizal spent there and regaled them with his wit, social graces, and sleight-of-hand tricks. In London, during his research on Antonio de Morga's writings, he became a regular guest in the home of Reinhold Rost of the British Museum who referred to him as \"a gem of a man.\" The family of Karl Ullmer, pastor of , and the Blumentritts saved even buttonholes and napkins with sketches and notes. They were ultimately bequeathed to the Rizal family to form a treasure trove of memorabilia.\n\nIn February 1895, Rizal, 33, met Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman from Hong Kong, when she accompanied her blind adoptive father, George Taufer, to have his eyes checked by Rizal. After frequent visits, Rizal and Bracken fell in love with each other. They applied to marry but, because of Rizal's reputation from his writings and political stance, the local priest Father Obach would only hold the ceremony if Rizal could get permission from the Bishop of Cebu. He was unable to obtain an ecclesiastical marriage because he would not return to Catholicism.\n\nAfter accompanying her father to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal's family in Manila. His mother suggested a civil marriage, which she believed to be a lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal's conscience than making any sort of political retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop. Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours after Josephine suffered a miscarriage; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.\n\nIn 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of Antonio de Morga's \"Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas\" (1609). He lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna, who had a niece Suzanna (\"Thil\"), age 16. Historian Gregorio F. Zaide states that Rizal had \"his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies.\" Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the 17-year-old niece, Suzanna Thil, as his other liaisons were all with young women. He found records clarifying their names and ages.\n\nRizal's Brussels stay was short-lived; he moved to Madrid, giving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. She wrote to him in French: \"After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…\" In 2007, Slachmuylders' group arranged for an historical marker honoring Rizal to be placed at the house.\n\nThe content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, \"Noli Me Tángere\", published in Berlin in 1887, and \"El Filibusterismo\", published in Ghent in 1891. For the latter, he used funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines.\n\nBlumentritt was the grandson of the Imperial Treasurer at Vienna in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and a staunch defender of the Catholic faith. This did not dissuade him from writing the preface of \"El filibusterismo\" after he had translated \"Noli Me Tángere\" into German. As Blumentritt had warned, these books resulted in Rizal's being prosecuted as the inciter of revolution. He was eventually tried by the military, convicted and executed. Teaching the natives where they stood brought about an adverse reaction, as the Philippine Revolution of 1896 took off virulently thereafter.\n\nAs leader of the reform movement of Filipino students in Spain, Rizal contributed essays, allegories, poems, and editorials to the Spanish newspaper \"La Solidaridad\" in Barcelona (in this case Rizal used a pen name, \"Dimasalang\", \"Laong Laan\" and \"May Pagasa\"). The core of his writings centers on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom; specifically, rights for the Filipino people. He shared the same sentiments with members of the movement: that the Philippines is battling, in Rizal's own words, \"a double-faced Goliath\"—corrupt friars and bad government. His commentaries reiterate the following agenda:\n\n\nThe colonial authorities in the Philippines did not favor these reforms. Such Spanish intellectuals as Morayta, Unamuno, Pi y Margall, and others did endorse them.\n\nWenceslao Retana, a political commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in \"La Epoca\", a newspaper in Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison the wife of a cousin, but she said she was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16 km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down.\n\nUpon reading the article, Rizal sent a representative to challenge Retana to a duel. Retana published a public apology and later became one of Rizal's biggest admirers, writing Rizal's most important biography, \"Vida y Escritos del José Rizal\".\n\nUpon his return to Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called \"La Liga Filipina\". The league advocated these moderate social reforms through legal means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that time, he had already been declared an enemy of the state by the Spanish authorities because of the publication of his novel.\n\nRizal was implicated in the activities of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao. There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. \"Abaca\", then the vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial.\n\nThe boys' school, which taught in Spanish, and included English as a foreign language (considered a prescient if unusual option then) was conceived by Rizal and antedated Gordonstoun with its aims of inculcating resourcefulness and self-sufficiency in young men. They would later enjoy successful lives as farmers and honest government officials. One, a Muslim, became a datu, and another, José Aseniero, who was with Rizal throughout the life of the school, became Governor of Zamboanga.\n\nIn Dapitan, the Jesuits mounted a great effort to secure his return to the fold led by Fray Francisco de Paula Sánchez, his former professor, who failed in his mission. The task was resumed by Fray , a prominent member of the Order. In a letter to Pastells, Rizal sails close to the deism familiar to us today.\nWe are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, it would be to doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: \"Plus Supra!\"...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.\nHis best friend, professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, kept him in touch with European friends and fellow-scientists who wrote a stream of letters which arrived in Dutch, French, German and English and which baffled the censors, delaying their transmittal. Those four years of his exile coincided with the development of the Philippine Revolution from inception and to its final breakout, which, from the viewpoint of the court which was to try him, suggested his complicity in it. He condemned the uprising, although all the members of the \"Katipunan\" had made him their honorary president and had used his name as a cry for war, unity, and liberty.\n\nHe is known to making the resolution of bearing personal sacrifice instead of the incoming revolution, believing that a peaceful stand is the best way to avoid further suffering in the country and loss of Filipino lives. In Rizal's own words, \"I consider myself happy for being able to suffer a little for a cause which I believe to be sacred [...]. I believe further that in any undertaking, the more one suffers for it, the surer its success. If this be fanaticism may God pardon me, but my poor judgment does not see it as such.\"\n\nIn Dapitan, Rizal wrote \"Haec Est Sibylla Cumana\", a parlor-game for his students, with questions and answers for which a wooden top was used. In 2004, Jean Paul Verstraeten traced this book and the wooden top, as well as Rizal's personal watch, spoon and salter.\n\nBy 1896, the rebellion fomented by the \"Katipunan\", a militant secret society, had become a full-blown revolution, proving to be a nationwide uprising. Rizal had earlier volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by Governor-General Ramón Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August 1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco.\nRizal was arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in Barcelona on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to Manila to stand trial as he was implicated in the revolution through his association with members of the \"Katipunan\". During the entire passage, he was unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had many opportunities to escape but refused to do so.\n\nWhile imprisoned in Fort Santiago, he issued a manifesto disavowing the current revolution in its present state and declaring that the education of Filipinos and their achievement of a national identity were prerequisites to freedom.\n\nRizal was tried before a court-martial for rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy, was convicted on all three charges, and sentenced to death. Blanco, who was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars, led by then Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda, had 'intercalated' Camilo de Polavieja in his stead, as the new Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines after pressuring Queen-Regent Maria Cristina of Spain, thus sealing Rizal's fate.\n\nMoments before his execution on December 30, 1896, by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders. The Spanish Army Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to silence when they began raising \"vivas\" with the highly partisan crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His last words were those of Jesus Christ: \"consummatum est\", – \"it is finished.\"\n\nHe was secretly buried in Pacò Cemetery in Manila with no identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely spot, there never having any ground burials, she made a gift to the caretaker to mark the site \"RPJ\", Rizal's initials in reverse.\n\nHis undated poem \"Mi último adiós\", believed to have been written a few days before his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests. During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, \"\"There is something inside it\", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, \"Look in my shoes\"\", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed he had been uncoffined, his burial not on sanctified ground granted the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. And now he is buried in Rizal Monument in Manila.\n\nIn his letter to his family he wrote: \"\"Treat our aged parents as you would wish to be treated...Love them greatly in memory of me...December 30, 1896.\" He gave his family instructions for his burial: \"Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries\".\"\n\nIn his final letter, to Blumentritt – \"Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience.\" Rizal is believed to be the first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown Litoměřice (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.\n\nRizal wrote mostly in Spanish, the lingua franca of the Spanish Philippines, though some of his letters (for example \"Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga Malolos\") were written in Tagalog. His works have since been translated into a number of languages including Tagalog and English.\n\n\n\n\nRizal also tried his hand at painting and sculpture. His most famous sculptural work was \"The Triumph of Science over Death\", a clay sculpture of a naked young woman with overflowing hair, standing on a skull while bearing a torch held high. The woman symbolized the ignorance of humankind during the Dark Ages, while the torch she bore symbolized the enlightenment science brings over the whole world. He sent the sculpture as a gift to his dear friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, together with another one named \"The Triumph of Death over Life\".\n\nThe woman is shown trampling the skull, a symbol of death, to signify the victory the humankind achieved by conquering the bane of death through their scientific advancements. The original sculpture is now displayed at the Rizal Shrine Museum at Fort Santiago in Intramuros, Manila. A large replica, made of concrete, stands in front of Fernando Calderón Hall, the building which houses the College of Medicine of the University of the Philippines Manila along Pedro Gil Street in Ermita, Manila.\n\nSeveral historians report that Rizal retracted his anti-Catholic ideas through a document which stated: \"I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct have been contrary to my character as a son of the Catholic Church.\" However, there are doubts of its authenticity given that there is no certificate of Rizal's Catholic marriage to Josephine Bracken. Also there is an allegation that the retraction document was a forgery.\n\nAfter analyzing six major documents of Rizal, Ricardo Pascual concluded that the retraction document, said to have been discovered in 1935, was not in Rizal's handwriting. Senator Rafael Palma, a former President of the University of the Philippines and a prominent Mason, argued that a retraction is not in keeping with Rizal's character and mature beliefs. He called the retraction story a \"pious fraud.\" Others who deny the retraction are Frank Laubach, a Protestant minister; Austin Coates, a British writer; and Ricardo Manapat, director of the National Archives.\n\nThose who affirm the authenticity of Rizal's retraction are prominent Philippine historians such as Nick Joaquin, Nicolas Zafra of UP León María Guerrero III, Gregorio Zaide, Guillermo Gómez Rivera, Ambeth Ocampo, John Schumacher, Antonio Molina, Paul Dumol and Austin Craig. They take the retraction document as authentic, having been judged as such by a foremost expert on the writings of Rizal, Teodoro Kalaw (a 33rd degree Mason) and \"handwriting experts...known and recognized in our courts of justice\", H. Otley Beyer and Dr. José I. Del Rosario, both of UP.\n\nHistorians also refer to 11 eyewitnesses when Rizal wrote his retraction, signed a Catholic prayer book, and recited Catholic prayers, and the multitude who saw him kiss the crucifix before his execution. A great grand nephew of Rizal, Fr. Marciano Guzman, cites that Rizal's 4 confessions were certified by 5 eyewitnesses, 10 qualified witnesses, 7 newspapers, and 12 historians and writers including Aglipayan bishops, Masons and anti-clericals. One witness was the head of the Spanish Supreme Court at the time of his notarized declaration and was highly esteemed by Rizal for his integrity.\n\nBecause of what he sees as the strength these direct evidence have in the light of the historical method, in contrast with merely circumstantial evidence, UP professor emeritus of history Nicolas Zafra called the retraction \"a plain unadorned fact of history.\" Guzmán attributes the denial of retraction to \"the blatant disbelief and stubbornness\" of some Masons. To explain the retraction Guzman said that the factors are the long discussion and debate which appealed to reason and logic that he had with Fr. Balaguer, the visits of his mentors and friends from the Ateneo, and the grace of God due the numerous prayers of religious communities.\n\nSupporters see in the retraction Rizal's \"moral courage...to recognize his mistakes,\" his reversion to the \"true faith\", and thus his \"unfading glory,\" and a return to the \"ideals of his fathers\" which \"did not diminish his stature as a great patriot; on the contrary, it increased that stature to greatness.\" On the other hand, senator Jose Diokno stated, \"Surely whether Rizal died as a Catholic or an apostate adds or detracts nothing from his greatness as a Filipino... Catholic or Mason, Rizal is still Rizal – the hero who courted death 'to prove to those who deny our patriotism that we know how to die for our duty and our beliefs'.\"\n\nThe poem is more aptly titled, \"Adiós, Patria Adorada\" (literally \"Farewell, Beloved Fatherland\"), by virtue of logic and literary tradition, the words coming from the first line of the poem itself. It first appeared in print not in Manila but in Hong Kong in 1897, when a copy of the poem and an accompanying photograph came to J. P. Braga who decided to publish it in a monthly journal he edited. There was a delay when Braga, who greatly admired Rizal, wanted a good job of the photograph and sent it to be engraved in London, a process taking well over two months. It finally appeared under 'Mi último pensamiento,' a title he supplied and by which it was known for a few years. Thus, when the Jesuit Balaguer's anonymous account of the retraction and the marriage to Josephine was appearing in Barcelona, no word of the poem's existence reached him in time to revise what he had written. His account was too elaborate that Rizal would have had no time to write \"Adiós.\"\n\nSix years after his death, when the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 was being debated in the United States Congress, Representative Henry Cooper of Wisconsin rendered an English translation of Rizal's valedictory poem capped by the peroration, \"Under what clime or what skies has tyranny claimed a nobler victim?\" Subsequently, the US Congress passed the bill into law which is now known as the Philippine Organic Act of 1902.\n\nThis was a major breakthrough for a US Congress that had yet to grant equal rights to African Americans guaranteed to them in the US Constitution and the Chinese Exclusion Act was still in effect. It created the Philippine legislature, appointed two Filipino delegates to the US Congress, extended the US Bill of Rights to Filipinos, and laid the foundation for an autonomous government. The colony was on its way to independence. The Americans, however, would not sign the bill into law until 1916 and did not recognize Philippine Independence until the Treaty of Manila in 1946—fifty years after Rizal's death.This same poem which has inspired independence activists across the region and beyond was recited (in its Indonesian translation by Rosihan Anwar) by Indonesian soldiers of independence before going into battle.\n\nJosephine Bracken, whom Rizal addressed as his wife on his last day, promptly joined the revolutionary forces in Cavite province, making her way through thicket and mud across enemy lines, and helped reloading spent cartridges at the arsenal in Imus under the revolutionary General Pantaleón García. Imus came under threat of recapture that the operation was moved, with Bracken, to Maragondon, the mountain redoubt in Cavite.\n\nShe witnessed the Tejeros Convention prior to returning to Manila and was summoned by the Governor-General, but owing to her stepfather's American citizenship she could not be forcibly deported. She left voluntarily returning to Hong Kong. She later married another Filipino, Vicente Abad, a mestizo acting as agent for the Tabacalera firm in the Philippines. She died of tuberculosis in Hong Kong in March 15, 1902, and was buried at the Happy Valley Cemetery. She was immortalized by Rizal in the last stanza of Mi Ultimo Adios: \"Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, my joy...\".\n\nPolavieja faced condemnation by his countrymen after his return to Spain. While visiting Girona, in Catalonia, circulars were distributed among the crowd bearing Rizal's last verses, his portrait, and the charge that Polavieja was responsible for the loss of the Philippines to Spain. Ramon Blanco later presented his sash and sword to the Rizal family as an apology.\n\nAttempts to debunk legends surrounding Rizal, and the tug of war between free thinker and Catholic, have kept his legacy controversial.\n\nThe confusion over Rizal's real stance on the Philippine Revolution leads to the sometimes bitter question of his ranking as the nation's premier hero. But then again, according to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, there is no Filipino historical figure, including Rizal, that was officially declared as national hero through law or executive order. Although, there were laws and proclamations honoring Filipino heroes.\n\nSome suggest that Jose Rizal was made a legislated national hero by the American forces occupying Philippines. In 1901, the American Governor General William Howard Taft suggested that the U.S. sponsored Philippine Commission name Rizal a national hero for Filipinos. Jose Rizal was an ideal candidate, favourable to the American occupiers since he was dead, and non-violent, a favourable quality which, if emulated by Filipinos, would not threaten the American rule or change the status quo of the occupiers of Philippine islands. Rizal did not advocate independence for Philippines either. Subsequently, the US-sponsored commission passed Act No. 346 which set the anniversary of Rizal’s death as a “day of observance.”\n\nRenato Constantino writes Rizal is a \"United States-sponsored hero\" who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the American colonial period of the Philippines – after Aguinaldo lost the Philippine–American War. The United States promoted Rizal, who represented peaceful political advocacy (in fact, repudiation of violent means in general) instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule. Rizal was selected over Andrés Bonifacio who was viewed \"too radical\" and Apolinario Mabini who was considered \"unregenerate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, numerous sources quote that it was General Emilio Aguinaldo, and not the second Philippine Commission, who first recognized December 30 as \"national day of mourning in memory of Rizal and other victims of Spanish tyranny. As per them, the first celebration of Rizal Day was held in Manila on December 30, 1898, under the sponsorship of the Club Filipino.\n\nThe veracity of both claims seems to be justified and hence difficult to ascertain. However, most historians agree that a majority of Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime, as he was a member of the richer elite classes (he was born in an affluent family, had lived abroad for nearly as long as he had lived in the Philippines) and wrote primarily in an elite language (at that time, Tagalog and Cebuano were the languages of the masses) about ideals as lofty as freedom (the masses were more concerned about day to day issues like earning money and making a living, something which has not changed much today).\n\nTeodoro Agoncillo opines that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not \"the leader of its liberation forces\". He gives the opinion that Andrés Bonifacio not replace Rizal as national hero, like some have suggested, but that be honored alongside him.\n\nConstantino's analysis has been criticised for its polemicism and inaccuracies regarding Rizal. The historian Rafael Palma, contends that the revolution of Bonifacio is a consequence wrought by the writings of Rizal and that although the Bonifacio's revolver produced an immediate outcome, the pen of Rizal generated a more lasting achievement.\n\nOthers present him as a man of contradictions. Miguel de Unamuno in \"Rizal: the Tagalog Hamlet\", said of him, “a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it. He pivots between fear and hope, between faith and despair.” His critics assert this character flaw is translated into his two novels where he opposes violence in \"Noli\" and appears to advocate it in \"Fili\", contrasting Ibarra's idealism to Simoun's cynicism. His defenders insist this ambivalence is trounced when Simoun is struck down in the sequel's final chapters, reaffirming the author's resolute stance, \"Pure and spotless must the victim be if the sacrifice is to be acceptable.\"\n\nMany thinkers tend to find the characters of María Clara and Ibarra (Noli Me Tángere) poor role models, María Clara being too frail, and young Ibarra being too accepting of circumstances, rather than being courageous and bold.\n\nIn \"El Filibusterismo\", Rizal had Father Florentino say: “...our liberty will (not) be secured at the sword's point...we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it. And when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn.” Rizal's attitude to the Philippine Revolution is also debated, not only based on his own writings, but also due to the varying eyewitness accounts of Pío Valenzuela, a doctor who in 1895 had consulted Rizal in Dapitan on behalf of Bonifacio and the \"Katipunan\".\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Valenzuela surrendered to the Spanish authorities and testified in military court that Rizal had strongly condemned an armed struggle for independence when Valenzuela asked for his support. Rizal had even refused him entry to his house. Bonifacio, in turn, had openly denounced him as a coward for his refusal.\n\nBut years later, Valenzuela testified that Rizal had been favorable to an uprising as long as the Filipinos were well-prepared, and well-supplied with arms. Rizal had suggested that the \"Katipunan\" get wealthy and influential Filipino members of society on their side, or at least ensure they would stay neutral. Rizal had even suggested his friend Antonio Luna to lead the revolutionary forces since he had studied military science. In the event that the \"Katipunan\" was discovered prematurely, they should fight rather than allow themselves to be killed. Valenzuela said to historian Teodoro Agoncillo that he had lied to the Spanish military authorities about Rizal's true stance toward a revolution in an attempt to exculpate him.\n\nBefore his execution, Rizal wrote a proclamation \"denouncing\" the revolution. But as noted by historian Floro Quibuyen, his final poem \"Mi ultimo adios\" contains a stanza which equates his coming execution and the rebels then dying in battle as fundamentally the same, as both are dying for their country.\n\nRizal was a contemporary of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means rather than by violent revolution. Coinciding with the appearance of those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern nationhood as a practical possibility in Asia. In the \"Noli\" he stated that if European civilization had nothing better to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.\n\nThough popularly mentioned, especially on blogs, there is no evidence to suggest that Gandhi or Nehru may have corresponded with Rizal, neither have they mentioned him in any of their memoirs or letters. But it was documented by Rizal's biographer, Austin Coates who interviewed Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi that Rizal was mentioned, specifically in Nehru's prison letters to his daughter Indira.\n\nAs a political figure, José Rizal was the founder of \"La Liga Filipina\", a civic organization that subsequently gave birth to the \"Katipunan\" led by Andrés Bonifacio, a secret society which would start the Philippine Revolution against Spain that eventually laid the foundation of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. He was a proponent of achieving Philippine self-government peacefully through institutional reform rather than through violent revolution, and would only support \"violent means\" as a last resort. Rizal believed that the only justification for national liberation and self-government was the restoration of the dignity of the people, saying \"Why independence, if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow?\" However, through careful examination of his works and statements, including \"Mi Ultimo Adios\", Rizal reveals himself as a revolutionary. His image as the Tagalog Christ also intensified early reverence to him.\n\nRizal, through his reading of Morga and other western historians, knew of the genial image of Spain's early relations with his people. In his writings, he showed the disparity between the early colonialists and those of his day, with the latter's injustices giving rise to Gomburza and the Philippine Revolution of 1896.\nThe English biographer, Austin Coates, and writer, Benedict Anderson, believe that Rizal gave the Philippine revolution a genuinely national character; and that Rizal's patriotism and his standing as one of Asia's first intellectuals have inspired others of the importance of a national identity to nation-building.\n\nThe Belgian researcher Jean Paul \"JP\" Verstraeten authored several books about Jose Rizal: \"Rizal in Belgium and France\", \"Jose Rizal's Europe\", \"Growing up like Rizal\" (published by the National Historical Institute and in teacher's programs all over the Philippines), \"Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal\" and Jose Rizal \"Pearl of Unselfishness\". He received an award from the president of the Philippines \"in recognition of his unwavering support and commitment to promote the health and education of disadvantaged Filipinos, and his invaluable contribution to engender the teachings and ideals of Dr. Jose Rizal in the Philippines and in Europe\". \nOne of the greatest researchers about Rizal nowadays is Lucien Spittael.\n\nSeveral titles were bestowed on him: \"the First Filipino\", \"Greatest Man of the Brown Race\", among others. The Order of the Knights of Rizal, a civic and patriotic organization, boasts of dozens of chapters all over the globe. There are some remote-area religious sects who venerate Rizal as a Folk saint collectively known as the Rizalista religious movements, who claim him as a sublimation of Christ. In September 1903, he was canonised as a saint in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, however it was revoked in the 1950s.\n\nJosé Rizal was imprisoned at Fort Santiago and soon after he was banished at Dapitan where he plunged himself into studying of nature. He then able to collect a number of species of various classes: insects, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, shells, snakes and plants.\n\nRizal sent many specimens of animals, insects, and plants for identification to the (Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden), Dresden Museum of Ethnology. It was not in his interest to receive any monetary payment; all he wanted were scientific books, magazines and surgical instruments which he needed and used in Dapitan.\n\nDuring his exile, Rizal also secretly sent several specimens of flying dragons to Europe. He believed that they were a new species. The German zoologist Benno Wandolleck named them \"Draco rizali\" after Rizal. However, it has since been discovered that the species had already been described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1885 as \"Draco guentheri\".\n\nThere are three species named after Rizal:\n\n\n\n\nThe cinematic depiction of Rizal's literary works won two film industry awards more than a century after his birth. In the 10th FAMAS Awards, he was honored in the Best Story category for Gerardo de León's adaptation of his book \"Noli Me Tángere\". The recognition was repeated the following year with his movie version of \"El Filibusterismo\", making him the only person to win back-to-back FAMAS Awards posthumously.\n\nBoth novels were translated into opera by the composer-librettist Felipe Padilla de León: \"Noli me tangere\" in 1957 and \"El filibusterismo\" in 1970; and his 1939 overture, \"Mariang Makiling\", was inspired by Rizal's tale of the same name.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n"}

His writings include over 120 short stories, 10 novellas, 5 novels, 3 historical romances, editorial and political writings and hundreds of film and music reviews.\n\nKrishnamurthy's father was Ramaswamy Aiyar, a poor accountant in Puttamangalam village in the old Tanjore district of erstwhile Madras Presidency. He began his primary education in his village school and later attended Municipal High School in Mayavaram but quit in 1921, just short of completion of his Senior School Leaving Certificate, in response to Mahatma Gandhi's 1921 call for non-co-operation joining the Indian National Congress instead.\n\nIn 1923 he joined as a sub-editor at \"Navashakti\", a Tamil periodical edited by Tamil scholar and freedom fighter Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram, popularly known as \"Thiru Vi. Ka\". Krishnamurthy's first book was published in 1927. After leaving \"Navashakti\" in 1928, Krishnamurthy stayed with C. Rajagopalachari at the Gandhi ashram in Tiruchengode in Salem district and helped him edit \"Vimochanam\", a Tamil journal devoted to propagating prohibition. In 1931, he was again imprisoned for six months. Next year Krishnamurthy joined \"Ananda Vikatan\", a humour weekly edited and published by S. S. Vasan.\n\nKrishnamurthy's witty, incisive comments on politics, literature, music and other forms of art were looked forward to with unceasing interest by readers. He wrote under the pen names of \"Kalki\", \"Ra. Ki\", \"Tamil Theni\", \"Karnatakam\" and so on. Vikatan published many of his short stories and novels (as serials). In 1941, he left \"Ananda Vikatan\", and rejoined the freedom struggle and courted arrest.\n\nUpon his release after three months he and Sadasivam started the magazine \"Kalki\". He was its editor until his death on 5 December 1954. The success that Krishnamurthy attained in the realm of historical fiction is phenomenal. At a time when the literacy level was low and when the English-educated Tamils looked down on writings in Tamil, Kalki's circulation touched 71,000 copies – the largest for any weekly in the county then – when it serialised his historical novels. \"Semmalar\", the monthly organ of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers Association, brought out a special number to commemorate Kalki's birth centenary. Kalki wrote the script and some lyrics for Meera, a film starring M.S. Subbulakshmi.\n\nKalki's contribution to the cause of Tamil music is also noteworthy. He spearheaded a movement that wanted Carnatic musicians to include more Tamil songs in their concerts and composed a number of songs. His Tamil translation of Gandhi's autobiography, \"My Experiments with Truth\", was published as \"Satya Sothanai\".\n\nKalki considered \"Alai Osai\", which was serialised in Kalki in 1948–49 and published as a book in 1963, as his best. The novel won him the Sahitya Akademi Award posthumously in 1956. Set at the time of Indian Independence Struggle, the book revolves around how the life of people living at that time and place are influenced by various fluctuations in Indian Society.\n\nHis other social novels include \"Thyaga Bhoomi\" (The land of sacrifice) and \"Kalvanin Kadali\" (Bandit's sweetheart), both of which have been filmed. \"Thyaga Bhoomi\", which has the Salt Satyagraha as its backdrop, dealt with women's rights and untouchability. It was serialised in \"Ananda Vikatan\", and was being filmed at the same time. Stills from the filming were used as illustration. After a successful run for six weeks, the film, directed by veteran K. Subramanyam, was banned by the colonial Government on the grounds that it indirectly aroused the people to fight for freedom. Almost all of Kalki's novels appeared first in the serial form and only then in the book form.\n\n\"Parthiban Kanavu\" and \"Sivagamiyin Sapatham\" give a picture of the great Pallava Age of the seventh century A.D., whereas \"Ponniyin Selvan\" paints the age of the glorious Cholas. Both periods are a mixture of many aspects of the history of Tamil Nadu such as that of religions, literature, art and architecture and also of administration.\n\n\nKalki was also a film and music critic who wrote under the pseudonym \"Karnatakam\". He also penned many lyrics for many songs, most of which were adapted into Carnatic Music.\n\nKalki died in Chennai on 5 December 1954 aged 55 years from tuberculosis. Kalki magazine's special issue dated 5 December 1954 (The day he died) for Annai Sarada Devi was his last editorial work. That magazine shared the information that his health was improving prior to his demise.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended elementary school in the town of Višegrad (Вишеград), and has graduated from high-school in Sarajevo. Baruh's academic studies and the PhD - \"Der Lautstand des Judenspanischen in Bosnien\" (The Sound System of the Judeo-Spanish in Bosnia) were at Vienna University. He worked as a teacher in the First Sarajevan Gymnasium/High-school, and was the only Balkan Peninsula scholarship recipient from the Spanish Government for the post-doctoral studies in the Spanish Center for Historic Studies in Madrid (1928/9). For a long period of years he worked together with several Yugoslav and European magazines in the field of linguistics and literature, such as: \"Srpski književni glasnik\" and \"Misao\", both from Belgrade, \"Revista de filología Española\" (Madrid)... He collaborated with the Institute for Balkan Studies and the University of Belgrade and the Royal Spanish Academy.

Koti is spoken on Koti Island and is also the major language of Angoche, the capital of the district with the same name in the province of Nampula.\n\nIn terms of genetic classification, Koti is generally considered to belong to the Makhuwa group (P.30 in Guthrie's classification). A large portion of its vocabulary however derives from a past variety of Swahili, today the lingua franca of much of East Africa's coast. This Swahili influence is usually attributed to traders from Kilwa or elsewhere on the Zanzibar Coast, who in the fifteenth century settled at Angoche. Arends et al. suggest it might turn out to be a Makhua–Swahili mixed language.\n\nThe place name \"Koti\" refers primarily to the island. An older form is ; this form with the class 2 nominal prefix \"a\" for 'people' gave rise to the Portuguese name \"Angoche\". The much older local African name of Angoche, still in use, is \"Parápaátho\". Angoche was probably established in the fifteenth century by dissidents from Kilwa. In the centuries that followed, it flourished as a part of the Indian Ocean trading network.\n\nAbout nine Koti villages are found in the coastal areas of Koti island; these are usually accessed by boat. Much of the coastline is covered by mangrove woods (\"khava\"). On the mainland, there are about five other Koti villages, all in the vicinity of Angoche. The main economic activity of men in the villages is fishing; the catch is sold on the markets of Angoche. People keep chickens and some goats.\n\nIn Makhuwa, the dominant regional language of much of northern Mozambique, the Koti are called \"Maka\", just like other coastal Muslim communities that were part of the Indian Ocean trading network. Most Koti have at least some knowledge of Makhuwa or one of its neighbouring dialects; this extensive bilinguality has had considerable influence on the Koti language in recent years.\n\nKoti has five vowels. The open vowels and are normally written \"e\" and \"o\". The high vowels \"i\" and \"u\" do not occur word-initially. There is a restricted form of vowel harmony in verbal bases which causes /u/ in verbal extensions to be rendered as [o] after another /o/; thus, the separative extensions \"-ul-\" and \"-uw-\" appear as \"-ol-\" and \"-ow-\" after the vowel \"o\". Furthermore, a distributional analysis shows that /o/ tends to occur mainly after another /o/, and only rarely after the other vowels.\n\nVowel length is contrastive in Koti, except in word-final position. Long vowels are best treated as two tone-bearing units. Several vowel coalescense processes do take place, within words as well as across morpheme boundaries: \"mathápá mawíxí apa\" → \"mathápá mawíx'áapa\" 'these green leaves' (the apostrophe shows the location of coalescence). In case of word-final 'i' it is sometimes accompanied with glide formation: \"olíli áka\" → \"olíly'aáka\" 'my bed'.\n\nThe table below shows the consonant inventory of Koti. The two glides \"w\" and \"y\" are only phonemically contrastive in certain contexts; in some other contexts, they can be derived from vowels. Consonants in parentheses are extremely rare, with the only example of \"dh\" in S&M's corpus, \"adhuhuri\" 'second prayer in the morning', being in variation with \"aduhuri\"; the fricative \"zh\" occurs only in some recent loans from Portuguese. Voiced stops are rather infrequent overall, and they tend to occur after a homorganic, tone-bearing nasal. Additionally, voiced stops often vary with their voiceless unaspirated counterparts.\n\nWords in Koti show incompatibility of aspirated consonants; this phenomenon is dubbed \"Katupha's Law\" in Schadeberg (1999), and is found in related Makhuwa languages as well. If two aspirated consonants are brought together in one stem, the first such consonant loses its aspiration. The effect is particularly clear in reduplicated words: \"kopikophi\" 'eyelash'; \"piriphiri\" 'pepper' (cf. Swahili 'piripiri'); \"okukuttha\" 'to wipe'.\nAnother incompatibility concerns dental and retroflex consonants, which never occur together within a stem, and usually assimilate when brought together. Consider the class 1 demonstrative for example: \"o-tthu-o-tu\" becomes \"othuutu\" under influence of the dentral-retroflex incompatibility.\n\nKoti, like most Bantu languages, is a register tone language with two tones: High and Low. Tone is not lexically distinctive for verbs, but it is very important in verbal inflection and in some other parts of grammar. Contour tones (falling and rising tones) do occur, but only on long vowels, therefore they are analysed as sequences of the H and L level tones. There is a process of High Doubling which spreads any H tone to the following tone bearing unit, and a process of Final Lowering which deletes any utterance-final High tone. Both can be seen in effect in the following example (Low tone is unmarked): \"kaláwa\" 'boat', \"kaláwá khuúlu\" 'the biggest boat'. In \"kaláwa\", High doubling is canceled because Final Lowering applies, so the last syllable has a Low tone. In the second example, the first H tone in \"kaláwá\" has spread to the next syllable (High Doubling) and Final Lowering again causes the very last syllable of the utterance to be Low in tone.\n\nKoti has a typical Bantu noun class system, in which every noun belongs to a nominal class which class markers throughout the sentence are in agreement with. Classes pair up in 'genders' for the derivation of plurals. Verbal words consist of a \"stem\" to which various morphemes and clitics can be affixed.\n\n\n"}

This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'), and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments. In exchange, the developing countries conceded to the Commonwealth's developed members (particularly Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), their interest in protecting the environment.\n\nAmongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:\n\n"}

The term is finding its way into business, both in advertising and internal communications.\n\nWhen a politician repeats the same thing \"ad nauseam\", or uses a question on one subject as a launching point to talk about a different subject, he or she is said to be exercising message discipline. Message discipline may involve a subordination of irrelevant personal opinions, or a subordination of fluctuating desires to say what others want to hear versus maintaining an unwavering devotion to the message as it reaches out to greater numbers of potential audience members.\n\nMessage discipline is often practiced around wedge issues. Devolving to talking points (practicing message discipline) around issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion rights can be a powerful weapon in the politician's arsenal, either clouding a difficult line of questioning from an interviewer, or motivating the candidates' base to vote. Key to defining wedge issues and practicing message discipline are the selection of terms that low-information voters will rally around.\n\nIn a business context, message discipline is the practice of reducing and managing the number of messages going from headquarters and marketing functions to field organizations as well as front-line employees. This goal-oriented, structured, strategic communication, is believed to drive operational excellence in organizations, as it reduces the clutter and mixed messages that sometimes afflict communications through organizational layers.\n\nMessage discipline is criticised by educated voters who see it as a method of obfuscation from what the electorate sees as important. Overly simplistic and repeated communications of the message is seen as dumbing downnand can meet with cynicism of the electorate.\n\n"}

It is tied at the end of a rope to serve as a weight, making it easier to throw, and also as an ornamental knot. This type of weighted rope can be used as a hand-to-hand weapon, called a slungshot by sailors. It was also used in the past as an anchor in rock climbing, by stuffing it into a crack. Nowadays it is still sometimes used in sandstone, e.g., the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Germany.\n\nThe monkey's fist knot is most often used as the weight in a heaving line. The line would have the monkey's fist on one end, an eye splice or bowline on the other, with about 30 feet (~10 metres) of line between. A lightweight feeder line would be tied to the bowline, then the weighted heaving line could be hurled between ship and dock. The other end of the lightweight line would be attached to a heavier-weight line, allowing it to be drawn to the target easily.\n\nThe knot is often tied around a small weight, such as a stone, marble, tight fold of paper, grapeshot, or a piece of wood. However, this may be considered unsafe and therefore poor seamanship.\nThe UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s (MCA) publication “Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seamen”, Section 25.3.2, states that “heaving lines should be constructed with a “monkey’s fist” at one end. To prevent personal injury, the ‘fist’ should be made only with rope and should not contain added weighting materials”.\nThey should not be attached by metal or plastic clip to the heaving line. \nSome port authorities instruct linesmen to cut off monkey's fists that use these fastenings. \n\nA monkey's fist can be used on two ends of a tow lines of one side a fish net which is then thrown from one trawler to another, allowing the net to be cast and set between two boats so the trawl can be used between the two, in pair trawling where the tow or catch is negotiated between both parties. This makes it easier to catch fish given the greater surface area between both boats to turn around and catch missed fish from the sea much more quickly. Once all fish have been hauled up from the sea, tow lines of the fish net is returned by way of thrown both monkey's fists back to the host trawler. Alternatively, a monkey fist can be used as a weight of a heaving line thrown to over to an opposing ship to bring two ships together.\n\nBecause of its use as a lifeline thrown from boat to boat, this knot was adopted as a symbol of solidarity among the hobo community.\n\nMonkey's fists are commonly used as a convenient and unobtrusive method of storing and transporting precious gemstones.\n\nA floating monkey's fist can be created by tying around a buoyant material such as cork or styrofoam.\nThe three coils of cordage in a monkey's fist form in effect a set of Borromean rings in three dimensions. This is most obvious when tied flat.\n\nIt is also the most common knot used in a pair for cufflinks where it is considered a \"silk knot.\"\n\nMonkey fists have become popular as main deployment handles for sport parachute systems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25403052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25403052", "title": "Na'vi language", "text": "Na'vi language\n\nThe Naʼvi language (Naʼvi: \"\") is the constructed language of the Naʼvi, the sapient humanoid indigenous inhabitants of the fictional moon Pandora in the 2009 film \"Avatar\". It was created by Paul Frommer, a professor at the USC Marshall School of Business with a doctorate in linguistics. Naʼvi was designed to fit James Cameron's conception of what the language should sound like in the film, to be realistically learnable by the fictional human characters of the film, and to be pronounceable by the actors, but to not closely resemble any single human language.\n\nWhen the film was released in 2009, Naʼvi had a growing vocabulary of about a thousand words, but understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator. However, this has changed subsequently as Frommer has expanded the lexicon to more than 2200 words and has published the grammar, thus making Naʼvi a relatively complete, learnable and serviceable language.\n\nThe Naʼvi language has its origins in James Cameron's early work on \"Avatar\". In 2005, while the film was still in scriptment form, Cameron felt it needed a complete, consistent language for the alien characters to speak. He had written approximately thirty words for this alien language but wanted a linguist to create the language in full. His production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, contacted the linguistics department at the University of Southern California seeking someone who would be interested in creating such a language. Edward Finegan, a professor of linguistics at USC, thought that the project would appeal to Paul Frommer, with whom he had co-authored a linguistics textbook, and so forwarded Lightstorm's inquiry on to him. Frommer and Cameron met to discuss the director's vision for the language and its use in the film; at the end of the meeting, Cameron shook Frommer's hand and said \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\nBased on Cameron's initial list of words, which had a \"Polynesian flavor\" according to Frommer, the linguist developed three different sets of meaningless words and phrases that conveyed a sense of what an alien language might sound like: one using contrasting tones, one using varying vowel lengths, and one using ejective consonants. Of the three, Cameron liked the sound of the ejectives most. His choice established the phonology that Frommer would use in developing the rest of the Naʼvi language – morphology, syntax, and an initial vocabulary – a task that took six months.\n\nThe Naʼvi vocabulary was created by Frommer as needed for the script. By the time casting for \"Avatar\" began, the language was sufficiently developed that actors were required to read and pronounce Naʼvi dialogue during auditions. During shooting Frommer worked with the cast, helping them understand their Naʼvi dialogue and advising them on their Naʼvi pronunciation, stress, and intonation. Actors would often make mistakes in speaking Naʼvi. In some cases, those mistakes were plausibly explained as ones their human characters would make; in other cases, the mistakes were incorporated into the language.\n\nFrommer expanded the vocabulary further in May 2009 when he worked on the , which required Naʼvi words that had not been needed for the film script and thus had not yet been invented. Frommer also translated into Naʼvi four sets of song lyrics that had been written by Cameron in English, and he helped vocalists with their pronunciation during the recording of James Horner's . At the time of the film's release on December 18, 2009, the Naʼvi vocabulary consisted of approximately 1000 words.\n\nWork on the Naʼvi language has continued even after the film's release. Frommer is working on a compendium which he plans to deliver to Fox in the near future. He hopes that the language will \"have a life of its own,\" and thinks it would be \"wonderful\" if the language developed a following. Since then, it has developed a following, as is evident through the increasing learner community of the language. The community's Lexical Expansion Project, together with Frommer, has expanded the lexicon by more than 50 percent.\n\nFrommer also maintains a blog, Na’viteri, where he regularly posts additions to the lexicon and clarifications on grammar. Naʼviteri has been the source of the vast majority of Naʼvi growth independent of Frommer's contract with 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe Naʼvi language was developed under three significant constraints. First, Cameron wanted the language to sound alien but pleasant and appealing to audiences. Second, since the storyline included humans who have learned to speak the language, it had to be a language that humans could plausibly learn to speak. And finally, the actors would have to be able to pronounce their Naʼvi dialogue without unreasonable difficulty. The language in its final form contains several elements which are uncommon in human languages, such as verbal conjugation using infixes. All Naʼvi linguistic elements are found in human languages, but the combination is unique.\n\nNaʼvi lacks voiced plosives like , but has the ejective consonants , which are spelled \"px, tx, kx.\" It also has the syllabic consonants \"ll\" and \"rr\". There are seven vowels, \"a ä e i ì o u.\" Although all the sounds were designed to be pronounceable by the human actors of the film, there are unusual consonant clusters, as in \"fngap\" \"metal\".\n\nNaʼvi syllables may be as simple as a single vowel, or as complex as \"skxawng\" \"moron\" or \"fngap\" above (both CCVC).\n\nThe fictional language Naʼvi of Pandora is unwritten. However, the actual (studio) language is written in the Latin script for the actors of \"Avatar\". Some words include: \"zìsìt\" \"year\", \"fpeio\" \"ceremonial challenge\", \"’awve\" \"first\" (\"’aw\" \"one\"), \"muiä\" \"fair\", \"tireaioang\" \"spirit animal\", \"tskxe\" \"rock\", \"kllpxìltu\" \"territory\", \"uniltìrantokx\" \"avatar\" (dream-walk-body).\n\nThere are seven monophthong vowels:\n\nThere are additionally four diphthongs: aw [aw], ew [εw], ay [aj], ey [εj], and two syllabic consonants: ll [l̩] and rr [r̩], which mostly behave as vowels.\n\nNote that the \"e\" is open-mid while the \"o\" is close-mid, and that there is no \"*oy.\" The \"rr\" is strongly trilled, and the \"ll\" is \"light\", never a \"dark\" (velarized) .\n\nThese vowels may occur in sequences, as in the Polynesian languages, Swahili, and Japanese. Each vowel counts as a syllable, so that \"tsaleioae\" has six syllables, , and \"meoauniaea\" has eight, .\n\nNaʼvi does not have vowel length or tone, but it does have contrastive stress: \"túte\" \"person\", \"tuté\" \"female person\". Although stress may move with derivation, as here, it is not affected by inflection (case on nouns, tense on verbs, etc.). So, for example, the verb \"lu\" (\"to be\") has stress on its only vowel, the \"u,\" and no matter what else happens to it, the stress stays on that vowel: \"lolú\" \"was\" (\"lu\"), \"lolängú\" \"was (ugh!)\" (\"lu\"), etc.\n\nThere are twenty consonants. There are two Latin transcriptions: one that more closely approaches the ideal of one letter per phoneme, with the \"c\" and \"g\" for and (the values they have in much of Eastern Europe and Polynesia, respectively), and a modified transcription used for the actors, with the digraphs \"ts\" and \"ng\" used for those sounds. In both transcriptions, the ejective consonants are written with digraphs in \"x,\" a convention that appears to have no external inspiration.\n\nThe fricatives and the affricate, \"f v ts s z h\", are restricted to the onset of a syllable; the others may occur at the beginning or at the end (though \"w y\" in final position are considered parts of diphthongs, as they only occur as \"ay ey aw ew\" and may be followed by another final consonant, as in \"skxawng\" \"moron\"). However, in addition to appearing before vowels, \"f ts s\" may form consonant clusters with any of the unrestricted consonants (the plosives and liquids/glides) apart from \"’\", making for 39 clusters. Other sequences occur across syllable boundaries, such as \"Naʼvi\" and \"ikran\" \"banshee\".\n\nThe plosives \"p t k\" are tenuis, as in Spanish or French. In final position, they have no audible release, as in Indonesian and other languages of Southeast Asia. The \"r\" is flapped, as in Spanish and Indonesian; it sounds a bit like the \"tt\" or \"dd\" in the American pronunciation of the words \"latter / ladder\".\n\nThe plosives undergo lenition after certain prefixes and prepositions. The ejective consonants \"px tx kx\" become the corresponding plosives \"p t k\"; the plosives and affricate \"p t ts k\" become the corresponding fricatives \"f s h\"; and the glottal stop \"’\" disappears entirely. For example, the plural form of \"po\" \"s/he\" is \"ayfo\" \"they\", with the \"p\" weakening into an \"f\" after the prefix \"ay-.\"\n\nLenition has its own significance when the plural prefix can optionally be omitted. In the above example, \"ayfo\" can be shortened to \"fo\". Similarly, the plural of \"tsmukan\" \"brother\" can be \"smukan\" (from \"aysmukan\").\n\nNaʼvi has free word order. For example, the English \"I see you\" (a common greeting in Naʼvi), can be as follows in Naʼvi:\n\n\"Oel ngati kameie\"\n\n\"Ngati oel kameie\"\n\n\"Oel kameie ngati\"\n\nAll forms of \"I see you\" in Naʼvi are completely correct. As sentences become more complex though, some words, like adjectives and negatives, will have to stay in a more or less fixed position in the sentence, depending on what the adjective or negative is describing.\n\n\"Today is a good day\"\n\n\"Fìtrr lu sìltsana trr\"\n\n\"Sìltsana trr fìtrr lu\"\n\nIn this case, the adjective \"sìltsan(a)\" (good) will need to stay with the noun \"trr\" (day), therefore limiting the sentence to fewer combinations on the construction of the sentence, but as long as it follows or precedes the noun, the sentence is fine. By putting the attributive \"a\" before the adjective, the adjective can be put after the noun:\n\n\"Fìtrr lu trr asìltsan\"\n\nMore information about this can be found in the \"Adjectives\" section.\n\nNouns in Naʼvi show greater number distinctions than those in most human languages do: besides singular and plural, they not only have special dual forms for two of an item (eyes, hands, lovers, etc.), which are common in human language (English has a remnant in \"both\"), but also trial forms for three of an item, which on Earth are only found with pronouns. Gender is only occasionally (and optionally) marked.\n\nThe plural prefix is \"ay+,\" and the dual is \"me+.\" Both trigger lenition (indicated by the \"+\" signs rather than the hyphens that usually mark prefix boundaries). In nouns which undergo lenition, the plural prefix may be dropped, so the plural of \"tokx\" \"body\" is either \"aysokx\" or just \"sokx.\"\n\nMasculine and feminine nouns may be distinguished by suffix. There are no articles (words for \"a\" or \"the\").\n\nNouns are declined for case in a tripartite system, which is rare among human languages. In a tripartite system, there are distinct forms for the object of a clause, as in \"he kicks the ball\"; the agent of a transitive clause which has such an object, as in \"he kicks the ball\"; and the subject of an intransitive clause, which does not have an object, as in \"he runs\". An object is marked with the accusative suffix \"-ti,\" and an agent with the ergative suffix \"-l\", while an intransitive subject has no case suffix. The use of such case forms leaves the word order of Naʼvi largely free.\n\nThere are two other cases—genitive in \"-yä\", dative in \"-ru\"—as well as a topic marker \"-ri\". The latter is used to introduce the topic of the clause, and is somewhat equivalent to Japanese \"wa\" and the much less common English \"as for\". It preempts the case of the noun: that is, when a noun is made topical, usually at the beginning of the clause, it takes the \"-ri\" suffix rather than the case suffix one would expect from its grammatical role. For example, in,\n\nBesides case, the role of a noun in a clause may be indicated with adpositions. Any adposition may occur as either as a preposition before the noun, or as an enclitic after the noun, a greater degree of freedom than English allows. For example, \"with you\" may be either \"hu nga\" or \"ngahu\". When used as enclitics, they are much like the numerous cases found in Hungarian and Finnish. When used as prepositions, more along the lines of what English does, certain of them trigger lenition. One of the leniting prepositions is \"mì\" \"in\", as in \"mì sokx\" \"in the body\". This may cause some ambiguity with short plurals: \"mì sokx\" could also be short for \"mì aysokx\" \"in the bodies\".\n\nNaʼvi pronouns encode clusivity. That is, there are different words for \"we\" depending on whether the speaker is including his/her addressee or not. There are also special forms for \"the two of us\" (with or without the addressee), \"the three of us\", etc. They do not inflect for gender; although it is possible to distinguish \"he\" from \"she\", the distinction is optional.\n\nThe deferential forms of \"I\" and \"you\" are \"ohe\" and \"ngenga\". Possessive forms include \"ngeyä\" \"your\" and \"peyä\" \"her/his\". \"He\" and \"she\" can optionally be differentiated as \"poan\" and \"poé\".\n\nThe grammatical distinctions made by nouns are also made by pronouns.\n\nNaʼvi adjectives are uninflected—that is, they do not agree with the noun they modify—and may occur either before or after the noun. They are marked by a syllable \"a\", which is attached on the side closest to the noun. For example, \"a long river\" can be expressed either as,\n\nor as,\n\nThe free word order holds for all attributives: Genitives (possessives) and relative clauses can also either precede or follow the noun they modify. The latter especially allows for great freedom of expression.\n\nThe attributive affix \"a-\" is only used when an adjective modifies a noun. Predicative adjectives instead take the \"be\" verb \"lu\":\n\nVerbs are conjugated for tense and aspect, but not for person. That is, they record distinctions like \"I am, I was, I would\", but not like \"I am, we are, s/he is\". Conjugation relies exclusively on infixes, which are like suffixes but go inside the verb. \"To hunt\", for example, is \"taron\", but \"hunted\" is \"taron\", with the infix \"\".\n\nThere are two positions for infixes: after the onset (optional consonant(s)) of the penultimate syllable, and after the onset of the final syllable. Because many Na’vi verbs have two syllables, these commonly occur on the first and last syllable. In monosyllabic words like \"lu\" \"be\", they both appear after the initial onset, keeping their relative order.\n\nThe first infix position is taken by infixes for tense, aspect, mood, or combinations thereof; also appearing in this position are participle, reflexive, and causative forms, the latter two of which may co-occur with a tense/aspect/mood infix by preceding it. Tenses are past, recent past, present (unmarked), future, and immediate future; aspects are perfective (completed or contained) and imperfective (ongoing or uncontained). The aspectual forms are not found in English but are somewhat like the distinction between 'having done' and 'was doing'.\n\nTense and aspect need not be marked when they can be understood by context or elsewhere in the sentence.\n\nThe second infix position is taken by infixes for affect (speaker attitude, whether positive or negative) and for evidentiality (uncertainty or indirect knowledge). For example, in the greeting in the section on nouns, \"Oel ngati kameie\" \"I See you\", the verb \"kame\" \"to See\" is inflected positively as \"kame\" to indicate the pleasure the speaker has in meeting you. In the subsequent sentence, \"Oeri ontu teya längu\" \"My nose is full (of his smell)\", however, the phrase \"teya lu\" \"is full\" is inflected pejoratively as \"teya lu\" to indicate the speaker's distaste at the experience. Examples with both infix positions filled:\n\nThe Naʼvi language currently has over 2,000 words. These include a few English loan words such as \"kunsìp\" \"gunship\". The published lexicon, including the odd inflectional form, is available online at https://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf. Additionally, the community at learnnavi.org is working with Dr. Frommer to further develop the language. Naʼvi is a very modular language and the total number of usable words far exceeds the 2,000 dictionary words. For example: \"rol\" \"to sing\" → \"tìrusol\" \"the act of singing\" or \"ngop\" \"to create\" → \"ngopyu\" \"creator\". Workarounds using existing words also abound in the Naʼvi corpus, such as \"eltu lefngap\" \"metallic brain\" for \"computer\" and \"palulukantsyìp\" \"little thanator\" for \"cat\".\n\n\n"}

Just before the president-elect takes the oath of office on Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect will step forward on the inaugural platform and repeat the oath of office. Although the United States Constitution——specifically sets forth the oath required by incoming presidents, it does not do so for incoming vice presidents. The constitution—Article VI, Clause 3— simply requires that they, along with all other government officers (federal and state; elected and appointed), pledge to support the Constitution. Since 1937, Inauguration Day has been January 20 (was March 4), a change brought about by the 20th amendment to the Constitution, which had been ratified four years earlier. The vice president's swearing-in ceremony also moved that year, from the Senate chamber inside the Capitol, to the presidential inaugural platform outside the building.\n\nThe 1st Congress passed an oath act in May 1789, authorizing only U.S. senators to administer the oath to the vice president (who serves as the president of the Senate). Later that year, legislation passed that allowed courts to administer all oaths and affirmations. Since 1789, the oath has been changed several times by Congress. The present oath repeated by the vice president, senators, representatives, and other government officers has been in use since 1884.\n\nWhen the vice presidency was established in 1789, and for the century that followed, the Vice President was sworn in on the same date as the president, March 4, but at a separate location, typically in the United States Senate, where he holds the office of President of the Senate. Up until the middle of the 20th Century, the Vice President-Elect nearly always would be sworn in by the highest-ranking officer of the US Senate which was the outgoing vice president or the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate. Sometimes, although not always, a short address would be given by the new vice president to the Senate.\n\nThe oath of office has been administered most by the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate (last in 1925) for a total of 20 times. Others to give the oath of office include the outgoing Vice President (last in 1945) 12 times, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (last in 2017) 9 times, the Chief Justice of the United States (last in 2001) 6 times, U.S. Senators that are not President Pro Tempore of the Senate (last in 1969) 5 times, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives (last in 2005) 4 times, a US judge twice, and a US Consul once with one time being unrecorded. Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger has given the oath the most times with three.\n\nOf the 59 times the Oath of Office has been administered, 47 times have been at some location in the United States Capitol. The White House has seen 3 oaths of office, and Congress Hall in Philadelphia twice. The following locations all had the oath administered once in that location: Federal Hall, Old Brick Capitol, Havana, Cuba, a private residence in New York, and the Number One Observatory Circle. Reflecting the relative lack of importance of the office in the early 1800s, there are two instances where the location of the Vice President's oath of office is unknown.\n\nDue to Vice President-elect William King's deteriorating health, a bill signed on March 3, 1853, the last day of the 32nd United States Congress, allowed for the oath to be administered to him as he rested in Cuba.\n\nEntries in the above list with an asterisk indicate the official legal oath of office for terms of office that began on Sunday instead of the public ceremonial swearing-in the following day.\n\n"}

The Riang languages are reported to be unintelligible or only understood with great difficulty by native speakers of the other Palaung languages.\n\nA total number of speakers is uncertain; there were 150,000 Shwe speakers in 1982, 272,000 Ruching (Palé) speakers in 2000, and 139,000 Rumai speakers at an unrecorded date.\n\nChinese linguists classify \"Deang 德昂\" varieties (spoken mostly in Santaishan Ethnic Deang Township 三台山德昂族乡, Mangshi and Junnong Township 军弄乡, Zhenkang County) as follows (\"Deangyu Jianzhi\").

It threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance to any country at war.\n\nNews that Revolutionary France had declared war on Great Britain in February 1793, and with this declaration that France, by the country's own volition, was now at war with all of Europe, did not reach America until the first half of April of that year. President Washington was at Mount Vernon attending the funeral of a nephew when he was given the news. He hurried back to Pennsylvania and summoned a cabinet meeting on April 19. It was unanimously agreed to issue a proclamation \"forbidding citizens to take part in any hostilities in the seas, on behalf of or against any of the belligerent powers.\"\n\nWashington's members agreed that neutrality was essential; the nation was too young and its military was too small to risk any sort of engagement with either France or Britain. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, in particular, saw in this question, as well as in the other twelve, the influence of the Federalists — his political rivals; yet he too agreed a proclamation was in order, though perhaps not an official one.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting of January 14th, Thomas Jefferson argued that while neutrality was a \"sine qua non\", there was no real need to make a Proclamation of Neutrality either immediately or even officially; perhaps there might be no need for an official declaration at all. The United States could declare its neutrality for a price, Jefferson intimated, \"Why not stall and make countries bid for [American] neutrality?\" In response, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton declared that American neutrality was not negotiable. Jefferson eventually resigned from his duty as Secretary of State in disagreement with the Proclamation of Neutrality.\n\nThe proclamation started a war of pamphlets between Hamilton (writing for the Federalists), and Madison (writing for the Jeffersonian/Republicans). In his seven essays, written under the \"nom de plume\" \"Pacificus\", Hamilton dealt with objections to the proclamation. Among his arguments were:\n\n\nJefferson (having read several of the \"Pacificus\" essays) encouraged James Madison to reply. Madison was initially hesitant. From his Virginia plantation he offered Jefferson excuses as to why he could not write a reply, including that he didn't have the necessary books and papers to refute \"Pacificus\", that the summer heat was \"oppressive\", and that he had many houseguests who were wearing out their welcome. Ultimately Madison agreed to Jefferson's request, though afterwards he wrote to him, \"I have forced myself in to the task of a reply. I can truly say I find it the most grating one I have ever experienced.\"\n\nWriting under the name \"Helvidius\", Madison's five essays showed the animosity that had evolved with the two political factions. He attacked Federalists, and Hamilton in particular, and anyone who supported the Neutrality Proclamation as secret monarchists, declaring: \"Several features with the signature of Pacificus were [as of] late published, which have been read with singular pleasure and applause by the foreigners and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our republican government and the French Revolution.\" Madison brought to light the strict constructionist's view of both the Constitution and the Proclamation, demanding that Congress, not the president, had full authority over all foreign affairs except those areas specified in the Constitution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "160538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160538", "title": "Psycholinguistics", "text": "Psycholinguistics\n\nPsycholinguistics or psychology of language is the study of the interrelation between linguistic factors and psychological aspects. It also studies psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.\n\nPsycholinguistics has roots in education and philosophy, and covers the \"cognitive processes\" that make it possible to generate a grammatical and meaningful sentence out of vocabulary and grammatical structures, as well as the processes that make it possible to understand utterances, words, text, etc. Developmental psycholinguistics studies children's ability to learn language.\n\nThe term \"psycholinguistics\" was coined in 1936 by Jacob Robert Kantor in his book \"An Objective Psychology of Grammar\" and started being used among his team at Indiana University, but its use finally became frequent thanks to the 1946 article \"Language and psycholinguistics: a review,\" by his student Nicholas Henry Pronko. It was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science \"that could be coherent\" as well as in the title of \"Psycholinguistics: A Survey of Theory and Research Problems\", a 1954 book by Charles E. Osgood and Thomas A. Sebeok.\n\nPsycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Hence, it is studied by researchers from a variety of different backgrounds, such as psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, and speech and language pathology. Psycholinguists study many different topics, but these topics can generally be divided into answering the following questions: (1) how do children acquire language (language acquisition)?; (2) how do people process and comprehend language (language comprehension)?; (3) how do people produce language (language production)?; and (4) how do people acquire a new language (second language acquisition)?\n\nSubdivisions in psycholinguistics are also made based on the different components that make up human language.\n\nLinguistics-related areas:\n\nA researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthographic, morphological, phonological, and semantic information from patterns in printed text. A researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level. Developmental psycholinguists study infants' and children's ability to learn and process language.\n\nIn this section, some influential theories are discussed for each of the fundamental questions listed in the section above.\n\nThere are essentially two schools of thought as to how children acquire or learn language, and there is still much debate as to which theory is the correct one. The first theory states that all language must be learned by the child. The second view states that the abstract system of language cannot be learned, but that humans possess an innate language faculty, or an access to what has been called universal grammar. The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of Jean Piaget and the empiricist Rudolf Carnap. Likewise, the school of psychology known as behaviorism (see Verbal Behavior (1957) by B.F. Skinner) puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response, hence it is learned.\n\nThe innatist perspective began with Noam Chomsky's highly critical review of Skinner's book in 1959. This review helped to start what has been termed \"the cognitive revolution\" in psychology. Chomsky posited humans possess a special, innate ability for language and that complex syntactic features, such as recursion, are \"hard-wired\" in the brain. These abilities are thought to be beyond the grasp of the most intelligent and social non-humans. According to Chomsky, children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars, yet at the time there was no evidence that children receive sufficient input to learn all the rules of their language (see poverty of the stimulus). Hence, there must be some other innate mechanism that endows a language ability to humans. Such a language faculty is, according to the innateness hypothesis, what defines human language and makes it different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication.\n\nThe field of linguistics and psycholinguistics since then has been defined by reactions to Chomsky, pro and con. The pro view still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically the ability to use recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability. This ability may have resulted from a favorable mutation or from an adaptation of skills evolved for other purposes. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by emergentism. This view challenges the \"innate\" view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it can't be tested. With the amount of computer power increasing since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models. These models provide evidence that there may, in fact, be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language, even syntax. If this is true, then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition.\n\nOne question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (also known as sentence processing). Experimental research has spawned a number of theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Typically these theories are concerned with what types of information contained in the sentence the reader can use to build meaning, and at what point in reading does that information become available to the reader. Issues such as \"modular\" versus \"interactive\" processing have been theoretical divides in the field.\n\nA modular view of sentence processing assumes that the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory, states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible in order to minimize effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence \"The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable,\" by the time the reader gets to the word \"examined\" he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made despite the fact that it results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this \"syntax first\" theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which \"the evidence\" is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach \"by the lawyer\" and must go back and re-parse the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.\n\nIn contrast to a modular account, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a constraint-based lexical approach assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive account, for example, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on in order to help determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that \"the evidence\" is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive accounts; which account is the correct one is still up for debate.\n\nLanguage production concerns how people produce language, either in written or spoken form, in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors. They include speech dysfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences; also, slips of tongue, like blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. Spoonerism), and various pronunciation errors. These speech errors yield significant implication on language production, in that they reflect that:\nIt is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of production: conceptualization \"(determining what to say), formulation (translating the intention to say something into linguistic form), and execution (the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself).\" Most psycholinguistic research has largely concerned itself with the study for formulation because the phase of conceptualization largely remains an elusive and mysterious period of development.\n\nFor models of speech production, see .\n\nMany of the experiments conducted in psycholinguistics, especially earlier on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of correct responses are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of priming effects, whereby a \"priming\" word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related \"target\" word later.\n\nAs an example of how behavioral methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a \"yes\" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a \"no\" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.\n\nRecently, eye tracking has been used to study online language processing. Beginning with Rayner (1978) the importance and informativity of eye-movements during reading was established. Later, Tanenhaus et al. (1995) used the visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language. Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention, language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is presented auditorily with linguistic input.\n\nThe analysis of systematic errors in speech, writing and typing of language as it is produced can provide evidence of the process which has generated it. Errors of speech, in particular, grant insight into how the mind processes language production while a speaker is in the midst of an utterance. Speech errors tend to occur in the lexical, morpheme, and phoneme encoding steps of language production, as seen by the ways errors can manifest. The types of speech errors, and some examples, are:\n\n\nSpeech errors will usually occur in the stages that involve lexical, morpheme, or phoneme encoding, and usually not the first step of semantic encoding. This can be credited to how a speaker is still conjuring the idea of what to say, and unless he changes his mind, can not be mistaken in what he wanted to say.\n\nUntil the recent advent of non-invasive medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to discover how language works in the brain. For example, severing the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy. Researchers could then study the ways in which the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.\n\nNewer, non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by positron emission tomography (PET); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.\n\nComputational modelling, such as the DRC model of reading and word recognition proposed by Max Coltheart and colleagues, is another methodology and refers to the practice of setting up cognitive models in the form of executable computer programs. Such programs are useful because they require theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render discursive analysis unreliable. Other examples of computational modelling is McClelland and Elman's TRACE model of speech perception and Franklin Chang's Dual-Path model of sentence production.\n\nPsycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the computations and processes that the brain undergoes to comprehend and produce language. For example, the cohort model seeks to describe how words are retrieved from the mental lexicon when an individual hears or sees linguistic input.\n\nRecent research using new non-invasive imaging techniques seeks to shed light on just where certain language processes occur in the brain.\n\nThere are a number of unanswered questions in psycholinguistics, such as whether the human ability to use syntax is based on innate mental structures or emerges from interaction with other humans, and whether some animals can be taught the syntax of human language.\n\nTwo other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate first language acquisition, the process by which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also seems to be the case that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.\n\nThe field of aphasiology deals with language deficits that arise because of brain damage. Studies in aphasiology can both offer advances in therapy for individuals suffering from aphasia, and further insight into how the brain processes language.\n\nA short list of books that deal with psycholinguistics, written in language accessible to the non-expert, includes:\n"}

Sasi shifted home base to Thiruvananthapuram, where he worked first as a journalist with magazines such as \"Kudumbakatha\" and \"Kuttikatha\". He then set up his own advertising agency, Primary Colours. He wrote some of his notable stage plays during this time. Inspired by various screenplays of M. T. Vasudevan Nair, he developed a keen interest in writing screenplays for films. He made his flm debut with Kaladharan’s \"Nettipattam\" (1990). But the film failed both critically and commercially. He was then approached by Rajasenan, for whom he wrote the family drama \"Ayalathe Adheham\". The film became a resounding hit.

The SOHP is dedicated to the study of the American South as told by the many who lived, but did not write, history. The SOHP has collected over 4,000 oral history interviews with southerners who have made important contributions to various fields, been involved in specific historical movements, or lived through times of southern transformation. In the past 35 years, the Program has grown to become one of the more prominent collections of oral histories in the United States. Graduate students and faculty at UNC and the SOHP as well as independent researchers work to collect oral histories with the goal of \"rendering historically visible those whose experience is not reflected in traditional written sources.\"\n\nThe SOHP is involved in many oral history outreach efforts, conducting workshops, aiding researchers interested in performing oral history interviews, and helping to promote the use of oral history in the classroom across North Carolina.\n\nAll oral histories are stored in the archives at the Southern Historical Collection in the Wilson Round Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and are freely available to the public. Many interviews have not only audio but also full transcripts, abstracts, biographical forms on the interviewees, and field notes from the interviewers. An interview database searchable by subject, project, interviewer, interviewee name, occupation, ethnicity, or interview number is available online. Traditionally, all oral histories have been accessible only on-site in the reading room of the Southern Historical Collection in Chapel Hill, N.C. However, a 2005 a grant-funded project, \"Oral Histories of the American South\" (OHAS), conducted by Documenting the American South began working to digitize 500 SOHP oral histories and provide online access to full audio, transcripts, and lesson plans for use of online oral histories in the classroom.\n\nSince 2001, much of the SOHP's research effort has been focused on the initiative \"The Long Civil Rights Movement: The South Since the 1960s,\" which documents the history and evolution of the Civil Rights Movement and other parallel movements in the South, such as the women's movement. These interviews focus on three main areas: race and the public schools, economic justice, and gender and sexuality. In 2008, the SOHP received a $937,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to continue to collaborate in their efforts to produce civil rights movement scholarship.\n\nThough the SOHP collects interviews from independent researchers across the South, most of the collection stems from field work conducted specifically by the SOHP. UNC faculty and students along with SOHP staff collect oral histories within the scope of specific interview series developed by the SOHP, listed below. Each series has a specific focus, and many contain sub-series.\n\n\nSee the Southern Oral History Program Collection finding aid for descriptions of individual series and sub-series.\n\n"}

The award system gives rise to phrases such as \"an Oxford Blue\", meaning a person who was awarded a Blue by the University of Oxford. Similarly a Cambridge Blue is awarded by the University of Cambridge. \"Colours are not however, always known as 'a Blue'.\" A 'university sporting blue' is a generic term which stems from the Oxford and Cambridge Blue, but 'Colours' by definition may be any colour, and often reflect the colours associated with the school uniform, crest, or other significant semiotic.\n\nIn some award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour, such as a Half-Blue. Typically, a given institution will award a single colour; for example, Cambridge and Oxford awards are different shades of blue, and the University of London awards a Purple.\n\nAmerican universities tend to award a varsity letter rather than a colour.\n\nThe system is common in the majority of British prep schools, independent schools and old schools of Australia, South African and Sri Lanka. Often blazers are given to denote pupils who have achieved in a sport. The blazers are often distinct from the standard school blazer though often colours simply take the form of embellished arms or braided cord or ribbon edging on the standard blazer.

He was associated with the communist movement in Kerala and his play \"Ningalenne Communistakki\" (You Made Me a Communist) is considered to be a groundbreaking event in the history of Malayalam theatre.\n\nBorn Thoppil Bhaskara Pillai, on 8 April 1924 at Vallikunnam in Alleppey district, Kerala, Bhasi was the eldest son of Thoppil Parameshwaran Pillai and Nanikkutti Amma.\n\nHis elementary education was at the SNDP Sanskrit School, and later on at the Sanskrit School, Changankulangara, from where he graduated in the Sanskrit Shastri course. Knowing fully well his desire to learn indigenous medicine, his father had him enrolled at the Ayurveda College, Thiruvananthapuram. It was here that he spearheaded the Students' Agitation that led to installing many of the facilities and rights enjoyed by the current generation of students at the College of Ayurveda. He also graduated securing the Top Rank in the Vaidya Kalanidhi Examination.\n\nHis deep and enduring friendship with Kambisseri Karunakaran that extended through all spheres of their lives, also saw them at the forefront of some of the most significant political agitations in central Kerala. Once a staunch supporter and activist of the Indian Congress party, Thoppil Bhasi soon distanced himself from the same on matters of principles and found his direction in the neo movement of Communism via the Communist Party of India. He was associated with the communist movements that took place in Kerala during the 1940s and 1950s. Branded a Subversive and a Wanted Man by the government, he was on the run and went underground during the period of 1948–52, as a top priority suspect in the infamous Sooranad Incident, with a Rs 1000 bounty on his head. He was later acquitted, and went on to contest the first Panchayat elections in Kerala. He won, becoming the first president of the Vallikunnom panchayat. He was elected twice to the state assembly contesting the State elections, from Bharanikkavu in 1954 and Pathanamthitta in 1957.\n\nThoppil Bhasi never contested any more elections post his 1957 win, to devote his entire energies to this new direction his life has set course on – theatre. He had written his first One-act play \"Munnettam\" (\"The Advance\") while on the run from the state, and based on the feedback received from the underground collective, had revisited, refined and re-energised the plot from a different perspective, creating the historical Ningalenne Communistaakki, both under his pseudonym Soman, for fear of revealing his true identity. The drama helped KPAC to become a force to reckon with on Kerala's theatrical arena. Later,he wrote scripts for 110 Malayalam films starting from 'Mudiyanaya Puthran' in 1961,most of them mega hits.\n\nHis association with KPAC started with the staging of Ningalenne Communistaakki, and the entire proceedings from the show were donated towards the attorney fees needed to free the rest of accused in the Soornad Incident.He wrote the play \"Ningalenne Communistakki\" while in hiding in connection with the Sooranad case, which resulted from a revolt by agricultural workers against a landlord. Bhasi had to write the play under the name, Soman. \"Ningalenne Communistakki\" was first staged (under the banner of KPAC) in Chavara in Kollam district on 6 December 1952. He wrote 16 plays, for KPAC, each more spectacular and socially relevant than its predecessor and it used to be said in the 60s and 70s that there wasn't a day where at least one of his plays was not staged at any part of Kerala! Such was the influence of his creative power. From KPAC, he slowly moved to the film industry (some say it was a natural progression), authoring over 100 Screenplays and turned to directing 16 movies in Malayalam language, most of them box-office successes.\n\nThoppil Bhasi's wedding with Amminiamma, the niece of C Shankaranarayanan – ex-Speaker of the Kerala Legislative Assembly was solemnised when he was on the run, a wanted man for the government! In a moving tribute, aptly titled 'My Comrade', Amminiamma, amongst other nuggets, shares her husband's principle of simplicity and frugality in every aspect of his life. She recalls Udaya studio's Kunchacko asking her to buy him a new shirt as he was fed up of seeing Thoppil Bhasi in the same shirt every time! Thoppil Bhasi seems to have famously remarked, \"Chackochen, I have 8 shirts of the same colour and type, and all eight have the same 'beedi-burn' patch at the left side of my breast-pocket !\" He was the quintessential socialist, according to her. Thoppil Bhasi has 4 sons – Ajayan, Soman, Rajan and Suresh, and daughter Mala . Ajayan went on direct the award-winning Malayalam film Perumthachan in 1991.\n\nThoppil Bhasi's dramas, Mudiyanaya Puthran and Puthiya Akasham, Puthiya Bhumi were awarded the Kerala Sahithya Academy Awards, and the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy awarded him its Fellowship in 1981. He is also the recipient of the Professor N Krishna Pillai Award and the SovietLand Nehru Award. He also was awarded the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film for directing Sarasayya in 1971 and the Kerala State Film Award for Best Story for Mooladhanam in 1969.\n\nThoppil Bhasi was prolific in terms of his creative output during his active years in theatre and movies. He authored 16 full-length plays, screenplays for over a 100 movies, directed 16 movies and his autobiography was titled, Oliviley Ormakal. He was a regular contributor to the Janayugom Magazine and short stories to various publications which are yet to be collated and archived.\n\nThoppil Bhasi died on 8 December 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

In a commercial radio or TV station there is a vital link between sales (of advertisement or commercial space) and traffic in keeping the information about commercial time availability.\n\nThe station sells airtime to its customers. It is not unusual in a single hour for 18–20 minutes to be commercials.\n\nThe traffic department together with sales aims to sell the available airtime (\"avails\") at the best possible rates. The traffic department generates a daily log of programming elements such as commercials, features and public service announcements. The log defines when they are planned to be aired. The log will be used by the on-air operator who actually plays the commercials. A copy of the log after the fact is used for reconciliation to determine what actually aired.\n\nTypically a broadcaster uses a broadcast management software system that allows for automation between departments. Some software systems are end-to-end and manage the whole spectrum of tasks required to broadcast a television or radio station, others specialize in specific areas, such as sales, programming, traffic, or automation for master control.\n\nThe traffic process starts by a salesperson making an agreement with a customer about a campaign. The agreement is called a \"sales order\" and it defines the dates when spots (advertisements) are run and the commercial terms of the campaign. The sales order usually also defines the product group in order to avoid conflicts in scheduling, for example, where two fast food vendors have a spot in the same break.\n\nAt the station, a traffic person collects the sales orders and enters them into a computer system that will help to generate the daily logs. The traffic person also links the sales order with the possible media, such as an audio tape which contains the actual spot. When all the material is finished, the traffic system will be updated with parameters that define how the campaign will be run: in which dayparts there will be spots, how the spots are placed within a break, and what other separation criteria in addition to product groups there may be.\n"}

{"id": "151965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151965", "title": "Vernalization", "text": "Vernalization\n\nVernalization (from Latin \"vernus\", \"of the spring\") is the induction of a plant's flowering process by exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After vernalization, plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually flower. Vernalization is sometimes used to refer to herbal (non-woody) plants requiring a cold dormancy to produce new shoots and leaves but this usage is discouraged.\n\nMany plants grown in temperate climates require vernalization and must experience a period of low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and winters, rather than in autumn. The needed cold is often expressed in chill hours. Typical vernalization temperatures are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nFor many perennial plants, such as fruit tree species, a period of cold is needed first to induce dormancy and then later, after the requisite period of time, re-emerge from that dormancy prior to flowering. Many monocarpic winter annuals and biennials, including some ecotypes of \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" and winter cereals such as wheat, must go through a prolonged period of cold before flowering occurs.\n\nIn the history of agriculture, farmers observed a traditional distinction between \"winter cereals\", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and \"spring cereals\", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist John Hancock Klippart, Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist Gustav Gassner who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold. In 1928 a Russian geneticist Trofim Lysenko published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term \"яровизация\" (\"jarovization\") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (\"Jarovoe\" in Russian, originally from \"jar\" meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into \"vernalization\" (from the Latin \"vernum\" meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as \"the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment\".\n\nLysenko's 1928 paper on vernalization and plant physiology drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Later however, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly.\n\nEarly research on vernalization focused on plant physiology; the increasing availability of molecular biology has made it possible to unravel its underlying mechanisms. For example, a lengthening daylight period (longer days), \"as well as\" cold temperatures are required for winter wheat plants to go from the vegetative to the reproductive state; the three interacting genes are called \"VRN1\", \"VRN2\", and \"FT\" (\"VRN3\").\n\nDue to plant flowering requiring the successful co-operation of several metabolic pathways, computer models that incorporate vernalization have also been made.\n\n\"Arabidopsis thaliana\" (\"thale cress\") is a much-studied model for vernalization. Some ecotypes (varieties), called \"winter annuals\", have delayed flowering without vernalization; others (\"summer annuals\") do not. The genes that underlie this difference in plant physiology have been intensively studied.\n\nThe reproductive phase change of \"A. thaliana\" occurs by a sequence of two related events: first, the bolting transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears). Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for vernalization research.\n\nIn winter annual \"Arabidopsis\", vernalization of the meristem appears to confer competence to respond to floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence for as long as 300 days in the absence of an inductive signal.\n\nAt the molecular level, flowering is repressed by the protein \"Flowering Locus C\" (\"FLC\"), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering. Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active copy of the gene \"FRIGIDA\" (\"FRI\"), which promotes \"FLC\" expression, thus repression of flowering. Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of \"VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3\", which interacts with the \"VERNALIZATION2\" polycomb-like complex to reduce \"FLC\" expression through chromatin remodeling. The epigenetic silencing of \"FLC\" by chromatin remodeling is also thought to involve the cold-induced expression of antisense \"FLC COOLAIR\" or \"COLDAIR\" transcripts. Vernalization is registered by the plant by the stable silencing of individual \"FLC\" loci. The removal of silent chromatin marks at \"FLC\" during embryogenesis prevents the inheritance of the vernalized state \n\nSince vernalization also occurs in \"flc\" mutants (lacking \"FLC\"), vernalization must also activate a non-\"FLC\" pathway. A day-length mechanism is also important.\n\nIt is possible to devernalize a plant by \nexposure to sometimes low and high temperatures subsequent to vernalization. For example, commercial onion growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant's energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.\n\n"}

His father, Pyotr Pavlovich Astafyev, was a son of a relatively rich mill-owner (a part-time hunter who most of his time though spent at home), mother Lydia Ilyinichna Astafyeva (née Potylitsyna) came from a peasant family. In his 2000 autobiography Viktor Astafyev remembered his father's household as a place where men, led by grandfather Pavel Yakovlevich, were on continuous binge, while all the work was being organized and done by two women, Lydia and her mother-in-law, Maria Osipova, Pavel Yakovlevich's young second wife.\n\nIn 1931 two tragedies struck. First Pyotr, Pavel and the latter's father (Astafyev grand-grandfather) Yakov Maximovich were arrested as part of the Dekulakization campaign and sent to a Siberian labour camp. In July 1931 Lydia Ilyinichna, Viktor's mother drowned in the Yenisey as the boat which she was rowing, carrying food to the Krasnoyarsk prison where her arrested husband was kept, got upturned. That year Pyotr Astafyev received 5 years of prison as an \"Enemy of the people\" and was sent to the infamous Belomorkanal building-site. Seven-year-old Viktor found himself in the house of Yekaterina Petrovna and Ilya Yevgrafovich Potylitsyns, his mother’s parents who gave the boy all their love and care. In 1932 he joined a local primary school. His life in the early 1930s Astafyev later described in his book of short stories \"The Last Respect\" (Posledny Poklon, 1968).\n\nIn 1934 Pyotr Astafyev returned from labour camp and married again. He took Viktor to his new place, a small forest village Sosnovka, then in 1935 moved the family to Igarka where they settled as spetspereselentsy. Ignored by both his stepmother Taisiya Tcherkasova (who’s by now given birth to her own son, Nikolai) and father, the boy rioted and soon found himself on the street, homeless. In 1937 he was taken in an orphanage and joined the 5th form of its special school which years later he remembered with great affection. Two of the teachers, Rozhdestvensky and Sokolov, noticed artistic and literary abilities in the boy who by this time started to write poetry, and did a lot to encourage him. Years later he remembered: Critics for some reason tend to feel sorry for me and for the difficult childhood that I had. This vexes me a lot. More than that... Given such a chance, I’d have chosen the very same life, full of things, happiness, victories and defeats. The latter only help to see the world better, to feel kindness deeper. There would have been just one thing I'd have changed – asked fate to keep mother with me. [Long pause] Orphanage, wandering, the boarding school – all this I had to live through in Igarka. But there were other things – books and songs, skiing trips, childhood happiness, first tears of epiphany... It was there that for the first time I've heard the radio, the gramophone, the brass orchestra... And it was in Igarka that I wrote my first ever short story which my teacher Rozhdestvensky published in our school's self-edited journal. And the newspaper Bolshevik Zapolyarya published my 4-line verse. \nOn 1 May 1941, Astafyev graduated from the school and joined a brickyard as a transport worker. As the Great Patriotic War broke out, he was working in the Kureika station, a manual worker at local village Soviet. In August he left Igarka and joined the newly formed Railway school in Krasnoyarsk which he graduated in June 1942.\n\nIn October 1942 Astafyev volunteered for the Soviet Army and, after six months spent in reserve units (first in Berdsk, then in Novosibirsk) in April 1943 was moved to Kaluga region as a soldier of the 92nd Howitzer brigade of the Kiev-Zhitomir division. In May Astafyev went into action, taking part in fierce fighting conducted by the Bryansk, Voronezh and Steppe Fronts. In October he was injured while force-crossing Dnieper (that was where and when he lost his right eye) and on 25 November received his first award, For Courage medal. In January 1944 he returned to action, took part first in Korsun-Shevchenko operation, then (in March and April) in the Kamenets-Podolsky assault and on 25 April was awarded the Order of the Red Star.\n\nOn 17 September 1944, Astafyev was heavily injured near Polish town of Dukla and spent the next 8 months in hospitals. \"Since then I was unfit for an active service and was drifting from one reserve unit to another until I settled at the postal point of the 1st Ukrainian Front nearby Zhmerinka station. Here I met a fellow soldier, Maria Semyonovna Koryakina, married her after demobilization and went with her to her place in the town of Chusovoy of the Perm (then Molotov) oblast,\" he wrote in autobiography.\n\nThe horrible experience of war has remained with Astafyev forever, becoming the major incentive to become a writer. \"About the War... what do I know? Everything and nothing. I was a common soldier and we had our own, soldiers' truth. One rather glib author called it derogatively 'the truth from the trenches' and our 'point of view' – a 'hillock view'… But I felt like I had to tell about the everyday side of the war, of how the trenches smelt, of the way people there lived... The first killed, one of us. The first one you've killed. I had to write of all the monstrous things I've seen,\" he said years later in an interview.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1945 Astafyev settled for a while in his wife's parents' house in Chusovoy, then went to Krasnoyarsk, doing various jobs such as locksmith and smelter. In 1950 he started contributing to the Tchusovsky Rabochy (The Tchusovoy Worker) newspaper which in February 1951 published his debut short story \"A Civil Man\" (Grazhdansky tchelovek), which two years later was reprinted by the Perm-based Zvesda newspaper. In 1954 Astafyev was for the first time published by a Moscow magazine (short story \"Splinter\", in \"Smena\"). In 1955 he left the newspaper and started working upon his first novel \"Snows are Melting\" (Tayut Snega) which was published in 1958, as was his first book of short stories \"Warm Rain\" (Tyoply Dozhd), dedicated mostly to the experience of Russian soldiers and civilians during the German-Soviet War. Also in the late 1950s Astafyev joined the regional Perm radio. Working there provided relatively good wages but involved too much blatant propaganda. \"I decided to quit after 1,5 years, feeling that otherwise I'd just stop respecting myself altogether,\" he remembered. On 1 October 1958 Astafyev became the member of the RSFSR Union of Writers.\n\nIn 1959, Astafyev enrolled in the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow; he became friends with Sergey Vikulov, Yevgeny Nosov and a group of Vologda authors. One of several short novels of this period, \"The Old Oak\" (\"Starodub\", 1960), became Astafyev's first European publication: translated into Czech, in 1963 it was published in Prague. After 1962 Astafyev became a professional writer, his wife Maria helping out as a typist.\n\nIn 1969 Astafyev and his family moved to the city of Vologda where most of his literary friends lived. Several major books – \"Notches\" (Zatesi), \"Mountain Pass\", \"The Last Respect\" (book 1), \"Shepherd and His Wife\" followed in the early 1970s and won Astafyev (now the Order of the Red Banner of Labour two-times chevalier) the RSFSR State Maxim Gorky Prize in December 1975. A year later \"Nash Sovremennik\" published \"The Tsar Fish\", one of his most famous short stories (which gave the title to the compilation). His debut play \"The Bird-Cherry Tree\" was premiered at the Moscow Yermolova theatre, also in 1976. On 19 October 1978, for the \"Tsar-Fish\" book Astafyev received the USSR State Prize.\n\nIn 1981 the first edition of \"The Complete Astafyev\" in 4 volumes came out. By this time the author bought himself a house in his native Ovsyanka and moved his family to Krasnoyarsk. The first TV documentary (shot by director M.Litvyakov) \"Viktor Astafyev\" was shown in 1983. By 1984 four films based on his work came out, including \"Falling Stars\" by Igor Talankin and Arkady Sirenko's \"Born Twice\", the latter featuring Astafyev as a scriptwriter. Great resonance had his novel \"Sad Detective\" (1986), as well as a set of 1987 short stories, including controversial \"The Catching of Cudgeons in Georgia\". In 1988–1989 Astavyev visited France (where his \"Sad Detective\" was published), Bulgaria (to oversee his 1966 short novel \"The Theft\" being screened) and Greece and took part in the 1989 Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. The epic novel \"The Cursed and the Slain\" (Proklyaty i Ubity, books 1 and 2, 1992–1993) brought Astafyev The State Prize of the Russian Federation in May 1996. The same month Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Ovsyanka to meet Astafyev. In 1998 the 15-volumes Krasnoyarsk edition of \"The Complete Astafyev\" came out.\n\nAstafyev's last years were not happy ones. In 2000 he suffered a stroke. Not long before his death Astafyev wrote his last words: \"I entered a world that was kind and open and I loved it wholeheartedly. I leave a world that is alien, evil and vile and I have nothing to say to all of you by way of farewells.\" Viktor Astafyev died on 29 November 2001, in Krasnoyarsk. He was buried in his native Ovsyanka.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he became embroiled in significant controversy over his writings followed by accusations of chauvinism and xenophobia when the public learned, through samizdat, about the correspondence between the literary historian Natan Eidelman and Astafyev that had been provoked by alleged racist overtones in Astafyev's work \"Sad Detective\" and his \"The Catching of Gudgeons in Georgia\" (both 1986), the latter deemed offensive by the Georgian readership. At the 8th USSR Writers Union Congress in the summer of 1986, Georgian delegates urged the author to apologize publicly for his insult to the Georgian nation; when he refused, they walked out in protest. In October 1993, he signed the Letter of Forty-Two. \nIn 1999, his novel \"Jolly Soldier\", which portrayed the horrors of the Soviet Army was met with extremely adverse reaction, which may have brought about a heart failure.\n\nIn the years when many Soviet war literature authors (like Fyodor Parfyonov or Ivan Stadnyuk) were singing paeans to an idealized, invincible Soviet war hero, crashing the enemy under the Communist Party leadership, Viktor Astafyev became one of the first to rebel against the officially-approved convention and reveal the darker, unglamorous side of what was happening in 1941–1945. He is credited with being one of the major proponents (alongside Viktor Nekrasov, Vasyl Bykov, Vladimir Bogomolov, Konstantin Vorobyov) of the so-called The Truth from the Trenches (okopnaya pravda) movement (the term was used originally in a derogatory sense by detractors who argued that formers soldier could not be trusted to write about the Great war objectively, being ignorant of its greater 'truths') which brought authenticity and harsh realism to the Soviet war literature.\n\nDavid Gillespie summed up his career as follows:Astafyev has always been a highly individual writer who conforms to no movements or stereotypes... He has always remained true to himself, and has retained a certain hard-edged integrity. His novel \"Prokliaty i ubity\" [The Damned and the Dead] is a gritty, typically uncompromising picture of war, with many naturalistic descriptions in a style the author has developed since the cathartic \"Pechal'nyi detektiv\". Astafyev remains very much a writer who refuses to be easily categorized: he is neither a Village Prose Writer, nor a writer of \"war prose\", nor a writer who explores the mistakes of the recent Soviet past. At the same time, he is all of these. Capable of surprising and even shocking his reader, Astafev maintains a deep lyrical sense that has produced what Eidel'man called \"the best descriptions of nature for decades\". More than any other writer living in Russia today (with the possible exception of Solzhenitsyn), he is a writer who examines man as subjected to and moulded by the total Soviet experience.\n\nKrasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University is named in his honour.\n\n\n\n\n"}
