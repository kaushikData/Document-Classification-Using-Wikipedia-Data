Between six and nine Basque dialects have been historically distinguished:\n\n\nIn modern times, however, both Lower Navarrese and Lapurdian are considered part of a Navarrese–Lapurdian dialect, so there would be five dialects, divided into 11 subdialects and 24 minor varieties.\nThe boundaries of all these dialects do not coincide directly with current political or administrative boundaries. It was believed that the dialect boundaries between Bizkaian, Gipuzkoan and Upper Navarrese showed some relation to some pre-Roman tribal boundaries between the Caristii, Varduli and Vascones. However, main Basque dialectologists now deny any direct relation between those tribes and Basque dialects. It seems that these dialects were created in the Middle Ages from a previously quite unified Basque language, and the dialects diverged from each other since then as a result of the administrative and political division that happened in the Basque Country.\n\nOne of the first scientific studies of Basque dialects, regarding the auxiliary verb forms, was made by Louis-Lucien Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. His original dialect map, \"Carte des Sept Provinces Basques\", was published in 1869 along with his \"Le Verbe Basque en Tableaux\" was regarded as the authoritative guide in Basque dialectology for a century. He collected his data in fieldwork between 1856 and 1869 in five visits to the Basque Country. By then, the Basque language was in retreat throughout the territory in which it had been commonly spoken. In Álava, Basque had all but vanished from the Plains and the Highlands, remaining only in the stronghold of Aramaio and bordering fringes of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, while in Navarre the scholar collected the last live evidence in areas extending as far south as Tafalla.\nIn 1998, Koldo Zuazo, Professor of Basque Philology at the University of the Basque Country, redefined the dialect classifications slightly. For example, he changed the name of Biscayan to Western, Gipuzkoan to Central, Upper Navarrese to Navarrese. He also grouped Lapurdian with Lower Navarrese, distinguished Eastern Navarrese as an independent dialect, and recognised several mixed areas:\n\nMuch has been studied too on the Basque dialect spoken formerly in Álava. In 1997, Zuazo released research carried out on the issue based on dispersed recorded evidence (such as Landuchio's glossary) and papers drawn up especially by Koldo Mitxelena. The pundit outlines three main linguistic areas running north to south, where features related to Western and Navarrese dialects mix up to different degrees according to their geographical position.\n\nHe focuses mainly on relevant lexico-morphological differences, such as instrumental declension marks -gaz/rekin, ablative -rean/tik, barria/berria (= 'new'), elexea/elizea (= 'church'), padura/madura (= 'swamp'), to mention but a few.\n\nKey distinguishing features in Basque dialect phonology include:\n\nModern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence. However, cross-dialectal communication without prior knowledge of either Standard Basque or the other dialect is normally possible to a reasonable extent, with the notable of exception of Zuberoan (also called Souletin), which is regarded as the most divergent Basque dialect.\n\nThe names for the language in the dialects of Basque (\"Euskara\" in Standard Basque) for example exemplify to some degree the dialectal fragmentation of the Basque speaking area. The most divergent forms are generally found in the Eastern dialects.\n\nThe following map shows the approximate areas where each word is used. The smaller-type instances are cases of the name being recorded for a particular area, the larger-type instances show super-regional forms common throughout the dialect area in question:\nComparing the forms of the Basque verb used in the different Basque dialects also gives a good overview over some of the differences and common features.\n\nKey to verb forms:\n\nBasque dialects all diverge from this standard inventory to a larger or lesser extent. The grapheme \"j\" (historically /j/) displays by far the most noticeable divergence, followed by the fricatives and affricates. Hualde (1991) describes the following:\n\nThere have been various attempts throughout history to promote standardised forms of Basque dialects to the level of a common standard Basque.\n\n\n"}

These occur in the natural language processing subfield of computer science and assign probabilities to given sequences of words by means of a probability distribution. Statistical language models are key components of speech recognition systems and of many machine translation systems: they tell such systems which possible output word sequences are probable and which are improbable. The particular characteristic of a cache language model is that it contains a cache component and assigns relatively high probabilities to words or word sequences that occur elsewhere in a given text. The primary, but by no means sole, use of cache language models is in speech recognition systems.\n\nTo understand why it is a good idea for a statistical language model to contain a cache component one might consider someone who is dictating a letter about elephants to a speech recognition system. Standard (non-cache) N-gram language models will assign a very low probability to the word \"elephant\" because it is a very rare word in English. If the speech recognition system does not contain a cache component the person dictating the letter may be annoyed: each time the word \"elephant\" is spoken another sequence of words with a higher probability according to the N-gram language model may be recognized (e.g., \"tell a plan\"). These erroneous sequences will have to be deleted manually and replaced in the text by \"elephant\" each time \"elephant\" is spoken. If the system has a cache language model, \"elephant\" will still probably be misrecognized the first time it is spoken and will have to be entered into the text manually; however, from this point on the system is aware that \"elephant\" is likely to occur again – the estimated probability of occurrence of \"elephant\" has been increased, making it more likely that if it is spoken it will be recognized correctly. Once \"elephant\" has occurred several times the system is likely to recognize it correctly every time it is spoken until the letter has been completely dictated. This increase in the probability assigned to the occurrence of \"elephant\" is an example of a consequence of machine learning and more specifically of pattern recognition.\n\nThere exist variants of the cache language model in which not only single words but also multi-word sequences that have occurred previously are assigned higher probabilities (e.g., if \"San Francisco\" occurred near the beginning of the text subsequent instances of it would be assigned a higher probability).\n\nThe cache language model was first proposed in a paper published in 1990, after which the IBM speech-recognition group experimented with the concept. The group found that implementation of a form of cache language model yielded a 24% drop in word-error rates once the first few hundred words of a document had been dictated. A detailed survey of language modeling techniques concluded that the cache language model was one of the few new language modeling techniques that yielded improvements over the standard N-gram approach: \"Our caching results show that caching is by far the most useful technique for perplexity reduction at small and medium training data sizes\".\n\nThe development of the cache language model has generated considerable interest among those concerned with computational linguistics in general and statistical natural language processing in particular: recently there has been interest in applying the cache language model in the field of statistical machine translation.\n\nThe success of the cache language model in improving word prediction rests on the human tendency to use words in a \"bursty\" fashion: when one is discussing a certain topic in a certain context the frequency with which one uses certain words will be quite different from their frequencies when one is discussing other topics in other contexts. The traditional N-gram language models, which rely entirely on information from a very small number (four, three, or two) of words preceding the word to which a probability is to be assigned, do not adequately model this \"burstiness\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1199716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1199716", "title": "Capsizing", "text": "Capsizing\n\nCapsizing or keeling over occurs when a boat or ship is turned on its side or it is upside down in the water. The act of reversing a capsized vessel is called righting.\nIf a capsized vessel has enough flotation to prevent sinking, it may recover on its own if it is not stable inverted. Vessels of this design are called self-righting.\n\nIn dinghy sailing, a practical distinction can be made between being knocked down (to 90 degrees) which is called a capsize, and being inverted, which is called being turtled. Small dinghies frequently capsize in the normal course of use and can usually be recovered by the crew. Some types of dinghy are occasionally deliberately capsized, as capsizing and righting the vessel again can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat.\n\nCapsizing (but not necessarily turtling) is an inherent part of dinghy sailing. It is not a question of \"if\" but a question of \"when\". For those who do not want the experience, a keelboat monohull has physics on its side. But even yachts can capsize and turtle in extraordinary conditions, so design considerations are important. Such events can overcome skill and experience; boats need to be appropriate for foreseeable conditions.\nA capsized kayak may be righted with a roll or eskimo rescue. As long as the kayaker knows how to react, the water is not too shallow, and the location is not close to dangers that require evasive action by the kayaker – which cannot be taken while capsized – capsizing itself is usually not considered dangerous. In whitewater kayaking, capsizing occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport.\n\nFor sailing vessels, the \"capsize ratio\" is a commonly published number used as a guideline for safe operation, where a ratio of less than 2.0 is considered suitable for offshore operation. However the only variables that go into \"capsize ratio\" are a vessel's beam and its displacement, and a thorough assessment of ship stability needs to consider various other factors.\n\nA vessel may be designated as \"self-righting\" if it is designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew on board). Most small craft intended as lifeboats with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are self-righting.\n\nIn a storm, even large vessels may be rolled by being hit broadside by a large wave or \"pitchpoled\" stem over stern in extreme waves. This is normally catastrophic for larger ships, and smaller yachts can be dismasted (i.e., lose their masts and rigging) due to the drag as the boat is forced to roll over.\n\nAmong ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship is more prone to capsizing as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of where the doors were accidentally left open), and one of the largest peacetime maritime disasters when MS Estonia sank off of the Finnish archipelago, water entering the car-deck is subject to the free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.\n\nA ship that is holed may capsize. In 2012 the very large cruise ship \"\" was holed, lost its propulsion, and drifted into shallow water where she partially sank, resting on her side with most of her structure out of the water. Technically, this was not a capsize as her bottom was only partly exposed; rather this was a partial sinking.\n\nA vessel which capsizes without being holed may allow water to enter in places normally above the waterline. The ship may not then be able to right itself; stability and safety will be compromised even if the vessel is righted.\n\nIn competitive yacht racing, a capsized boat has certain special rights as it cannot maneuver. A boat is deemed capsized when the mast is touching the water; when it is fully inverted, it is said to have turned turtle or turtled. Good racers can often recover from a capsize with minimal loss of time.\n\nThe capsize can result from extreme broaching, especially if the keel has insufficient leverage to tilt the vessel upright.\n\nMotor life boats are designed to be self-righting if capsized, but most other motorboats are not.\n\nIntermediate sailors are encouraged to capsize their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat's floating properties and the capsize process. The boat is then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, so that in the event of an uncontrolled capsize, the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover.\n\nMost small monohull sailboats can normally be righted by standing or pulling down on the centreboard, daggerboard (or bilgeboard in a ) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending on the design of the hull, the boat's righting moment will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans use a small flotation device mounted at the tip of the mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).\n\nIn both cases, having a crew member lift the end of the mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the greatest challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.\n\nCare is taken not to let the boat swing all the way over and capsize on the other side, frequently with the crew on the bottom. This is more likely if the boat is not pointed into the wind.\n\nThere is a wide range of technology that can be installed or strategically placed to prevent or deter a boat or ship from capsizing. The various technologies rely on inflating airbags also known as lift bags which increasing the vessel's buoyancy with the water.\n\nCapsizing in yachts can occur when water is able to infiltrate the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to capsizing. Yachts can be deployed with a flotation system which is a series of strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the vessel's buoyancy and filling void space where water can collect, providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate.\n\nWhen larger ships such as cargo ships and tankers capsize or sink not only is recovery not possible but great environment damage can occur from spillage of cargo. Larger ships are being equipped with Surfacing System for Ship Recovery which is an inflatable device that is installed in the ballast water tank or within the hull of the vessel and can be deployed within seconds of an accident to stabilize the vessel and give more time for rescue and evacuation.\n\n\n\n"}

The instrument of class action will not confer any new rights or create new claims but will only provide new ways of asserting these. Some European states already have proceedings which are similar to class action, others have introduced compromises, such as legal action taken by associations, although most EU member states do not have any such instruments.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3129075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3129075", "title": "Coving (urban planning)", "text": "Coving (urban planning)\n\nCoving is a method of urban planning used in subdivision and redevelopment of cities characterized by non-uniform lot shapes and home placement. When combined with winding roads, lot area is increased and road area reduced. Coving is used as an alternative to conventional urban \"grid\" and suburban zoning-driven land development layouts in order to enhance curb appeal, eliminate monotony, reduce costs, such as road surfacing and street length, while increasing the amount of land available for construction.\n\nCoving was pioneered by Minneapolis-based urban designer Rick Harrison. His design intent was that no two houses look directly into each other's windows. The name comes from coves of green spaces among the homes which are made possible by winding roads and meandering setbacks.\n\nCoving was first discovered by accident when Rick Harrison was experimenting with design options on a Chicago subdivision layout in 1990. By the meandering of setbacks and the elimination of pavement bubbles running the calculations through Land Innovation software it was discovered that street pavement was reduced 20%. Assuming it was a software error, the site was manually checked. What he had discovered was that by a careful meandering of the homes to form curved shapes separate from the direction of the street, there could be a significant reduction in street length. Coving has led to many new discoveries and pioneering design methods and techniques as well as new software technologies and user interfaces. Currently Coving is in its fourth generation, and has demonstrated an average reduction of public street length by 25% while maintaining density of conventional (curved street) subdivision platting. More recently in 2013, advancements in architecture were made possible by the lot shaping and open space interconnection with living spaces within the home - redefining architecture as well as land planning.\n\nAnother area where coved design has made advancement is in the realm of Urban Redevelopment. By abandoning excessive streets and right-of-ways a demonstrated reduction of public street of upwards of 60% can redefine how inner core suburban (typically tight gridded lots) are redeveloped. This model was first created at the beginning of the 2008 recession and is being proposed in blighted urban spaces to bring about housing affordability and increased quality of life.\n\nA coved layout reduces construction costs by reducing roadway length, thereby lowering paving and utility-line costs. The reduction in road surface adds usable land for lots and parks. Other benefits are increased pedestrian safety due to less road and fewer intersections. Individual properties also gain aesthetic value from the separate meandering setback lines, sidewalks, and roadways.\nVery early coved design (first generation) were somewhat experimental with potential problems:\n\nCoving has been cited as having several disadvantages: greater set-back from the street, larger lots, reduced usability for mixed application, decreased walkability, decreased street and pedestrian connectivity of a tract to its surroundings, increased suburban sprawl, leaving little or no public open space, and allowing more soil runoff and less communal open space than alternate development types such as urban cluster and new urbanism.\n\nIn an effort to eliminate any negative elements of the design, research was done to visit early coved sites and query both residents and cities to revise and update the design methods. Along with receiving comments from land developers and builders, coved design had gone through 4 iterations of evolution. Today's coved designs have better vehicular flow reducing energy and time in transit, direct and connective pedestrian systems with safer and elegant meandering walks, as well as curve radii standards that reduce excessive infrastructure of early designs. These comparisons are for traditional curved subdivision designs as well as the New Urbanism or smart growth methods of planning. In the top two images on this page, the before TND, or Smart Growth design has 54 street intersections and 38% more street length than the coved design of the same housing mix and density. The coved plan has much better walking connectivity and is far safer with less interaction between vehicles and people. More important is that the average lot size increases 15% and monotony is eliminated. As with all coved development, the design methods accomplish all of this and more by exceeding every existing regulatory minimum. Coved development is unique in all of land planning in that it actually gains efficiency by exceeding existing regulatory minimums, it is the first method of design with such a claim to boast. What this means is there is nothing special to request for approvals - the design exceeds the regulatory minimums.\n\nAn external early commentary was made about the covered design methods:\n\nDesigning coved developments is considered comparatively difficult. Specialized software is often used and designers often need several years of experience to become proficient. The design also isn't feasible for narrow tracts of land, and house footprints need to be less than 85% of the lot size.\nExisting CAD based software is not intended to create plans that are not based upon replication. With coved design there is little if any replication. LandMentor, a software product can produce plans using coving concepts within an acceptable time frame.\n\n"}

He was arrested, tortured, and killed by the Turkish authorities during the Armenian Genocide.\n\nErukhan was born in 1870 in the city of Constantinople. He received his childhood education from the Nersesian institution, an old and shabby building serving as a school. Erukhan based one of his humorous characters in the novel “The Lord’s Daughter” (Armenian: Ամիրային Աղջիկը) on the school’s principal: Constantine Abantarian. As a student, Erukhan was said to be a lazy and weak student. He had a particular distaste for mathematics, saying that the first individuals that he detested in his life were his mathematics teachers.\n\nIn 1886, his father pushed him to pursue a career in medicine but a family friend persuaded him to enroll his son in the newly opened Central College (Armenian: Կեդրոնական Վարժարան). Erukhan enrolled in the school, but he was unable to be a first-rate student. Ironically, he was even mediocre in Armenian literature. He fell ill during the end of year exam session and was unable to write his exams. His appeal for make up examinations was refused and he dropped out of the institution. \n\nBeing from a poor family, he was forced to quickly find work. He worked for a week alongside a trader before being fired supposedly because he “wasn’t the man for the job”. \nDuring the next two years, Erukhan devoted himself to reading a multitude of novels from various European and Armenian writers, he also became fluent in the French language. He then joined the editing team of the newspaper East (Armenian: Արեւելք) as translator. He eventually started writing his own material, and his talent was spotted by the great Armenian writers of the time Zohrab and Arpiarian. He was encouraged to continue writing and his works were continually published in the newspapers East (Armenian: Արեւելք) and Masis (Armenian: Մասիս).\n\nIn 1896, during the Hamidian massacres, he fled the country, alongside many other Armenian intellectuals. He settled in Bulgaria, where he wrote for the newspaper Shavigh (Armenian: Շաւիղ) and worked as a teacher as well. In 1904, he moved to Egypt where he took charge of the editing of Light Bringer (Armenian: Լուսաբեր) newspaper. He got married to one of his former students in 1905.\n\n\"The Lord’s Daughter\" (Amirayin aghchige, Armenian: Ամիրային աղջիկը) is possibly one of the best works in Western Armenian literature. The author portrays a tragedy about the disparity between two classes of Armenians living in Constantinople.\n\n\"The Legitimate Son\" (Harazad vortin, Armenian: Հարազատ որդին) is a spiritual novel about a husband who thinks his wife has wronged him and that their son is therefore illegitimate. The father is tormented about the thought and finally commits suicide.\n\nErukhan wrote many short stories describing the hard yet simple life of fishermen, firemen and porters. These works were gathered and published in Paris in 1942. He also had many published articles throughout the years in various newspapers.\n\nErukhan can be classified as a realist that came from a younger generation of Armenian writers. He was preceded by Zohrab and other realist novelists. In a career spanning a quarter century, he wrote approximately sixty short novels and two novels. His stories are of great value to historians because he was able to depict in great details the daily setting of many characters. His accurate descriptions have become a form of documented history of those specific individuals and their respective environment. He provides great insight into the careers, social norms, social hierarchy, ideologies and even gossip of that specific era. This author didn’t look to the aristocracy for his storylines, but instead embraced the commoner as his main source of character depictions. The reader truly feels the joys and the pains of these common people in his novels.\n\nHe was convinced that work and hard labor truly molded men into better people and made them better able to appreciate life. The ones that struggled to bring food on the table were purer of heart than those who did not, according to him. He truly did sympathize with the poor, but did recognize their bravery and their resolute nature. His stories can be seen as a sort of homage to those who have never received any.\n\nHis language is usually simple but it does sometimes get clogged with a more difficult vocabulary and many nuanced comparisons. The influence of other prominent writers of his époque can be seen in some of his writings.\n\nHe returned to Constantinople in 1908, where he became principal of his former school: the Central College. Five years later, he moved to Kharberd (Nor Kyurin) (Armenian: Խարբերդ) where he took an administrative role in a local school. April 24, 1915 signaled the start of the Armenian Genocide. Erukhan, along with a priest, was arrested and thrown in jail shortly after that date. They were tortured for many days, after which they were chained and made to walk to streets of Kharberd. The Turkish soldiers herded them outside the city and shot Erukhan and the priest. His wife and two children were killed in the death marches leading to Deir ez-Zor.\n\nTranslated from Armenian: N.A.

{"id": "554592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=554592", "title": "Finnish verb conjugation", "text": "Finnish verb conjugation\n\nVerbs in the Finnish language can be divided into six main groups depending on the stem type, both for formal analysis and for teaching the language to non-native speakers. All six types have the same set of personal endings, but the stems assume different suffixes and undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.\n\nThe article on Finnish language grammar has more about verbs and other aspects of Finnish grammar.\n\nTables of conjugation are given here for the regular verb, of type I \"puhua\" (to speak), as used in the formal, written language. Verb conjugation in the everyday spoken language is somewhat different.\n\nThe present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect correspond fairly well to English: \"speaks\", \"spoke\", \"has spoken\", and \"had spoken\", respectively or in the passive voice, \"it is spoken\", \"it was spoken\", \"it has been spoken\", and \"it had been spoken\". The auxiliary verb \"ei\" used for negation, usually with the naked stem of the main verb but with the past participle in the negative imperfect. Finnish lacks a true future tense, so normally the present tense is used for future time as well.\n\nThe conditional mood corresponds mostly to \"would\" or \"should\" or to the past subjunctive in English. (Finnish lacks a subjunctive mood.) The potential mood is rather rare, and corresponds to \"may\" or \"might\" in English. The perfect forms of these moods are easily understood as \"would have\", \"should have\", \"might have\", etc.\n\nThe first and third person imperative forms here correspond to English \"let us speak\", \"let him not speak\", \"let it not be spoken\", etc. The perfect imperative is still valid, if somewhat awkward and contrived: as English \"let it (not) have been spoken\". The first person plural imperative \"puhukaamme\" sounds rather formal and archaic so in everyday speech, the passive present indicative, \"puhutaan\", is used instead, but it may not quite be considered correct. There are many variations of the imperative forms: in old writings, one may also see the forms \"puhukaat\" or \"puhukaatte\" for the second person plural, \"puhukaan\" for the third person plural, or \"puhuttakaan\" for the passive. In the passive or third person, the imperative is sometimes used for the present or perfect subjunctive of other languages, a mood lacking in Finnish.\n\nThe and the correspond best to \"I am to speak\" and \"I was to speak\" in English. It is not correct Finnish to use these tenses in the plural: the plural form of the present participle, \"puhuvat\", would be confusing if used in this sense, as it resembles too closely the third person plural present indicative. Despite the apparently equivalent use of the present participle, the grammatical aspect of these tenses is prospective rather than continuous or progressive as in English.\n\nVerbs of obligation such as \"täytyä\", \"tarvita\", \"pitää\", and \"tulla\", with the meanings \"must\", \"need to\", \"ought to\", \"shall\", respectively are often used in the agent form of construction in which the verb is not conjugated for person but is in the impersonal third person singular. Here\n\nThere is no equivalent of this type of construction in English.\n\nThe verb \"täytyä\" can be used only in this construction and therefore has no other personal forms. The other verbs can carry personal endings in other forms of construction with the normal subject, verb, and object in which the obligation is less strong or in which the verb takes on a different meaning altogether.\n\n\nIn Finnish there are five infinitive forms, with past and present participles for both active and passive voices.\n\nFirst infinitive is the dictionary form of the verb: \"puhu-a\" = \"to speak\" (stem \"puhu\"), and it corresponds in meaning and function to the English infinitive introduced by the particle \"to\". The suffix of the first infinitive depends on the type of the verb stem. With so-called \"vowel\" stems, (see verbs of Type I, below), the first infinitive suffix is \"-a\"/\"-ä\", whereas with \"consonantal\" stems, (types IV-VI), the suffix is most often \"-ta\"/\"-tä\". With vowel stems that consist of a single open syllable ending in a long vowel or a diphthong or longer stems that end in such syllables, (Type II), the infinitive suffix is \"-da\"/\"-dä\": \"saa-da\" = \"to get\", \"syö-dä\" = \"to eat\", \"reagoi-da\" = \"to react\". The first infinitive of consonantal stems always has the weak consonant grade in the stem, e.g., \"karata\" = \"to flee\" < stem \"karkaa-\".\n\nIt can be used in a sentence similarly to the English infinitive and stand for a subject or a direct object, without any additional inflection. It is also governed by modal verbs like \"saattaa\" \"might\" or \"voida\" \"be able to\": \"saattaa mennä\" = \"might go\" or \"voi hakea\" = \"can fetch\".\n\nIt has a so-called \"long form\", with the ending of the nominal translative case and an obligatory possessive suffix. The long form is usually associated with the literary register. It connotes either extent or intent:\nIn spoken Finnish, intent is often expressed with the short form infinitive if the subject is implicit or understood by context or more explicitly with a subordinate clause containing a conditional verb: \"että minä muistaisin\". Nevertheless, the long form is still used to signify extent; another example: \"tietä-ä\" = \"to know\", \"tietä-ä-kse-ni\" = \"as far as I know\".\n\nThe first infinitive generally take on no inflected forms. It appears only in the short (dictionary) form and in the long form, and the long form is not used without a possessive suffix.\n\nThe second infinitive may be formed from the first infinitive by replacing the final 'a/ä' with an 'e'. It occurs in the instructive and inessive cases. If the second infinitive has a subject, the subject is put in the genitive case; in the inessive case, the second infinitive also accepts a possessive suffix if it is appropriate.\n\nThe instructive form conveys manner of action corresponding approximately with \"-ing\" or \"-ingly\" in English, less commonly with \"-ande/ende\" in Swedish and very commonly with \"-ant\" in French. It is parallel in function and meaning to the Russian adverbial participle (as opposed to the adjectival participle):\n\nThe inessive form conveys coterminal action, something happening at the same time as something else. More properly, it is seen as some action whose accomplishment simultaneously brings about the accomplishment of something else. It corresponds approximately in English to the use of \"when\", \"while\", or the somewhat archaic or British \"whilst\"; strict co-terminality is still expressed in English with \"in\" or\"by\", the present participle \"-ing\" and any subject in the possessive case in a manner analogous to the Finnish, like in French with \"\"en\" and the present participle \"-ant\"\":\n\nThe inessive of this infinitive also has a passive form:\nbut it is ambiguous and could be taken for the active inessive infinitive II of the causative \"tiedettää\", \"to make (someone) know\"\n\nThe third infinitive is formed by adding the ending \"-ma/mä\" to the hard grade of the present stem. It is a noun in its own right, denoting \"the act\" of a verb. It is fully declineable as a noun, but some of the cases have special or commonly understood meanings. The illative of the third infinitive is a common inchoative, governed by such verbs as \"ruveta\" and \"joutua\":\nThe elative is used in the sense of forbidding or discouraging an action.\nThe adessive is used to tell how the action is done.\nAlso with a possessive suffix.\n\nIn Finnish, the passive participle cannot be used when the agent is expressed. Finnish uses forms ending in \"-ma/mä\" that are formally identical to the third infinitive. (Some authors include it as one of the uses of the third infinitive; others list it under the special name \"agentive participle\".) The agentive participle is never used when the agent is not expressed, and it must be used in all situations that one wishes to use the passive and express the agent:\nAs expected for a participle, it agrees with the head noun; in the following, the ending \"-mia\" and \"kirjeita\" 'letters' are in the partitive plural:\n\nThe fourth infinitive is formed just like the third but with the ending \"-minen\", which is declined like all other Finnish nouns in \"-nen\". It is also a noun but its meaning is more \"the process\" rather than the very act of a verb. This often corresponds to \"-ation\" words in English:\nThe use of this form as a proper infinitive rather than an \"action noun\" is generally restricted to forms such as the following in which it implies a sort of obligation:\nor this construction, where the finite verb is repeated in the partitive with a possessive suffix:\n\nThe rarely-used fifth infinitive is a \"diminutive\" of the third infinitive. It is apparently used only in the adessive plural with a possessive suffix. It indicates that at some point, the action of the verb is \"but little\" accomplished:\n\nThe active present participle is formed by adding \"-va/vä\" to the hard grade of the present indicative stem of the verb.\n\nThere is also a passive present participle formed by adding the same ending to the passive stem:\nThis form is also ambiguous: it could equally well be the active present participle of the causative \"puhuttaa\", \"to cause (someone) to speak\", thus:\n\nThe active past participle is usually formed by adding \"-nut/nyt\" to the short stem, omitting any epenthetic vowel. Verbs of type III (ending in \"-lla/llä\", \"-rra/rrä\", and \"-sta/stä\") assimilate the \"n\" of this ending:\nThe stem of the active past participle, for all other cases except the nominative singular, ends in \"-nee-\", which may be likewise assimilated. See tables of conjugation.\n\nSee Agentive Participle above.\n\nThe passive past participle has the ending \"-tu/ty\" or \"-ttu/tty\" to the soft grade of the stem. For a verb of type I, a final -a/ä- of the stem is replaced by -e- for the passive past participle:\nThe passive past participle is subject to consonant gradation:\nand for verbs of type III:\n\nAll other passive forms of the verb may be regularly derived from the passive past participle by replacing the final \"-u/y\" with the following endings:\n\nThe following table shows the basic changes and marks for conjugating each of the types of Finnish verbs:\n\nThey are verbs whose infinitive forms end in vowel + \"a/ä\", for example \"puhua\" = \"to speak\", \"tietää\" = \"to know\". The group contains a very large number of verbs. Here is how \"tietää\" conjugates in the present indicative:\n\nThe personal endings are \"-n\", \"-t\", \"-(doubled final vowel)\", \"-mme\", \"-tte\", \"-vat\". The inflecting stem is formed by dropping the final \"-a/ä\" of the infinitive and has a strong-grade consonant in the third-person forms and weak-grade elsewhere. For the third person plural, it is an exception to the general rule for strong grade.\n\nIn the simple case (which applies to most type I verbs), the imperfect indicative is formed by inserting the characteristic marker \"i\" between the stem and the personal endings, which are the same as in the present tense except that the vowel does not double in the third person singular:\n\nHowever, the insertion of the \"i\" often has an effect on the stem. Of type I verbs, one notable exception is \"tietää\":\n\n\"ymmärtää\" = 'to understand' also follows this pattern. Changes of stem for other verb types will be discussed in the relevant sections below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith verbs whose first infinitive ends in vowel + \"da\" ( \"juoda\" = 'to drink', \"syödä\" = 'to eat'), it is a fairly large group of verbs partly because one way in which foreign borrowings are incorporated into the Finnish verb paradigms is to add \"oida\": \"organisoida\" = 'to organise'.\n\nAnother important verb of this type is \"voida\" = 'to be able/allowed to'.\n\nThe stem is formed by removing \"da\" with no vowel doubling in the third person singular: juon, juot, juo, juomme, juotte, juovat.\n\nFor these verbs whose stems end in two vowels, the first of the vowels is lost when the \"i\" is added in the imperfect:\n\"juon = 'I drink', \"join\" = 'I drank'.\n\nThere is an exception to the rule if the stem already ends in an \"i\" (\"voida\" or the \"-oida\" verbs mentioned earlier). Then, the stem does not change between present and imperfect indicative so the imperfect forms are the same as the present forms, and the distinction between them must be made from context.\n\nPassives are formed in the same way:\n\nVerbs have a first infinitive ending in two consonants + \"a\": \"mennä\" = 'to go'. Another way of looking at the verbs is that they have verb stems ending in a consonant to which a vowel must be added (\"e\" for the present tense or \"i\" for the past tense) before the personal ending. The final consonant of the stem is generally emphasised by length in the infinitive and participle forms and so is written as a double consonant. If the consonant ending of the stem is -s, however, the dictionary form of the verb ends with -stä or -sta. It is another large group of verbs.\n\nThe stem is formed by removing the \"a\" and its preceding consonant, and \"e\" followed is added, followed by the personal endings: menen, menet, menee, menemme, menette, menevät.\n\nThe \"i\" of the imperfect is added directly to the stem formed as for the present tense, and the personal endings are added:\n\"pestä\" = 'to clean', \"pesen\" = 'I clean', \"pesin\" = 'I cleaned' etc.\n\n\n\nTypes IV-VI have a first infinitive ending in a vowel and \"ta/tä\". Most commonly, type IV verbs end with \"ata/ätä\", \"ota/ötä\", \"uta/ytä\", but other vowels are possible: \"tavata\" = \"to meet\", \"pilkata\" = \"to mock\", \"vastata\" = \"to answer\", \"haluta\" = \"to want\", \"tarjota\" = \"to offer\".\n\nThe stem used in present indicative conjugation is formed by dropping the \"-ta/-tä\" suffix from the infinitive form and adding \"a/ä\". In conjugation, the normal personal ending is added; the final vowel is doubled in the third person singular unless the stem already ends in \"aa/ää\":\n\nThe consonant in the stem appears in the strong grade.\n\nThe imperfect stem can be obtained from the infinitive by changing the final \"t\" to \"s\" followed by the usual imperfect marker \"i\"; the stem consonant appears in the strong grade: \"halusi-n\" = \"I wanted\", \"tapasi-t\" = \"you met\", \"vastasi\", \"he answered\", etc.\n\nPassives in this type are formed in the same fashion as for type I verbs; as in type I, the stem consonant appears in the weak grade:\n\nAll verbs have infinitives ending in \"ita/itä\". There are few members, but \"tarvita\" = \"to need\" is a common example.\n\nThe indicative stem may be obtained by dropping the final \"a\" and adding \"-se\": tarvitsen, tarvitset, tarvitsee, tarvitsemme, tarvitsette, tarvitsevat.\n\n\"-si\" takes the place of \"-se\", but in the third-person singular, there is only one vowel: \"tarvitsin, tarvitsit, tarvitsi, tarvitsimme, tarvitsitte, tarvitsivat\".\n\nThe passive forms of these verbs are built just like those of type IV; both types end in \"-ta\".\n\nAlmost all verbs have infinitives ending in 'eta' (notable exceptions are \"parata\" = \"to improve/become better\" and \"huonota\" = \"to deteriorate/become worse\"). There are not many verbs in this category, and they tend to be uncommon. However, it is a fairly common route for turning adjectives into verbs: \"kylmä\" = \"cold\", \"kylmetä\" = \"to get cold\".\n\nThe present stem is characterized by the insertion of \"ne\" after the infinitive stem and so the final syllable of the stem is open, and hence the final consonant of the stem is in strong grade:\n\nThe imperfect indicative is formed by replacing the final \"e\" of the \"ne\" stem with the imperfect marker \"i\":\n\nPassives are formed in the same way as for type IV verbs.\n\nStandard Finnish has comparatively very few irregular verbs in addition to 'olla' discussed above. However, because the infinitive is an inflected form of the root, the consonant gradation may obscure the root. The root of the word 'juosta' = 'to run' is \"juoks-\"; when generating the infinitive, the pattern \"ks\" → \"s\" is applied: \"juoks+ta\" → \"juosta\". Epenthetic 'e' is added for personal forms: \"juoksen\".\n\nThere is a rare pattern with a stem with \"-k-\" rendered as \"-hdä\" in the infinitive but disappearing in gradation:\nThat is, \"teke-\" and \"näke-\" forms are rendered as \"tehdä\" and \"nähdä\" in the infinitive but are subject to gradation of 'k' in personal forms like \"teen\". In some colloquial forms, the 'e' is rendered as a chroneme instead: \"nään\" instead of \"näen\" etc.\n\nSpoken Finnish adds some more irregular verbs by assimilative deletion:\n\n"}

It is believed that you are born with the propensity to become a Bissu, revealed in a baby whose genitalia are ambiguous. Ambiguous genitalia alone cannot ensure that you become a bissu. Moreover, these ambiguous genitalia need not be visible; a normative male who becomes a bissu is believed to be female on the inside. This combination of sexes enables a 'meta-gender' identity to emerge.\n\nBugis society has a cultural belief that all five genders must co-exist harmoniously.\n\nAccording to the Bugis gender system, \"calabai\" are false women and so are generally assigned male at birth but take on the role of heterosexual females.

{"id": "37445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37445", "title": "Kannada", "text": "Kannada\n\nKannada (; ) is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by Kannada people in India, mainly in the state of Karnataka, and by significant linguistic minorities in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and abroad. The language has roughly 43.7 million native speakers, who are called Kannadigas (). Kannada is also spoken as a second and third language by over 12.9 million non-Kannada speakers living in Karnataka, which adds up to 56.6 million speakers. It is one of the scheduled languages of India and the official and administrative language of the state of Karnataka.\n\nThe Kannada language is written using the Kannada script, which evolved from the 5th-century Kadamba script. Kannada is attested epigraphically for about one and a half millennia, and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 6th-century Ganga dynasty and during the 9th-century Rashtrakuta Dynasty. Kannada has an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years. Kannada literature has been presented with 8 Jnanapith awards, the most for any Dravidian language and the second highest for any Indian language.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the Committee of Linguistic Experts, appointed by the ministry of culture, the government of India designated Kannada a classical language of India. Kannada is considered to be one of the oldest living languages . In July 2011, a center for the study of classical Kannada was established as part of the Central Institute of Indian Languages at Mysore to facilitate research related to the language.\n\nKannada is a Southern Dravidian language, and according to Dravidian scholar Sanford B. Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three periods: Old Kannada (\"Halegannada\") from 450–1200 CE, Middle Kannada (\"Nadugannada\") from 1200–1700, and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present. Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit. Influences of other languages such as Prakrit and Pali can also be found in the Kannada language. The scholar Iravatham Mahadevan indicated that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than the 3rd century BCE, and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit inscriptions of that period, Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population. The scholar K. V. Narayana claims that many tribal languages which are now designated as Kannada dialects could be nearer to the earlier form of the language, with lesser influence from other languages.\n\nThe sources of influence on literary Kannada grammar appear to be three-fold: Pāṇini's grammar, non-Paninian schools of Sanskrit grammar, particularly \"Katantra\" and \"Sakatayana\" schools, and Prakrit grammar. Literary Prakrit seems to have prevailed in Karnataka since ancient times. The vernacular Prakrit speaking people may have come into contact with Kannada speakers, thus influencing their language, even before Kannada was used for administrative or liturgical purposes. Kannada phonetics, morphology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax show significant influence from these languages.\n\nSome naturalised (\"tadbhava\") words of Prakrit origin in Kannada are: \"baṇṇa\" (colour) derived from \"vaṇṇa\", \"hunnime\" (full moon) from \"puṇṇivā\". Examples of naturalized Sanskrit words in Kannada are: \"varṇa\" (colour), \"arasu\" (king) from \"rajan\", \"paurṇimā\", and \"rāya\" from \"rāja\" (king). \n\nLike the other Dravidian languages Kannada also has borrowed (\"tatsama\") words such as \"dina\" (day), \"kopa\" (anger), \"surya\" (sun), \"mukha\" (face), \"nimiṣa\" (minute) and \"anna\" (rice).\n\nPurava HaleGannada: This Kannada term literally translated means \"Previous form of Old Kannada\" was the language of Banavasi in the early Common Era, the Satavahana, Chutu Satakarni (Naga) and Kadamba periods and thus has a history of over 2500 years. The Ashoka rock edict found at Brahmagiri (dated to 230 BCE) has been suggested to contain words in identifiable Kannada. According to Jain tradition, Brahmi, the daughter of Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankara of Jainism, invented 18 alphabets, including Kannada, which points to the antiquity of the language. Supporting this tradition, an inscription of about the 9th century CE, containing specimens of different alphabets, mostly Dravidian, was discovered in a Jain temple in the Deogarh fort.\n\nGreek dramatists Euripides (480-406 BCE) and Aristophanes (446-386 BCE) of the 5th–4th century BCE were purportedly familiar with the Kannada country and language which can be concluded by the usage of Kannada words, phrases and expressions in their Greek plays along with Persian and Punic. This would show a far more intimate contact of the Greeks with Kannada culture than with Indian culture elsewhere.\n\nThe Kannada word \"Ooralli\" (\"lit\" it means \"in a village\") is said to be written on a huge wall constructed in Alexandria in the 4th century BCE as part of the remnants of 36,000 palm manuscripts that had been burnt in an accidental fire in Alexander's time. The palm manuscripts contained texts written not only in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, but also in Sanskrit and Kannada.\n\nIn some 3rd–1st century BCE Tamil inscriptions, words of Kannada influence such as '\"nalliyooraa'\", '\"kavuDi'\" and '\"posil'\" have been introduced. The use of the vowel '\"a\"' as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil but its usage is available in Kannada. Kannada words such as '\"gouDi-gavuDi'\" transform into Tamil’s '\"kavuDi'\" for lack of the usage of \"Ghosha svana\" in Tamil. Hence the Kannada word 'gavuDi' becomes 'kavuDi' in Tamil. 'Posil' ('hosilu') was introduced into Tamil from Kannada and colloquial Tamil uses this word as 'Vaayil'. In a 1st-century CE Tamil inscription, there is a personal reference to '\"ayjayya\"', a word of Kannada origin. In a 3rd-century CE Tamil inscription there is usage of '\"oppanappa vIran\"'. Here the honorific '\"appa\"' to a person's name is an influence from Kannada. Another word of Kannada origin is \"'taayviru\"' and is found in a 4th-century CE Tamil inscription. S. Settar studied the '\"sittanvAsal\"' inscription of first century CE as also the inscriptions at '\"tirupparamkunram\"', '\"adakala\"' and '\"neDanUpatti\"'. The later inscriptions were studied in detail by Iravatham Mahadevan also. Mahadevan argues that the words '\"erumi\"', '\"kavuDi\"', '\"poshil\"' and '\"tAyiyar\"' have their origin in Kannada because Tamil cognates are not available. Settar adds the words '\"nADu\"' and '\"iLayar\"' to this list. Mahadevan feels that some grammatical categories found in these inscriptions are also unique to Kannada rather than Tamil. Both these scholars attribute these influences to the movements and spread of Jainas in these regions. These inscriptions belong to the period between the first century BCE and fourth century CE. These are some examples that are proof of the influence of Kannada on Tamil before the common era and in the early centuries of the common era.\n\nIn the 150 CE Prakrit book \"Gaathaa Saptashati\", written by Haala Raja, Kannada words like \"tIr or Teer (\"meaning \"to be able)\", \"tuppa\", \"peTTu\", \"poTTu, poTTa, piTTu (\"meaning \"to strike), Pode (Hode)\" have been used. On the Pallava Prakrit inscription of 250 CE of Hire Hadagali's Shivaskandavarman, the Kannada word \"kOTe\" transforms into \"koTTa\". In the 350 CE Chandravalli Prakrit inscription, words of Kannada origin like \"punaaTa\", \"puNaDa\" have been used. In one more Prakrit inscription of 250 CE found in Malavalli, Kannada towns like \"vEgooraM\" (\"bEgooru\"), \"kundamuchchaMDi\" find a reference.\n\nPliny the Elder (23 – 79 CE) was a naval and army commander in the early Roman Empire. He writes about pirates between Muziris and Nitrias (Netravati River). He also mentions Barace (Barcelore). Nitrias of Pliny and Nitran of Ptolemy refer to the Netravati River as also the modern port city of Mangaluru, upon its mouth. Many of these are Kannada origin names of places and rivers of the Karnataka coast of 1st century CE.\n\nThe Greek geographer Ptolemy (150 CE) mentions places such as Badiamaioi (Badami), Inde (Indi), Kalligeris (Kalkeri), Modogoulla (Mudagal), Petrigala (Pattadakal), Hippokoura (Huvina Hipparagi), Nagarouris (Nagur), Tabaso (Tavasi), Tiripangalida (Gadahinglai), Soubouttou or Sabatha (Savadi), Banaouase (Banavasi), Thogorum (Tagara), Biathana (Paithan), Sirimalaga (Malkhed), Aloe (Ellapur) and Pasage (Palasige) indicating prosperous trade between Egypt, Europe and Karnataka. He also mentions Pounnata (Punnata) and refers to beryls, i.e., the \"Vaidhurya\" gems of that country. He mentions Malippala (Malpe) a coastal town of Karnataka. In this work Larika and Kandaloi are identified as Rastrika and Kuntala. Ptolemy writes in the midst of the false mouth and the Barios, there is a city called Maganur (Mangalore). He mentions of inland centres of pirates called Oloikhora (Alavakheda). He mentions Ariake Sadinon meaning Aryaka Satakarni and Baithana as capital of Siro(e) P(t)olmaios, i.e., Sri Pulimayi clearly indicating his knowledge of the Satavahana kings. The word \"Pulimayi\" means \"One with body of Tiger\" in Kannada, which bears testimony to the possible Kannada origin of Satavahana kings.\n\nA possibly more definite reference to Kannada is found in the 'Charition Mime' ascribed to the late 1st to early 2nd century CE. The farce, written by an unknown author, is concerned with a Greek lady named Charition who has been stranded on the coast of a country bordering the Indian Ocean. The king of this region, and his countrymen, sometimes use their own language, and the sentences they speak could be interpreted as Kannada, including \"Koncha madhu patrakke haki\" (\"Having poured a little wine into the cup separately\") and \"paanam beretti katti madhuvam ber ettuvenu\" (\"Having taken up the cup separately and having covered it, I shall take wine separately.\"). The language employed in the papyrus indicates that the play is set in one of the numerous small ports on the western coast of India, between Karwar and Kanhangad (presently in Kerala). The character of the king in this farce refers to himself as 'the Nayaka of Malpe (Malpi-naik)'. B. A. Saletore identifies the site of this play as Odabhandeshwara or Vadabhandeshwara (ship-vessel-Ishwara or God), situated about a mile from Malpe, which was a Shaivite centre originally surrounded by a forest with a small river passing through it. He rejects M. Govinda Pai's opinion that it must have occurred at Udyavara (Odora in Greek), the capital of Alupas. Stavros J. Tsitsiridis mentions in his research work that \"Charition\" is not an exclusively prose or verse text, but a mixed form. The corrupt lines indicate that the text found at Oxyrhynchus (Egypt) has been copied, meaning that the original was even earlier in date. Wilamowitz (1907) and Andreassi (2001) say that for more precise dating of the original, some place the composition of the work as early as in the Hellenistic period (332-30 BCE), others at a later date, up to the early 2nd c. CE.\n\nThe earliest examples of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (\"shilaashaasana\") containing Brahmi characters with characteristics attributed to those of proto-Kannada in \"Hale Kannada\" (\"lit\" Old Kannada) script can be found in the Halmidi inscription, usually dated c. AD 450, indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language at that time. The Halmidi inscription provides invaluable information about the history and culture of Karnataka. The Kannada inscription excavated at the Pranaveshwara temple complex at Talagunda near Shiralakoppa in Shikaripur taluk of Shivamogga district, dated to 370 CE is said to be one of the earliest Kannada inscriptions replacing the Halmidi inscription of 450 CE. The 5th century Tamatekallu inscription of Chitradurga and the Chikkamagaluru inscription of 500 AD are further examples. Recent reports indicate that the Old Kannada \"Nishadi\" inscription discovered on the Chandragiri hill, Shravanabelagola, is older than Halmidi inscription by about fifty to hundred years and may belong to the period AD 350–400. The noted archaeologist and art historian S. Shettar is of the opinion that an inscription of the Western Ganga King Kongunivarma Madhava (c. 350–370) found at Tagarthi (Tyagarthi) in Shikaripura taluk of Shimoga district is of 350 CE and is also older than the Halmidi inscription.\n\nCurrent estimates of the total number of existing epigraphs written in Kannada range from 25,000 by the scholar Sheldon Pollock to over 30,000 by the Amaresh Datta of the Sahitya Akademi. Prior to the Halmidi inscription, there is an abundance of inscriptions containing Kannada words, phrases and sentences, proving its antiquity. The 543 AD Badami cliff inscription of Pulakesi I is an example of a Sanskrit inscription in old Kannada script.\nKannada inscriptions are not only discovered in Karnataka but also quite commonly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Some inscriptions were also found in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The Northern most Kannada inscription of the Rashtrakutas of 964 CE is the Jura record found near Jabalpur in present-day Madhya Pradesh, belonging to the reign of Krishna III. This indicates the spread of the influence of the language over the ages, especially during the rule of large Kannada empires. Pyu sites of Myanmar yielded variety of Indian scripts including those written in a script especially\narchaic, most resembling the Kadamba (Kannada-speaking Kadambas of 4th century CE Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh) form of common Kannada-Telugu script from Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe earliest copper plates inscribed in Old Kannada script and language, dated to the early 8th century AD, are associated with Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu (the Dakshina Kannada district), and display the double crested fish, his royal emblem. The oldest well-preserved palm leaf manuscript in \"Old Kannada\" is that of \"Dhavala\". It dates to around the 9th century and is preserved in the Jain Bhandar, Mudbidri, Dakshina Kannada district. The manuscript contains 1478 leaves written using ink.\n\nSome early Kadamba Dynasty coins bearing the Kannada inscription \"Vira\" and \"Skandha\" were found in Satara collectorate. A gold coin bearing three inscriptions of \"Sri\" and an abbreviated inscription of king Bhagiratha's name called \"bhagi\" (c. AD 390–420) in old Kannada exists. A Kadamba copper coin dated to the 5th century AD with the inscription \"Srimanaragi\" in Kannada script was discovered in Banavasi, Uttara Kannada district. Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered spanning the rule of the Western Ganga Dynasty, the Badami Chalukyas, the Alupas, the Western Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Hoysalas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the Keladi Nayakas and the Mysore Kingdom, the Badami Chalukya coins being a recent discovery. The coins of the Kadambas of Goa are unique in that they have alternate inscription of the king's name in Kannada and Devanagari in triplicate, a few coins of the Kadambas of Hangal are also available.\n\nThe oldest existing record of Kannada poetry in \"Tripadi\" metre is the Kappe Arabhatta record of AD 700. \"Kavirajamarga\" by King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I (AD 850) is the earliest existing literary work in Kannada. It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries. The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King Durvinita of the 6th century and Ravikirti, the author of the Aihole record of 636 AD. Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of Kannada grammar and literary styles, it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier. An early extant prose work, the \"Vaddaradhane\" (ವಡ್ಡಾರಾಧನೆ) by Shivakotiacharya of AD 900 provides an elaborate description of the life of Bhadrabahu of Shravanabelagola.\n\nKannada works from earlier centuries mentioned in the Kavirajamarga are not yet traced. Some ancient texts now considered extinct but referenced in later centuries are \"Prabhrita\" (AD 650) by Syamakundacharya, \"Chudamani\" (Crest Jewel—AD 650) by Srivaradhadeva, also known as Tumbuluracharya, which is a work of 96,000 verse-measures and a commentary on logic (\"Tatwartha-mahashastra\"). Other sources date \"Chudamani\" to the 6th century or earlier. The \"Karnateshwara Katha\", a eulogy for King Pulakesi II, is said to have belonged to the 7th century; the \"Gajastaka\", a work on elephant management by King Shivamara II, belonged to the 8th century, and the \"Chandraprabha-purana\" by Sri Vijaya, a court poet of King Amoghavarsha I, is ascribed to the early 9th century. Tamil Buddhist commentators of the 10th century AD (in the commentary on \"Nemrinatham\", a Tamil grammatical work) make references that show that Kannada literature must have flourished as early as the AD 4th century.\n\nAround the beginning of the 9th century, Old Kannada was spoken from Kaveri to Godavari. The Kannada spoken between the rivers Varada and Malaprabha was the pure well of Kannada undefiled.\n\nThe late classical period gave birth to several genres of Kannada literature, with new forms of composition coming into use, including \"Ragale\" (a form of blank verse) and meters like \"Sangatya\" and \"Shatpadi\". The works of this period are based on Jain and Hindu principles. Two of the early writers of this period are Harihara and Raghavanka, trailblazers in their own right. Harihara established the \"Ragale\" form of composition while Raghavanka popularised the \"Shatpadi\" (six-lined stanza) meter. A famous Jaina writer of the same period is Janna, who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works.\n\nThe Vachana Sahitya tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature, and the sum of contributions by all sections of society. Vachanas were pithy poems on that period's social, religious and economic conditions. More importantly, they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution, which caused a radical re-examination of the ideas of caste, creed and religion. Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include Basavanna, Allama Prabhu and Akka Mahadevi.\n\nEmperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was \"Margi\" (formal or written form of language) and \"Desi\" (folk or spoken form of language) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada. In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work \"Dharmamrita\" (ಧರ್ಮಾಮೃತ), a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil. He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote \"Kabbigara Kava\"- ಕಬ್ಬಿಗರ ಕಾವ (Poet's Defender), also called \"Sobagina Suggi\" (Harvest of Beauty) or \"Madana-Vijaya and\" \"Kavana-Gella\" (Cupid's Conquest)\",\" a \"Champu\" work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (\"desya\") Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words – \"tadbhavas\", without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated that it was impossible to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.\n\nDuring the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, Hinduism had a great influence on Middle Kannada (\"Nadugannada\"- ನಡುಗನ್ನಡ) language and literature. Kumara Vyasa, who wrote the \"Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari\" (ಕರ್ಣಾಟ ಭಾರತ ಕಥಾಮಂಜರಿ), was arguably the most influential Kannada writer of this period. His work, entirely composed in the native \"Bhamini Shatpadi\" (hexa-meter), is a sublime adaptation of the first ten books of the Mahabharata. \nDuring this period, the Sanskritic influence is present in most abstract, religious, scientific and rhetorical terms. During this period, several Hindi and Marathi words came into Kannada, chiefly relating to feudalism and militia.\n\nHindu saints of the Vaishnava sect such as Kanakadasa, Purandaradasa, Naraharitirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Vijaya Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Prasanna Venkatadasa produced devotional poems in this period. Kanakadasa's \"Ramadhanya Charite\" (ರಾಮಧಾನ್ಯ ಚರಿತೆ ) is a rare work, concerning with the issue of class struggle. This period saw the advent of \"Haridasa Sahitya\" (\"lit\" Dasa literature) which made rich contributions to \"Bhakti\" literature and sowed the seeds of Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa is widely considered the \"Father of Carnatic music\".\n\nThe Kannada works produced from the 19th century make a gradual transition and are classified as \"Hosagannada\" or Modern Kannada. Most notable among the modernists was the poet Nandalike Muddana whose writing may be described as the \"Dawn of Modern Kannada\", though generally, linguists treat \"Indira Bai\" or \"Saddharma Vijayavu\" by Gulvadi Venkata Raya as the first literary works in Modern Kannada. The first modern movable type printing of \"Canarese\" appears to be the \"Canarese Grammar\" of Carey printed at Serampore in 1817, and the \"Bible in Canarese\" of John Hands in 1820. The first novel printed was John Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\", along with other texts including \"Canarese Proverbs\", \"The History of Little Henry and his Bearer\" by Mary Martha Sherwood, Christian Gottlob Barth's \"Bible Stories\" and \"a Canarese hymn book.\"\n\nModern Kannada in the 20th century has been influenced by many movements, notably \"Navodaya\", \"Navya\", \"Navyottara\", \"Dalita\" and \"Bandaya\". Contemporary Kannada literature has been highly successful in reaching people of all classes in society. Further, Kannada has produced a number of prolific and renowned poets and writers such as Kuvempu, Bendre, and V K Gokak. Works of Kannada literature have received eight Jnanpith awards, the highest number awarded to any Indian language.\n\nBesides being the official and administrative language of the state of Karnataka, Kannada language is present in other areas:\n\nThere is also a considerable difference between the spoken and written forms of the language. Spoken Kannada tends to vary from region to region. The written form is more or less consistent throughout Karnataka. The Ethnologue reports \"about 20 dialects\" of Kannada. Among them are Kundagannada (spoken exclusively in Kundapura), Nadavar-Kannada (spoken by Nadavaru), Havigannada (spoken mainly by Havyaka Brahmins), Are Bhashe (spoken by Gowda community mainly in Madikeri and Sullia region of Dakshina Kannada), Malenadu Kannada (Sakaleshpur, Coorg, Shimoga, Chikmagalur), Sholaga, Gulbarga Kannada, Dharawad Kannada etc. All of these dialects are influenced by their regional and cultural background. The one million Komarpants in and around Goa speak their own dialect of Kannada, known as Halegannada. They are settled throughout Goa state, throughout Uttara Kannada district and Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district, Karnataka. The Halakki Vokkaligas of Uttara Kannada, Shimoga and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka speak in their own dialect of Kannada called Halakki Kannada or Achchagannada. Their population estimate is about 75,000.\n\nEthnologue also classifies a group of four languages related to Kannada, which are, besides Kannada proper, Badaga, Holiya, Kurumba and Urali.\n\nNasik district of Maharashtra has a distinct tribe called 'Hatkar Kaanadi' people who speak a Kannada (Kaanadi) dialect with lot of old Kannada words. Per Chidananda Murthy, they are the native people of Nasik from ancient times which shows that North Maharashtra's Nasik area had Kannada population 1000 years ago.\n\nKannada speakers formed 0.12% of Nasik district's population as per 1961 census.\n\nR. Narasimhacharya considers Tulu, Kodava, Toda, Kota, Badaga and Irula as Kannada dialects due to their closeness to Kannada.\n\nThe Director of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Udaya Narayana Singh, submitted a report in 2006 to the Indian government arguing for Kannada to be made a classical language of India. In 2008 the Indian government announced that Kannada was to be designated as one of the classical languages of India.\n\nThe language uses forty-nine phonemic letters, divided into three groups: \"swaragalu\" (vowels – thirteen letters); \"vyanjanagalu\" (consonants – thirty-four letters); and \"yogavaahakagalu\" (neither vowel nor consonant – two letters: \"anusvara\" and \"visarga\" ). The character set is almost identical to that of other Indian languages. The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a \"half n\" (which becomes a half m). The number of written symbols, however, is far more than the forty-nine characters in the alphabet, because different characters can be combined to form \"compound\" characters \"(ottakshara)\". Each written symbol in the Kannada script corresponds with one syllable, as opposed to one phoneme in languages like English. The Kannada script is syllabic.\n\nKannada–Kannada dictionary has existed in Kannada along with ancient works of Kannada grammar. The oldest available Kannada dictionary was composed by the poet 'Ranna' called 'Ranna Kanda' (ರನ್ನ ಕಂದ) in 996 ACE. Other dictionaries are 'Abhidhana Vastukosha' (ಅಭಿದಾನ ವಾಸ್ತುಕೋಶ) by Nagavarma (1045 ACE), 'Amarakoshada Teeku'(ಅಮರಕೋಶದ ತೀಕು) by Vittala (1300), 'Abhinavaabhidaana'(ಅಭಿನವಾಭಿದಾನ) by Abhinava Mangaraja (1398 ACE) and many more. A Kannada–English dictionary consisting of more than 70,000 words was composed by Ferdinand Kittel.\n\nG. Venkatasubbaiah edited the first modern Kannada–Kannada dictionary, a 9,000-page, 8-volume series published by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat. He also wrote a Kannada–English dictionary and a \"kliṣtapadakōśa\" (ಕ್ಲಿಷ್ಟಪಾದಕೋಶ), a dictionary of difficult words.\n\nKannada has 34 consonants and 13 vowels.\n\n\nThe canonical word order of Kannada is SOV (subject–object–verb) as is the case with Dravidian languages.\nKannada is a highly inflected language with three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter or common) and two numbers (singular and plural). It is inflected for gender, number and tense, among other things. The most authoritative known book on old Kannada grammar is \"Shabdhamanidarpana\" by Keshiraja. The first available Kannada book, a treatise on poetics, rhetoric and basic grammar is the \"Kavirajamarga\" from 850 C.E.\n\nThe most influential account of Kannada grammar is Keshiraja's \"Shabdamanidarpana\" (c. AD 1260). The earlier grammatical works include portions of \"Kavirajamarga\" (a treatise on \"alańkāra\") of the 9th century, and \"Kavyavalokana\" and \"Karnatakabhashabhushana\" (both authored by Nagavarma II in the first half of the 12th century).\n\nCompound bases, called \"samāsa\" in Kannada, are a set of two or more words compounded together. There are several types of compound bases, based on the rules followed for compounding. The types of compound bases or samāsas: tatpurusha, karmadhāraya, dvigu, bahuvreehi, anshi, dvandva, kriya and gamaka samāsa. Examples: \"taṅgāḷi\", \"hemmara\", \"kannusanne\".\n\nIn many ways the third-person pronouns are more like demonstratives than like the other pronouns. They are pluralized like nouns and whereas the first- and second-person pronouns have different ways to distinguish number.\n\n\n\n"}

The family includes both Indic languages (Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Marathi, Gujarati, Sinhalese and other languages spoken primarily in South Asia) and Iranian (Persian, Kurdish, Pashto, Balochi and other languages spoken primarily in Iran, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Central Asia, the Caucasus and parts of South Asia). In addition, other branches of Indo-European spoken in Asia include the Slavic branch, which includes Russian in Siberia; Greek around the Black Sea; and Armenian; as well as extinct languages such as Hittite of Anatolia and Tocharian of (Chinese) Turkestan.\n\nA number of smaller, but important language families spread across central and northern Asia have long been linked in an as-yet unproven Altaic family. These are the Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic (including Manchu), Koreanic, and Japonic languages. Speakers of the Turkish language (Anatolian Turks) are believed to have adopted the language, having instead originally spoken the Anatolian languages, an extinct group of languages belonging to the Indo-European family.\n\nThe Mon–Khmer languages (also known as Austroasiatic) are the oldest family in Asia. Languages given official status are Vietnamese and Khmer (Cambodian).\n\nThe Kra–Dai languages (also known as Tai-Kadai) are found in southern China, Northeast India and Southeast Asia. Languages given official status are Thai (Siamese) and Lao.\n\nThe Austronesian languages are widespread throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, including major languages such as Fijian (Fiji), Tagalog (Philippines), and Malay (Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei). Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese of Indonesia belong to this family as well.\n\nThe Dravidian languages of southern India and parts of Sri Lanka include Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam, while smaller languages such as Gondi and Brahui are spoken in central India and Pakistan respectively.\n\nThe Afroasiatic languages (in older sources Hamito-Semitic), particularly its Semitic branch, are spoken in Western Asia. It includes Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic, in addition to extinct languages such as Akkadian. The Modern South Arabian languages contain a substratum influence from the Cushitic branch of Afroasiatic, which suggests that Cushitic speakers originally inhabited the Arabian Peninsula alongside Semitic speakers.\n\nBesides the Altaic families already mentioned (of which Tungusic is today a minor family of Siberia), there are a number of small language families and isolates spoken across northern Asia. These include the Uralic languages of western Siberia (better known for Hungarian and Finnish in Europe), the Yeniseian languages (linked to Turkic and to the Athabaskan languages of North America), Yukaghir, Nivkh of Sakhalin, Ainu of northern Japan, Chukotko-Kamchatkan in easternmost Siberia, and—just barely—Eskimo–Aleut. Some linguists have noted that the Koreanic languages share more similarities with the Paleosiberian languages than with the Altaic languages. The extinct Ruan-ruan language of Mongolia is unclassified, and does not show genetic relationships with any other known language family.\n\nThree small families are spoken in the Caucasus: Kartvelian languages, such as Georgian; Northeast Caucasian (Dagestanian languages), such as Chechen; and Northwest Caucasian, such as Circassian. The latter two may be related to each other. The extinct Hurro-Urartian languages may be related as well.\n\nAlthough dominated by major languages and families, there are number of minor families and isolates in South Asia & Southeast Asia. From west to east, these include:\n\nThe eponymous pidgin (\"business\") language developed with European trade in China. Of the many creoles to have developed, the most spoken today are Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole of the Philippines, and various Malay-based creoles such as Manado Malay influenced by Portuguese. A very well-known Portuguese-based creole is the Kristang, which is spoken in Malacca, a city-state in Malaysia.\n\nA number of sign languages are spoken throughout Asia. These include the Japanese Sign Language family, Chinese Sign Language, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language, as well as a number of small indigenous sign languages of countries such as Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Many official sign languages are part of the French Sign Language family.\n\nAsia and Europe are the only two continents where most countries use native languages as their official languages, though English is also widespread.\n\n"}

The theorem is named for John Myhill and Anil Nerode, who proved it at the University of Chicago in 1958 .\n\nGiven a language \"L\", and a pair of strings \"x\" and \"y\", define a distinguishing extension to be a string \"z\" such that\nexactly one of the two strings \"xz\" and \"yz\" belongs to \"L\".\nDefine a relation \"R\" on strings by the rule that \"x R y\" if there is no distinguishing extension for \"x\" and \"y\". It is easy to show that \"R\" is an equivalence relation on strings, and thus it divides the set of all strings into equivalence classes.\n\nThe Myhill–Nerode theorem states that \"L\" is regular if and only if \"R\" has a finite number of equivalence classes, and moreover that the number of states in the smallest deterministic finite automaton (DFA) recognizing \"L\" is equal to the number of equivalence classes in \"R\". In particular, this implies that there is a unique minimal DFA with minimum number of states .\n\nIf \"L\" is a regular language, then by definition there is a DFA \"A\" that recognizes it, with only finitely many states. If there are \"n\" states, then partition the set of all finite strings into \"n\" subsets, where subset \"S\" is the set of strings that, when given as input to automaton \"A\", cause it to end in state \"i\". For every two strings \"x\" and \"y\" that belong to the same subset, and for every choice of a third string \"z\", automaton \"A\" reaches the same state on input \"xz\" as it reaches on input \"yz\", and therefore must either accept both of the inputs \"xz\" and \"yz\" or reject both of them. Therefore, no string \"z\" can be a distinguishing extension for \"x\" and \"y\", so they must be related by \"R\". Thus, \"S\" is a subset of an equivalence class of \"R\". Combining this fact with the fact that every member of one of these equivalence classes belongs to one of the sets \"S\", this gives a many-to-one relation from states of \"A\" to equivalence classes, implying that the number of equivalence classes is finite and at most \"n\".\n\nIn the other direction, suppose that \"R\" has finitely many equivalence classes. In this case, it is possible to design a deterministic finite automaton that has one state for each equivalence class. The start state of the automaton corresponds to the equivalence class containing the empty string, and the transition function from a state \"X\" on input symbol \"y\" takes the automaton to a new state, the state corresponding to the equivalence class containing string \"xy\", where \"x\" is an arbitrarily chosen string in the equivalence class for \"X\". The definition of the Myhill–Nerode relation implies that the transition function is well-defined: no matter which representative string \"x\" is chosen for state \"X\", the same transition function value will result. A state of this automaton is accepting if the corresponding equivalence class contains a string in \"L\"; in this case, again, the definition of the relation implies that all strings in the same equivalence class must also belong to \"L\", for otherwise the empty string would be a distinguishing string for some pairs of strings in the class.\n\nThus, the existence of a finite automaton recognizing \"L\" implies that the Myhill–Nerode relation has a finite number of equivalence classes, at most equal to the number of states of the automaton, and the existence of a finite number of equivalence classes implies the existence of an automaton with that many states.\n\nThe Myhill–Nerode theorem may be used to show that a language \"L\" is regular by proving that the number of equivalence classes of \"R\" is finite. This may be done by an exhaustive case analysis in which, beginning from the empty string, distinguishing extensions are used to find additional equivalence classes until no more can be found. For example, the language consisting of binary representations of numbers that can be divided by 3 is regular. Given the empty string, \"00\" (or \"11\"), \"01\" and \"10\" are distinguishing extensions resulting in the three classes (corresponding to numbers that give remainders 0, 1 and 2 when divided by 3), but after this step there is no distinguishing extension anymore. The minimal automaton accepting our language would have three states corresponding to these three equivalence classes.\n\nAnother immediate corollary of the theorem is that if a language defines an infinite set of equivalence classes, it is \"not\" regular. It is this corollary that is frequently used to prove that a language is not regular.\n\nThe Myhill–Nerode theorem can be generalized to trees. See tree automaton.\n\n\n"}

Administratively, it is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also serves as the administrative center of Pervomaiskyi Raion though administratively it does not belong to the raion. Population: It is the fourth largest city in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nThe city is known for Khimprom, one of the biggest chemical factories in the former USSR. The city has lush green plots and parks, a cultural center named \"DK Khimik\" and a stadium also named \"Khimik\".\n\nIn 1869 a railway was opened, Kursk-Kharkiv-Sevastopol. In August of the same year a whistle stop was built 80 kilometres from Kharkiv. Trains stopped for water and firewood and the station was named Likhachevo, in honour of a squire Likhachov, whose estate was near a village Sivash in a few kilometres from the railway. Water was supplied from lake Sivash and a water-tower was built.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War the (joint) Alekseevskogo, Berekskogo, Upper Bishkinskogo rural Soviets decided to relocate the peasants of these villages to the farm Likhachevo. So in 1924 a settlement was built in Likhachevo which originally was under the jurisdiction of the Upper Bishkinskyi village council. The founders of the village were migrants from the villages of Alexeevka, Bereka, Maslivka, and Upper-Bishkin. They built streets, such as 1 May Street. Agriculture and crafts schools were built, along with a primary school, which both children and adults attended.\n\nIn 1927 the village had 13 lots and 56 residents. In 1928, it was already 85 lots. The population increased as workers came to work at the brick and mechanical plant, as well as the mill. In September 1929, on the initiative of activists Tolokneeva and Fedoseenko, a gang was organized in the village. At the suggestion of porters, it was called \"May 1\" in honor of the international proletarian holiday. In early December 1929 Lihachevsky machine-tractor station was organized (one of the first in the Kharkiv district). Lihachevsky MTS first served 30 collective Alexeevski district.\n\nAccording to the Soviet census of 1939, 640 people lived in Likhachevo.\n\nOn 20 October 1941 the Nazis occupied Likhachevo. 38 boys and girls were sent to work as slave laborers in Germany. 15 people from the village joined the partisans in Alexeevski district, whose leaders were Secretary of the Communist Party VS Ulyanov and executive committee chairman AG Buznyka.\n\nLikhachevo repeatedly became the site of fierce fighting. During the war, it changed hands four times. On 16 September 1943 troops of the Steppe Front finally returned Likhachevo to Soviet control.\n\nIn 1946 a midwifery unit began to operate in the town. In 1948 a hospital was built, employing two doctors and three nurses.\n\nIn 1947 a kindergarten was built.\n\nOn 25 December 1948 Likhachevo became the center of the Council of Agriculture, who controlled the farm Pervomajskij, Our Way.\n\nIn 1950 a high school was built; its enrollment was 824 students and it employed 28 teachers.\n\nOn 24 June 1952 the settlement Likhachevo was renamed Pervomaiskyi.\n\nPervomaiskyi is situated on the Pivdenna Zalisnitsa railway line. The railway station here is called \"Likhachove,\" or, in Russian, \"Likhachevo\". Pervomaiskyi is also a main road hub which links many other cities like Lozova, Merefa, Balakliia and Izium together with the Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nPervomaiskyi was planned as a colony for the workers and clerical staff of the Khimprom chemical factory. Until the fall of the USSR in 1992, the city's inhabitants had good earnings, but afterwards, the city's economy collapsed. Many became jobless. However in the late 1990s some private companies moved into Pervomaiskyi.\n\nPervomaiskyi originally had just two schools till 1977. Now it has 7 secondary schools; one is Russian-medium, and the rest are Ukrainian-medium. Pervomaiskyi has 6-day-care centres (detski sad), which are all Ukrainian-medium. There is one college offering technical education after 9th Class in many fields like cooking, tractor building, driving, heavy wheel driving, and field fertilizing.\n\nAs Pervomaiskyi lies just around 95 km south of Kharkiv, its weather is similar. Pervomaiskyi's climate is moderate continental: cold and snowy winters, and hot summers. The seasonal average temperatures are not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer: in January, and in July. The average rainfall totals per year, with the most in June and July.\nPervomaiskyi has two newspapers working within the region and city, and two private TV channels:\n\n\n"}

He met repression and was executed in 1939. The Soviet government posthumously rehabilitated him during de-Stalinization.\n\nSeyfullin was born 15 October 1894 in a nomadic settlement in what is today Karaganda Region.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1908, Seyfullin studied in a Russian-Kazakh school in the Spassk brass works. He went on to study in Akmola in the primary parish school and the Akmola three-class city school. In addition, he taught Russian at a Muslim madrasah. On August 21 of 1913, Seifullin entered the Omsk teaching seminarium. His first article was published in the November edition of \"Ay Qap\" magazine. It was at this time that he began to be spied upon by the Omsk okhrana, the secret police.\n\nIn 1914, Seyfullin became one of the heads of the first cultural and educational society of Kazakh youth, \"Birlik\" (Unity) in Omsk. His book of poetry (Past Days) was published that year.\n\nIn 1916, he worked on a property census commission for the 12 volosts of Akmola Uezd.

While the section 17 right to use either language within the Parliament of Canada repeats a right already anchored in section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", section 17 also guarantees the right to use both languages in the legislature of New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province under section 16 of the \"Charter\".\n\nSection 17 reads,\n\nAs noted in the Supreme Court decision \"New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia\" (1993), the stated application of section 17 is to \"Parliament.\" This wording is an anomaly because technically Parliament is just an institution that enacts statutes. The rights held under section 17, in contrast, presumably are not held against the statutes of Parliament but rather apply to the debates that occur within Parliamentary institutions, such as the House of Commons of Canada and Senate of Canada.\n\nThis section, as it applies to Parliament, extends to Parliamentary committees, and thus any witness has a right to use either English or French if he or she appears before a committee. Justice Michel Bastarache and his fellow-writers agree that section 17 applies to \"other activities of Parliament,\" including Parliamentary committees, but argue that bilingualism in Parliamentary committees had been allowed for years prior to the Charter and interpreters had been provided.\nAs noted, the section also extends these constitutional rights to New Brunswick. However, similar statutory rights in New Brunswick had already been in place when the \"Charter\" came to force. Namely, they were in the Official Languages of New Brunswick Act. Section 17 thus constitutionalized the rights.\n\nIn the 1986 Supreme Court case \"Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents\", Justice Jean Beetz found that section 17 was so similar to section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (section 17 was based on section 133) that section 17 would not represent any change in regard to rights that had belonged under section 133. Thus, section 133 case law would influence section 17 case law. Justice Bertha Wilson, commenting on section 17's parallel with section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, also said that it could represent mere \"constitutional continuity.\" However, she did acknowledge that section 17 being exempt from the notwithstanding clause, and the amending formula making Canada's language rights impossible to amend without the support from all provinces as well as the federal government, reveal language rights to be \"a response to the peculiar facts of Canada's history.\" At any rate, Beetz found that in Parliament, while section 17 guarantees a right for a person to speak in either French or English, depending on his or her preference, this does not extend to guaranteeing a right for the person's speech to be translated so all can understand it; the same line of reasoning had been used for section 133.\n\nThis line of thinking regarding section 133 also appeared in the Supreme Court case \"MacDonald v. City of Montreal\" (1986). In \"MacDonald\", \"Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick\" (1975) was cited as finding that section 133 did not really effectively establish a sophisticated official bilingualism for Canada. While rights to biligualism in legislative bodies might allow for some members to understand each other if they happened to know the language being used, there was no guarantee for this. Moreover, courts should interpret these rights conservatively since they are a political matter. According to \"MacDonald\", having translators in Parliament is thus not mandatory under section 133, since there is no guarantee everyone will be able to understand an MP when he or she chooses to speak in English or French. These rights are thus negative rights only. An unconstitutional action would be for Parliament or a legislature to force a person to leave for speaking in English or French.\n\n"}

This field of research combines text analytics and Semantic Web technologies like RDF. Semantic analytics measures the relatedness of different ontological concepts.\n\nSome academic research groups that have active project in this area include Kno.e.sis center at Wright State University among others. \n\nAn important milestone in the beginning of semantic analytics occurred in 1996, although the historical progression of these algorithms is largely subjective. In his seminal study publication, Philip Resnik established that computers have the capacity to emulate human judgement. Spanning the publications of multiple journals, improvements to the accuracy of general semantic analytic computations all claimed to revolutionize the field. However, the lack of a standard terminology throughout the late 90's was the cause of much miscommunication. This prompted Budanitsky & Hirst to standardize the subject in 2006 with a summary that also set a framework for modern spelling and grammar analysis.\n\nIn the early days of semantic analytics, obtaining a large enough reliable knowledge bases was difficult. In 2006, Strube & Ponzetto demonstrated that Wikipedia could be used in semantic analytic calculations. The usage of a large knowledge base like Wikipedia allows for an increase in both the accuracy and applicability of semantic analytics.\n\nGiven the subjective nature of the field, different methods used in semantic analytics depend on the domain of application. No singular methods is considered correct, however one of the most generally effective and applicable method is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA). ESA was developed by Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Shaul Markovitch in the late 2000's. It uses machine learning techniques to create a semantic interpreter, which extracts text fragments from articles into a sorted list. The fragments are sorted by how related they are to the surrounding text.\n\nLatent semantic analysis (LSA) is another common method that does not use ontologies, only considering the text in the input space.\n\n\nThe application of semantic analysis methods generally streamlines organizational processes of any knowledge management system. Academic libraries often use a domain-specific application to create a more efficient organizational system By classifying scientific publications using semantics and Wikipedia, researchers are helping people find resources faster. Search engines like Semantic Scholar provide organized access to millions of articles.\n\n\nSemantic Scholar\n"}

She is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. She is an expert in language acquisition and children's development of biological concepts and is known for introducing the concept of fast mapping, whereby children learn the meanings of words after a single exposure. Her research focuses on analyzing philosophical concepts, and conceptual changes in science over time. She has conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates.\n\nShe was born in 1942. Her parents were William and Mary. Later, her father remarried to a woman, Joan, who currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carey's studies focus on the development of children and adults and the cultural construction of concepts over time.\n\nCarey received a B.A. from Radcliffe College in 1964, a Fulbright scholarship to study in University of London in 1965, and a Ph.D. in Experimental psychology from Harvard University in 1971. She was employed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1972 to 1996 in the Psychology Department of Brain and Cognitive development and New York University from 1996 to 2001 before she joined the faculty at Harvard University in 2001.\n\nOn returning to Harvard, Carey began working alongside Elizabeth Spelke, and they started a Developmental Studies lab. Carey also studied alongside George Miller, Jerome Butler, and Roger Brown. She conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates. Carey coined the term \"Quinian bootstrapping,\" a bootstrapping process that historians and philosophers look at on conceptual change.\n\nCarey is a member of the American Philosophical Society, National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine, and the British Academy. Her research analyzes philosophical concepts, and conceptual changes in science over time. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. Carey is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and has received many academic awards and distinctions, including the Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind in 1998. She was the first woman to receive the Rumelhart Prize, in 2009, which has been given annually since 2001 for significant contributions to the theoretical foundation of human cognition.\n\nShe is married to the professor of philosophy Ned Block (NYU). Carey authored \"Conceptual Change in Childhood\", which reconciles Piaget's work on animism with later work on children's knowledge of biological concepts. She also authored \"The Origin of Concepts\" for which she won the 2010 Eleanor Maccoby Book Award from the American Psychological Association.\n\nWhen Susan Carey began her career she served on a few Editorial Boards. Some of the boards she was on were for the Psychological Review, Psychological Science, Journal of Acquisition, and Development Psychology. Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett were at Harvard University when they created the term \"Fast mapping\" in 1978. This term refers to the hypothesized mental process where a new concept is learned only based on a single exposure. Susan Carey wrote a book during her career as a psychologist, which was called Conceptual Change in Childhood. This book was about the cognitive differences between children and adults. It is a case study about children's acquisition of biological knowledge and analyzes the ways the knowledge is restructured during the development. Susan Carey wrote another book called \"the Origin of Concepts\" which shows the basis of development of cognitive science.\n\nIn her professional experience she started out as an assistant professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) between 1972 and 1977. She then went to an associate professor at MIT in 1977 to 1984. Instead of being in the psychology department in 1984 she became a professor in the MIT's department of brain and cognitive sciences until 1996. She was a professor at NYU (New York University) for the department of psychology from 1996 to 2001, after her career at NYU she had moved to Harvard and is still currently teaching.\n\nSusan Carey has received many fellowships and honors.

{"id": "14239228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14239228", "title": "The King and Country debate", "text": "The King and Country debate\n\nThe King and Country debate took place at the Oxford Union debating society of Oxford University in England on 9 February 1933. The motion, \"that this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country\", was carried by 275 votes to 153. It is one of the most widely reported and discussed debates conducted at the Oxford Union.\n\nPrior to the debate, a similar motion had been proposed at the Cambridge Union by Arthur Ponsonby in March 1927: \"That lasting peace can only be secured by the people of England adopting an uncompromising attitude of pacifism\". The motion was passed by 213 votes to 138 and attracted no public attention.\n\nThe Oxford Union motion was proposed by Kenelm Hubert Digby of St John's College and opposed by K. R. F. Steel-Maitland of Balliol College. Among other speakers, Quintin Hogg argued against it. Digby found some difficulty obtaining a noted speaker to support the motion: Norman Angell, Bertrand Russell, Beverley Nichols and John Strachey were all unable to attend. Finally, philosopher C. E. M. Joad agreed to come and support the motion. Joad and David Maurice Graham of Balliol, the Union's Librarian at the time and the original drafter of the motion, argued in favour at the debate.\n\nThe teller for the Ayes was Max Beloff and that for the Noes was R. G. Thomas. The President of the Union was Frank Hardie.\n\nDigby addressed the packed chamber: \"It is no mere coincidence that the only country fighting for the cause of peace, Soviet Russia, is the country that has rid itself of the war-mongering clique. The justification urged for the last war was that it was a war to end war. If that were untrue it was a dastardly lie; if it were true, what justification is there for opposition to this motion tonight?\"\n\n\"Isis\", a student magazine of the University of Oxford, reported that Digby had a \"tub-thumping style of oratory which would be more appreciated in Hyde Park than in the Union\".\n\nHogg argued that the policy that Digby advocated would cause, not prevent, war. In his opinion, a powerful England was a factor for peace and a disarmed Britain would have no more influence for peace in Europe than it had in the Far East, with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.\n\nJoad delivered what was described as a \"tour de force of pacifist rhetoric\". He claimed that the motion really meant \"that this House will never commit murder on a huge scale whenever the Government decided it should do so\" and argued that although limited wars might have been justified in the past, the scale of destruction now possible with modern weapons meant that war had become unthinkable. Joad also postulated that any invasion of Britain could be defeated by a Gandhian campaign of nonviolence.\n\nAll told, there were five opening speakers, nine others supporting the motion and ten against. Future Oxford Union President David Lewis was the eighth of the nine speakers in support of the motion. When the motion was put, President Frank Hardie declared it carried, 275 votes to 153. Digby went to shake hands with Hogg, but his opponent refused to do so.\n\nA Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, R. B. McCallum, claimed that the \"sensation created when this resolution was passed was tremendous. It received world-wide publicity... Throughout England people, especially elderly people, were thoroughly shocked. Englishmen who were in India at the time have told me of the dismay they felt when they heard of it... 'What is wrong with the younger generation?' was the general query\".\n\nInitially, the debate gained little media attention, but the \"Daily Telegraph\" ran an article about the debate headlined \"DISLOYALTY AT OXFORD: GESTURE TOWARDS THE REDS\". The \"Daily Express\" wrote: \"There is no question but that the woozy-minded Communists, the practical jokers, and the sexual indeterminates of Oxford have scored a great success in the publicity that has followed this victory... Even the plea of immaturity, or the irresistible passion of the undergraduate for posing, cannot excuse such a contemptible and indecent action as the passing of that resolution\".\n\nThe \"Manchester Guardian\" responded differently: \"The obvious meaning of this resolution [is] youth's deep disgust with the way in which past wars for 'King and Country' have been made, and in which, they suspect, future wars may be made; disgust at the national hypocrisy which can fling over the timidities and follies of politicians, over base greeds and communal jealousies and jobbery, the cloak of an emotional symbol they did not deserve\".\n\nPart of the controversy arose because some newspapers falsely claimed that the supporters of the motion had insulted King George V (in fact, the British monarchy had been barely mentioned in the debate) or the British soldiers, killed in World War I\n\nA \"Daily Express\" reporter claimed to have found the Mayor of Oxford, Alderman C. H. Brown, and his wife sitting in front of the fire reading their bibles, with Brown claiming, \"I say that as mayor of a city that fathers a university of such foreign communistic sentiments, I am ashamed\". Cambridge University was reported to have threatened to pull out of that year's Boat Race because of \"incompatibility of temperament\".\n\nAn anonymous critic sent the Oxford Union a box containing 275 white feathers, one for each vote for the resolution. A second box followed, and Hardie announced that each member who had voted 'aye' could have two feathers.\n\nWinston Churchill condemned the motion in a speech on 17 February 1933 to the Anti-Socialist and Anti-Communist Union: \"That abject, squalid, shameless avowal... It is a very disquieting and disgusting symptom\":\n\nMy mind turns across the narrow waters of Channel and the North Sea, where great nations stand determined to defend their national glories or national existence with their lives. I think of Germany, with its splendid clear-eyed youths marching forward on all the roads of the Reich singing their ancient songs, demanding to be conscripted into an army; eagerly seeking the most terrible weapons of war; burning to suffer and die for their fatherland. I think of Italy, with her ardent Fascisti, her renowned Chief, and stern sense of national duty. I think of France, anxious, peace-loving, pacifist to the core, but armed to the teeth and determined to survive as a great nation in the world. One can almost feel the curl of contempt upon the lips of the manhood of all these people when they read this message sent out by Oxford University in the name of young England.\n\nBy contrast, Joad, A. A. Milne and Francis Wrigley Hirst all publicly defended the resolution. Hirst later argued in his book, \"Consequences of the War to Great Britain\" (1934), that the resolution did not rule out wars of self-defence, only imperialist conflicts. John Alfred Spender and James Louis Garvin took issue with the resolution, which, in their view, neglected the issue of war prevention.\n\nIn March 1933 the \"Oxford Pledge\" or \"Oxford Oath\", as the resolution came to be called, was adopted by the University of Manchester and the University of Glasgow. However, in the dominions of the British Empire, the University of Melbourne, the University of Toronto and the University of Cape Town all passed motions affirming that they would fight for King and Country.\n\nThree weeks after it was passed, Randolph Churchill proposed a resolution at the Oxford Union to delete the \"King and Country\" motion from the Union's records but was defeated by 750 votes to 138, in a rowdy debate, where Churchill was met by a barrage of hisses and stink bombs. A bodyguard of Oxford Conservatives and police escorted Churchill back to his hotel, after the debate.\n\nCharles Kimber, who would later lead the peace group Federal Union, was present at the debate, and later argued the vote was a protest against nationalist wars, not war in general. Kimber noted that several of the motion's supporters later fought with the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nSpeaking after the debate, Digby said: \"I believe that the motion was representative neither of the majority of the undergraduates of Oxford nor of the youth of this country. I am certain if war broke out tomorrow the students of the university would flock to the recruiting office as their fathers and uncles did.\" He was proved right: when World War II broke out in September 1939, the War Office organised a recruiting board at Oxford, which invited undergraduates and resident postgraduates under 25 to enlist: 2,632, out of a potential 3,000, volunteered. McCallum recalled at the outbreak of war two students, \"men of light and leading in their college and with a good academic record\" visited him to say goodbye before leaving to join their units. Both of them had separately said that if they had to vote on the \"King and Country\" resolution then and there, they would do so. One of them said: \"I am not going to fight for King and Country, and you will notice that no one, not Chamberlain, not Halifax, has asked us to\".\n\nTelford Taylor, chief United States prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, wrote \"the 'King and Country' debate was a colorful reflection of the British temper between the two great wars. Exhausted and disgusted by the prolonged bloodbath in Flanders Fields, wracked by internal economic strains and already tiring of the burdens of empire, neither the people nor their leaders were in any mood to embark on new crusades\".\n\nSixty years after the event, Digby mused, \"It was just a debate. I don't know what all the fuss was about. Frank Hardie had asked me to propose the motion and I agreed. That's all there was to it. But ever since the debate security intelligence organisations seem to have taken an interest in me\". Certainly Digby's subsequent career in Sarawak and the United Kingdom suffered by his association with the debate.\n\nIn a speech in the House of Commons on 20 July 1934, the Liberal MP Robert Bernays described a visit he made to Germany:\n\nThe 18-year-old Patrick Leigh Fermor, who was walking across Europe in 1934, \"dreaded\" being asked in Germany about the resolution, and tried to explain it: \"A kind of joke, really...I could detect a kindling glint of scornful pity and triumph in the surrounding eyes which declared quite plainly their certainty that, were I right, England was too far gone in degeneracy and frivolity to present a problem\". Benito Mussolini was particularly struck by the sentiment expressed by the undergraduates and became convinced that the Joad declaration proved that Britain was a \"frightened, flabby old woman\". While considering whether to take British threats seriously while embarking on his Abyssinia adventure Mussolini often referred to the Joad declaration on why he ignored British demands.\n\nMartin Ceadel, reviewing the German coverage of the \"King and Country Debate\", notes that although it was widely covered in Germany, the Nazis did not seem to have made political capital out of it: \"indeed, the London correspondent of the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" was in 1933 stressing rather the militarism of British youth\". Shortly before the outbreak of war in 1939, the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" was still \"insisting that the Oxford debate was insignificant\".\n\nChurchill would, after the war, write on how Japan and Germany too took note of the Joad resolution, which altered their way of thinking about Britain as a \"decadent, degenerate... and swayed many [of their] calculations\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "249606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249606", "title": "Tulu language", "text": "Tulu language\n\nTulu (Tulu: ) is a Dravidian language spoken mainly in the south west part of the Indian state of Karnataka and also in the Kasaragod district of Kerala. The Tulu speaking region is often referred to as Tulu Nadu. The native speakers of Tulu are referred to as \"Tuluva\" or Tulu people.\n\nThe Indian census report of 2011 reported a total of 1,846,427 native Tulu speakers in India. The 2001 census had reported a total of 1,722,768 native speakers, According to one estimate reported in 2009, Tulu is currently spoken by 3 to 5 million speakers in the world. There is some difficulty in counting Tulu speakers who have migrated from their native region as they often get counted as Kannada speakers in Indian Census reports\n\nSeparated early from Proto-South Dravidian, Tulu has several features not found in Tamil–Kannada. For example, it has the pluperfect and the future perfect, like French or Spanish, but formed without an auxiliary verb.\n\nRobert Caldwell, in his pioneering work \"A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages\", called this language \"peculiar and very interesting\". According to him, \"Tulu is one of the most highly developed languages of the Dravidian family. It looks as if it had been cultivated for its own sake.\"\n\nTulu is the primary spoken language in Tulu Nadu, a region comprising the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in the west of the state of Karnataka and the Kasaragod taluk. Non-native speakers of Tulu include those who speak the Beary language, Havyaka and Gowda dialects of Kannada as also Konkani, Koraga and Malayalam speakers resident in the Tulu Nadu region. Apart from Tulu Nadu, a significant emigrant population of Tulu speaking people is found in Maharashtra, Bangalore, Chennai, the English-speaking world, and the Gulf countries.\n\nThe various medieval inscriptions of Tulu from the 15th century are in the Tigalari or Tulu script. Two Tulu epics named \"Sri Bhagavato\" and \"Kaveri\" from the 17th century were also written in the same script. However, in modern times the Tulu language is mostly written using the Kannada script. The Tulu language is known for its oral literature in the form of epic poems called \"Paddana\" .The Epic of Siri and the legend of Koti and Chennayya belong to this category of Tulu literature.\n\nTulu belongs to the southern branch of the family of Dravidian languages. It descends directly from Proto-Southern Dravidian, which in turn descends directly from Proto-Dravidian, the hypothesised mother language from which all Dravidian languages descend. The Tulu language originates in the southern part of India.\n\nLinguists have suggested that the word \"Tulu\" means \"that which is connected with water\", based on words from Kannada and Tamil. \"Tulave\" (jack fruit) means \"watery\" in Tulu; and, other water-related words in Tulu include \"talipu\", \"teli\", \"teLi\", \"teLpu\", \"tuLipu\", \"tulavu\", and \"tamel\". In Kannada, there are words such as tuLuku means \"that which has characteristics of water\" and toLe In Tamil, thuli means drop of water; and, thulli means the same in Malayalam.\n\nTulu is not currently an official language of India or any other country. Efforts are being made to include Tulu to the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. In August 2017, an online campaign was organized to include Tulu to 8th schedule of constitution and in October 2017, when the prime minister, Narendra Modi visited Dharmasthala Temple same demand was presented in front of him.\n\nThe oldest available inscriptions in Tulu are from the period between 14th to 15th century AD. These inscriptions are in the Tigalari script and are found in areas in and around Barkur which was the capital of Tulu Nadu during the Vijayanagar period. Another group of inscriptions are found in the \"Ullur\" \"Subrahmanya\" Temple near Kundapura. Many linguists like S.U. Panniyadi and L. V. Ramaswami Iyer as well as P.S. Subrahmanya suggested that Tulu is among the oldest languages in the Dravidian family which branched independently from its Proto-Dravidian roots nearly 500 years ago. This assertion is based on the fact that Tulu still preserves many aspects of the Proto-Dravidian language.\n\nThis dating of Tulu is also based on the fact that the region where Tulu is natively spoken was known to the ancient Tamils as Tulu Nadu. Also, the Tamil poet Mamular who belongs to the Sangam Age (200 AD) describes Tulu Nadu and its dancing beauties in one of his poems. In the Halmidi inscriptions one finds mention of the Tulu country as the kingdom of the Alupas. The region was also known to the Greeks of the 2nd century as \"Tolokoyra\". The history of Tulu would not be complete without the mention of the Charition mime, a Greek play belonging to 2nd century BC. The play's plot centres around the coastal Karnataka, where Tulu is mainly spoken. The play is mostly in Greek, but the Indian characters in the play are seen speaking a language different from Greek.\n\nThere is considerable ambiguity regarding the Indian language in the play, though all scholars agree the Indian language is Dravidian, but there is considerable dispute over which one. Noted German Indologist Dr. E. Hultzsch was the first to suggest that the language was Dravidian. The dispute regarding the language in the play is yet to be settled, but scholars agree that the dispute arises from the fact that Old Kannada, Old Tamil and Tulu during the time when the play was written were perhaps dialectical variations of the same proto-language, and that over the years they evolved into their present forms as separate languages. Tulu is widely considered one of the most rich and well organized for many reasons. Found largely in Karnataka, it is spoken primarily within the Indian state. Dating back several hundred years, the language has developed numerous defining qualities. The Tulu people follow a saying which promotes leaving negative situations and finding newer, more positive ones. The language, however, is not as popular as others which means it could become endangered and extinct very soon. The influence of other mainstream languages is present danger for the Tulu people. With the right degree of awareness, we can help promote Tulu to more people who may appreciate it and its uniqueness.[https://archive.org/stream/elementsofcompar00lathrich/elementsofcompar00lathrich_djvu.txt <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] Today, it is spoken by nearly 1.8 million people around the globe. Large parts of the language are altered and changed constantly because it is commonly passed down through oral tradition. Oral traditions within Tulu have meant that certain phrases have not always maintained the same meaning or importance.\n\nAccording to Malayalam works like Keralolpathi and Sangam literature in Tamil, the region stretching from the Chandragiri river, now part of the Kasaragod district, Kerala, to Gokarna, now part of Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, was ruled by the Alupas and was known as Alva Kheda. This Kingdom was the Homeland of Tulu speaking people. \nHowever the present day Tulu linguistic majority area is confined to the region of Tulu Nadu, which comprises the districts of part of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in the Indian state of Karnataka and the northern part of Kasaragod district of Kerala up to the river Payaswani also known as Chandragiri. The cities of Mangalore, Udupi and Kasaragod being the cultural centres of Tulu culture.\n\nTuluvas have a saying: \"Oorudu nanji aanda paardh badkodu\" . A loose translation would be: \"If it's tough at home; run away and survive\". Tuluvas are true to this character and have migrated to other places in great numbers. Early migration was to neighbouring regions like Malabar (now Kerala), Mysore kingdom, Madras Presidency ( Tamil Nadu now - areas like salem, attur, chinnasalem, thiruvannamalai, villupuram, vellore, chennai and perambalur). The large scale migration of Tulu speaking people from undivided dakshina Kannada district to other provinces (regions) of India happened during World War I, but there is no concrete materialistic evidence to prove.\n\nThe reason being rationing of food grains by British who were ruling India then and spread of communicable diseases. The next wave of emigration was during World War II, now they settled in interior parts of Karnataka, coastal Andhra Pradesh and also far off cities like Mumbai and Chennai. They mostly ran restaurants serving Udupi cuisine. Mumbai and Thane in Maharashtra state has a sizable population of Tuluvas. Even today Tulu is widely spoken in the Dakshina Kannada, partially in Udupi district of Karnataka state and to some extent in Kasaragod of Kerala. Efforts are also being made to include Tulu in the list of Official languages of India. As a whole, Tulu is largely contained to the southern part of India. The Indian state of Karnataka is where the language seems to thrive in the present day. Some of the major cities within the Tulu culture include Kasaragod and Mangalore. [http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=138784 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] Speakers of the language have reflected interest in spreading to more modern nations such as the United States.\n\nThe various historical inscriptions of Tulu found around Barkur and Kundapura are in the Tigalari script. The Kannada script has become contemporary script for the Tulu language gradually. All contemporary works and literature are done in the Kannada script. Historically, Brahmins of Tulu Nadu and Havyaka Brahmins used the Tigalari script to write Vedas and other Sanskrit works. The Tigalari script is descended from the Brahmi through the Grantha script. It is a sister script of the Malayalam script. However, very few works written in vernacular languages like Kannada and Tulu are available. Hence, the Tigalari script was employed by Tulu Brahmins to write Tulu and Kannada languages apart from the Kannada script. The National Mission for Manuscripts has conducted several workshops on this script with the help of a scholar, Keladi Gunda Jois. In the 18th century, the use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in the Tigalari script contributed to the marginalization of the Tigalari script. Currently, the script is studied by few scholars and manuscriptologists for research and religious purposes. Although its contents is largely derived from the Kannada language, there is proof that Tulu may have been before others in the Dravidian family. The Kannada script has become the contemporary script for the Tulu language gradually. All contemporary works and literature are done in the Kannada script.\n\nTulu language has four dialects, which are broadly similar, with slight variations.\n\nThe four dialects are:\n\nFive short and five long vowels (\"a\", \"ā\", \"e\", \"ē\", \"u\", \"ū\", \"i\", \"ī\", \"o\", \"ō\") are common in Dravidian languages. Like Kodava Takk (and also like Konkani and Sinhala), Tulu also has an - or -like vowel, generally occurring word-finally. Kannada script does not have a symbol to specifically represent this vowel, which is often written as a normal \"e\". For example, the first person singular form and the third person singular masculine form of a verb are spelled identically in all tenses, both. ending in \"e\", but are pronounced differently: the terminating \"e\" in the former sounds nearly like ‘a’ in the English word ‘man’ ( \"maḷpuve\" , \"I make\"), while that in the latter like ‘e’ in ‘men’ ( \"maḷpuve\" , \"he makes\"). Paniyadi in his 1932 grammar used a special vowel sign to denote Tulu /ɛ/ in the Kannada script: according to Bhat, he used two \"telakaṭṭu\"s for this purpose (usually, a \"telakaṭṭu\" means the crest that a Kannada character like has), and the same convention was adopted by Upadhyaya in his 1988 Tulu Lexicon. The long counterpart of this vowel occurs in some words. In all dialects, the pair /e/ and /ɛ/ contrasts.\n\nAdditionally, like Kodava Takk and Toda, and like Malayalam \"saṁvr̥tōkāram\", Tulu has an -like vowel (or schwa ) as a phoneme, which is romanized as \"ŭ\" (ISO), \"ɯ\", or \"u̥\". Both J. Brigel and A. Männer say that it is pronounced like \"e\" in the French \"je\". Bhat describes this phoneme as /ɯ/. However, if it is like Malayalam \"half-u\", or may be a better description. In the Kannada script, Brigel and Männer used a virama (halant), , to denote this vowel. Bhat says a \"telakaṭṭu\" is used for this purpose, but apparently he too means a virama.\n\nThe following are consonant phonemes in Tulu:\nThe contrast between and is preserved in the South Common dialect and in the Brahmin dialect, but is lost in several dialects. Additionally, the Brahmin dialect has and . Aspirated consonants are sometimes used in the Brahmin dialect, but are not phonemic. In the Koraga and Holeya dialects, \"s\" and \"ś\" merge with \"c\" (the Koraga dialect of the Tulu language is different from the Koraga language). Word-initial consonant clusters are rare and occur mainly in Sanskrit loanwords. As noted in 'Dialects/Varieties', the Tulu alphabet resembles the Malayalam script in many ways. It is also similar to many characters found in the Tigalari alphabet. This is from the same region in the state of Karnataka. The Tigilari and Kannada alhpabets include a stress on vowels with \"a\" and \"o\"sounds. [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tulu.htm <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] Other vowels include sounds such as \"au\" \"am\" and \"ah\". Numerous consonants have their own origin from the Dravidian languages like \"kha\" \"gha\" \"dha\" and \"jha\". These are derived from the Tigalari alphabet.\n\nTulu has five parts of speech: nouns (substantives and adjectives), pronouns, numerals, verbs, and particles.\n\nSubstantives have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), two numbers (singular and plural), and eight cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, ablative or instrumental, communicative, and vocative). According to Bhat, Tulu has two distinct locative cases. The communicative case is used with verbs like \"tell\", \"speak\", \"ask\", \"beseech\", \"inquire\", and denotes \"at whom\" a message, an inquiry, or a request is aimed, as in \"I told \"him\".\" or \"I speak \"to them\".\" It is also used to denote \"relationship with whom\" it is about, in a context like \"I am on good terms \"with him\".\" or \"I have nothing \"against him\".\" Bhat calls it the sociative case. It is somewhat similar to the comitative case, but different in that it denotes communication or relationship, not physical companionship. The plural suffix is \"-rŭ\", \"-ḷu\", \"-kuḷu\", or \"-āḍḷu\"; as, \"mēji\" (\"table\"), \"mējiḷu\" (\"tables\"). The nominative case is unmarked, while the remaining cases are expressed by different suffixes.\n\nThe following table shows the declension of a noun, based on Brigel and Bhat (u̥ used by Brigel and ɯ used by Bhat are both shown as ŭ for clarity): when two forms are given, the one in parentheses is by Bhat, and the other is by Brigel. Some of these differences may be dialectal variations.\n\nThe personal pronouns are irregularly inflected: \"yānŭ\" \"I\" becomes \"yen-\" in oblique cases. Tulu makes the distinction between the inclusive and exclusive \"we\" (See \"Clusivity: Dravidian languages\"): \"nama\" \"we (including you)\" as opposed to \"yenkuḷu\" \"we (not including you)\". For verbs, this distinction does not exist. The personal pronouns of the second person are \"ī\" (oblique: \"nin-\") \"you (singular)\" and \"nikuḷu\" \"you (plural)\". Three genders are distinguished in the third person, as well as proximate and remote forms. For example, \"imbe\" \"he (proximate)\", \"āye\" \"he (remote)\". The suffix \"-rŭ\" makes a polite form of personal pronouns, as in \"īrŭ\" \"you (respectfully)\", \"ārŭ\" \"he (remote; respectfully)\".\nPostpositions are used usually with a noun in the genitive case, as in \"guḍḍe-da mittŭ\" \"on the hill\".\n\nTulu verbs have three forms: active, causative, and reflexive (or middle voice).\nThey conjugate for person, number, gender, tense (present, past, pluperfect, future, and future perfect), mood (indicative, imperative, conditional, infinitive, potential, and subjunctive), and polarity (positive and negative).\n\nEach sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate and every sentence is a full speech or thought in words. There is both singular and plural while being expressed in first through third person. There are several exceptions to each of these depending on the instance. For example: the verb has to be in a plural style if there are numerous nominatives within a sentence or of different genders that agree with the previous sentence. The verb may also be omitted in some sentences. Present tense and past tense may change and their perception.\n\nThe written literature of Tulu is not as large as the literature of other literary Dravidian languages such as Tamil. Nevertheless, Tulu is one of only five literary Dravidian languages, the other four being Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. The earliest available Tulu literature that survives to this date is the Tulu translation of the great Sanskrit epic of Mahabharata called Mahabharato (ಮಹಾಭಾರತೊ). It was written by \"Arunabja\" (1657 AD), a poet who lived in Kodavur near Udupi around late 14th to early 15th century AD.\nOther important literary works in Tulu are:\n\nThis script was mainly used to write religious and literary works in Sanskrit. Even today the official script of the eight Tulu monasteries (Ashta Mathas of Udupi) founded by Madhvacharya in Udupi is Tulu. The pontiffs of the monasteries write their names using this script when they are appointed.\n\nModern-day Tulu literature is written using the Kannada script. \"Mandara Ramayana\" is the most notable piece of modern Tulu literature. Written by Mandara Keshava Bhatt, it received the Sahitya Academy award for best poetry. \"Madipu\", \"Mogaveera\", \"Saphala\" and \"Samparka\" are popular Tulu periodicals published from Mangalore. The Tulu Sahitya Academy, established by the state government of Karnataka in 1994, as also the Kerala Tulu Academy established by the Indian State Government of Kerala in Manjeshwaram in 2007, are important governmental organisations that promote Tulu literature. Nevertheless, there are numerous organisations spread all over the world with significant Tulu-migrated populations that contribute to Tulu literature. Some notable contributors of Tulu literature are Kayyar Kinhanna Rai, M. K. Seetharam Kulal, Amruta Someshwara, B. A. Viveka Rai, Kedambadi Jattappa Rai, Venkataraja Puninchattaya, Paltadi Ramakrishna Achar, Dr. Sunitha M. Shetty, Dr. Vamana Nandavara, Sri. Balakrishna Shetty Polali.\nThe oral traditions of Tulu are one of the major traditions that greatly show the finer aspects of the language. The following are various forms of Tulu oral tradition and literature.\n\n\nTheatre in the form of the traditional Yakshagana, prevalent in coastal Karnataka and northern Kerala has greatly preserved the finer aspects of the Tulu language. Yakshagana which is conducted in Tulu is very popular among the Tuluva people. It can also be seen as a form of temple art, as there are many Yakshagana groups that are attached to temples, for example that of Kateel Durga Parameshwari Temple as also the Udupi Krishna Temple.\n\nPresently, eight professional Yakshagana troupes perform Tulu-language Yakshagana not only during the Yakshagana season but also during the off-season in various places in Karnataka and outside. In Mumbai, Tulu Yakshagana is very popular among the Tulu audiences. More than 2,000 Yakshagana artistes take part in the performance in various places in Mumbai annually. Notable performers include Kalladi Koraga Shetty, Pundur Venkatraja Puninchathaya, Guru Bannanje Sanjiva Suvarna and Pathala Venkatramana Bhat.\n\nTulu plays are among the major entertainment for admirers of art and culture in the Tulu Nadu. Tulu plays, generally centered on the comic genre, are very popular in Mumbai and Bangalore outside Tulu Nadu.\n\nThe Tulu cinema industry is fairly small; it produces around five films annually. The first film, \"Enna Thangadi\", was released in 1971. Usually these films are released in theatres across the Tulu Nadu region and on DVD. The critically acclaimed film \"Suddha\" won the award for Best Indian Film at the Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema in New Delhi in 2006. As of 2015, \"Oriyardori Asal\" (2011) has been the most commercially successful Tulu film. Chaali Polilu is the longest-running film in Tulu film history, as well as the highest-grossing film in the Tulu film industry. It has successfully completed 470 days at PVR Cinemas in Mangalore. The 2014 film \"Madime\" was reported to be remade in Marathi, thereby becoming the first Tulu film to be remade in another language. \"Shutterdulai\" was the first remake in Tulu cinema. \"Eregla Panodchi\" is the second remake in Tulu cinemas. A suit for damages of Rs. 25 lakhs was filed against the makers of the Telugu film \"Brahmotsavam\" for copying the first 36 seconds of the song \"A...lele...yereg madme\" by Dr. Vamana Nandaavara found in the \"Deepanalike\" CD composed for the Siri channel. The song was used in the movie in a sequence involving the lead actor who, while accompanying his family on a tour, dances to the tune of the hit Tulu song. \"Prajavani\" reported that with its dubbing rights sold to Hindi for 21 lakhs, the 2018 movie \"Umil\" became the first Tulu movie to achieve the feat.\n\nTulu as a language continues to thrive in coastal Karnataka and Kasaragod in Kerala. Tulu Sahitya Academy, an institute established by the state government of Karnataka, has introduced Tulu as a language in schools around coastal Karnataka, including Alva's High School, Moodbidri; Dattanjaneya High School, Odiyoor; Ramakunjeshwara English-medium High School, Ramakunja; and Vani Composite Pre-University College, Belthangady. Initially started in 16 schools, the language is now taught in over 33 schools, of which 30 are in Dakshina Kannada district. More than 1500 students have opted this language.\n\nTulu is also taught as a language at the post graduate level in Mangalore University, and there is a dedicated department for Tulu studies, Translation and Research at Dravidian University in Kuppam Andhra Pradesh.The Government Degree College at Kasaragod in Kerala has also introduced a certificate course in Tulu for the academic year 2009-2010. It has also introduced Tulu as an optional subject in its Kannada post-graduation course. It has adopted syllabi from the books published by the Tulu Sahitya Academy.\n\nGerman missionaries Revs. Kammerer and Männer were the first people to conduct research on the language. Rev. Krammer collected about 3,000 words and their meanings until he died. Later his work was carried on by Rev. Männer, who completed the research and published the first dictionary of the Tulu language in 1886 with the help of the then Madras government. The effort was incomplete, as it did not cover all aspects of the language. The Govinda Pai Research Centre at MGM College, Udupi started an 18-year Tulu lexicon project in the year 1979.\n\nDifferent dialects, special vocabularies used for different occupational activities, rituals, and folk literature in the forms of Paād-danāas were included in this project. The Centre has also released a six-volume, trilingual, modestly priced Tulu-Kannada-English lexicon. The Tulu lexicon was awarded the Gundert Award for the best dictionary in the country in 1996. In September 2011, the Academic Council of Mangalore University accepted a proposal, to allow the university and the colleges affiliated to it to offer certificates, diplomas and postgraduate diploma courses in Tulu, both in regular and correspondence modes\n\n\n\n"}

It may be made of tarlatan, muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon. Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip.\n\nThe derivation of the word \"tutu\" is unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881. One theory is that it is simply derived from the word \"tulle\" (one of the materials from which it is made).\n\nAnother theory is that it derives from French babytalk for bottom (\"cucul\"): during that era, the \"abonnés\" (rich male subscribers at the Paris Opera Ballet) were encouraged to mix with the ballet girls in the foyer, and arrange assignations. It is suggested the expression came from the abonnés playfully patting the back of the tulle dress with the saying \"pan-pan cucul\" (French for \"I'll spank your bottom\").\n\nA third, related theory suggests a derivation from the more vulgar French word, \"cul\" (which can be used to refer to the bottom or genital area). During this era, women (including dancers) wore pantalettes as underwear, which were open at the crotch. The abonnés favoured the very front rows in the hope of a scandalous view, and the skirt was modified for that reason. This is supported by the description by nineteenth-century balletomane, Charles Nuitter, who defined \"tutu\" as \"a slang term for the very short petticoat worn by \"danseuses\" in the interest of modesty.\"\n\nThe skirt that became known as the Romantic tutu made its first appearance in 1832 at the Paris Opera, where Marie Taglioni wore a gauzy white skirt cut to reveal her ankles, designed by Eugene Lami in \"La Sylphide\". From the late 19th century onwards, the tutu was steadily shortened, for ease of movement and to show off the dancer's legs.\n\nFashion designers have often been involved in design for ballet. Fashion designers Cecil Beaton in England, Christian Lacroix in France, and Isaac Mizrahi in the United States have all designed tutus. Among the leading makers of tutus around the world, few designers have matched the reputation of Barbara Karinska (1886-1983), costumer for the New York City Ballet for many years, She designed and constructed tutus of extraordinary beauty and durability.\n\n"}
{"id": "3977384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3977384", "title": "Tyler Burge", "text": "Tyler Burge\n\nTyler Burge (; born 1946) is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at UCLA. Burge has made contributions to many areas of philosophy, including the philosophy of mind, philosophy of logic, epistemology, philosophy of language, and the history of philosophy.\n\nBurge earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University in 1971 where he worked with Donald Davidson and John Wallace. He joined the UCLA faculty that year (1971), and has taught there ever since, with visiting professorships also at Stanford University, Harvard University, and MIT. He is an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1993 and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy since 1999. He was the recipient of the 2010 Jean Nicod Prize.\n\nBurge has argued for anti-individualism. In Burge's words, anti-individualism is a theory that asserts the following: “individuating many of a person or animal’s mental kinds … is necessarily dependent on relations that the person bears to the physical, or in some cases social, environment\". This view, and some variants, has been called \"content externalism\", or just \"externalism.\" Burge favors \"anti-individualism\" over this terminology, in part because he considers the central issue to be what individuates content, rather than where contents may be located, as \"externalism\" may suggest. (Burge 2003, 435-6).\nBurge argues in a similar fashion that a person's beliefs are dependent on the physical world. In his thought experiment he attempted to demonstrate that all thoughts and beliefs have wide contents.\n\nIn “The Meaning of Meaning” (1975), Putnam had argued that the meaning of a natural kind term such as “water” depends on the nature of the physical world. Burge argues that the difference in the thoughts is attributable to the difference between the nature of stuffs in the respective physical environments. As with the \"arthritis\" thought experiment, dependence of thought on the physical environment is a conclusion that is supposed to follow purely from reflection on the cases in the thought experiment.\n\nBurge has extended the thesis of anti-individualism into the realm of the theory of vision, arguing that the contents of representations posited by a computational theory of vision, such as that pioneered by David Marr, are dependent on the environment of the organism's evolutionary history. (See Burge 1986.)\n\nAnti-individualism about thoughts is a controversial thesis. It has been disputed on a number of grounds. For example, it has been claimed that the thesis undermines a person's authoritative knowledge of their own thought contents. (See, e.g., McKinsey 1991.) It has also been thought to cause problems for our understanding of the way that mental states cause behavior. (See, e.g., Fodor 1991.) Burge (1988) has argued that anti-individualism is compatible with knowledge of our own mental states. He has also argued that it presents no problems for our understanding of causation. (See Burge 1989.)\n\nBurge published his first book-length monograph in 2010, offering a philosophical account of perception heavily informed by empirical psychology. The book was described by one reviewer as \"an absolutely terrific work, conceived and executed at a scale and level of ambition rarely seen in contemporary philosophy. The book's primary aim is to contribute a theory of perception; more broadly, however, it also delivers a subtle and nuanced query into the place of distinctively psychological capacities in the natural order.\"\n\nIn the history of philosophy, he has published articles on the philosophy of Gottlob Frege, and René Descartes. A collection of his writings on Frege, along with a substantial introduction and several postscripts by the author, has been published (Burge, 2005). In epistemology, he has written on such topics as self-knowledge, interlocution, reasoning and memory, and reflection (Burge 2013). He is perhaps most well known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, including his views on de re belief and, most notably, anti-individualism with respect to mental content, which is also known as externalism, the view that the content of one's thoughts depends partly on the external environment. A festschrift devoted mostly to Burge's work on anti-individualism, including extensive replies from Burge to the contributors, has also appeared (Hahn and Ramberg 2003). Since 1978, four of Burge's articles have been chosen as among \"the ten best\" of the year by \"The Philosopher's Annual\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "620412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620412", "title": "Undercover operation", "text": "Undercover operation\n\nTo go \"undercover\" is to avoid detection by the entity one is observing, and especially to disguise one's own identity or use an assumed identity for the purposes of gaining the trust of an individual or organization to learn or confirm confidential information or to gain the trust of targeted individuals in order to gather information or evidence. Traditionally, it is a technique employed by law enforcement agencies or private investigators, and a person who works in such a role is commonly referred to as an undercover agent.\n\nUndercover work has been used in a variety of ways throughout the course of history, but the first organized, but informal, undercover program was first employed in France by Eugène François Vidocq in the early 19th century, from the late First Empire through most of the Bourbon Restoration. At the end of 1811, Vidocq set up an informal plainclothes unit, the \"Brigade de la Sûreté\" (\"Security Brigade\"), which was later converted to a security police unit under the Prefecture of Police. The Sûreté initially had eight, then twelve, and, in 1823, twenty employees. One year later, it expanded again, to 28 secret agents. In addition, there were eight people who worked secretly for the Sûreté, but instead of a salary, they received licences for gambling halls. A major portion of Vidocq's subordinates were ex-criminals like himself.\n\nVidocq personally trained his agents, for example, in selecting the correct disguise based on the kind of job. He himself still went out hunting for criminals too. His memoirs are full of stories about how he outsmarted crooks by pretending to be a beggar or an old cuckold. At one point, he even simulated his own death.\n\nIn England, the first modern police force was established in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel as the Metropolitan Police of London. From the start, the force occasionally employed plainclothes undercover detectives, but there was much public anxiety that these powers were being used for the purpose of political repression. In part due to these concerns, the 1845 official \"Police Orders\" required all undercover operations to be specifically authorized by the superintendent. It was only in 1869 that Police commissioner Edmund Henderson established a formal plainclothes detective division.\nThe first Special Branch of police was the Special Irish Branch, formed as a section of the Criminal Investigation Department of the MPS in London in 1883, initially to combat the bombing campaign that the Irish Republican Brotherhood had begun a few years earlier. This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counter terrorism techniques.\n\nIts name was changed to Special Branch as it had its remit gradually expanded to incorporate a general role in counter terrorism, combating foreign subversion and infiltrating organized crime. Law enforcement agencies elsewhere established similar Branches.\n\nIn the United States, a similar route was taken with the establishment of the Italian Squad in 1906 by the New York City Police Department under police commissioner William McAdoo to combat rampant crime and intimidation in the poor Italian neighborhoods. Various federal agencies began their own undercover programs shortly afterwards – the Federal Bureau of Investigation was founded in 1908.\n\nThere are two principal problems that can affect agents working in undercover roles. The first is the maintenance of identity and the second is the reintegration back into normal duty.\n\nLiving a double life in a new environment presents many problems. Undercover work is one of the most stressful jobs a special agent can undertake. The largest cause of stress identified is the separation of an agent from friends, family and his normal environment. This simple isolation can lead to depression and anxiety. There is no data on the divorce rates of agents, but strain on relationships does occur. This can be a result of a need for secrecy and an inability to share work problems, and the unpredictable work schedule, personality and lifestyle changes and the length of separation can all result in problems for relationships.\n\nStress can also result from an apparent lack of direction of the investigation or not knowing when it will end. The amount of elaborate planning, risk, and expenditure can pressure an agent to succeed, which can cause considerable stress. The stress that an undercover agent faces is considerably different from his counterparts on regular duties, whose main source of stress is the administration and the bureaucracy. As the undercover agents are removed from the bureaucracy, it may result in another problem. The lack of the usual controls of a uniform, badge, constant supervision, a fixed place of work, or (often) a set assignment could, combined with their continual contact with the organized crime, increase the likelihood for corruption.\n\nThis stress may be instrumental in the development of drug or alcohol abuse in some agents. They are more prone to the development of an addiction as they suffer greater stress than other police, they are isolated, and drugs are often very accessible. Police, in general, have very high alcoholism rates compared to most occupational groups, and stress is cited as a likely factor. The environment that agents work in often involves a very liberal exposure to the consumption of alcohol, which in conjunction with the stress and isolation could result in alcoholism.\n\nThere can be some guilt associated with going undercover due to betraying those who have come to trust the officer. This can cause anxiety or even, in very rare cases, sympathy with those being targeted. This is especially true with the infiltration of political groups, as often the agent will share similar characteristics with those they are infiltrating like class, age, ethnicity or religion. This could even result in the conversion of some agents.\n\nThe lifestyle led by undercover agents is very different compared to other areas in law enforcement, and it can be quite difficult to reintegrate back into normal duties. Agents work their own hours, they are removed from direct supervisory monitoring, and they can ignore the dress and etiquette rules. So resettling back into the normal police role requires the shedding of old habits, language and dress. After working such free lifestyles, agents may have discipline problems or exhibit neurotic responses. They may feel uncomfortable, and take a cynical, suspicious or even paranoid world view and feel continually on guard.\nOther risks include capture, death and torture.\n\nUndercover agents should not be confused with law enforcement officers who wear plainclothes. This method is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. To wear plainclothes is to wear civilian clothes, instead of wearing a uniform, to avoid detection or identification as a law enforcement officer. However, plainclothes police officers typically carry normal police equipment and normal identification. Police detectives are assigned to wear plainclothes by wearing suits instead of the uniform typically worn by their peers. Police officers in plainclothes must identify themselves when using their police powers; however, they are not required to identify themselves on demand and may lie about their status as a police officer.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41859", "title": "Voice-operated switch", "text": "Voice-operated switch\n\nIn telecommunications, a voice operated switch, also known as VOX or voice-operated exchange, is a switch that operates when sound over a certain threshold is detected. It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. It is used instead of a push-to-talk button on transmitters or to save storage space on recording devices. On cell phones, it is used to save battery life. Intercom systems that use a speaker in a room as both a speaker and a microphone will often use VOX on the main console to switch the audio direction during a conversation. The circuit usually includes a delay between the sound stopping and switching direction, to avoid the circuit turning off during short pauses in speech.\n\nA special case exists, if there is enough energy to power the system directly. For example, a microphone may send a voltage, high enough, to directly operate a transmitter. \n\nUnlike manual push-to-talk (PTT) operation, VOX is\nautomatic; the user can keep his or her hands free while talking. But VOX also has some significant disadvantages that explain why PTT is still common.\n\nMost VOX circuits have a sensitivity adjustment, but unwanted (and sometimes undetected) VOX triggering can still occur on background noise, heavy breathing or a side conversation. Conversely, it may not activate when desired on speech that is too weak.\n\nThe VOX in a two-way radio can also be triggered by the loudspeaker carrying the other side of the conversation. This problem can be\nminimized with an \"anti vox\" feature to decrease VOX sensitivity when the receiver is active.\n\nTransmitters and recorders have short but finite activation times that\nmay clip the beginnings of phrases. Some modern VOX circuits eliminate this problem by recording or transmitting a delayed version of the input signal. An older way of overcoming this, used by pilots, and astronauts, as some of the first users of VOX, was to habitually preface every transmission with \"uh\" in place of keying the microphone. \n\nVOX uses a \"hang\" timer, typically 1-3 seconds, to remain engaged during brief speech pauses. This means the last several seconds of each transmission or recorded segment are always silence. A VOX-activated recorder can delete the end of each segment but the user of a VOX-activated half duplex radio must wait for the timer to expire before he or she can receive again.\n"}

It was popularized by the Italian-American community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1940s.\n\nAlthough often used as a greeting, \"yo\" may come at the end of a sentence, often to direct focus onto a particular individual or group or to gain the attention of another individual or group.\n\nThe interjection \"yo\" was first used in Middle English. In addition to \"yo\", it was also sometimes written \"io\".\n\nThough the term may have been in use in the 16th century, its current popularity stems from its use in Philadelphia's Italian American population in the twentieth century, which spread to other ethnic groups in the city, notably among the African Americans.\n\nFrom the late twentieth century it frequently appeared in hip hop music and became associated with African American Vernacular English, as seen in the title \"Yo! MTV Raps\", a popular American television hip-hop music program in the 1980s.\n\nA frequent example of the expression is fictional Philadelphian Rocky Balboa, where the word is used throughout all of the Rocky films, and is part of the iconic line, \"Yo, Adrian, I did it!\", which was ranked 80th in the AFI's list of 100 best movie quotes.\n\nThe phrase \"Yo, Blair.

It is populated by several races, known as the \"Thinking Kinds\". The Thinking kinds include the humans, the \"ktuvoks\" (swamp reptiles considered demons by most Almean humans), the \"iliu\" (ancient wise aquatic race, playing a role similar to elves in Tolkien's mythos), the \"flaids\" (said to be 'friendly but insane'), the \"elcari\" (hard-working mountain dwellers comparable to Tolkien's dwarves), and the \"icëlani\" (more primitive relatives of humans). Almea's main continent, Ereláe, has several nations, including Verduria, which is the most detailed, Dhekhnam, which is a ktuvok empire (meaning that humans function as slaves to the \"ktuvoks\" there, much like blacks were slaves to whites in the South), and Skouras, a detailed maritime nation. Ereláe also has a detailed historical atlas, which was inspired by the New Penguin Historical Atlases. In addition to the various atlases and languages, there is also a wiki called the Almeopedia, which works as an encyclopedic reference. The part of the website devoted to Almea, Virtual Verduria, also includes a range of stories and guides to various subjects, including drawing and maps.\n\nLanguages of Almea described on the website include:\n\nMost words in those languages have etymologies, being derived from proto-languages (like Proto-Eastern above) by means of sound changes, and are given historical backgrounds, resulting in the presence of loan-words.\n\n\n"}
