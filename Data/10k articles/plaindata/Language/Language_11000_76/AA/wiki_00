{"id": "177772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177772", "title": "Bosnian language", "text": "Bosnian language\n\nThe Bosnian language (; \"bosanski\" / босански ) is the standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian mainly used by Bosniaks. Bosnian is one of three such varieties considered official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with Croatian and Serbian, and also an officially recognized minority or regional language in Serbia, Montenegro, and the Republic of Kosovo.\n\nBosnian uses both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, with Latin in everyday use. It is notable among the varieties of Serbo-Croatian for a number of Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and Persian loanwords, largely due to the language's interaction with those cultures through Islamic ties.\n\nBosnian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of Standard Croatian, Serbian, and Montenegrin. Until the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, they were treated as a unitary Serbo-Croatian language, and that term is still used in English to subsume the common base (vocabulary, grammar and syntax) of what are today officially four national standards, although this term is controversial for native speakers, and paraphrases such as \"Serbo-Croato-Bosnian\" (SCB) or \"Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian\" (BCS) are therefore sometimes used instead, especially in diplomatic circles.\n\n \n\nAlthough Bosnians are, at the level of colloquial idiom, linguistically more homogeneous than either Serbians or Croatians, unlike those nations they failed to codify a standard language in the 19th century, with at least two factors being decisive:\n\n\nThe literature of the so-called \"Bosnian revival\" at the start of the 20th century was written in an idiom that was closer to the Croatian standard than to the Serbian one: it was a western Shtokavian dialect with an Ijekavian accent and used a Latin script, but had recognizable Bosnian lexical traits. The main authors were the polymath, politician and poet Safvet-beg Bašagić and the storyteller Edhem Mulabdić.\n\nThe modern Bosnian standard took shape in the 1990s and 2000s. Lexically, Islamic-Oriental loanwords are more frequent; phonetically: the phoneme /x/ (letter \"h\") is reinstated in many words as a distinct feature of vernacular Bosniak speech and language tradition; also, there are some changes in grammar, morphology and orthography that reflect the Bosniak pre-World War I literary tradition, mainly that of the Bosniak renaissance at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe name \"Bosnian language\" is a controversial issue for some Croats and Serbs, who also refer to it as the \"Bosniak\" language ( / ; ). Bosniak linguists however insist that the only legitimate name is \"Bosnian\" language (\"\"), and that that is the name that both Croats and Serbs should use. The controversy arises because the name \"Bosnian\" may seem to imply that it is the language of all Bosnians, while Bosnian Croats and Serbs reject that designation for their idioms.\n\nThe language is called \"Bosnian language\" in the 1995 Dayton Accords and is concluded by observers to have received legitimacy and international recognition at the time.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO), United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN), and the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) recognize the Bosnian language. Furthermore, the status of the Bosnian language is also recognized by bodies such as the United Nations, UNESCO, and translation and interpreting accreditation agencies, including internet translation services.\n\nMost English-speaking language encyclopaedias (Routledge, Glottolog, Ethnologue, etc.) register the language solely as \"Bosnian\" language. The Library of Congress registered the language as \"Bosnian\" and gave it an ISO-number. The Slavic language institutes in English-speaking countries offer courses in \"Bosnian\" or \"Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian\" language, not in \"Bosniak\" language (e.g. Columbia, Cornell, Chicago, Washington, Kansas). The same thing in German-speaking countries, where the language is taught under the name ', not ' (e.g. Vienna, Graz, Trier) with very few exceptions.\n\nSome Croatian linguists (Zvonko Kovač, Ivo Pranjković, Josip Silić) support the name \"Bosnian\" language, whereas others (Radoslav Katičić, Dalibor Brozović, Tomislav Ladan) hold that the term \"Bosnian language\" is the only one appropriate and that accordingly the terms Bosnian language and Bosniak language refer to two different things. The Croatian state institutions, such as the Central Bureau of Statistics, use both terms: \"Bosniak\" language was used in the 2001 census, while the census in 2011 used the term \"Bosnian\" language.\n\nThe majority of Serbian linguists hold that the term \"Bosniak language\" is the only one appropriate, which was agreed as early as 1990.\n\nThe original form of The Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina called the language \"Bosniac language\", until 2002 when it was changed in Amendment XXIX of the Constitution of the Federation by Wolfgang Petritsch. The original text of the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was agreed in Vienna, and was signed by Krešimir Zubak and Haris Silajdžić on March 18, 1994.\n\nThe constitution of , the Serb-dominated entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, did not recognize any language or ethnic group other than Serbian. Bosniaks were mostly expelled from the territory controlled by the Serbs from 1992, but immediately after the war they demanded the restoration of their civil rights in those territories. The Bosnian Serbs refused to make reference to the Bosnian language in their constitution and as a result had constitutional amendments imposed by High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch. However, the constitution of refers to it as the \"Language spoken by Bosniaks\", because the Serbs were required to recognise the language officially, but wished to avoid recognition of its name.\n\nSerbia includes the Bosnian language as an elective subject in primary schools. Montenegro officially recognizes the Bosnian language: its 2007 Constitution specifically states that although Montenegrin is the official language, Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian are also in official use.\n\n\nThe differences between the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian literary standards are minimal. Although Bosnian employs more Turkish, Persian, and Arabic loanwords—commonly called orientalisms—it is very similar to both Serbian and Croatian in its written and spoken form.\n\nThe Bosnian language, as a new normative register of the Shtokavian dialect, was officially introduced in 1996 with the publication of ' in Sarajevo. According to that work, Bosnian differed from Serbian and Croatian on some main linguistic characteristics, such as: sound formats in some words, especially \"h\" (' versus Serbian '); substantial and deliberate usage of Oriental (\"Turkish\") words; spelling of future tense (') as in Croatian but not Serbian (\"\") (both forms have the same pronunciation).\n\n\n"}

This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist Wolfgang Köhler in 1929. In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of Tenerife (where the primary language is Spanish), Köhler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called \"takete\" and which was called \"baluba\" (\"maluma\" in the 1947 version). Although not explicitly stated, Köhler implies that there was a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with \"takete\" and the rounded shape with \"baluba\".\n\nIn 2001, Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words \"kiki\" and \"bouba\" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India \"Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?\" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as \"bouba\" and the jagged one as \"kiki\", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way. Work by Daphne Maurer and colleagues shows that even children as young as 2 years old may show this effect as well. The effect does not occur in all communities, and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.\n\nThe effect has also been shown to emerge when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as \"Molly\" with round silhouettes, and names such as \"Kate\" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (\"e.g.\", easygoingness with \"round names\"; determination with \"sharp names\"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.\n\nRamachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary. The rounded shape may most commonly be named \"bouba\" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sound \"kiki\". Alternatively, the distinction may be between coronal or dorsal consonants like /k/ and labial consonants like /b/. Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects. The presence of these \"synesthesia-like mappings\" suggest that this effect might be the neurological basis for sound symbolism, in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and events in the world.\n\nMore recently, research indicated that the effect may be a case of ideasthesia. Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek \"idea\" and \"aisthesis\", meaning \"sensing concepts\" or \"sensing ideas\", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.\n\nAutistic individuals do not show as strong a preference. Individuals without autism agree with the standard result 88% of the time, while individuals with autism agree only 56% of the time.\n"}

{"id": "6212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6212", "title": "Context-sensitive language", "text": "Context-sensitive language\n\nIn formal language theory, a context-sensitive language is a language that can be defined by a context-sensitive grammar (and equivalently by a noncontracting grammar). Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\n\nComputationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only formula_1 cells, where formula_2 is the size of the input and formula_3 is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.\n\nThis set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\")), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The class LINSPACE (or DSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\"))) is defined the same, except using a deterministic Turing machine. Clearly LINSPACE is a subset of NLINSPACE, but it is not known whether LINSPACE=NLINSPACE.\n\nOne of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is formula_4: the language of all strings consisting of formula_2 occurrences of the symbol \"a\", then formula_2 \"b\"'s, then formula_2 \"c\"'s (abc, , , etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language, is defined as the set of all strings where \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often (, , etc.) and is also context-sensitive.\n\nformula_8 can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts formula_8. The language can easily be shown to be neither regular nor context free by applying the respective pumping lemmas for each of the language classes to formula_8.\n\nSimilarly:\nformula_11 is another context-sensitive language; the corresponding formula_12 can be easily projected starting with two context-free grammars generating sentential forms in the formats\nformula_13\nand\nformula_14\nand then supplementing them with a permutation production like \nformula_15, a new starting symbol and standard syntactic sugar.\nformula_16 is another context-sensitive language (the \"3\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a ternary alphabet); that is, the \"product\" operation defines a context-sensitive language (but the \"sum\" defines only a context-free language as the grammar formula_17 and formula_18 shows). Because of the commutative property of the product, the most intuitive grammar for formula_19 is ambiguous. This problem can be avoided considering a somehow more restrictive definition of the language, e.g. formula_20. This can be specialized to \nformula_21 and, from this, to formula_22, formula_23, etc.\nformula_24 is a context-sensitive language. The corresponding formula_12 can be obtained as a generalization of the formula_26 for formula_27, formula_28, etc.\nformula_29 is a context-sensitive language (see example 9.5 (p. 224) of Hopcroft, John E.; Ullman, Jeffrey D. (1979). Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation. Addison-Wesley).\nformula_30 is a context-sensitive language (the \"2\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a binary alphabet). This was proved by Hartmanis using pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages over a binary alphabet and, after that, sketching a multitape LBA accepting formula_31.\nformula_32 is a context-sensitive language (the \"1\" in the name of this language is intended to mean an unary alphabet). This was credited by A. Salomaa to Matti Soittola by means of a formula_33 over an unary alphabet(pages 213-214, exercise 6.8) and also to Marti Penttonen by means of a formula_12 also over an unary alphabet (See: Formal Languages by A. Salomaa, page 14, Example 2.5).\nAn example of recursive language that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an EXPSPACE-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent regular expressions with exponentiation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1169088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169088", "title": "Cypriot Greek", "text": "Cypriot Greek\n\nCypriot Greek () is the variety of Modern Greek that is spoken by the majority of the Cypriot populace and Greek Cypriot diaspora. It is a markedly divergent variety as it differs from Standard Modern Greek in various aspects of its lexicon, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and even pragmatics, not only for historical reasons, but also because of geographical isolation, different settlement patterns, and extensive contact with typologically distinct languages.\n\nCypriot Greek is not an evolution of ancient Arcadocypriot Greek, but derives from Byzantine Medieval Greek. It has traditionally been placed in the southeastern group of Modern Greek varieties, along with the dialects of the Dodecanese and Chios (with which it shares several phonological phenomena).\n\nThough Cypriot Greek tends to be regarded as a dialect by its speakers, it is unintelligible to speakers of Standard Modern Greek without adequate prior exposure. Greek-speaking Cypriots are diglossic in the vernacular Cypriot Greek (the \"low\" variety) and Standard Modern Greek (the \"high\" variety). Cypriot Greek is itself a dialect continuum with an emerging koine. argue that diglossia has given way to a \"post-diglossic [dialectal] continuum [...] a quasi-continuous spread of overlapping varieties\".\n\nStudies of the phonology of Cypriot Greek are few and tend to examine very specific phenomena, e.g. gemination, \"glide hardening\". A general overview of the phonology of Cypriot Greek has only ever been attempted once, by , but parts of it are now contested.\n\nCypriot Greek has geminate and palato-alveolar consonants, which Standard Modern Greek lacks, as well as a contrast between and , which Standard Modern Greek also lacks. The table below, adapted from , depicts the consonantal inventory of Cypriot Greek.\n\nStops and affricate are unaspirated and may be pronounced weakly voiced in fast speech. are always heavily aspirated and they are never preceded by nasals, with the exception of some loans, e.g. \"shampoo\". and are laminal post-alveolars. is pronounced similarly to , in terms of closure duration and aspiration.\n\nVoiced fricatives are often pronounced as approximants and they are regularly elided when intervocalic. is similarly often realised as an approximant in weak positions.\n\nThe palatal lateral approximant is most often realised as a singleton or geminate lateral or a singleton or geminate fricative , and sometimes as a glide (cf. yeísmo). The circumstances under which all the different variants surface are not very well understood, but appear to be favoured in stressed syllables and word-finally, and before . identifies the following phonological and non-phonological influencing factors: stress, preceding vowel, following vowel, position inside word; and sex, education, region, and time spent living in Greece (where is standard). notes that speakers of some local varieties, notably that of Larnaca, \"substitute\" the geminate fricative for , but contests this, saying that, \" is robustly present in the three urban areas of Lefkosia, Lemesos and Larnaka as well as the rural Kokinohoria region, especially among teenaged speakers ... the innovative pronunciation is not a feature of any local patois, but rather a supra-local feature.\"\n\nThe palatal nasal is produced somewhat longer than other singleton nasals, though not as long as geminates. is similarly \"rather long\".\n\nThe alveolar trill is the geminate counterpart of the tap .\n\nIn analyses that posit a phonemic (but not phonetic) glide , palatals and postalveolars arise from CJV (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, namely:\n\nThe glide is not assimilated, but hardens to an obstruent after and to after . At any rate, velar stops and fricatives are in complementary distribution with palatals and postalveolars before front vowels ; that is to say, broadly, are palatalised to either or ; to or ; and to .\n\nThere is considerable disagreement on how to classify Cypriot Greek geminates, though they are now generally understood to be \"geminates proper\" (rather than clusters of identical phonemes or \"fortis\" consonants). Geminates are 1.5 to 2 times longer than singletons, depending, primarily, on position and stress. Geminates occur both word-initially and word-medially. Word-initial geminates tend to be somewhat longer. have found that \"for stops, in particular, this lengthening affects both closure duration and VOT\", but claim that stops contrast only in aspiration, and not duration. undertook a perceptual study with thirty native speakers of Cypriot Greek, and has found that both closure duration and (the duration and properties of) aspiration provide important cues in distinguishing between the two kinds of stops, but aspiration is slightly more significant.\n\nWord-final assimilates with succeeding consonants—other than stops and affricates—at word boundaries producing post-lexical geminates. Consequently, geminate voiced fricatives, though generally not phonemic, do occur as allophones. Below are some examples of geminates to arise from sandhi.\n\nIn contrast, singleton stops and affricates do not undergo gemination, but become fully voiced when preceded by a nasal, with the nasal becoming homorganic. This process is not restricted to terminal nasals; singleton stops and affricates always become voiced following a nasal.\n\nWord-final is altogether elided before geminate stops and consonant clusters:\n\nLike with , word-final assimilates to following and producing geminates:\n\nLastly, word-final becomes voiced when followed by a voiced consonant belonging to the same phrase:\n\nCypriot Greek has a five-vowel system that is nearly identical to that of Standard Modern Greek (see for an acoustic comparison of the two vowel systems and ).\n\nBack vowels following at the end of an utterance are regularly reduced (50% of all cases presented in study) to \"fricated vowels\" (40% of all cases, cf. Slavic yers), and are sometimes elided altogether (5% of all cases).\n\nIn glide-less analyses, may alternate with or , e.g. \"cage\" → \"cages\", or \"koulouri\" → \"koulouria\"; and, like in Standard Modern Greek, it is pronounced when found between and another vowel that belongs to the same syllable, e.g. \"one\" (f.).\n\nCypriot Greek has \"dynamic\" stress. Both consonants and vowels are longer in stressed than in unstressed syllables, and the effect is stronger word-initially. There is only one stress per word, and it can fall on any of the last four syllables. Stress on the fourth syllable from the end of a word is rare and normally limited to certain verb forms. Because of this possibility, however, when words with antepenultimate stress are followed by an enclitic in Cypriot Greek, no extra stress is added (unlike Standard Modern Greek, where the stress can only fall on one of the last three syllables), e.g. Cypriot Greek , Standard Modern Greek \"my bicycle\".\n\nAn overview of syntactic and morphological differences between Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek can be found in .\nMore loanwords are in everyday use than in Standard Modern Greek. These come from Old French, Italian, Provençal, Turkish and, increasingly, from English. There are also Arabic expressions like \"mashallah\" and \"inshallah\". Much of the Cypriot core vocabulary is different to the modern standard's, e.g. in addition to μιλώ \"I talk\", instead of βλέπω \"I look\", etc. A historically interesting example is the occasional use of Archaic πόθεν instead of από που for the interrogative \"from where?\"\n\n\"Ethnologue\" reports that the lexical similarity between Cypriot Greek and Demotic Greek is in the range of 84–93%.\n\nThere is no established orthography for Cypriot Greek. Efforts have been made to introduce diacritics to the Greek alphabet to represent palato-alveolar consonants found in Cypriot, but not in Standard Modern Greek, e.g. the combining caron , by the authors of the \"Syntychies\" lexicographic database at the University of Cyprus. When diacritics are not used, an epenthetic —often accompanied by the systematic substitution of the preceding consonant letter—may be used to the same effect (as in Polish), e.g. Standard Modern Greek → Cypriot Greek , Standard Modern Greek → Cypriot Greek .\n\nGeminates (and aspirates) are represented by two of the same letter, e.g. \"today\", though this may not be done in cases where the spelling would not coincide with Standard Modern Greek's, e.g. would still be spelt .\n\nIn computer-mediated communication, Cypriot Greek, like Standard Modern Greek, is commonly written in the Latin script, and English spelling conventions may be adopted for shared sounds, e.g. for (and ).\n\nCyprus was cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world from the 7th to the 10th century due to Arab attacks. It was reintegrated in the Byzantine Empire in 962 to be isolated again in 1191 when it fell to the hands of the Crusaders. These periods of isolation led to the development of various linguistic characteristics distinct from Byzantine Greek.\n\nThe oldest surviving written works in Cypriot date back to the Medieval period. Some of these are: the legal code of the Kingdom of Cyprus, the Assizes of Jerusalem; the chronicles of Leontios Machairas and Georgios Voustronios; and a collection of sonnets in the manner of Francesco Petrarca. In the past hundred years, the dialect has been used in poetry (with major poets being Vasilis Michaelides and Dimitris Lipertis). It is also traditionally used in folk songs and (battle poetry, a form of playing the Dozens) and the tradition of (bards).\n\nIn the late seventies, Minister of Education Chrysostomos A. Sofianos upgraded the status of Cypriot by introducing it in education. More recently, it has been used in music, e.g. in reggae by Hadji Mike and in rap by several Cypriot hip hop groups, such as Dimiourgoi Neas Antilipsis (DNA). Locally produced television shows, usually comedies or soap operas, make use of the dialect, e.g. \"Vourate Geitonoi\" ( instead of ) or \"Oi Takkoi\" ( being a uniquely Cypriot name).

{"id": "276930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276930", "title": "Exegesis", "text": "Exegesis\n\nExegesis (; from the Greek from , \"to lead out\") is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, particularly a religious text. Traditionally the term was used primarily for work with the Bible; however, in modern usage \"biblical exegesis\" is used for greater specificity to distinguish it from any other broader critical text explanation.\n\nExegesis includes a wide range of critical disciplines: textual criticism is the investigation into the history and origins of the text, but exegesis may include the study of the historical and cultural backgrounds of the author, text, and original audience. Other analyses include classification of the type of literary genres presented in the text and analysis of grammatical and syntactical features in the text itself.\n\nThe terms exegesis and hermeneutics have been used interchangeably.\n\nOne who practices exegesis is called an \"exegete\" (; from Greek ). The plural of exegesis is \"exegeses\" (). Adjectives are exegetic or exegetical (e.g., exegetical commentaries). In biblical exegesis, the opposite of exegesis (to draw out) is eisegesis (to draw in), in the sense of an eisegetic commentator \"importing\" or \"drawing in\" his or her own purely subjective interpretations into the text, unsupported by the text itself. Eisegesis is often used as a derogatory term.\n\nThe earliest examples, and also one of the largest corpora of text commentaries from the ancient world, come from Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the first millennium BCE. Known from over 860 manuscripts, the majority of which date to the period 700–100 BCE, most of these commentaries explore numerous types of texts, including literary works (such as the Babylonian Epic of Creation), medical treatises, magical texts, ancient dictionaries, and law collections (the Code of Hammurabi). Most of them, however, comment on divination treatises, in particular treatises that predict the future from the appearance and movement of celestial bodies on the one hand (Enūma Anu Enlil), and from the appearance of a sacrificed sheep’s liver on the other (Bārûtu).\n\nAs with the majority of the thousands of texts from the ancient Near East that have survived to the present day, Mesopotamian text commentaries are written on clay tablets in cuneiform script. Text commentaries are written in the East Semitic language of Akkadian, but due to the influence of lexical lists written in Sumerian language on cuneiform scholarship, they often contain Sumerian words or phrases as well.\n\nCuneiform commentaries are important because they provide information about Mesopotamian languages and culture that are not available elsewhere in the cuneiform record. To give but one example, the pronunciation of the cryptically written name of Gilgamesh, the hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh, was discovered in a cuneiform commentary on a medical text. However, the significance of cuneiform commentaries extends beyond the light they shed on specific details of Mesopotamian civilization. They open a window onto what the concerns of the Mesopotamian literate elite were when they read some of the most widely studied texts in the Mesopotamian intellectual tradition, a perspective that is important for “seeing things their way.” Finally, cuneiform commentaries are also the earliest examples of textual interpretation. It has been repeatedly argued that they influenced rabbinical exegesis. See Akkadian Commentaries and Early Hebrew Exegesis\n\nThe publication and interpretation of these texts began in the mid-nineteenth century, with the discovery of the royal Assyrian libraries at Nineveh, from which ca. 454 text commentaries have been recovered. The study of cuneiform commentaries is, however, far from complete. It is the subject of on-going research by the small, international community of scholars who specialize in the field of Assyriology.\n\nA common published form of biblical exegesis is known as a Bible commentary and typically takes the form of a set of books, each of which is devoted to the exposition of one or two books of the Bible. Long books or those that contain much material either for theological or historical-critical speculation, such as Genesis or Psalms, may be split over two or three volumes. Some, such as the Four Gospels, may be multiple- or single-volume, while short books such as the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel, Esther, and Jeremiah (i.e. Book of Susanna, Prayer of Azariah, Bel and the Dragon, Additions to Esther, Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah), or the pastoral or Johannine epistles are often condensed into one volume.\n\nThe form of each book may be identical or allow for variations in methodology between the many authors who collaborate to write a full commentary. Each book's commentary generally consists of a background and introductory section, followed by detailed commentary of the book pericope-by-pericope or verse-by-verse. Before the 20th century, a commentary would be written by a sole author, but today a publishing board will commission a team of scholars to write a commentary, with each volume being divided out among them.\n\nA single commentary will generally attempt to give a coherent and unified view on the Bible as a whole, for example, from a Catholic or Reformed (Calvinist) perspective, or a commentary that focuses on textual criticism or historical criticism from a secular point of view. However, each volume will inevitably lean toward the personal emphasis of its author, and within any commentaries there may be great variety in the depth, accuracy, and critical or theological strength of each volume.\n\nThe main Christian exegetical methods are historical-grammatical, historical criticism, revealed, and rational.\n\nThe historical-grammatical method is a Christian hermeneutical method that strives to discover the Biblical author's original intended meaning in the text. It is the primary method of interpretation for many conservative Protestant exegetes who reject the historical-critical method to various degrees (from the complete rejection of historical criticism of some fundamentalist Protestants to the moderated acceptance of it in the Catholic Church since Pope Pius XII), in contrast to the overwhelming reliance on historical-critical interpretation, often to the exclusion of all other hermeneutics, in liberal Christianity.\n\nHistorical criticism also known as the historical-critical method or higher criticism, is a branch of literary criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand \"the world behind the text\". This is done to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense.\n\nRevealed exegesis considers that the Holy Spirit inspired the authors of the scriptural texts, and so the words of those texts convey a divine revelation. In this view of exegesis, the principle of \"sensus plenior\" applies — that because of its divine authorship, the Bible has a \"fuller meaning\" than its human authors intended or could have foreseen.\n\nRational exegesis bases its operation on the idea that the authors have their own inspiration (in this sense, synonymous with artistic inspiration), so their works are completely and utterly a product of the social environment and human intelligence of their authors.\n\nCatholic centres of biblical exegesis include:\n\nFor more than a century, German universities such as Tübingen have had reputations as centers of exegesis; in the USA, the Divinity Schools of Chicago, Harvard and Yale became famous.\n\nRobert A. Traina's book \"Methodical Bible Study\" is an example of Protestant Christian exegesis.\n\nTraditional Jewish forms of exegesis appear throughout rabbinic literature, which includes the Mishnah, the two Talmuds, and the midrash literature.\n\nJewish exegetes have the title \"mefarshim\" (commentators).\n\nThe Midrash is a homiletic method of exegesis and a compilation of homiletic teachings or commentaries on the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), a biblical exegesis of the Pentateuch and its paragraphs related to the Law or Torah, which also forms an object of analysis. It comprises the legal and ritual Halakha, the collective body of Jewish laws, and exegesis of the written Law; and the non-legalistic Aggadah, a compendium of Rabbinic homilies of the parts of the Pentateuch not connected with Law.\n\nBiblical interpretation by the Tannaim and the Amoraim, which may be best designated as scholarly interpretations of the Midrash, was a product of natural growth and of great freedom in the treatment of the words of the Bible. However, it proved an obstacle to further development when, endowed with the authority of a sacred tradition in the Talmud and in the Midrash (collections edited subsequently to the Talmud), it became the sole source for the interpretation of the Bible among later generations. Traditional literature contains explanations that are in harmony with the wording and the context. It reflects evidence of linguistic sense, judgment, and an insight into the peculiarities and difficulties of the biblical text. But side by side with these elements of a natural and simple Bible exegesis, of value even today, the traditional literature contains an even larger mass of expositions removed from the actual meaning of the text.\n\nIn the halakhic as well as in the haggadic exegesis the expounder endeavored not so much to seek the original meaning of the text as to find authority in some Bible passage for concepts and ideas, rules of conduct and teachings, for which he wished to have a biblical foundation. The talmudical hermeneutics form \"asmachta\" is defined as finding hints for a given law rather than basing on the bible text. To this were added, on the one hand, the belief that the words of the Bible had many meanings, and, on the other, the importance attached to the smallest portion, the slightest peculiarity of the text. Because of this move towards particularities the exegesis of the Midrash strayed further and further away from a natural and common-sense interpretation.\nMidrash exegesis was largely in the nature of homiletics, expounding the Bible not in order to investigate its actual meaning and to understand the documents of the past but to find religious edification, moral instruction, and sustenance for the thoughts and feelings of the present. The contrast between explanation of the literal sense and the Midrash, that did not follow the words, was recognized by the Tannaim and the Amoraim, although their idea of the literal meaning of a biblical passage may not be allowed by more modern standards. The above-mentioned tanna, Ishmael b. Elisha said, rejecting an exposition of Eliezer b. Hyrcanus: \"Truly, you say to Scripture, 'Be silent while I am expounding!'\" (Sifra on Lev. xiii. 49).\nTannaitic exegesis distinguishes principally between the actual deduction of a thesis from a Bible passage as a means of proving a point, and the use of such a passage as a mere mnemonic device – a distinction that was also made in a different form later in the Babylonian schools. The Babylonian Amoraim were the first to use the expression \"Peshaṭ\" (\"simple\" or face value method) to designate the primary sense, contrasting it with the \"Drash,\" the Midrashic exegesis. These two terms were later on destined to become important features in the history of Jewish Bible exegesis. In Babylonia was formulated the important principle that the Midrashic exegesis could not annul the primary sense. This principle subsequently became the watchword of commonsense Bible exegesis. How little it was known or recognized may be seen from the admission of Kahana, a Babylonian amora of the fourth century, that while at 18 years of age he had already learned the whole Mishnah, he had only heard of that principle a great many years later (Shab 63a). Kahana's admission is characteristic of the centuries following the final redaction of the Talmud. The primary meaning is no longer considered, but it becomes more and more the fashion to interpret the text according to the meaning given to it in traditional literature. The ability and even the desire for original investigation of the text succumbed to the overwhelming authority of the Midrash. It was, therefore, providential that, just at the time when the Midrash was paramount, the close study of the text of the Bible, at least in one direction, was pursued with rare energy and perseverance by the Masorites, who set themselves to preserving and transmitting the pronunciation and correct reading of the text. By introducing punctuation (vowel-points and accents) into the biblical text, in the seventh century, they supplied that protecting hedge which, according to Rabbi Akiva's saying, the Masorah was to be for the words of the Bible. Punctuation, on the one hand, protected the tradition from being forgotten, and, on the other, was the precursor of an independent Bible science to be developed in a later age.\n\nThe Mikra, the fundamental part of the national science, was the subject of the primary instruction. It was also divided into the three historic groups of the books of the Bible: the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa, called in traditional Hebrew attribution the Torah (the Law or Teaching), the Nevi'im (the Prophets) and the Kethuvim (the Writings) respectively. The intelligent reading and comprehension of the text, arrived at by a correct division of the sentences and words, formed the course of instruction in the Bible. The scribes were also required to know the Targum, the Aramaic translation of the text. The Targum made possible an immediate comprehension of the text, but was continuously influenced by the exegesis taught in the schools. The synagogues were preeminently the centers for instruction in the Bible and its exegesis. The reading of the biblical text, which was combined with that of the Targum, served to widen the knowledge of the scholars learned in the first division of the national science. The scribes found the material for their discourses, which formed a part of the synagogue service, in the second division of the several branches of the tradition. The Haggadah, the third of these branches, was the source material for the sermon.\n\nJewish exegesis did not finish with the redaction of the Talmud, but continued during ancient times, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance; it remains a subject of study today. Jews have centres for exegetic studies around the world, in each community: they consider exegesis an important tool for the understanding of the Scriptures.\n\nThe Mimamsa school of Indian philosophy, also known as (\"prior\" inquiry, also ), in contrast to (\"posterior\" inquiry, also ), is strongly concerned with textual exegesis, and consequently gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language. Its notion of shabda \"speech\" as indivisible unity of sound and meaning (signifier and signified) is due to Bhartrhari (7th century).\n\nTafsir (, \"tafsīr\", \"interpretation\") is the Arabic word for exegesis or commentary, usually of the Qur'an. An author of tafsīr is a \"mufassir\" (, \"mufassir\", plural: , \"mufassirūn\").\n\nTafsir does not include esoteric or mystical interpretations, which are covered by the related word \"Ta'wil\". Shi'ite organization Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project cites the Islamic prophet Muhammad as stating that the Qur'an has an inner meaning, and that this inner meaning conceals an even deeper inner meaning, in support of this view. Adherents of people for Sufism and Ilm al-Kalam pioneered this thought.\n\nZoroastrian exegesis consists basically of the interpretation of the Avesta. However, the closest equivalent Iranian concept, zand, generally includes Pahlavi texts which were believed to derive from commentaries upon Avestan scripture, but whose extant form contains no Avestan passages. Zoroastrian exegesis differs from similar phenomena in many other religions in that it developed as part of a religious tradition which made little or no use of writing until well into the Sasanian era. This lengthy period of oral transmission has clearly helped to give the Middle Persian Zand its characteristic shape and has, in a sense, limited its scope. Although the later tradition makes a formal distinction between “Gathic” (gāhānīg), “legal” (dādīg), and perhaps “ritual” (hādag-mānsrīg) Avestan texts, there appear to be no significant differences in approach between the Pahlavi commentary on the Gathas and those on dādīg texts, such as the \"Vendīdād\", the \"Hērbedestān and the Nērangestān\". Since many 19th and 20th century works by Zoroastrians contain an element of exegesis, while on the other hand no exegetical literature in the strict sense of the word can be said to exist, the phenomenon of modern Zoroastrian exegesis as such will be discussed here, without detailed reference to individual texts.\n\nSeveral universities, including the Sorbonne in Paris, Leiden University, and the \"Université Libre de Bruxelles\" (Free University of Brussels), put exegesis in a secular context, next to exegesis in a religious tradition. Secular exegesis is an element of the study of religion.\n\nAt Australian universities, the exegesis is part of practice-based doctorate projects. It is a scholarly text accompanying a film, literary text, etc. produced by the PhD. candidate.\n\n"}
{"id": "53257961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53257961", "title": "F. L. Woodward", "text": "F. L. Woodward\n\nFrank Lee Woodward (1871–1952) was an English educationist, Pali scholar, author and theosophist. Woodward studied and researched on Theravada Buddhism and wrote numerous work based on them. He is admired among the Pali scholars for compiling the vast concordance of Pali canon by translating eighteen of the forty-two volumes of the Pali texts into English. He also served as the principal of Buddhist school Mahinda College, Galle in Ceylon for 16 years from 1903 to 1919. Woodward lived his latter stage of life in Rowella, Tasmania, mainly spending his time on studies and translation work.\n\nF. L. Woodward was born on 13 April 1871 at Saham Toney in Norfolk, England, as the third son of William Woodward, an Anglican vicar, and his wife Elizabeth Mary Ann. Woodward had an archetypal Victorian boyhood and began to study the languages Latin, Greek, French and German by the age of eight. He joined the traditional English public school Christ's Hospital (the Bluecoat School), London in 1879, where he later won the Latin and French prizes on three occasions. Woodward also did well in athletics at his school and won prizes for many athletic events. He did specially well in Putting the weight, where he held the records for several years. Woodward won a scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge at the age of eighteen and won the distinction as a classical scholar, sportsman and organist there. He was also the captain of the Rugby football team, vice-captain of Boats and was a full-back of the Soccer team of Sydney Sussex College.\n\nHe received B.A. in 1893 and M.A. in 1902 and later turned to teaching and taught in several English public schools which secured him a deputy headmaster-ship. Woodward began his teaching career at Rugby Preparatory School, where he served for a short period as an assistant master. Later he taught for three years at the Royal Grammar School, Worcester until 1897 as classics master. Woodward then joined Stamford School, Lincolnshire, where he served for five years as the second master. During his five-year period at Stamford school he spend a great deal of his time for the study of both Western and Eastern philosophy, Pali and Sanskrit, English literature, and religion. Woodward joined the London Theosophical Society in 1902, and became a friend and follower of Col. Henry Steel Olcott, the co-founder and first President of the Theosophical Society. In 1903 Col.Olcott offered him the principal-ship of Mahinda College, Galle, Ceylon which was then administered by the Buddhist Theosophical Society of Galle, Ceylon. Woodward accepted the principalship of Mahinda College which he nursed for the next 16 years of his life.\n\nF. L. Woodward was the principal of Mahinda College from 1903 to 1919. His work at Mahinda College included taking classes in English, Latin, Pali, Buddhism and Art, in addition to the administrative duties related with the head mastership of the school. With the assistance of Mudaliyar Gunaratne, Muhandiram Thomas Amarasuriya, Muhandiram Wickremasinghe and the charitable Buddhist public of Galle, Woodward relocated Mahinda College from bussy Galle fort to its present site, which is more suited for a school. His involvement went much further as he was the designer and architect of its buildings, personally supervised their construction, and often worked alongside the masons. \nDuring the tenure of Woodward, the school had grown rapidly and became one of the leading colleges in the Southern Sri Lanka. Although he was a strict disciplinarian, his students greatly idolised him.\n\nWhile working in Sri Lanka, he edited the Buddhist, the leading Buddhist magazine of the island at the time, and went to Madras each year for the annual convention of the Theosophical Society Adyar. Woodward advised the director of education in Ceylon often during his work and was actively involved with the movement for establishing a University in Ceylon. Sinhalese language was accepted as a subject for the Cambridge local examinations due to his efforts. He decided to leave Mahinda College in 1919 due to the tropical climate, which was having a bad impact on his health. He migrated to Tasmania to live the remaining part of his life with the intention of translating the Pali Canon into English language.\n\nWoodward settled in Tasmania, and bought a small apple orchard and a cottage from a fellow Theosophist, situated on the Tamar River 40 km from Launceston, from where Ben Lomond, one of the highest peaks in Tasmania, can be seen. In this peaceful setting he resumed his studies on Buddhism and translations for the Pali Text Society, established by Thomas Rhys Davids in 1881. He lived alone, surrounded by Buddhist scriptures on thousands of ola leaves and practiced yoga and meditation. Although he preferred isolation, he developed friendships with his close neighbors and was liked by the local children, who were given sweets by Woodward on his visits to the store. A vegetarian and animal lover, he surprised his neighbours with his fondness for the snakes of the area.\n\nIn his final years, his orchard became neglected and he was reduced to near poverty. Woodward only left his home town two or three times a year, usually to take part in some activity of the local branch of the Theosophical Society. His work \"Some Sayings of the Buddha\", has contributed to a wider understanding of Buddhism in the western world. An erudite Pali scholar and translator, he translated eighteen of the forty-two volumes of the Pali texts into English and compiled the vast concordance of the Pali canon. In 1936, after the publication of 15 volumes of a complete translation of the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta and Anguttara Nikaya, Caroline Rhys Davids admired Woodward greatly for his untiring work for which he never expected any reward. Woodward died on 27 May 1952 at Beaconsfield Hospital, West Tamar, at the age of 81. He was buried in Carr Villa cemetery, Launceston.\n\nThe following are some of the literary works of F. L. Woodward.\n"}
{"id": "557667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557667", "title": "Face (professional wrestling)", "text": "Face (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, a face (babyface) is a heroic or a \"good guy\" wrestler, booked (scripted) by the promotion with the aim of being cheered by fans. Traditionally, they wrestle within the rules and avoid cheating (in contrast to the villains who use illegal moves and call in additional wrestlers to do their work for them) while behaving positively towards the referee and the audience. Such characters are also referred to as \"blue-eyes\" in British wrestling and \"técnicos\" in \"lucha libre\". The face character is portrayed as a hero relative to the heel wrestlers, who are analogous to villains. Not everything a face wrestler does must be heroic: faces need only to be cheered by the audience to be effective characters.\n\nThe vast majority of wrestling storylines involving faces place a face against a heel, although more elaborate set-ups (such as two faces being manipulated by a nefarious outside party into fighting) often happen as well. In the world of \"lucha libre\" wrestling, they are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers and wearing outfits using bright colors with positive associations (such as solid white). This is contrasted with the villainous \"rudos\" that are generally known for being brawlers, using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size while often having outfits akin to demons or other nasty characters.\n\nTraditional faces are classic \"good guy\" characters who rarely break the rules, follow instructions of those in authority such as the referee, are polite and well-mannered towards the fans and often overcome the rule-breaking actions of their heel opponents to cleanly win matches. While many modern faces still fit this model, other versions of the face character are now also common. A good example would be Stone Cold Steve Austin, who despite playing a heel early on in his career would start to be seen more of an antihero because of his popularity with the fans. While clearly not championing rule following, nor submission to authority, Austin was still regarded as the face in many of his duels such as his rivalry with World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) owner Mr. McMahon.\n\nThe portrayal of face wrestlers changed in the 1990s with the birth of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), the start of World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) New World Order (nWo) storyline, and the Attitude Era of the WWF. During this time, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sting used tactics traditionally associated with heels, but remained popular with the fans.\n\nConversely, Kurt Angle was introduced to the then-WWF with an American hero gimmick based on his gold medal win at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Angle presented himself as a role model and stressed the need to work hard to realize one's dreams. Although such a personality appears appropriate for a face wrestler, Angle's character was arrogant and constantly reminded people of his Olympic glory, behaving as if he thought he was better than the fans. Angle's character served as a meta-reference to how wrestling had changed. Although his character was intended to be a heel and behaved accordingly, some commentators speculated that if Angle attempted to get over as a face using a more heroic version of the same character, he would have failed. Unusually, Angle did not use any of these heroic mannerisms when playing a face character, instead acting as somewhat of an antihero with a few elements of the \"lovable loser\" character archetype.\n\nFans sometimes dislike face wrestlers despite the way they are promoted. Some reasons for this include repetitive in-ring antics, a limited moveset, a lengthy title reign, lack of selling their opponents' moves, or an uninteresting character. This often results in wrestlers who are supposed to be cheered receiving a negative or no reaction from the fans.\n\nThe majority of the time, faces who are low-carders, or lesser known, are used as jobbers. These wrestlers usually lose matches against established wrestlers, usually heels that would then lose to the top faces.\n\nSome face wrestlers would often give high fives or give out merchandise to fans while entering the ring before their match, such as T-shirts, sunglasses, hats and masks. Bret Hart was one of the first superstars to make this popular, as he would drape his signature sunglasses on a child in the audience. Rey Mysterio, who has been a face in WWE since his debut, would go to any fan (frequently a child) wearing a replica of his mask and touch their head with his head for good luck before wrestling. Other examples include John Cena throwing his shirts and caps in the crowd before entering a match and Big Show giving his hat to a fan when he was a face. After becoming a face, Alberto Del Rio would give his signature scarf to a fan before entering the ring, and Becky Lynch also gives one of her steam punk goggles to a young fan, and sometimes gives one of them to some of her fans before entering the ring, \n\nSome faces, such as Bret Hart and Ricky Steamboat, promoted an image as a \"family man\" and supported their persona by appearing with their family members before and after matches. Steamboat famously carried his 8 month old son Richard Jr. into the ring with him at WrestleMania IV before his match with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, then handing him to his wife Bonnie before the match started. These actions often relate to wrestlers promoting charity work or other actions outside the ring, blurring the lines between scripted wrestling and their personal lives.\n\n"}
{"id": "232963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232963", "title": "Feature film", "text": "Feature film\n\nA feature film is a film (also called a motion picture or movie) with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole film to fill a program. The notion of how long this should be has varied according to time and place. According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute and the British Film Institute, a feature film runs for at least 40 minutes, while the Screen Actors Guild asserts that a feature's running time is 80 minutes or longer.\n\nMost feature films are between 70 and 210 minutes long. The first narrative feature film was the 60-minute \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906, Australia). The first (proto)-feature-length adaptation was \"Les Misérables\" (1909, U.S.). Other early feature films include \"The Inferno (L'Inferno)\" (1911), \"Defence of Sevastopol\" (1911), \"Quo Vadis?\" (1913), \"Oliver Twist\" (1912), \"Richard III\" (1912), \"From the Manger to the Cross\" (1912) and \"Cleopatra\" (1912).\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute, and the British Film Institute all define a feature as a film with a running time of 2,400 seconds (i.e. 40 minutes) or longer. The Centre National de la Cinématographie in France defines it as a 35 mm film longer than , which is exactly 58 minutes and 29 seconds for sound films, and the Screen Actors Guild gives a minimum running time of at least 80 minutes.<ref name=\"http://www.sagaftra.org/files/sag/Low_Budget_Ageement_1_5.pdf\"></ref>\n\nThe term \"feature film\" came into use to refer to the main film presented in a cinema and the one which was promoted or advertised. The term was used to distinguish the longer film from the short films (referred to as shorts) typically presented before the main film, such as newsreels, serials, animated cartoons, live-action comedies, and documentaries. There was no sudden increase in the running times of films to the present-day definitions of feature-length; the \"featured\" film on a film program in the early 1910s gradually expanded from two to three to four reels.\n\nEarly features had been produced in the United States and France, but were released in individual (short film) scenes. This left exhibitors the option of playing them alone, to view an incomplete combination of some films, or to run them all together as a short film series. The American company S. Lubin released a Passion Play titled Lubin's Passion Play in January 1903 in 31 parts, totaling about 60 minutes. The French company Pathé Frères released a different Passion Play, \"The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ\", in May 1903 in 32 parts running about 44 minutes. There were also full-length records of boxing matches, such as \"The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight\" (1897), \"Reproduction Of The Corbett-Jeffries Fight\" (1899), and \"The Jeffries-Sharkey Fight\" (1899). Some consider the 100-minute \"The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight\" to be the first documentary feature film, but it is more accurately characterized as a sports program as it included the full unedited boxing match.\n\nIn 1900, the documentary film \"In the Army\" was made. It was over 1 hour in length and was about the training techniques of the British soldier.\n\nDefined by length, the first dramatic feature film was the Australian 70-minute film \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906). Similarly, the first European feature was the 90-minute film \"L'Enfant prodigue\" (France, 1907), although that was an unmodified record of a stage play; Europe's first feature adapted directly for the screen, \"Les Misérables\", came from France in 1909. The first Russian feature was \"Defence of Sevastopol\" in 1911. Early Italian features were \"The Inferno (L'Inferno)\" (1911), \"Quo Vadis?\" (1913), \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1913), and \"Cabiria\" (1914). The first UK features were the documentary \"With Our King and Queen Through India\" (1912), filmed in Kinemacolor and \"Oliver Twist\" (1912). The first American features were adaptations of \"Oliver Twist\" (1912), \"From the Manger to the Cross\" (1912), \"Cleopatra\" (1912), and \"Richard III\" (1912). The latter starring actor Frederick Warde starred in some of these movie adaptations. The first Asian feature was Japan's \"The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara\" (1912), the first Indian feature was \"Raja Harishchandra\" (1913), the first South American feature was Brazil's \"O Crime dos Banhados\" (1913), and the first African feature was South Africa's \"Die Voortrekkers\" (1916). 1913 also saw China's first feature film, Zhang Shichuan's \"Nan Fu Nan Qi\".\n\nBy 1915 over 600 feature films were produced annually in the United States. It is often incorrectly cited that \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915) was the first American feature film. The most prolific year of U.S. feature production was 1921, with 682 releases; the lowest number of releases was in 1963, with 213. Between 1922 and 1970, the U.S. and Japan alternated as leaders in the quantity of feature film production. Since 1971, the country with the highest feature output has been India, which produces a thousand films in more than twelve Indian languages each year.\n\nIn 1927, Warner Bros. released the first feature-length film with sound, \"The Jazz Singer\", whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called Vitaphone. The film's success persuaded other studios to go to the considerable expense of adding microphones to their sets, and scramble to start producing their own \"talkies\".\n\nOne of the next major advancements made in movie production was color film. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Early techniques included hand tinting: painting each frame by hand. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a signal color, used in a large number of films in the 1920s. The film processing lab Technicolor developed the Three-Tone coloring technique that became the standard for color film. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try. One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was Disney. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\nDigital Video (or DV) has quickly changed how most films are made. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. In 2002, George Lucas' \"\" became the first major feature-length film to be shot entirely on digital cameras. The ability to instantly play back footage and quickly transfer footage to computers for editing helped to speed up post-production time. Digital film making was given a big boost in 2005 when the Digital Cinema Initiative created a guide for manufacturers to create a universal standard, to make the technologies more compatible with each other and more user friendly. shooting movies on digital also lead to new technologies for distributing films. \"Titan A.E.\", released in 2000, was the first feature film to be released for viewing over the internet. Digital distribution changed the ways people received and watched media. It also gave viewers access to huge amounts of online content on demand.\n"}

{"id": "11391817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11391817", "title": "Guaymí language", "text": "Guaymí language\n\nGuaymí, or Ngäbere, also known as Movere, Chiriquí, and Valiente, is spoken by the indigenous Ngäbe people in Panama and Costa Rica. The people refer to themselves as \"Ngäbe\" (pronounced ) and to their language as \"Ngäbere\" . The Ngäbes are the most populous of Panama’s several indigenous peoples.\nThe language is centered in Panama within the semi-autonomous indigenous reservation known as the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. Beginning in the 1950s, Costa Rica began to receive Ngäbe immigrants, where they are found in several indigenous reservations: Abrojos Montezuma, Conteburica, Coto Brus, Guaymí de Alto Laguna de Osa, and Altos de San Antonio.\n\nNgäbere is part of the Chibchan language family, which is indigenous to an area that extends from eastern Honduras to northern Colombia. Ngäbere is one of two languages classified under a group called Guaymí. The other is a related but mutually unintelligible language called Buglere, spoken by the Buglé people within the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé.\n\nWhile all varieties of Ngäbere are grammatically identical and mutually intelligible, there are phonological and lexical differences that vary from region to region. The people of different regions may use different words for the same concept or pronounce the same word differently. Vowel sounds may change; for example, the word for “to see” that is pronounced /toen/ in some regions may be pronounced /tuen/ in other areas; the word for “you” may be pronounced /mä/ or /ma/ depending on the region. Syllable stress may also vary regionally—for instance, the word for “dove,” \"ütü\", may be pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, or with equal strong accents on both syllables, depending on the speaker’s region. The Penonomeño was somewhat more distinct, but is no longer spoken.\n\nNgäbere is directly referred to as \"dialecto\" (dialect) frequently by both Ngäbes and Latinos. Rolando Rodríguez remarks on this misnomer: “El ngäbere no es una variedad del español o de otra lengua conocida, de manera que por desconocimiento se suele decir dialecto al ngäbere, cuando en realidad es una lengua.” (Ngäbere is not a variety of Spanish or of any other known language. Through ignorance people usually call Ngäbere “dialect,” when in reality it is a language.) \n\n\"Dialecto\" is a word used popularly to refer to languages that are considered inferior. As Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, spoken by more than 500 million people and has an institution that sets the rules of the correct grammar (Real Academia Española), it is considered a real language. On the other hand, Ngäbere is not official in any country, spoken by few people relatively (less than a half million for example) and has no standard grammar, then it is not considered a real language (when linguistically it really is).\n\nAs a traditionally oral language, the Ngäbere writing system has only very recently been created. An alphabet was developed using the Latin script, based on the Spanish alphabet. Given that Spanish is the most widely used language in the Central American region, the alphabet was based on the Spanish alphabet in the attempt to create a closer sense of correlation between the two languages.\n\nSome features of the alphabet are as follows:\n\nStandardization of spelling has been slow to solidify after the creation of a writing system, especially regarding the transcription of vowels. This appears to have been influenced by the different alphabets and pronunciation of the various Spanish and English speaking researchers attempting to create a representation that corresponds to the spelling system in their language. For example, the word \"Ngäbe\" has been recurrently and erroneously spelled “Ngöbe” by many people, Latino and Ngäbe alike, because the phoneme /ä/ is heard and reproduced by Spanish speakers as /o/, and therefore they attempt to write it that way while continuing to acknowledge that it is in fact a different phoneme than the Spanish /o/. Along the same lines, \"Ngäbe\" has been spelled “Ngawbe” by numerous English speakers to reconcile English spelling and the pronunciation. Words that should be written with or in the middle of the word have also been the subject of non-standard spelling, since many write the word as it is pronounced rather than following the spelling rule. For the purposes of this article, all spelling will attempt to follow the standard writing and phonetics system.\n\nThe accent system generally puts the primary accent on the penultimate syllable of words, although there many exceptions. A monosyllabic word always features a primary or strong accent. In a bisyllabic word the accent can fall on either syllable. In words of three or four syllables the primary accent often appears in the first or second syllable; in the rare longer word of three or more syllables, sometimes two primary accents may appear. The tone is slightly higher on the primary accent than on the rest of the word.\n\nNgäbere is largely a monotonous language, with few extreme fluctuations in tone. To listen to a recorded sample of the language, visit Global Recordings Network, where they have recordings of messages and songs created for the purpose of Evangelical missionary work, as well as the English scripts.\n\nThe word order of the Ngäbere sentence generally follows a Subject – Object – Verb pattern, which is a common feature of Chibchan languages.\n\nYoung and Givón describe the sentence features in which Ngäbere differs from typical S–O–V languages:\n\nAdditionally, in the passive voice the word order takes on an S – V – O arrangement, much like in English except that the auxiliary verb is placed after the main verb.\n\nThe auxiliary verbs carry the timed or finite verbal inflections, while the complement verbs carry an untimed or non-finite inflection.\n\nNegative sentences are most commonly formed in the arrangement of S + Negative + (Auxiliary) + (Object) + Verb.\n\nThe negative marker precedes the finite verb.\n\nNgäbere is a split-ergative language. It also displays a number of suffixal tense-aspect-modality markers, as well as suffixal case markers and adposistions. These suffixes are attached to nouns and verbs. When used in the perfect aspect to indicate a nominative case, the suffix \"-kwe\" is used to show agency for transitive subjects. In the imperfect aspect, \"-kwe\" also is used to indicate possession (see \"noun clauses\").\n\nThe marker \"-e\" shows dative joining with verbs that show mental state (and may also be used to show possession):\n\nEach Ngäbere suffix has a variety of meanings. Some of the most frequently used suffixes and their English equivalents are as follows. The suffix \"–be\" expresses “with,” “only,” or an immediate reaction. The suffix \"–btä\" expresses “over,” “to be in,” “going to,” “and,” “also,” and time. The suffix \"–bti\" expresses “over,” above,” “on top of,” “by,” “in,” “through,” “then,” “after,” “plus” (indicates addition or sum), “with” (indicates instrument), and “behind”\n\nNouns may be formed by combining two nouns or a noun with a verb:\n\nNouns may also be derived by placing a suffix at the end of another word:\n\nNgäbere contains many polysemic words, meaning that the same word often has many different meanings. For example, the word \"kä\" denotes name, earth, year, climate, and place, depending on context. Other examples are \"sö\" (moon, month, tobacco), \"kukwe\" (language, word, topic, issue, roast, burn), \"kri\" (tree, large), \"tö\" (mind, intelligence, to want, summer), and \"tare\" (pain, difficulty, love)\n\nThe regular noun phrase consists of the nucleus (head noun or pronoun) followed by the possible addition of a modifier, quantifier, or demonstrative. Articles are not used in Ngäbere.\n\n'Plurality'\n\nAll nouns are countable in Ngäbere. To form a plural noun in reference to humans, \"-tre\" is added:\n\nIn reference to non-human entities, such as animals and other objects, \"-krä\" is added:\n\n'Personal pronouns'\n\n\"Ti\" I\n\n\"Mä\" you\n\n\"Niara\" he, she\n\n\"Nun\" we\n\n\"Mun\" you (plural)\n\n\"Niaratre\" they\n\n'Reflexive pronouns'\n\nReflexivity and reciprocity is marked with \"ja\". \"Ja tikekä\" means “to cut onself.” \"Mete\" means “to hit,” but when \"ja\" is added, \"ja mete\" means “to fight.” \"Ja\" may also indicate possession, as in the case of \"ja gwriete\", “one’s own house.”\n\n'Demonstrative pronouns'\n\n\"Ne\" This (object is close to the speaker)\n\n\"Ye\" That (object is far from the speaker but close to the listener)\n\n\"Se\" That (object is far from both speaker and listener)\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns are modified by the suffix of location \"–te\" and \"–kware\" to create adverbs and prepositions of location:\n\n\"Nete\" Here\n\n\"Yete\" There\n\n\"Sete\" Way over there\n\n\"Negware\" Toward here\n\n\"Segware\" Toward there\n\n'Possessive'\n\nThere are no possessive pronouns. Possession is marked depending on the order of possessor and possessed. The suffix \"–kwe\" is added to nouns or pronouns to show non-inherent possession (such as possession of objects, animals, political relations, etc.) in order of possessed/possessor.\n\n\"Tikwe\" my, mine\n\"Mäkwe\" yours \n\"Niarakwe\" his, her, hers \n\"Nunkwe\" our, ours\n\"Munkwe\" your, yours (plural)\n\n\"Niaratrekwe\" theirs\n\n\"Minchi Mariakwe\" Maria´s cat\n\n\"Mrö monsokwe\" the child´s food\n\n\"Meye mäkwe\" your mother\n\n\"Nukro tikwe\" my dog\n\nNon-inherent possession can also be shown in the possessor/possessed by adding the suffix \"-e\".\n\n\"Ti jue\" my house\n\nPossession is also shown by placing a personal pronoun or noun in front of an inherently possessed object (family members, body parts, etc.).\n\n\"Ti run\" my father\n\n\"Mä eteba\" your brother\n\n\"Samuel okwä\" Samuel’s eye\n\nDouble possession uses both structures:\n\n\"Kä mundiaka etebakwe\" the hunter´s brother´s land\n\n\"Ju ti rünkwe\" my father´s house\n\nNgäbere verbs do not need to agree with their subject — verbs are inflected only for tense, not person. “Ngäbere verbs do not display subject or object agreement. In this way they differ from verbs in related Chibchan languages”. While the verbs are conjugated solely in respect to time, linguistic treatment of time is somewhat more complex in Ngäbere than in English. According to Kopesec, there are two broad categories of time, actual and potential. Actual refers to an action that has happened or has begun to happen, while potential refers to an action that is projected or intended. \nFurthermore, there are two other categories that verbs may be placed in, limited or unlimited. A limited verb is not currently in progress, which implies an end point or completion in the case of actual verbs, or a future beginning point in the case of potential verbs. An unlimited verb is currently in progress during a specific scenario, and the beginning or end point is not implied. \nOne more distinction made by the Ngäbere concept of time is linguistically differentiating between the near past and the remote past, as well as the near future and the remote future. Generally speaking the close or recent past may be considered during the same day as the present time. Farther back in the past should be expressed using the remote past. Verbs are conjugated by taking the root of the verb and adding a suffix. The suffixes for recent and remote past change depending on the root class, but the future suffixes remain the same for all root classes.\n\nFor example, the verb \"mike\" (to put) can be conjugated in the following ways by taking the root \"mika\" and adding suffixes. It may be translated into English by adding an adverbial phrase to express the implied actual or potential time.\n\n\"Limited\"\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye miri sete. \"He put it there (not long ago).\" Action recently completed\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mikaba sete. \"He put it there (a long time ago).\" Action completed long ago\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mikadi sete. \"He will put it there (soon).\" Action to take place shortly.\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mikai sete. \"He will put it there (much later).\" Action to take place in remote future\n\n\"Unlimited\"\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mike sete. \"He puts it there (right now).\" Present action\n\nOR \"He is putting it there (right now).\" Present continuous action\n\nJodron ye mika ta sete kwe. \"It was put there by him.\" Passive voice\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mikadre sete. \"He has to put it there (now).\" Present obligation\n\nNiarakwe jodron ye mikabare sete. \"They say that he put it there.\" External testimony of \nothers\n\nJodron ye mikani sete niarakwe. \"It has been put there by him.\" Completed action that has \ncontinuing effect \n\nVerbs are divided for conjugation rules in categories depending on the ending of the verbs and the nasal quality of the vowels.\n\nAuxiliary verbs are used to describe movement, state, and change of state. For example:\n\nTi nikira jüben. \"I am going (right now) to bathe.\" \n\nTi bi niken. \"I am going.\"\n\nNiara reba blite kuin. \"She can speak well.\" \n\nTi niki ngin den. \"I am going to get firewood.\"\n\nThe total population of those who identified themselves as Ngäbe in the 2010 Panamanian National Census was 260,058. The population of speakers in Costa Rica in the year 2000 was 5,090, with a total ethnic population of 5,360. It must be kept in mind that the number of speakers of Ngäbere is somewhat lower than the ethnic population, given the fact that many younger people today are not learning the language. Oftentimes people of indigenous descent who do not speak the indigenous language do not consider themselves to be “Indians” but rather identify themselves as Latino or campesino. Before the formation of the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé, census figures for Ngäbe population were based on whether or not they spoke the native language.\n\nThe Ngäbe people and language have been historically referred to by Latinos as \"Guaymí\", although in recent years the use of \"Ngäbe\" and \"Ngäbere\" has become prevalent. It is not clear where the name \"Guaymí\" originated, although there has been speculation. One such theory is that the term was derived from the Buglere word \"ngwamigda\", which means “indigenous.” Rolando Rodríguez offers another theory of the origin of the words \"Guaymí\" and \"Bogotá\" in reference to the Ngäbe and Buglé peoples, respectively, that the terms come from both the Ngäbere and Buglere languages:\n\nVagueness and long silences are normal and acceptable in communication. In fact, it is considered impolite if one does not give another enough time to consider his words before speaking.\n\nIt is typical to greet one another or pass the time while working by making a noise known in Spanish as a saloma or grito.\n\nWord play is common, where double and even triple meanings may be implied.\n\nNgäbe proper names typically don't refer to any object, natural or otherwise—for the most part they are just names. Some examples of male names are Oli, Chíton, Chä, Niti, Ima, Nicho, Ulira, and Itikän. Examples of female names are Besikó, Ei, Bei, Bechi, Belikó, Meti, Mesi, and Tu Last names are determined by where a person is from. Traditionally the Ngäbes lived in small hamlets as family units, and the name of this place was their family name. Stemming from the influence of Christian missionaries grouping the people into tighter communities, today it is more common to live in larger communities, though the last name is still determined by the name of the town. \nMost Ngäbes have two names, their Ngäbe name and their Spanish name. The Spanish name is their legal name and is used for all official documentation and during much of everyday life. In recent times, the use of Ngäbe names is often pushed aside, especially in front of outsiders. On the other hand, Ngäbes love to bestow Ngäbe names on trusted outsiders to share their culture and indicate acceptance, and will refer to that person exclusively by his or her Ngäbe name. \nNgäbe communities also have two names, one in Spanish and one in Ngäbere, which often correspond with each other, but not always. For example, \"Cerro Otoe\" (Otoe Mountain) and \"Tätobta\" (Beside Otoe Peak), \"Llano Ñopo\" (Spaniard Plain) and \"Suliakwatabti\" (On top of Spaniard Plain/Flesh). Many other communities have place names that are either untranslatable proper nouns or names whose translations have been lost. Examples include \"Kinkinbta\" (\"Peña Blanca\" or \"White Cliff\" in Spanish), Kaninbta (\"Hato Pilón\" or \"Rice Mortar Ranch\"), and Ünbti (\"Hato Chamí\" or \"Chamí Ranch\").\n\nKinship terms are quite broad and often can be applied to many types of relationships, depending on where the person falls in the kinship network. P.D. Young wrote an ethnography in the 1960s which offers, among other things, an in-depth analysis of the complexity of kinship relations. Kinship terms often depend on the sex of the speaker. For example, the words for “brother” and “sister” are determined by the sex of both siblings. \"Eteba\" is a sibling of the same sex, and \"ngwae\" is a sibling of the opposite sex. Therefore, if the speaker is male, his brother would be \"eteba\" and his sister \"ngwae\"; if the speaker is female, her brother would be \"ngwae\" and her sister \"eteba\". However, both these terms could also be applied to what in English would be known as “cousin” or “second cousin.” There are also vocative and non-vocative kinship terms, depending on whether one is speaking directly to the relative or simply referring to them. Traditionally a man was not supposed to speak directly to his \"u\", or father-in-law, and \"me\", mother-in-law, although he was bound in service to them in return for marrying their daughter. Therefore, in this case there are no vocative terms because the \"duana\", “son-in-law,” was not supposed to directly address them.\n\nThe following list of phrases is likely to be useful for a visitor to the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé. Oftentimes locals will greet foreigners in Ngäbere to test them. They are very impressed and culturally validated by simple exchanges with foreigners in Ngäbere. \n\"Ñantörö\" Hello\n\n\"Köbö kuin dekä (dere, deu)\" Good morning (afternoon, evening)\n\n\"Dre kukwe (“dre gwe”)\" What’s up?\n\n\"Basakukwe.\" Visiting.\n\n\"Mä kä ño?\" What is your name?\n\n\"Ti kä …\" My name is …\n\n\"Mä niki medente?\" Where are you going?\n\n\"Ti niki sete.\" I´m going over there.\n\n\"Ti ta basare.\" I am visiting.\n\n\"Mä medente?\" Where are you from?\n\n\"Ti Estados Unidosbu.\" I am from the United States.\n\n\"Jän\" Yes\n\n\"Ñakare\" No\n\n\"Mä tua ño?\" How are you?\n\n\"Ti ta kuin\" I am fine.\n\n\"Ja tuaita\" See you.\n\n\"Ngöbö rika mäbe\" May God go with you.\n\n\nSpanish is the language of education and government, and is the \"lingua franca\" for contact with outsiders. Ngäbere has borrowed many words from Spanish, and to a lesser extent from English. The sounds of the loan words are often nasalized, voiced, or de-voiced, in order to conform to Ngäbere phonology. K. Bletzer Bletzer argues that\n\nSince most Ngäbere words end in vowel sounds, foreign words ending in consonants are often stripped of their final consonants or adorned with a final vowel. Internal consonants are also softened. (ex. Jesus → \"Jesu\", \"arroz\" “rice” → \"aro\", \"carro\" “car” → \"caro\", \"cruz\" “cross” → \"kruso\"). Many of the loan words are household objects or technologies that were brought in by outsiders (ex. \"celular\" “cell phone,” \"mesa\" “table”). In addition to using loan words, bilingual Ngäbes conversing with each other often code switch between Spanish and Ngäbere within the same conversation or even the same sentence.\n\nThe Ngäbere alphabet was designed taking into consideration the differences between Spanish and Ngäbere, and the need to reconcile these differences. Costa Rican linguist Barbara Lininger notes a tension between the two languages with “la presencia del español como lengua de cultura predominante, o al menos coexistente en la región. Dicho factor causa un conflicto debido a las grandes diferencias que existen entre los dos idiomas” (the presence of Spanish as the language of predominant culture, or at least coexistent in the region. Said factor causes a conflict due to the great differences that exist between the two languages)\nThe Ngäbe people´s feelings about the Latinos can be seen in how they initially called their invaders: \"Sulia\", which is a kind of small cockroach. The Spanish language is therefore called \"Suliare\", which means to speak like a cockroach. By the same token, Ngäbes have long been the recipient of sustained racism from the Latinos. The language use and education of Ngäbere in the home has been heavily diminished by cause of several factors, including the socialization to be embarrassed of Ngäbe language and culture because of racism and low self-esteem. The use of the word \"dialecto\", which often used to label the language, is considered demeaning:\n\nLanguage loss has also occurred because of the very education that has helped a select few Ngäbes move ahead in a Spanish-speaking world. Rodriguez points out:\n\nOften parents want their children to speak Spanish in order to have more success in life. Even when Ngäbere is still spoken in the home it is not uncommon for children to answer their parents’ Ngäbere questions in Spanish. Spanish is spoken almost exclusively at school, and even on the playground. The result is that many in the younger generations are not learning the language, and those who have not learned it can’t pass it on to their children. Although the language is not in immediate danger of extinction, there is a chance that in the future if this trend continues it could be in danger.\n\nDue to growing concern about the future of the language and culture, there has been a recent resurgence in cultural pride, even a reclamation of sorts of a position of power: “En término general los Ngäbes se sienten orgullosos de su cultura y de su idioma. [Ahora] se sienten más cómodos de hablar y practicar los elementos de las costumbres y tradiciones, como los bailes, y decir sus nombres en Ngäbere sin pena.” (In general terms the Ngäbes feel proud of their culture and language. They [now] feel more comfortable speaking and practicing the elements of their customs and traditions, such as the dances, and say their names in Ngäbere without shame.”\n\nUntil recent decades, it was nearly unheard of for a Ngäbe to receive an education past primary school. Although there are definitely more educational opportunities now than in the past, there is still much wanting in the education of Ngäbe children. According to the Minority Rights Group International, only 18% of children ages 15–19 in the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé receive schooling beyond sixth grade, compared to the national average of 65%.\n\nAlthough education through ninth grade is free and compulsory, it is difficult for many Ngäbe children to attend school. Many live in remote areas too far away to attend school, and some walk up to three hours and back every day to attend classes. Many families do not have enough money to buy uniforms or notebooks for their children. Although the government offers welfare programs such as \"La Red de Oportunidades\" (Network of Opportunities) which gives women with children $50 a month that is supposed to help out with education expenses, oftentimes those resources are spent before they are even received. Even if children are able to attend school they usually receive a subpar education, since the least experienced(and sometimes most disgruntled) teachers often get sent to work in difficult access schools. If a small percentage of Ngäbes graduate from high school, a minuscule amount (less than 1%) is able to receive a higher education.\n\nDue to these factors, the majority of those who are technically literate are still very poorly educated, and are often looked down upon by other Panamanians in part because of their poor Spanish skills and lack of education. The elderly and women are more likely to be illiterate, and many old women do not even speak Spanish at all. As such, these people are less likely to know how and through which channels to petition aid from the government or become self-sufficient workers within the Panamanian economy. Even more seriously, “Due to inadequate education and poor Spanish language skills members of this group are often unaware of their rights and fail to employ legal channels when threatened” by outside coercions from mining and power companies, and the like.\n\nAccording to the Panamanian National Institute of Statistics and Census, the percentage of illiteracy in the Comarca Ngäbe Buglé fell from 45.9% in 2000 to 30.8% in 2010; although a significant improvement, it is still much a much higher rate than in the rest of Panama, with women having a higher illiteracy rate than men. These numbers refer only to Spanish literacy. Most Ngäbes are illiterate in Ngäbere, since it is traditionally an oral language. Learning to read Ngäbere is not a priority to most Ngäbes, since there is a more urgent need for literacy in Spanish. As well, there is still the ever-present cultural stigma attached to the language that may be affecting the impetus of Ngäbere as a written language. Rodríguez) observes that “la gente en general está enfocando su interés otra vez en el idioma pero no tiene habilidad para leer su propio idioma y al hacerlo les da pena.” (The people in general are again focusing their interest in the language, but they don’t have the ability to read their own language and they are embarrassed doing it).\n\nComarca law stipulates that there must be a bilingual Spanish/Ngäbere education. However, in practice there has been virtually no application of this policy. There are a few prototype bilingual programs in existence in primary schools. There was also a new university established in 2010, La Universidad de las Américas (UDELAS), located in Chichica, which is dedicated to providing a degree in intercultural bilingual education. In 2012 UDELAS will have its first graduating class, and it is hoped that, according to Professor Julia Mora, it will produce a notable change in the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé by training teachers who will rescue the Ngäbere language. There is another Comarca institution located in Soloy, La Universidad Ngäbe-Buglé, which is “preparando personal bilingüe de la comarca para la comarca” (preparing bilingual personnel from the Comarca for the Comarca). It is hoped that more Ngäbes will be trained as teachers who will show greater dedication to the preservation of Ngäbe culture and language by working within the Comarca.\n\nResearch of Ngäbere has been sporadic throughout the past 200 years. Among the first efforts to study the language was a basic lexicon written in the beginning of the 19th century by Padre Blas José Franco. His work was the base of a lexicon written by A. L. Pinart, who visited the Cricamola River region in 1893. His findings were then used as the base of some language studies by other linguists but very little of the information was thoroughly reliable or extensive.\n\nEphraim S. Alphonse was a Methodist missionary who lived among the Ngäbe for 21 years and became fluent in their language. In 1956 his \"Guaymí Grammar and Dictionary\" was published. While far more substantial than anything previously published, it still had problems. José Murillo notes that, “Aunque los ejemplos de este autor son numerosos, carecen, en general, de transmorfologización, lo cual hace al trabajo poco útil.” (Although the examples of this author are numerous, they lack, in general, in transmorphologization, which makes them of little use to work with” Alphonse was not a trained linguist, so while his effort was well-intentioned and his long history with the people was insightful, it remained for the next generation of linguists to offer a more detailed and correct description of Ngäbere grammar.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s more attention was focused on studying the phonetic and grammatical structures, during which time a definite alphabet and writing system was developed. Kopesec offers a more comprehensive description of the grammar. Payne also gave insights on the function of the subject in Ngäbere. Murillo has recently expanded on the works of Kopesec and Payne in regards to the grammar and formation of words and sentences.)\nLininger comments on the difficulties regarding the research itself due to the linguistic pre-perceptions of the researchers:\n\nSpanish speakers find the Ngäbere nasalized vowels quite difficult to distinguish and reproduce due to the nature of Spanish vowels. It has also been observed by English speakers that “/b/, /m/, /n/, and /l/ are notoriously difficult to distinguish in Guaymí speech” (Young 1990). Oftentimes spelling has been inconsistent within the body of published research.\n\nStudies in the past have sometimes been conducted in a manner which could lead to inconclusive results for the language as a whole (i.e. using only one informant as the language source in the study), as in the studies of Lininger and Payne in studying the Ngäbere of Costa Rican speakers.\n\nAs has been the case over the past 200 years, there is a scarcity of current published research, especially on cultural language use. There are some published colloquial works, educational manuals, and religious translations, although few in number. These include stories from the oral tradition; a translation of the New Testament, \"Kukwe Kuin Ngöbökwe\" and a hymnal, \"Ari Kare Ngöböye.\"\n\n"}

He was one of the founders of progressive romanticism movement in the contemporary Azerbaijani literature. He was exiled during the Stalin purges in the USSR.\n\nHuseyn Abdulla oglu Rasizadeh was born in 1882 to a family of a theologian in Nakhchivan in the Erivan Governorate. After completing his elementary education at a religious school in 1898, Javid pursued his mid-school education in the Maktab-i Tarbiya of Mashadi Taghi Sidgi. In 1899–1903, Huseyn Javid studied in the Talibiyya Madrasah in Tabriz. After obtaining a degree in literature at the Istanbul University in 1909, Javid worked as a teacher in Nakhchivan, Ganja and Tiflis, and starting from 1915 in Baku.\nHuseyn Javid's first book of lyrical poems titled \"Kechmish gunlar\" (\"The Past Days\") was published in 1913. However Javid was known more as a playwright. His philosophical and epic tragedies, and family dramas introduce a new line of development in Azerbaijani literature. In his literary tragedy \"Sheikh Sanan\" (1914), Huseyn Javid philosophized about the idea of a universal religion to lift inter-religious barrier between humans. His most famous creation, \"Iblis\" (The Devil) written in 1918, exposed all oppressive forces as the supporters of \"humans are wolves to each other\" philosophy and \"the 20th century cultural savages\", and summarized them in the character of Satan. In his works, Javid criticized any form of colonialism and oppression.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Huseyn Javid authored a number of historical epics, such as \"Peyghambar\" (\"The Prophet\") in 1922, \"Topal Teymur\" (\"Timur\") in 1925, \"Sayavush\" (\"Siyâvash\") in 1933 and \"Khayyam\" (\"Khayyám\") in 1935.\n\nHuseyn Javid wrote during the time of Collectivization and Stalin purges in the Soviet Azerbaijan. In the worst times of totalitarianism, he refused to serve as propagandist of \"revolutionary socialist achievements\". Javid was arrested in 1937 on trumped-up charges of being a \"founding member of a counter-revolutionary group that was plotting an overthrow of the Soviet power\".\n\nHis arrest was a part of the nationwide campaign of purge against intelligentsia. The Soviet government exiled Huseyn Javid to the Far East to the city of Magadan, Siberia in the late 1930s. He died on 5 December 1941 in the village of Shevchenko (Tayshetsky District). Huseyn Javid was officially exonerated in 1956. His repatriation came only on Javid's 100th birthday in 1982, when his remains were moved from Shevchenko back to his homeland of Nakhchivan and reburied in a mausoleum built in Javid's honor.\nMonument to Javid was built in King's Park in Podgorica in 2013.\n\nMushkunaz Molla Huseyn (wife) was born in 1902 in Nakhchivan. She passed away in 1976. His son was Artogrul Javid (1919) was born in Baku. He studied at Azerbaijan Pedagogical University (1940). In 1941-1942, he studied at Azerbaijan Conservatorium. Uzeyir Hajibeyov was his teacher. Artogrul devoted his first work – “9 Lariasiya” to his teacher. He died in 1943. Artogrul’s grave is situated next to his parents in Nakhchivan.\n\nIn 1981, Azerbaijan Communist Party decided the establishment of memorial museums of Huseyn Javid in Baku and Nakhchivan for the “100 years anniversary of Huseyn Javid”. This initiation was realized in 1995 by the order of Heydar Aliyev. The area of the home museum in Baku is 245 m2. In exposition of the home museum of Huseyn Javid, there are more than 600 exhibits which includes his and his family’s personal belonging, his publications and works, photos etc.\n\nHome museum of Huseyn Javid was opened in 1984 in Alixan street where Javid was born. There are about 6000 exhibits. Besides preserving personal belongings and writings of Huseyn Javid, the museum researches his works.\n\nThe mausoleum was established in 1996, for the 114 years anniversary of Huseyn Javid. It was built on his grave. The architect of the mausoleum is honored architect Rasim Aliyev. Heydar Aliyev participated in the opening ceremony of the mausoleum.\n\n\n"}

Although, audibly, quite distinct from the spoken Tamil dialects of Tamil Nadu, it nevertheless shares the same standard written Tamil as in Tamil Nadu. If anything one could argue that the formal/ written Tamil is somewhat based on the Jaffna Tamil dialect as it was formulated and pioneered by the Jaffna Hindu Pundit Arumuga Navalar. He was much celebrated as the father of modern Tamil prose.\n\nThis dialect is largely distinct from other South Indian dialects and to a lesser extent from that of the Eastern, Western and Upcountry dialects of Sri Lanka.\n\nJaffna Tamil and South Indian language of Malayalam have certain common linguistic [sic] that are not found in South Indian Tamil.In fact it is an often occurrence that a person from Jaffna be mistaken for a Malayali in Tamil Nadu. Both preserve certain archaic words which have gone out of vogue in South Indian Tamil. Consequently many consider the Jaffna dialect to be a purer form of Tamil. \n\nA subdialect retained by the Paraiyar people of Kayts still retains a number of archaic words and Prakrit loans not found in any other dialects of Tamil.

{"id": "7849529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7849529", "title": "Klingon alphabets", "text": "Klingon alphabets\n\nKlingon alphabets are fictional alphabets used in the \"Star Trek\" movies and television shows to write the Klingon language.\n\nIn Marc Okrand's \"The Klingon Dictionary\" this alphabet is named as \"codice_1\", but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in Star Trek productions they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to simulate real writing and to create an appropriate atmosphere.\n\nThe Astra Image Corporation designed the symbols (currently used to \"write\" Klingon) for \"\", although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to Michael Okuda. They based the letters on the Klingon battlecruiser hull markings (three letters) first created by Matt Jeffries, and on Tibetan writing because the script had sharp letter forms—used as an allusion to the Klingons' love for bladed weapons.\n\nThe KLI version of the pIqaD alphabet was created by an anonymous source at Paramount, who based the alphabet on letters seen in the show. This source sent in the alphabet to the Klingon Language Institute, and the KLI uploaded it onto its Web site. The vast majority of \"Klingonists\", however, still prefer the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe alphabet itself is quite simple: It contains twenty-six letters with a one-to-one \"grapheme-phoneme correspondence\": that is, one letter represents one sound and one sound is written with one letter. The set also includes ten numerals. It is written from left to right, top to bottom like English. There is no actual punctuation; however, those that use punctuation with the alphabet, use Skybox punctuation symbols (\"see below\").\n\nThe KLI pIqaD script is registered in the ConScript registry in the Private Use Area of Unicode.\n\nBing translate translates between many languages and Klingon, including the KLI pIqaD script. Bing currently uses a private use script code of \"Qaak\" for pIqaD instead of the official ISO 15924 script code \"Piqd\".\n\nGoogle provides a Klingon language search interface.\n\nIn September 1997, Michael Everson made a proposal for encoding KLI pIqaD in Unicode based on the Linux kernel source code (specifically \"Documentation/unicode.txt\" by H. Peter Anvin). The Unicode Technical Committee rejected the Klingon proposal in May 2001 on the grounds that research showed almost no use of the script for communication, and the vast majority of the people who did use Klingon employed the Latin alphabet by preference. A modified version of the Linux kernel allocation for pIqaD in the Private Use Area of Unicode was added to the ConScript Unicode Registry (U+F8D0 to U+F8FF) by Michael Everson. Since then several fonts using that encoding have appeared, and software for typing in pIqaD has become available. Existing text in Romanization can easily be converted to pIqaD also. Bing translator can translate between pIqaD and Latin forms.\n\nIf a ConScript-compliant font is installed, the following PUA text should display:\n\nThe following is a pangram: \n\nUntil the Klingon Language Institute promoted a standardized alphabet for Klingon there were previous variations used primarily for decorative effect. These variants were never adopted by the Klingon speaking community and aren't used in modern Klingon.\n\nThe KLI adapted version of pIqaD utilizes the character set originally assembled by author Thomas E. Scheuer in his publication \"Mortas-te-Kaase - the Death's Hand Battle Fleet\" fan organization group operations manual (compiled, written, illustrated and published by author Thomas E. Scheuer from 1989–1994) which the author and founder of the KLI later became a member of, and learned of the MTK character assemblage and membership booklet designations, isn't the only mapping of Klingon letters. The \"Astra Image\" letters as released in the \"Mortas-te-Kaase\" were taken and used in the Paramount-endorsed Bitstream font pack. They were used to make a font with ten letters of the English alphabet: \"e\" to \"n\" being represented by the ten different klingon letters. This font itself has been used by the Star Trek production team when creating Klingon graphics; however it is still used only as random gibberish on the shows. Dr. Schoen would often refer inquiries to Thomas Scheuer as he was still a student of the Klingon language at the time. The Mortas-te-Kaase organisation was also in very close contact with linguist Marc Okrand, who was also an active member of MTK and would often release exclusive additional words and phrases through the regular publications of the organisation via their newsletter \"veS QonoS\". Scheuer was never credited however, in any of Dr. Schoen's works or publications, and thus following commercial usage was not credited properly either. A copy of the original release as photocopied from MTK member manual is displayed at the right. (See also the MTK 1990 Klin-Kon flier utilizing the MTK pIqaD)\n\nThe trading card company Skybox used this font when they created the Klingon language cards in their \"\" trading card collection . The Klingon cards themselves detail aspects of Klingon culture and feature pIqaD text and a transliteration and translation provided by Marc Okrand. Some of these cards, notably S7, S8, and S9, feature pIqaD, which corresponds to the Latin transcription.\nOther known cards include S19 and S20 (which contain belittling references to \"Blockbuster\", probably an allusion to Blockbuster Video) the season seven card selection \"s37, s38 and s39\" (which featured no actual tlhIngan Hol, but only English and on card S39 Latin, written in the Skybox alphabet), and finally, the Checklist cards for each season's set of cards had the word \"cards\" written in Klingon on them when listing the above-mentioned cards.\n\nThe script is written in horizontal lines running from left to right, top to bottom, just like English. Klingon can be written with spaces between words (a word being defined as any noun, verb or leftover, plus any prefixes and suffixes attached to it) and punctuation. When this is the case, two punctuation marks are used:\n\nThe triangular punctuation marks have been accepted into the common usage of the KLI pIqaD (see above).\n\nKlingon can also be written with no spaces or punctuation at all; this form is more common on the TV shows. As in English, Klingon text can be left-justified, center-justified, or right-justified, and written in vertical columns on banners.\n\nDue to its nature, the \"Skybox\" Alphabet is ill-suited to writing Klingon, in that ambiguity in the alphabet is apparent, so different words are spelled the same way; these are homographs. The heartiest commendations and the gravest insults could be written identically; however, context would go a long way to disambiguating homographs.\n\nA third script, known as the Klinzhai or Mandel script, was included in \"The U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's Manual\" (1980). It holds more closely to the D7 battlecruiser hull markings and is also loosely based upon the conceptual art of Matt Jeffries, set designer.\n\nIts letters map to various letters and digraphs of English, but they have no relation to Marc Okrand's Klingon language. Like the other two alphabets, it is probably written in the same direction as English.\n\nSome fans have suggested this alphabet could be used to write Klingonaase in its native form.\n\nIn 1989, a fan by the name of David Christensen of Seattle, Wa., developed the first computer text font based on the Mandel script, prior to there being font software, meaning the font was built entirely in ResEdit.\n\nA pIqaD r () using the Code2000 font was used in the upper right corner of the from 2003 until 2010. It was replaced with the Ethiopic syllable wə (ው) in the of the logo.\n\n\n"}

It is therefore to be clearly distinguished from the Holy See, which already was in existence for many centuries before that date.\n\nThe Vatican Constitution has established no official language. However, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the \"Legge sulle fonti del diritto\" (\"Law on the sources of law\") of 7 June 1929, it promulgates its laws and regulations by publishing them in the Italian-language \"Supplemento per le leggi e disposizioni dello Stato della Città del Vaticano\" attached to the \"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\". On its official website Vatican City uses English, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Latin, Portuguese, and Arabic, which are found on the official website of the Holy See.\n\nMany languages are used within the state. For instance, recruits to the Pontifical Swiss Guard take their oath in the language of the canton to which they belong: German, French or Italian. And the Holy See's semi-official newspaper, \"L'Osservatore Romano\" is published in Italian, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. A Malayalam edition was added in July 2008.\n\nThe Holy See itself mainly uses Latin for its most important official documents, which are published in the \"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\".\n\nSince the state came into existence only in 1929, most of the buildings situated within it predated it by centuries: inscriptions can be found in them mainly in Latin, but also in Italian, Greek, French and German.\n\nWhat became Vatican City was from 1870 to 1929 part of the Kingdom of Italy, whose official language also was Italian, and before 1870 it was part of the Papal States, in which standard Italian (based on Tuscan) and various Italian dialects, such as Emiliano-Romagnolo, were spoken, but which for the first centuries of its existence used Latin for all official purposes. Earlier still, it was part of the Roman Empire. In the earliest historical records the term \"Vatican\" was used to refer to a marshy area, larger than the Vatican City State, on the right bank of the Tiber River, between the Milvio Bridge and the present Sixtus Bridge. During the monarchy and the republican age, the area was known as \"Ager Vaticanus\". From the 2nd century A.D., the toponym \"Vaticanum\" was applied to an area corresponding roughly to the present Vatican City State.\n\n"}

{"id": "44356448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44356448", "title": "Malay language in the Philippines", "text": "Malay language in the Philippines\n\nMalay is spoken by a minority of Filipinos, particularly in the Sulu Archipelago and parts of Mindanao, mostly in the form of trade and creole languages. Historically, Malay was spoken as a \"lingua franca\" prior to the Spanish colonization of the Philippines and Malay was the language spoken by the aristocracy. Ferdinand Magellan used a Malay servant Enrique of Malacca to converse with the Visayans. This variant is known as Old Malay.\n\nEven in non-Malay speaking communities, mostly in the Muslim communities, titles of nobility such as \"datu\" or \"rajah\" (which themselves originate from Sanskrit) are retained.\n\nThe other predominant, and the proper dialect of Malay spoken in the Philippines is Indonesian, which is spoken by Indonesians who have either settled or do business in the Philippines. It is also learned as a foreign language, by students and members of the armed forces.\n\nThe use of Malay was a result of extensive interactions between the native kingdoms in the Philippines and the various ancient Malay civilizations that existed in modern-day Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia as it was the trade language of the entire Maritime Southeast Asian region. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, the earliest-known document found in the Philippines was written in a mix of Old Malay, Classical Tagalog and Old Javanese and in the Kawi alphabet which recorded interactions between the classical civilizations in Luzon with the Javanese kingdom of Majapahit and the Malay Srivijaya Empire.\n\nThe Old Malay spoken in the archipelago also reflected the religious nature of the region - the archipelago was inhabited by a mix of Buddhist, Animists and Hindus. Upon the arrival of Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan in Cebu, his slave, Enrique, a Malaccan-native had to speak on his behalf since he was a native-Malay speaker who acted as a translator between Spanish, Portuguese and Malay. Enrique likely perished in Mactan Island during the battle that killed Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. The name of \"Visayas\" itself originated from \"Srivijaya\", an ancient Malay empire that ruled Sumatra and parts of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThe use of Malay reached the height of its speak with the introduction of Islam by Malay Muslims, Arab, Chinese Muslim and Indian Muslim preachers to the islands. However, this was in the form of Classical Malay, a dialect which originated from the Riau-Malacca region. Along with that, Arabic was also introduced as well as the introduction of the Jawi script, an Arabic-based alphabet for Malay. The dynasties of the Islamic sultanates in Mindanao were themselves of ethnic Malay descent with sprinkles of Arab ancestry such as those of the Sultanate of Maguindanao.\n\nWith progress of Spanish conquest in the 1500s, the use of Malay among the Philippine natives quickly deteriorated and diminished as it was replaced by Spanish. It became non-existent among the Christian Filipinos. Malay remained much confined to the Muslim population of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, who actively resisted Spanish rule and attempts by missionaries to convert them to Christianity.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, with the deterioration of Spanish rule, a Pan-Malayan movement began in the Philippines, spearheaded by national hero José Rizal, who had a vision of \"uniting the Malayan race\" from the bondage of separation by colonial powers. He had actually tried learning the Malay language, having believed it to be an original of Tagalog.\n\nPoliticians in the Philippines had actually contemplated on renaming the country to \"Malaysia\", before the actual federation was named so. Some maps had also referred to the area now comprising Philippines, Indonesia and East Malaysia as \"Malaysia\" as a whole.\n\nMalay is related to the native languages of the Philippines, being Austronesian languages. Many words in the Tagalog and various Visayan languages are derived from Old Malay.\n\nAlthough the history of Malay influence in Philippine history is a subject of conversation, no attempts have been made to ever promote Malay or even Spanish. The number of Malay-speakers in the Philippines are unknown, as a result of the 300-year Spanish rule most of them are very confined to the southern parts of Mindanao (specifically in the Zamboanga Peninsula) and the Sulu Archipelago in a region known as Bangsamoro. This region, derives from the Malay word \"bangsa\" and the Spanish \"moro\", the Muslim peoples of the Philippines refer to themselves Moro which comes from a Spanish word meaning \"moor\". These people more-less do not consider themselves \"Filipino\".\n\nThe treatment of the Muslim peoples of Mindanao by the Christian-dominated government in the Philippines during the 1970s also worsened any hopes of Malay ever being revived into nationwide use again. Today Filipino and English are the official languages of the Philippines.\n\nThere are also misconceptions in the Philippines between Ethnic Malays and Malay race. While it is true that certain Filipino ethnic groups (namely the Visayans and Maguindanao) contain Malay ancestors; the ethnic Malays themselves are focused around Malay peninsular, eastern Sumatra, coastal Borneo and southern Thailand. The Malay race compasses a larger class of Austronesian ethnic groups in the entire Malay Archipelago. This results in false labels to pre-occupation rulers such as Lapu-Lapu, the famous native chief who killed Magellan as a Malay and a Muslim although he was ethnically Visayan who spoke old Cebuano and whose religious background is obscure.\n\nThe Indonesian language, which is the official dialect of Malay spoken in the Philippines' southern neighbor Indonesia, has a notable presence of speakers in Davao City since the city is home to the Indonesian School which caters to expatriates in Mindanao and aims to protect Indonesian language and culture among the expatriate community. Indonesian is also taught as a foreign language in the University of the Philippines.\n\nSince 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Due to increasing demand among students, the Embassy will open an intermediate Indonesian language course later in the year. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., USA also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.\n\nIn an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malaysian, which are related to Filipino and other regional languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied. Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia is also spoken as a third or fourth language by native Filipinos of the Maguindanao and Tausug tribes, especially those who have studied in Malaysia, Indonesia as religious students, migrant laborers or long time residents in Sabah, Malaysia. It should also be noted that the dissemination of the Malay language was also through the usage of Malay books in the study of Islam.\n\n"}

An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.\n\nThe phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, \"You never read about a plane that did not crash\".\n\nThe phrase was coined by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to \"New York Sun\" editor John B.

{"id": "1928724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928724", "title": "Mental plane", "text": "Mental plane\n\nThe mental plane, or world of thought, in Hermeticism, Theosophical, Rosicrucian, Aurobindonian, and New Age thought refers to the macrocosmic or universal plane or reality that is made up purely of thought or mindstuff. In contrast to Western secular modernist and post-modern thought, in occult and esoteric cosmology, thoughts and consciousness are not just a byproduct of brain functioning, but have their own objective and universal reality quite independent of the physical. This reality itself constitutes only one gradation in a whole series of planes of existence (the total number of planes varies, although seven is a common number in Theosophical formulations). In most such cosmologies and explanations of reality, the mental plane is located between, and hence is intermediate between, the astral plane below and the higher spiritual realms of existence above.\n\nIn India in the seventh century b.c.e., the Taittiriya Upanishad referred to five levels of self, of which the middle one is the \"self made of mind\" (\"manas\"). Although the text is describing the nature of the individual rather than the cosmos as a whole, it established the concept of mind as only one of a series of ontological layers of being. The Taittiriyan concept of the five selves would represent an important element of Vedantic ontology, for example the five koshas of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nMeanwhile in Greece, and coming from a philosophical-mystical rather than a yogic perspective, Plato spoke of archetypal forms or ideas as the original spiritual prototypes behind the physical world. These ideas were not equivalent to mind or thought as such. But they did eventually help inspire Middle Platonic (including Philo's) and Neoplatonic metaphysics in which the ideas exist in the mind of God or the Demiurge, or (according to Plotinus and hence Neoplatonism) the Divine Mind or \"Nous\". In the metaphysics of Proclus, the Nous is only one level of hypostasis, with higher ones like Life, Being, and Unity above it.\n\nThe esoteric conception of the mental plane had to wait till the occult revival of the late 19th century, with the development of modern Theosophical, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic ideas that were to serve as the foundation for the current New Age movement.\n\nH. P. Blavatsky taught a cosmology and ontology consisting of seven principles and seven planes. In her writings she aimed at showing how different spiritual systems share a common source, and therefore refers to Vedantic, Buddhist, Samkhyan, Tantric, Neoplatonic, Ancient Egyptian, Kabbalistic, and Occult systems. She relates the mind with the principle of \"Manas\", and also talks about a kosmic Manasic plane. However, the latter represents a very sublime level of consciousness which can be experienced only by enlightened beings.\n\nIn \"The Kabbalah Unveiled\", MacGregor Mathers divides the sephirot (apart from the lowest, \"Malkhut\", representing the physical world) of the Tree of Life into three triads: the Intellectual, Moral, and Astral triads. The Intellectual triad could be compared to the Neoplatonic ideas (Intellect = \"Nous\") and this here represents the highest subdivision.\n\nAround the turn of the twentieth century, Max and Alma Théon were producing \"The Tradition\". This involved a Lurianic Kabbalistic-inspired cosmology in which the ineffable Godhead emanates a number of sublime worlds, the lowest of which is made up of seven or eight \"States\". The third or fourth lowest State is the Mental or Intellectual, which again corresponds to a very high, spiritual level of consciousness.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, immediately beyond the higher regions of the desire world — which exhibit the marked peculiarity of blending form and sound — and before entering the world of thought (mental plane), there is the \"Great Silence\", where all the world seems to disappear and the spirit has the feeling of floating in an ocean of intense light: all is one eternal now. The world of thought is, according to this author, divided into two regions: the \"Region of Concrete Thought\" (inferior) related to the mind and the \"Region of Abstract Thought\" (superior) related to the third (lower) aspect of the threefold Ego, the \"Human Spirit\" aspect.\n\nHis writings, called \"Western Wisdom Teachings\", describe that the Memory of Nature may be read, in an entirely different manner covering the essence of a whole life, in the highest subdivision of the \"Region of Concrete Thought\" of the \"World of Thought\".\n\nA discipline prevalent in the West is mathematics. The field was strengthened by Pythagoreanism and Philosophy (Platonism, Neoplatonism), which were, alongside ancient Egyptian philosophy, among the oldest non-mythical wisdom paradigms. Math once meant \"magic\" and is still important within occultism, especially topics farther beyond the earthly. Any mathematician who considers the mental plane's dimensionality equal to or more than the earthly one defines them as \"hyperplanes.\" Classical Theosophists (other precursors of Heindel) may not have defined those dimensions, but several neo-Theosophists call the mind 5-dimensional, (i.e. in Einstein-Minkowski spacetime) Platonic terms such as nous or Nous (human or divine mind), synonymous (in contexts) with logistikon/logos or Protologos/Logos-Alogos, and Aristotelean (empiricist, including much/all constructivism) acceptance/use of the terms differ. They may reject that Logos Alogos causes Protologos or Logoi cause/are Nous, or that such or infinite dimensions enumerated in abstract philosophical logic have any use in semi-abstract/-concrete mathematical logic. However, contemporary philosophers are considering dimensions of M-theory physics.\n\nThe influence of C.W. Leadbeater's work on the New Age movement has been underrated. One of Leadbeater's achievements was to make Blavatsky's difficult cosmology simpler and more understandable; for example by equating each of the seven principles or vehicles of consciousness with a corresponding cosmic plane. So there is a physical body that is the vehicle of consciousness on the dense matter of the physical plane; an etheric body, which is formed by the etheric matter found on subtler counterpart of the physical plane; an astral body that corresponds to the astral plane; a mental body which belongs to the lower mental plane, and a causal body, or vehicle of the individual soul, which is located at the level of the higher mental or Causal plane.\n\nThus, for Leadbeater and subsequent theosophists, ex-theosophists (e.g. Alice Bailey) and occultists, the mental plane is a distinct reality or zone of being, more subtle and refined than the Astral, but denser and coarser than the Causal. A detailed account of The Mental Plane and the Mental Body and their associated phenomena, as described by Leadbeater and his co-worker Annie Besant (who succeeded Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society), can be found in Arthur E. Powell's \"The Mental Body\".\n\nSri Aurobindo developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Theon's ideas (which he received via The Mother, who was Théon's student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the Physical, Vital, and Mental), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (\"Life Divine\" bk. 1 ch. 27). The Aurobindonian Mind or mental plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the overmental divine region (\"Letters on Yoga\", Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of pure mind or pure thought.\n\n\n"}

He was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha (the Upper House in the Indian government) until 1966. He was instrumental in making Hindi an official language in the Indian Constitution, while tolerating the other major Indian languages. He devoted his later life to helping spread Hindi in South India.\n\nMoturi was born in Dondapadu village in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India. After his primary education, he studied English, Telugu, and Hindi at the National College in Machilipatnam, achieving a high proficiency in them. He joined the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha as a volunteer and gradually became the Secretary and Principal Secretary of that organisation. A major mission in his life would be to efficiently promote the growth of Hindi in South India between 1936 and 1961. He married Shrimati Suryakanta Devi and had three sons and four daughters with her.\n\nMoturi participated in Quit India Movement in 1942 and was jailed. \nDuring this time, Moturi was an active promoter of the Hindi language. He was the Editor of \"Hindi Pracharak\" (1926–36), \"Hindi Prachar Samachar\" (1938–61) and Dakshina Bharat (1947–61). He organised many Institutions all over India such as \"Dakshina Bharata Hindi Prachara Sabha\" of Madras (1926–61). He was the Founding Secretary of \"Telugu Basha Samithi\" of Madras and Hyderabad.\n\nAfter India became independent from Britain, Moturi was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India from 1948–50. He served as a Member of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution for its Language Section. He was a key figure in the divisive debates on: what to make the official language of India (Hindi, English, or a number of local languages such as Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, etc.); how to set up a pluralistic civil service examination system; and how to balance local languages with national languages at different levels of government. He advocated for drafting of the Constitution in Indian languages first.\n\nAfter Indian Independence, from 1950–52, Moturi was a member of the Provisional Parliament of India as an MP. After the Indian Constitution was drafted, Moturi was nominated by the President of India as a Rajya Sabha (Upper House) member. He served twice between 1954 and 1966 (3 April 1954 to 2 April 1960 and 3 April 1960 to 2 April 1966). He was also a member of: the Madras Legislative Council (1952–54); the Central Advisory Board of Education of the Govt. of India; the Madras University Senate (1952–53); the Central Official Languages Commission (1954–56).\n\nMoturi had many scholarly interests. He was the Chief Editor of Encyclopedia on Social Sciences in Hindi published by the Hindi Vikas Samithi, Madras. He was the founding secretary of the Telugu Bhasha Samiti. He also founded the Hindi Vikas Samiti and published 'Vishwa Vignana Samhita.' Finally, Moturi was an editor for a comprehensive encyclopaedia published in his native language of Telugu.\n\nLater in his life, Moturi won many awards. He was a recipient of the Padma Shri award in 1954 and the Padma Bhushan award in 1962, both from the Government of India. Andhra University honoured him with its Kala Prapoorna award in 1977.\n\nMoturi lived to the age of 93. When a family member asked the nonagenarian Moturi about the secret of his longevity, his brief response was: \"Listen more, eat less.\"\n\nAs an activist for Indian Independence, a framer of the Indian Constitution, and a Parliamentarian, Moturi was a key figure in India's political history. However, some people criticise his decision to support Hindi, and not English, as the official language of India. The awkward provisions in the Indian Constitution and a later push by pro-Hindi hardliners led to \"language riots\" in the 1960s in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, where more than 60 people died. Several students immolated themselves protesting the forced use of Hindi as the national language. While English has become the de facto national language of India by 2010, the Indian Constitution has continued to serve as the fundamental basis of the India's polity and society and its drafting was a major accomplishment.\n\n"}

He later converted to Buddhism and got the name \"Nagarjun\". His mother died when he was only three, and his father being a vagabond himself, couldn't support him so young Vaidya Nath thrived on the support of his relatives, and the scholarships he won on the account of him being an exceptional student. Soon he became proficient in Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit languages, which he first learnt locally and later at Varanasi and Calcutta, where he was also semi-employed, while pursuing his studies. Meanwhile he married Aparajita Devi and the couple had six children.\n\nHe started his literary career with Maithili poems by the pen-name of Yatri (यात्री) in the early 1930s. By the mid 1930s, he started writing poetry in Hindi. His first permanent job of a full-time teacher, took him to Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh), though he didn't stay there for long as his urge to delve deeper into Buddhist scriptures, took him to the Buddhist monastery at Kelaniya, Sri Lanka, where in 1935, he became a Buddhist monk, entered the monastery and studied the scriptures, just as his mentor, Rahul Sankrityayan had done earlier, and hence took upon the name \"Nagarjun\". While at the monastery, he also studied Leninism and Marxism ideologies, before returning to India in 1938 to join 'Summer School of Politics' organised by noted peasant leader, Sahajanand Saraswati, founder of Kisan Sabha. A wanderer by nature, Nagarjun spent a considerable amount of his time in the 1930s and the 1940s travelling across India.\n\nHe also participated in many mass-awakening movements before and after independence. Between 1939 and 1942, He was jailed by the British courts for leading a farmer's agitation in Bihar. For a long time after independence he was involved with journalism.\n\nHe played an active role in Jayaprakash Narayan's movement prior to the Emergency period (1975–1977), and therefore was jailed for eleven months, during the emergency period. He was strongly influenced by Leninist-Marxist ideology. This was one of the reasons that he never found patronage from the mainstream political establishments.\n\nHe died in 1998 at the age of 87 in Darbhanga.\n\nThe subjects of his poetry are varied. Effects of both his wandering tendencies and activism, is evident in his middle and later works. His famous poems like \"Bādal kō Ghiratē Dēkhā hai\" (), is a travelogue in its own right. He often wrote on contemporary social and political issues. His famous poem \"Mantra Kavita\" (मंत्र कविता), is widely considered the most accurate reflection of a whole generation's mindset in India. Another such poem is \"Āō Rānī Hum Ḍhōēṅgē Pālakī\" (), which sarcastically humiliates the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, for the extravagant welcome thrown by him for Queen Elizabeth.\n\nBesides these accepted subjects of poetry, Nagarjun found poetic beauty in unconventional subjects. One of his most astonishing works is a poem based on a saw called \"With Sharp Teeth\" (). Another such creation is a series of poems on a full-grown jackfruit.\n\nBecause of the breadth of his poetry, Nagarjun is considered the only Hindi poet after Tulsidas to have an audience ranging from the rural sections of society to the elite. He effectively freed poetry from the bounds of elitism.\n\nMaithili was his mother tongue and he authored many poems, essays and novels in Maithili. He was educated in Sanskrit, Pali, and Hindi. Hindi remained the language of the bulk of his literature. The Hindi of his works varies from highly sanskritized to vernacular forms. He was a poet of the masses, and preferred to write in the language of immediate local impact. Therefore he never adhered to specific bounds of languages.\n\nHe also had good grasp of the Bengali language and used to write for Bengali newspapers. He was close to the Bengali Hungry generation or \"Bhookhi Peerhi\" poets and helped Kanchan Kumari in translating Malay Roy Choudhury's long poem \"JAKHAM\" and Chana Jor Garam in Hindi\n\nNagarjun was given the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1969 for his historic book \"Patarheen Nagna Gachh\", and the 'Bharat Bharati Award' by the Uttar Pradesh government for his literary contributions in 1983. He was also honoured by the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, India's highest literary award for lifetime achievement, in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition, there are socio-political movements and political groups formed by LGBT people who are linked to political parties.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 1.00% of the total population in UK is homosexual and so, 480,000 people consider themselves gay or lesbian.\n\nPolitical parties in Britain now aim at the pink vote bank and leave no stone unturned to persuade the homosexual community to vote in their favour.\n\nThe significance of pink vote has increased considerably with the changing times. Charles Kennedy of The Liberal Democrats pitched for the \"pink vote\" and even promised a package of ways to boost homosexual rights. Even the PM and the Conservative leader took measures to win the UK's three million pink voters.\n\nAccording to the research report by Gallup, Americans interviewed estimated the gay population to be around one in every fifth person in the US which would account for almost 20% of the overall population, while actual numbers are estimated to be 10% or less. This percentage does play a big role in the elections and political parties try every way to attract these pink voters. LGBT Democrats (linked to the Democratic Party) and Log Cabin Republicans (linked to the Republican Party) are two of the largest American political groups advocated to LGBT rights issues in politics.\n\nWith the visible impact of the pink vote in Britain, Canada’s political scenario also caught up with the pink vote politics.

Leonardo da Vinci was the most prominent practitioner of sfumato, based on his research in optics and human vision, and his experimentation with the camera obscura. He used it in many works, including the \"Virgin of the Rocks\" and in his famous painting of the \"Mona Lisa\". He described sfumato as \"without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke or beyond the focus plane\".\n\nAccording to the theory of the art historian Marcia B. Hall, which has gained considerable acceptance, \"sfumato\" is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian High Renaissance painters, along with \"cangiante\", chiaroscuro and \"unione\".\n\nThe word \"sfumato\" comes from the Italian language and is derived from \"fumo\" (\"smoke\", \"fume\"). \"Sfumato\" translated into English means \"soft, vague or blurred\". In Italian the word is often used as an adjective (like \"biondo sfumato\" for \"pale blonde\" hair) or as a verb (\"l'affare è sfumato\" would mean \"the deal has gone up in smoke\"). The use of the term (unlike some others) dates back to the period.\n\nThe technique is a fine shading meant to produce a soft transition between colours and tones, in order to achieve a more believable image. It is most often used by making subtle gradations that do not include lines or borders, from areas of light to areas of dark. The technique was used not only to give an elusive and illusionistic rendering of the human face but also to create rich atmospheric effects. Leonardo da Vinci described the technique as blending colours, without the use of lines or borders \"in the manner of smoke\".\n\nBesides Leonardo and his followers the Leonardeschi, who often used it heavily, other prominent practitioners of sfumato included Correggio, Raphael and Giorgione. Raphael's \"Madonna of the Meadow\" is a famous example, particularly around Mary's face. The Leonardeschi include Bernardino Luini and Funisi.\n\n"}

It is typically created as a preprocessing step to support NLP tasks such as text condensation\nterm disambiguation\n(topic-based) text summarization, relation extraction and textual entailment.\n\nThe semantics of what a text graph's nodes and edges represent can vary widely. Nodes for example can simply connect to tokenized words, or to domain-specific terms, or to entities mentioned in the text. The edges, on the other hand, can be between these text-based tokens or they can also link to a knowledge base.\n\nThe TextGraphs Workshop series is a series of regular academic workshops intended to encourage the synergy between the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and graph theory. The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications that focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and semantic role labelling, got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections.\n\nThe 11th edition of the workshop (TextGraphs-11) will be collocated with the Annual Meeting of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017) in Vancouver, BC, Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

Valuations are also called truth assignments.\n\nIn propositional logic, there are no quantifiers, and formulas are built from propositional variables using logical connectives. In this context, a valuation begins with an assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable. This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas.\n\nIn first-order logic, a language consists of a collection of constant symbols, a collection of function symbols, and a collection of relation symbols. Formulas are built out of atomic formulas using logical connectives and quantifiers. A structure consists of a set (domain of discourse) that determines the range of the quantifiers, along with interpretations of the constant, function, and relation symbols in the language. Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all sentences (formulas with no free variables) in the language.\n\nIf formula_1 is a valuation, that is, a mapping from the atoms to the set formula_2, then the double-bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation; that is, formula_3 for a proposition formula_4.\n\n\n"}

Often several phonemes correspond to a single viseme, as several phonemes look the same on the face when produced, such as , (viseme: /k/), (viseme: /ch/), (viseme: /t/), and (viseme: /p/). Thus words such as \"pet, bell,\" and \"men\" are difficult for lip-readers to distinguish, as all look like /pet/. However, there may be differences in timing and duration during actual speech in terms of the visual 'signature' of a given gesture that can not be captured with a single photograph. Conversely, some sounds which are hard to distinguish acoustically are clearly distinguished by the face (Chen 2001). For example, acoustically speaking English and can be quite similar (especially in clusters, such as 'grass' vs. 'glass'), yet visual information can show a clear contrast. This is demonstrated by the more frequent mishearing of words on the telephone than in person. Some linguists have argued that speech is best understood as bimodal (aural and visual), and comprehension can be compromised if one of these two domains is absent (McGurk and MacDonald 1976). \n\nVisemes can often be humorous, as in the phrase \"elephant juice,\" which when lip-read appears identical to \"I love you.\"\n\nApplications for the study of visemes include speech processing, speech recognition, and computer facial animation.\n\n\n"}
