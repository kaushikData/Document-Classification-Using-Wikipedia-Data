Krishna Rao (Arakalagudu Narasingarao Krishna Rao; 9 May 1908 – 8 July 1971), popularly known as Anakru, was an Indian writer. He is one of the best-known writers in the Kannada language and was popularly known as \"Kadambari Sarvabhouma\" (\"lit\", \"King of Novels\"). The inception of the \"Pragatishila\" (\"progressive\") movement in Kannada literature is credited to him. He received an honorary doctorate from the Mysore University and the Karnataka state Sahitya Akademi award.\n\nAnakru was born on 9 May 1908 in Kolar town in the state of Karnataka, India to Narasinga Rao (father) and Annapoornamma (mother). The family traces its roots to Arkalgud town in the Hassan district of Karnataka. At the start of his career, he edited literary Kannada magazines such \"Katha Manjari\" and \"Vishva Vani\". He was also an editor of the Kannada Sahitya Parishath's publication \"Kannada Nudi\" (\"Kannada speech\"). Anakru was nominated as the president of 42nd Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held in Manipal. He is known for his passion for his native language Kannada. Once when introducing Anakru to an audience, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, one of Kannada's most well-known writers said \"I am a Tamil Kannadiga, Sir Mirza Ismail is a Muslim Kannadiga, and Anakru is a pure Kannadiga\". This tribute from the likes of Masti mirrors the Kannada fervour Anakru was known for.\n\nAnakru fought for the unification of Kannada speaking regions, when Kannada speakers were spread across different provinces in British India. He started a movement to promote and popularize Kannada. He openly criticized people in authority who neglected Kannada. In one such case, he wrote an article in the \"Kannada Nudi\"', criticizing the Hindi oriented policies of R. R. Divakar (the first governor of Bihar), the President of Kannada Sahitya Sammelana in 1929. On being asked to apologize, Anakru resigned from the post of the editor. Anakru lived most of his life in his house (called \"Annapoorna\") in Vishveshpuram, a suburb in South Bangalore. He died on 8 July 1971 at the age of 63.\n\nStarting with his first novel, \"Jeevanayathre\" (\"Journey of life\"), Anakru wrote for about 40 years and authored more than a hundred novels. He was a prolific writer and his literary output exceeded eighty thousand pages. When he started writing, the \"Navodaya\" form of Kannada literature was in vogue. He rejected this form because he felt such writings were a creation of aesthetes and did not reflect the disturbing realities of life. He came up with themes that formed a new movement in itself, called \"Pragatishila\" (\"progressive\"). Anakru saw literature as an instrument of social change. Influenced by Anakru, other promising writers such as Ta Ra Su (T.R. Subba Rao), Basavaraj Kattimani and Anupama Niranjana wrote novels that belonged to the \"Pragatishila\" genre.\n\nNot known to follow the beaten track, Anakru penned three novels, \"Nagna Sathya\", \"Shani Santaana\" and \"Sanje Gaththalu\", with themes dwelling on the topic of prostitution for which he was criticized for depicting vulgarity in these novels. To defend his theme, Anakru wrote in his work \"Sahitya mattu kama prachodane\" (\"Literature and the propagation of lust\"): \"If telling the truth is vulgar, then I am a vulgar writer. If the act of covering with a cloth, a downtrodden helpless naked woman on the street is vulgar, then I am a vulgar writer\". His non-moralistic approach to writing and extensive usage of dialogue contributed to vast readership.\n\nHis magnum opus novel Natasarvabhowma runs for 750 pages, delves into the dire state of Kannada drama world, during the early 20th century. He provides the details about what was ailing the Kannada drama companies and provides valuable suggestions on their improvement. The novel covers the life of fictitious stage actor Rajacharaya, his struggle to establish as an actor and then to run the drama company as its proprietor. This novel was first published in 1940 and was way ahead of its time. The novel was criticized for celebrating the extramarital affairs of Rajacharya. However out of 750 pages hardly 3-4 pages covers this and the rest wonderfully depicts the do good nature of Rajachraya, where he donates majority of his earnings to charity. Krishna Raos love for the Kannada culture, its people and his quest to see the Kannada speaking areas integrated comes out clearly. He severely criticizes the language bigotry and tries to convey that all languages are great through Rajacharya.\n\nAnakru wrote many novels where the protagonist was an artist. These novels follow a plot which narrates the story of a gifted musician who becomes famous, only to succumb to the charms of a woman. This leads to his subsequent failure as his commitment on the art deteriorates. At the end, the artist either overcomes this to regain his touch or succumbs completely to passion leading to his eventual failure. One of Anakru's most popular novels \"Sandhyaraaga\" belonged to this theme and narrates of the life of a dedicated musician while contrasting him with his mean brother. a Kannada movie based on this novel in 1966 received critical acclaim. Other notable novels written by Anakru with on theme are the \"Mia Malhar\", \"Udayaraga\", \"Sahitya Ratna\" and \"Vijayanagara Samrajya (11 novels)\"\n\n\nNovel\n\nPlay\n\n\nCriticism\n\nBiography\n\nAutobiography\n\n\nChildren's books\n\nReligion & Other\n\n\nShort Story\n\n\n"}

Most material in these biographies that was not plagiarized was (as was discovered too late for many subsequent scholars) fabricated.\n\nIn 1876 he was briefly arrested following an accusation of libel.\n\nBuell's own statements about his life and ancestry are not to be trusted. From his claims to have ancestors who were personally acquainted with the subjects of his biographies, down to the simple thanks he gave to the Library of Congress (which, according to the visitors' log, he never entered) he told the stories his audience wanted to hear.\n\nHe was born in 1847, and raised in New York City, he is known to have enlisted in Company L of the 20th New York Cavalry, on August 21, 1863. He was promoted to corporal three months later, but demoted again the following April, and he left the service in July 1865. He later claimed to have risen to the rank of colonel. For some years he lived in New York State, but his literary career began some time after he had moved to Philadelphia, to work for the major shipbuilding and engineering firm of William Cramp & Sons.\n\nIn his Civil War memoir, \"The Cannoneer\", published in 1890, he vividly described his experiences at the Battle of Gettysburg, but that battle took place in July 1863, seven weeks before he enlisted, and two essays by Silas Felton reveal much of the hollow truth behind Buell's claims. He later claimed that a visit to St. Petersburg in Russia on behalf of Cramp's, a few years later, enabled him to find important material for his first biographical project, the life of John Paul Jones. The major demolition job on that work we owe to the far superior scholarship of Admiral Samuel Eliot Morison, who devoted an appendix to Buell's lies about Jones in his own Pulitzer-winning biography. The work of scholars like Morison, which should never have been necessary, reveals the full depth of Buell's fraud. Had he simply introduced false stories without citing any source document, there would have been less of a problem, but he went one step further, and invented entire letters and journals, from which he published extracts in the book.\n\nHe died in 1904, and is buried at the Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\nMilton Hamilton, editor of the papers of colonial administrator Sir William Johnson, had to do the same sort of research as Morison to uncover the truth behind Buell's 1903 production. Two further biographies, of William Penn and Andrew Jackson, were published in the months following Buell's death, by which time suspicions of his work were already growing rapidly. His last posthumous work may be his most truthful, the memoirs of his boss, Charles H. Cramp. About the same time as this was published, Mrs. Reginald de Koven produced the first detailed analysis of the fraudulent Buell technique, specifically his John Paul Jones biography.\n\nDespite the suspicions, in 1905 a superb quotation from John Paul Jones was copied from Buell's biography for \"Reef Points\", the handbook of the Brigade of Midshipmen. It was pretty much all Buell's invention, based only loosely on genuine Jones material, as was his explanation of the context of Jones's famous quotation \"I have not yet begun to fight\", but in both cases the lie achieved immortality because it was superior to the truth (and although Jones's reputation as \"Father of the U.S. Navy\" is largely based on Buell's fabrications, that does not mean it is entirely undeserved). The list of later biographies that innocently quoted Buell's invented primary source documents would make a substantial Wikipedia article by itself.\n\nBuell's diary for 1867-68 still survives, in the Davidson Library, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\n"}

He was a very hard working person from his childhood and grew up having a dream in his eyes to do something for his state and the people of Odisha. During his time there was no connectivity of road to his village, and due to lack of funds, he was unable to cross the river by boat so he would swim across the river to go to school. But there was an incident which changed his life. When Birendra was 13 years old, his Father died due to some health issue. His mother was his prime inspiration. After that Birendra stayed in his maternal uncle's house to complete his schooling. But after his father's death he couldn't concentrate on studies and left home. He went to Kashi, Brindavan and Mathura in order to become a monk. In Mathura he came across a Monk whose advice changed his mind and gave new focus towards life. He came back and completed his matriculation from Indupur High School. He had completed his bachelors and Masters after that. He had seen a dream to serve the poor people of Odisha which motivated him to join the Government of Odisha service in the field of administration.\n\nHe started writing from 1951 and had shown his excellence in the field of Odia Literature in just 40 years i.e. till 1991.He was noted primarily as a major writer in Oriya, for his understanding of rural and ethnic myths and situations, especially on village life of Odisha, original imagery, humanistic outlook, his command over Oriya diction and idiom. His main area of focus was children's literature. He had written many popular Odia songs out of which in 1965 \"Eka K eKa\", \"Joutuka Deiparibini\", Jataka Padichhi Raja Jataka\",\"Kalasha Upare Amba Dalia Gori Kanyaku Bara Kalia\"which were sung by many famous singers of Odisha like Akshaya Mohanty, Bhikari Bal, and Mohammed Sikander Alam.Many of his compositions had already been broadcast from Akashvani Cuttack.\n\nHe had written many books and had won several state and national awards for his work.He was also a lyricist in All India Radio, Cuttack..His book \"Lakhmi Nandan\" for neo literates was awarded with the 27th National Award by Human Resource Development Department of Government of India.For his contributions towards Odia Children Literature, he was awarded Mina Bazar Award by Prajatantra Prachar Samiti founded by Dr.Harekrushna Mahatab.\nApart from literature world he also had proven himself as a strict Administrative Officer. His first posting was in Talcher where he worked in Adult Education department of Govt.Of India. He also had worked in different places e.g. Raruan, Narasighpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Nilagiri, Kamakhya Nagar, Dhenkanal, Tureikela, Talcher, Korei, Suanpatna, Kendujhar and Kotagada. He had done many significant jobs for the people of Odisha during his tenure in various parts of Odisha he was posted. He couldn't complete his service and died just before his retirement from service on 19-June-1991 at the age of 57 years.\n\nHe was married to Shubhashini Bhuyan in 1956. He has two sons, Subhendra and Satyendra and three daughters, Jayasri, Gitisri and Padmasri. His Aunt Sushila Devi popularly known as Singha Jhia Sushila (Daughter of Leo) was a freedom fighter during the Indian independence movement and was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n"}
{"id": "19558103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19558103", "title": "Canopy (grape)", "text": "Canopy (grape)\n\nIn viticulture, the canopy of a grapevine includes the parts of the vine visible aboveground - the trunk, cordon, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. The canopy plays a key role in light energy capture via photosynthesis, water use as regulated by transpiration, and microclimate of ripening grapes. Canopy management is an important aspect of viticulture due to its effect on grape yields, quality, vigor, and the prevention of grape diseases. Various viticulture problems, such as uneven grape ripening, sunburn, and frost damage, can be addressed by skillful canopy management. In addition to pruning and leaf trim, the canopy is often trained on trellis systems to guide its growth and assist in access for ongoing management and harvest.\n\nThe vine is the main part of the grapevine, extending from the root system in the ground up to the cordons, or arms, of the vine. When the grape is young the trunk is very pliable and must be supported by stakes as part of a vine training system. The height of the trunk varies depending on grape variety and the type of trellis system being used and can range from 4 inches (10 cm) to 30 feet (10 m). During winter dormancy, the trunk can be vulnerable to extreme freezing conditions and will be sometimes buried and insulated with soil to protect it.\n\nThe trunk is composed of sleeves of conductive tissue, most notably the phloem and xylem. The outside bark of the vine contains the phloem tissues which transports sap, enriched by sugars and other molecules, from the leaves to the rest of the vine. During the annual growth cycle of the grapevine, the vine will start to store carbohydrate energy in the wood part of the trunk and roots. The downward passage of phloem sap to the roots and this storing process can be interrupted by the viticultural practice of \"girdling\" or cincturing the vine. This process can improve fruit set by forcing the vine to direct most of its energy towards developing the grape clusters. The xylem is the woody tissue on the inside of the trunk that moves sap, enriched with water, minerals and other compounds, up from the roots to the leaves.\n\nThe cordon, or \"arms\", of the grapevine extend from the trunk and are the part where additional arms and eventually leaves and grape clusters extend. The cordons are usually trained along wires as part of a trellis system. This training usually fixes the cordon into a permanent position, such as horizontal extending from the trunk in opposite directions.\n\nThe terms stem, stalks and shoots are sometimes used interchangeably but viticulturalists generally make some differentiation. The stem of the grapevine item, extending from cordon, is considered the shoot and this part is most often pruned in the process of \"shoot thinning\" to control grape yields. The stalk extending out to hold the grape cluster is known as the bunchstem while the stem of the individual grape berry is the pedicel.\n\nThe shoot of the vine develops from new buds located on the cordon and grow to include the leaves, tendrils and eventually grape clusters. Shoots first begin to appear in spring, following bud break, accelerating growth till the flowering stage and usually slowly by the time that the vine begins veraison. During the stage of veraison (typically mid to late summer), the shoot starts to harden and change color from green to brown. \n\nThe shoot is ripening at this point and becomes known as a \"cane.\" In wintertime, the canes of the grapevine are usually completely cut off with the amount and weight of the cane being used to gauge the amount of pruning and canopy management that will be needed for the upcoming year. The \"tip\" of the shoot is the small (0.4 in/1 cm) part of the shoot furthermost from the vine. Viticulturalist use the growth of this tip as an indication of vine vigor because the tip competes with the grape clusters for resources from the vine. Ideally, shoot growth should come to a stop around the time of veraison; a vine that continues growing the shoots will stand the chance of less fully developed grape clusters.\n\nA grapevine's leaves are the most visible part of the canopy and also one of the most important. It is through the leaves that the vital physiological process of photosynthesis takes places which creates the carbohydrates that the vine needs to grow and process grape clusters. The size of the leaves vary due to grape varieties with varieties like Merlot having very large leaves and Gewürztraminer noted for having small leaves. The typical size is normally comparable to that of a human hand. In addition to size, there are many of other unique characteristics to the leaves that ampelographers use for plant identification. The size and shape of the leaf's sinus (the opening space where the blade of the leaf connects to the petiole), the shape of the \"teeth\" along the outer edge, the arrangement of the five lobes or projecting parts and the angle and length of the veins can all assist in identifying the grapevine.\n\nThe color of the leaf can be an indication of the health and nutrition of the vine. Chlorophyll in the leaf gives it a natural greenish color. Prior to the winter dormancy, the vine will stop being photosynthetically active which will contribute to a natural break down of chlorophyll and changing of color. However, deficiency in nitrogen or sulfur could cause the vine to turn prematurely (such as before harvest) yellow. The appearance of reddish spots of brown \"dead zones\" could be the sign of a viral infection (such as the leafroll virus) or contamination through the use of herbicides.\n\nViticulturalist will use a leaf to fruit ratio as a guideline in determining a vine's ability to fully ripen grapes. Quite different from the consideration of yields, the balance of leaf cover (needed for photosynthesis) and proportion of fruit (judged by weight rather than number of clusters) could have the most substantial effect on the quality of the grape for winemaking. Pioneered by viticulturalist Richard Smart, the idea of maintaining a \"balanced vine\" is to have just enough leaf cover for the plant to produce the energy needed to ripen the grape without having too much photosynthetic activity to where the vines has a surplus of energy and continues growing more shoots. Additionally, leaves provide shade to the grape clusters which be beneficial in protecting the clusters from the harshness of heat stress (\"sunburn\") but excessive shade can also decrease the development of sugars, anthocyanins and other phenolics and other important compounds in the grape. Many vineyards employ the practice of leaf removal throughout the growing season to try to maintain optimal leaf coverage.\n\n"}

He is venerated as a blessed by the Catholic Church.\n\nDuring World War II, he was a military chaplain of the Alpini, the elite mountain warfare soldiers of the Italian Army, and after the tragic experience of the war, he strove to ease the wounds of suffering and misery created by the war.\n\nGnocchi was born in San Colombano al Lambro, a few miles from Lodi, to Enrico Gnocchi and Clementina Pasta, a seamstress. The youngest of three brothers, when he was age five, he lost his father in 1907, from silicosis, caused by the unhealthy job as a marble worker.\n\nAfter moving to Milan with family, he lost his two older brothers in a few yearsMario, in 1908, and Andrea, in 1915, from tuberculosis. He grew up in a very devout and fervent environment, in the village of Montesiro in Brianza, where he often went to his relatives because of poor health. There, he was approached by Father Luigi Ghezzi, who helped him in his choice to enter seminary. He received his Holy Orders as priest in 1925 from Archbishop of Milan Eugenio Tosi, and the same year he celebrated his first Mass in Montesiro.\n\nGnocchi's first passion, since the first years of his priesthood, was the upbringing and education of the youth, by getting them closer to the Church and the oratory.\n\nFirst, he was entrusted to the parish of Cernusco sul Naviglio and then in 1926, the densely populated San Pietro in Sala of Milan, he continued his vocation for years, creating a deep bond with his parishioners.\n\nHis fame as an educator came to Cardinal Archbishop of Milan, Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster who, in 1936, appointed him as spiritual director of the Gonzaga Institute of the Brothers of Christian Schools.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s, Gnocchi was named chaplain of the second legion of Milan, composed of students of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore and the Gonzaga Institute. His mother, to whom he was very attached, died in 1939. At the start of World War II, Gnocchi volunteered in the \"Val Tagliamento\" battalion of the Alpini, sent to the Greek–Albanian front. After the Balkans Campaign in 1941, in 1942 Gnocchi left for the Russian front as chaplain of the 2nd Alpine Division Tridentina, where he participated in the Battle of Nikolayevka. During the dire retreat in the Russian steppe, he nearly fell victim to the freezing cold: dazed by frostbite, he would certainly have met the fate of thousands of other Italian servicemen, had not medical officer Rolando Prada (an offspring of the famous leather-working family) recognized him and put him on a passing military sled.\n\nSurviving the conflict, he gathered last wishes of the wounded, that he would bring back to Italy, in a journey all over the country, as a messenger for the families of the deceased. He went into the Alpine Valleys to find the relatives of fallen comrades. After becoming part of the O.S.C.A.R., Catholic association for aid to refugees, he helped Jews and escaped Allied POWs flee to Switzerland. He wrote articles in the illegal magazine \"Il Ribelle\" (\"Rebel\") and in the diocesan newspaper \"L'Italia\" (\"Italy\"). He was imprisoned more than once in the San Vittore prison, but obtained the liberation by the intervention of the archbishop of Milan, Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster. In those years the idea arose to create a charitable center that would take care of the victims of this war, which in the future developed as the origin of the \"Pro Juventute\".\n\nAfter the war, Gnocchi felt as his duty to aid that part of childhood that had been affected by the war the most. First, he directed his charitable work to the orphans of Alpini, housing them in Istituto Arosio (Institute Arosio) and subsequently devoted himself to the \"mutilated\" and to children invalids of war and civilians, establishing for them a vast network of colleges in many cities of Italy (Inverigo, Parma, Pessano con Bornago, Torino, Rome, Salerno, Milan, Firenze, Genova, ...); and, in the end, opened the doors of modern \"Centri di rieducazione\" (\"Re-educations centers\") for children affected by polio. For this forsaken and handicapped children, to whom he had devoted all of his young life, Gnocchi dedicated one of his most significant writings: \"Pedagogia del dolore innocente\" (\"Pedagogy of Innocent Suffering\").\n\nThe dramatic experience of the retreat from Russia, lived as military ordinariate always on the front, matured in Gnocchi the idea and the focus of his charitable mission; assisting the victims of war, in search of redemption for their \"innocent suffering\". In 1945, he was nominated as director of the \"Istituto Grandi Invalidi\" (Institute of Registered Invalids) of Arosio, thus accepting the first orphans and adults disabled by the war. In 1948, he founded the \"Fondazione Pro Infanzia Mutilata\" (\"Foundation For Mutilated Infants\"), acknowledged in the next year with a decree by the President of Italy. The same year, the Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi nominated Gnocchi as adviser to the Presidency of the Council for the mutilated by the war. In 1951, the foundation was dissolved, and all its goods and structure were donated to the newly created \"Fondazione Pro Juventute\" (Juvenile Foundation).\n\nHe died in Milan, age 53, with a crucifix in his hands, given to him by his mother years before, and very beloved in his last hours. The metastasis of the tumor that had stricken him had reached the skeleton and the respiratory system. Three crises that occurred between noon and the evening before had announced the fourth, fatal, and no one had delusions about his possible recovery anymore: Don Gnocchi's constitution had been too hardly tested and accompanied by suffering and fasting, as well as by the unrelenting advancing of the illness, even though his face, often smiling, deceived visitors. While dying, he donated his corneas to two blind children, guests of his foundations, \"Silvio Coangrande\" and \"Amabile Battistello\".\n\nAfter his death, there were many people and the believers who called for his help, say they received \"graces\" by the priest. On 17 August 1979, an \"Alpino\", a specialist electrician by profession, from Villa d'Adda, survived a serious accident at work. The miracle is attributed to Gnocchi, invoked by the victim. For these reasons, thirty years after his death, cardinal archbishop of Milan Carlo Maria Martini established the \"Processo sulla vita, virtù e fama di santità\" (\"Process on the life, virtues and reputation for holiness\") (Diocesan process) on 6 May 1987, that was concluded positively on 23 February 1991. In 199 sessions was held deposition of 178 texts and numerous documentation that was collected. This investigation material (for a total of 4321 pages) was presented to the Congregazione per le Cause dei Santi di Roma (Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome), where Brother Leo Luigi Morelli was appointed postulator of the cause of canonization.\n\nAfter his death, which occurred in 2002, replaces brother Rodolfo Cosimo Meoli. After years of careful investigation and analysis, on 20 December 2002, Pope John Paul II declared him \"venerable\". On 17 January 2009, Pope Benedict XVI, with a papal decree recognized a miracle attributed to Gnocchi, a decisive step towards the beatification. On 2 March 2009, cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi announced the beatification for the 25 October 2009; the rite for beatification was presided by the archbishop of Milan, cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi in the presence of many ambrosian priests and bishops. Among these were the cardinal Prefect of the Congregation of Bishops Giovanni Battista Re, the former Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Msgr. Piero Marini and the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, bishop Angelo Amato.\n\nHis charitable work goes under the name of Juvenile Foundation Don Gnocchi, today known as Don Carlo Gnocchi - ONLUS Foundation, that was awarded in 2003 with gold medal of merit of Public Health.\nHis writings include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38469122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38469122", "title": "Cauque Mayan language", "text": "Cauque Mayan language\n\nCauque Mayan is a mixed language, a K’iche’ (Quiché) base relexified by Kaqchikel (Cakchiquel). During the colonial era, K’iche’ migrated to Sacatepéquez, in the heart of Kaqchikel territory, where they founded the village of Santa María Cauque. Today only older adults retain the K’iche’ base to their speech: for younger speakers, the language has merged into Kaqchikel.\n\nThe Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language is also known as the Cauqué Mixed Language, or Cauqué Mayan, spoken in the aldea of Santa María Cauqué, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Department of Sacatepéquez in Guatemala. A 1998 study by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) estimated speaker population at 2,000. While the language's grammatical base is from K’iche’, its lexicon is supplied by Kaqchikel. It is generally thought that in the 15th century during the colonial period, its original K’iche’ speakers came from the area of what is now the Department of Quiché and founded Santa María Cauqué. Currently, the aldea is west of Guatemala City and at least 100 miles from the nearest K’iche’-speaking region. The exact origin of this mixed language's K’iche’an grammatical base is not agreed upon, with some sources listing the K'iche' dialect of Joyabaj as having been the contributing grammar, while others state that the area of current-day city of Quetzaltenango is from where the original Santa María Cauqué founders and their respective K'iche' dialect came. In any case, it is clear that a variety of the original K’iche’ language was brought into and has continued to manifest in the grammar of this Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, while it demonstrates the result of relexification over time from the surrounding Kaqchikel language. This particular process of relexification of the original K'iche' that had emigrated to a predominantly Kaqchikel-speaking region probably began with borrowing from the contact language (Kaqchikel) of roots and content morphemes, such as nouns and verbs. This heavy lexical influence is understood to have been a significant deviation in \"content\" words from those that were part of the original Joyabaj dialect of K'iche' to their current Kaqchikel counterparts in the Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, while at the same time there has been no structural borrowing from the surrounding Kaqchikel to replace the grammar that appears to have originated from K'iche'.\n\nAccording to a preliminary phonological analysis by Paul S. Stevenson, the speech of those from Santa María Cauqué came from an original variety of K'iche', which now acts as the mixed language’s grammatical base. This evidence is realized in K’iche’ morphological-syntactic elements surrounding Kaqchikel vocabulary. This includes verb inflection for present tense-aspect marker, from which the K’iche’ prefix //k-// is implemented, contrasted with the more typical Kaqchikel prefixes of //y-// and //n-//. Furthermore, Santa María Cauqué utilizes K’iche’ suffixes at the end of a phrase that indicate whether the verb was transitive or intransitive, //-o//~//-u// or //-ik// respectively, those which Kaqchikel does not. In fact, the //-ik// suffix can also be found with positionals in Santa María Cauqué. Possession by a third person singular, preconsonantal, displays K’iche’ //u-// and not Kaqchikel //ru-//. The third person pronoun is also affected, in that the mixed language shows a higher number of speakers displaying K’iche’ \"rare’\" ‘him/her/it’, instead of Kaqchikel \"rija’\" ‘him/her/it’. Function words are still marked by K’iche’ as well, with //-uk’// ‘with’ and not Kaqchikel //-ik’in//. While the majority of grammatical elements in Santa María Cauqué are presented in K’iche’, the majority of lexical elements are realized in Kaqchikel.\n\nFollowing Bakker and Muysken’s criteria of mixed languages, the Cauqué Mixed Language, with its convergence of K’iche’ grammar and Kaqchikel lexicon, is a result of geographical and historical social influence of identity (López 1999). As documented in 1998 and 2003, there are about 2,000 speakers of the Kaqchikel-K’iche’ Mixed Language in the Santa María Cauqué aldea. They are mainly adults older than 30 years of age, while there does not seem to be as much language transmission to the younger generations. These speakers also display bilingualism in the surrounding South Central Kaqchikel dialect, while the numbers of those also bilingual in Spanish continues to grow. While there are previous assertions that the mixed language has not undergone structural borrowing, there still appears to be a shift within the language to become more like Kaqchikel, since older speakers show more of a K’iche’ morphological-syntactic base.\n\n"}

{"id": "30156930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30156930", "title": "Content determination", "text": "Content determination\n\nContent determination is the subtask of Natural language generation that involves deciding on the information to be communicated in a generated text. It is closely related to the task of Document structuring.\n\nConsider an NLG system which summarises information about sick babies. Suppose this system has four pieces of information it can communicate\nWhich of these bits of information should be included in the generated texts?\n\nThere are three general issues which almost always impact the content determination task, and can be illustrated with the above example.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental issue is the \"communicative goal\" of the text, i.e. its \"purpose\" and \"reader\". In the above example, for instance, a doctor who wants to make a decision about medical treatment would probably be most interested in the heart rate bradycardias, while a parent who wanted to know how her child was doing would probably be more interested in the fact that the baby was being given morphine and was crying.\n\nThe second issue is the \"size\" and \"level of detail\" of the generated text. For instance, a short summary which was sent to a doctor as a 160 character SMS text message might only mention the heart rate bradycarias, while a longer summary which was printed out as a multipage document might also mention the fact that the baby is on a morphine IV.\n\nThe final issue is how \"unusual and unexpected\" the information is. For example, neither doctors nor parents would place a high priority on being told that the baby's temperature was normal, if they expected this to be the case.\n\nRegardless, content determination is very important to users, indeed in many cases the quality of content determination is the most important factor (from the user's perspective) in determining the overall quality of the generated text.\n\nThere are three basic approaches to document structuring: schemas (content templates), statistical approaches, and explicit reasoning.\n\n\"Schemas\" are templates which explicitly specify the content of a generated text (as well as Document structuring information). Typically they are constructed by manually analysing a corpus of human-written texts in the target genre, and extracting a content template from these texts. Schemas work well in practice in domains where content is somewhat standardised, but work less well in domains where content is more fluid (such as the medical example above).\n\n\"Statistical techniques\" use statistical corpus analysis techniques to automatically determine the content of the generated texts. Such work is in its infancy, and has mostly been applied to contexts where the communicative goal, reader, size, and level of detail are fixed. For example, generation of newswire summaries of sporting events.\n\n\"Explicit reasoning\" approaches have probably attracted the most attention from researchers. The basic idea is to use AI reasoning techniques (such as knowledge-based rules, planning, pattern detection, case-based reasoning, etc.) to examine the information available to be communicated (including how unusual/unexpected it is), the communicative goal and reader, and the characteristics of the generated text (including target size), and decide on the optimal content for the generated text. A very wide range of techniques has been explored, but there is no consensus as to which is most effective.\n"}

It suggests that in order for an organism to evolve a large brain without a significant increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (as seen in humans), the organism must use less energy on other expensive tissues; the paper introducing the ETH suggests that in humans, this was achieved by eating an easy-to-digest diet and evolving a smaller, less energy intensive gut. The ETH has inspired many research projects to test its validity in primates and other organisms.\n The original paper introducing the ETH was written by Dr. Leslie Aiello and Dr. Peter Wheeler. In the paper, they sought to explain how humans managed to have energy for their large and metabolically expensive brains while still maintaining a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) comparable to other primates with smaller brains. They found that the humans’ smaller relative gut size almost completely compensated for the metabolic cost of the larger brain. They went on to postulate that a larger brain would allow for more complex foraging behavior, which would result in a higher quality diet, which would then allow the gut to shrink further, freeing up more energy for the brain. This research also presented a case for studying the evolution of organs in a more interconnected manner, rather than in isolation.\n The academic debate around the ETH is still active, and has inspired a number of similar tests, all attempting to verify the ETH with another species or group of species by looking at encephalization (a ratio between brain size and body size), gut size, and/or diet quality. Primates, being the closes living relatives to humans, are a natural extension to the hypothesis, and as such are examined by many of these tests. One such study supported the expensive tissue hypothesis and found a positive correlation between diet quality and brain size (as would be expected by the original paper), but it did note that there were exceptions among the species tested . A broader study including primates and other mammals disputed the ETH, finding that there is no negative correlation between brain and gut sizes; it did, however, support the idea of energy trade offs in evolution as it found a negative correlation between encephalization and adipose (fat) deposits.\n"}

The length of the document is usually limited to 2 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices), although some conferences may allow slightly longer articles. If the conference does not specify a document style, the standard double-column IEEE format is a common practice. \n\nThe concept of a \"fast abstract\" was created at the 28th Fault-Tolerant Computing Symposium, 1998, by Ram Chillarege, who was the program co-chair of the conference. They are meant to promote communication and discussion of subjects that have yet to be established or completed as research projects, and to provide a venue for reporting barely tested ideas, early experiments, or opinions. While informal discussions, stand-up talks, and round tables provide an avenue for such sharing, they lack the written record that is essential for academic progress. Fast abstracts aim to fill this gap. Since their inception, fast abstract sessions have been gradually adopted by several conferences, in some cases even being among the most attended sessions.\n\nDue to their purpose and short length, fast abstracts do not require a full treatment of results as expected of a full paper published at a conference or journal.

{"id": "6299014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6299014", "title": "Heideggerian terminology", "text": "Heideggerian terminology\n\nMartin Heidegger, the 20th-century German philosopher, produced a large body of work that intended a profound change of direction for philosophy. Such was the depth of change that he found it necessary to introduce a large number of neologisms, often connected to idiomatic words and phrases in the German language.\n\nTwo of his most basic neologisms, present-at-hand and ready-to-hand, are used to describe various attitudes toward things in the world. For Heidegger, such \"attitudes\" are prior to, i.e. more basic than, the various sciences of the individual items in the world. Science itself is an attitude, one that attempts a kind of neutral investigation. Other related terms are also explained below.\n\nHeidegger's overall analysis is quite involved, taking in a lot of the history of philosophy. See \"Being and Time\" for a description of his overall project, and to give some context to these technical terms.\n\nHeidegger's idea of \"aletheia\", or disclosure (\"Erschlossenheit\"), was an attempt to make sense of how things in the world appear to human beings as part of an opening in intelligibility, as \"unclosedness\" or \"unconcealedness\". (This is Heidegger's usual reading of \"aletheia\" as \"Unverborgenheit\", \"unconcealment.\") It is closely related to the notion of world disclosure, the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted \"aletheia\" to stand for a re-interpreted definition of truth. However, he later corrected the association of \"aletheia\" with truth.\n\nAn assertion (as opposed to a question, a doubt or a more expressive sense) is apophantic. It is a statement that covers up meaning and just gives us something as present-at-hand. For Instance, \"The President is on vacation\", and, \"Salt is Sodium Chloride\" are sentences that, because of their apophantic character, can easily be picked-up and repeated in news and gossip by 'The They.' However, the real \"ready-to-hand\" meaning and context may be lost.\n\nBeing-in-the-world is Heidegger's replacement for terms such as subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, that there is no consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.\n\nAt the most basic level of \"being-in-the-world,\" Heidegger notes that there is always a mood, a mood that \"assails us\" in our unreflecting devotion to the world. A mood comes neither from the \"outside\" nor from the \"inside,\" but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood; it is part of our facticity. Only with a mood are we permitted to encounter things in the world. \"Dasein\" (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind. As such, \"Dasein\" is a \"thrown\" \"projection\" (\"geworfener Entwurf\"), projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding the world in terms of possibilities. Such projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself toward a plan that has been thought out. It is not a plan, since \"Dasein\" has, as \"Dasein\", already projected itself. \"Dasein\" always understands itself in terms of possibilities. As projecting, the understanding of \"Dasein\" is its possibilities \"as\" possibilities. One can take up the possibilities of \"The They\" self and merely follow along or make some more authentic understanding (see Hubert Dreyfus's book \"Being-in-the-World\".)\n\nBeing-toward-death is not an orientation that brings \"Dasein\" closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather a way of being. Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the \"Dasein\" towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by dread or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of Being. Time, the present and the notion of the \"eternal\", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it is very different from the mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an ecstasy, an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of \"Dasein\"s temporality.\n\nDeath is that possibility which is the absolute impossibility of \"Dasein\". As such, it cannot be compared to any other kind of ending or \"running out\" of something. For example, one's death is not an empirical event. For Heidegger, death is \"Dasein\"s ownmost (it is what makes \"Dasein\" individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not understand our own death through the death of other \"Dasein\"), and it is not to be outstripped. The \"not-yet\" of life is always already a part of \"Dasein\": \"as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.\" The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's \"ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped\". Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural \"not-yet\"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.\n\nWith average, everyday (normal) discussion of death, all this is concealed. The \"they-self\" talks about it in a fugitive manner, passes it off as something that occurs at some time but is not yet \"present-at-hand\" as an \"actuality\", and hides its character as one's ownmost possibility, presenting it as belonging to no one in particular. It becomes devalued — redefined as a neutral and mundane aspect of existence that merits no authentic consideration. \"One dies\" is interpreted as a fact, and comes to mean \"nobody dies\".\n\nOn the other hand, authenticity takes \"Dasein\" out of the \"They,\" in part by revealing its place as a part of the They. Heidegger states that \"Authentic being-toward-death\" calls \"Dasein\"s individual self out of its \"they-self\", and frees it to re-evaluate life from the standpoint of finitude. In so doing, \"Dasein\" opens itself up for \"angst,\" translated alternately as \"dread\" or as \"anxiety.\" Angst, as opposed to fear, does not have any distinct object for its dread; it is rather anxious in the face of Being-in-the-world in general — that is, it is anxious in the face of \"Dasein\"s own self. Angst is a shocking individuation of \"Dasein\", when it realizes that it is not at home in the world, or when it comes face to face with its own \"uncanny\" (German \"Unheimlich\" \"not homelike\"). In \"Dasein\"s individuation, it is open to hearing the \"call of conscience\" (German \"Gewissensruf\"), which comes from \"Dasein\"s own Self when it wants to be its Self. This Self is then open to truth, understood as unconcealment (Greek \"aletheia\"). In this moment of vision, \"Dasein\" understands what is hidden as well as hiddenness itself, indicating Heidegger's regular uniting of opposites; in this case, truth and untruth.\n\nThe term \"Being-with\" refers to an ontological characteristic of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, that he or she is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) \"ultrasocial\" and \"obligatorily gregarious.\" Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life \"Being-with\" (\"Mitsein\"), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.\n\nA fundamental basis of our being-in-the-world is, for Heidegger, not matter or spirit but care:\n\nAll these ways of Being-in have concern (\"Sorge\", care) as their kind of Being. Just as the scientist might investigate or search, and presume neutrality, we see that beneath this there is the mood, the concern of the scientist to discover, to reveal new ideas or theories and to attempt to level off temporal aspects.\n\nIn German the word \"Lichtung\" means a clearing, as in, for example, a clearing in the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (\"Licht\"), it is sometimes also translated as \"lighting,\" and in Heidegger's work it refers to the necessity of a clearing in which anything at all can appear, the clearing in which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed. Note the relation that this has to \"Aletheia\" (see the main article or the entry above) and disclosure.\n\nBeings (\"Seiendes\"), but not Being itself (\"Sein\"), stand out as if in a clearing, or physically, as if in a space. Thus, Hubert Dreyfus writes, \"things show up in the light of our understanding of being.\" Thus the clearing makes possible the disclosure of beings (\"Seiendes\"), and also access to Dasein's own being. But the clearing is not, itself, an entity that can be known directly, in the sense in which know about the entities of the world. As Heidegger writes in \"On the Origin of the Work of Art\":\n\nFounded in the work of Martin Luther, here is Martin Heidegger on philosophy as the task of destroying ontological concepts, in other words also including, ordinary everyday meanings of words like time, history, being, theory, death, mind, body, matter, logic etc.:\n\nHeidegger considers that tradition can become calcified here and there:\n\nHeidegger then remarks on the positivity of his project of \"Destruktion\":\n\n\"Dasein\" is a German word and is sometimes translated as \"being-there\" or \"being-here\" (\"da\" combines in its meaning \"here\" and \"there\", excluding the spatial-relational distinction made by the English words; \"Sein\" is the infinitive, \"to be\"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for \"human being\" or \"human entity.\" A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, \"in a familiar world\", and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger does not want to get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as \"person,\" \"consciousness,\" \"soul,\" or \"spirit,\" so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of \"mineness,\" or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand \"what\" things are and \"that\" they are e.g. \"My dog is brown\" or \"Today is Sunday.\" Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities \"as\" entities, helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of \"\"Dasein\".\"\n\nHubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa write that: \"According to Heidegger our nature is to be world disclosers. That is, by means of our equipment and coordinated practices we human beings open coherent, distinct contexts or worlds in which we perceive, feel, act, and think.\"\n\nHeidegger scholar Nikolas Kompridis writes: \"World disclosure refers, with deliberate ambiguity, to a process which actually occurs at two different levels. At one level, it refers to the disclosure of an already interpreted, symbolically structured world; the world, that is, within which we always already find ourselves. At another level, it refers as much to the disclosure of new horizons of meaning as to the disclosure of previously hidden or unthematized dimensions of meaning.\"\n\nThe ontological-existential structure of Dasein consists of \"thrownness\" (\"Geworfenheit\"), \"projection\" (\"Entwurf\"), and \"being-along-with\"/\"engagement\" (\"Sein-bei\"). These three basic features of existence are inseparably bound to \"discourse\" (\"Rede\"), understood as the deepest unfolding of language.\n\nAn object in the world with which we have meaningful dealings.\n\nA nearly un-translatable term, Heidegger's equipment can be thought of as a collective noun, so that it is never appropriate to call something 'an equipment'. Instead, its use often reflects it to mean a tool, or as an \"in-order-to\" for Dasein. Tools, in this collective sense, and in being \"ready-to-hand\", always exist in a network of other tools and organizations, e.g., the paper is on a desk in a room at a university. It is inappropriate usually to see such equipment on its own or as something \"present-at-hand\".\n\nAnother, less prosaic, way of thinking of 'equipment' is as 'stuff we can work with' around us, along with its context. \"The paper we can do things with, from the desk, in the university, in the city, on the world, in the universe.\" 'Equipment' refers to the thing, and its usefulness possibilities, and its context.\n\nEreignis is translated often as \"an event,\" but is better understood in terms of something \"coming into view.\" It comes from the German prefix, \"er-\", comparable to 're-' in English, and \"Auge\", eye. It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix \"er-\" also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as \"enowning\"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. Hubert Dreyfus defined the term as \"things coming into themselves by belonging together.\"\n\nEreignis appears in Heidegger's later works and is not easily summarized. The most sustained treatment of the theme occurs in the cryptic and difficult \"Contributions to Philosophy\". In the following quotation he associates it with the fundamental idea of concern from \"Being and Time\", the English etymology of \"con-cern\" is similar to that of the German:\n\nHeidegger uses this word to describe the nature of \"Dasein\"'s being. Beings unlike \"Dasein\" (chairs, shoes, etc.) do not \"exist\"; they are merely \"objectively present\". \"Dasein\" exists; chairs are objectively present.\n\nTwo related words, \"existenziell\" and \"Existential\", are used as descriptive characteristics of Being. To be \"existenziell\" is a categorical or ontic characteristic: an understanding of all this which relates to one's existence, while an \"Existenzial\" is an ontological characteristic: the structure of existence.\n\nOften translated as \"releasement,\" Heidegger's concept of \"Gelassenheit\" has been explained as \"the spirit of \"disponibilité\" [availability] before What-Is which permits us simply to let things be in whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery.\" Heidegger elaborated the idea of \"Gelassenheit\" in 1959, with a homonymous volume which includes two texts: a 1955 talk entitled simply \"Gelassenheit\", and a 'conversation' (\"Gespräch\") entitled \"Zur Erörterung der Gelassenheit. Aus einem Feldweggespräch über das Denken\" (\"Towards an Explication of \"Gelassenheit\": From a Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking\" or \"Toward an Emplacing Discussion [\"Erörterung\"] of Releasement [\"Gelassenheit\"]: From a Country Path Conversation about Thinking\"). An English translation of this text was published in 1966 as \"Conversation on a Country Path about Thinking\". He borrowed the term from the Christian mystical tradition, proximately from Meister Eckhart.\n\n\"Geworfenheit\" describes our individual existences as \"being thrown\" (\"geworfen\") into the world. For William J. Richardson, Heidegger used this single term, \"thrown-ness,\" to \"describe [the] two elements of the original situation, There-being's non-mastery of its own origin and its referential dependence on other beings\".\n\nHeidegger's later works, beginning by 1930 and largely established by the early 1940s, seem to many commentators (e.g. William J. Richardson) to at least reflect a shift of focus, if not indeed a major change in his philosophical thinking which is known as the turn (\"die Kehre\"). One way this has been understood is as a shift from \"doing\" to \"dwelling\" and from \"Being and Time\" (early Heidegger) to \"Time and Being\" (late Heidegger). However, others feel that this is to overstate the difference. Heidegger himself held between 1 and 4 December 1949 at Bremen Club four lectures, which were repeated in the spring of 1950 (25 and 26 March) unchanged at Bühlerhöhe. The titles were \"Das Ding\", \"Das Gestell\", \"Die Gefahr\" and \"Die Kehre\". The second and third lecture were reworked into a larger text in 1953 with the title \"Die Frage nach der Technik\" and in this form published in 1954 in the collection \"Vorträge und Aufsätze\", which also included a slightly reworked version of the first lecture, \"Das Ding\". In 1962, \"Die Frage nach der Technik\" and the fourth lecture \"Die Kehre\" were published together in a small book called \"Die Technik und die Kehre\", which is still in print. The Bremen lectures were published all four together, and in their original form, only in 1994 in volume 79 of the Gesamtausgabe.\n\nHeidegger uses the term ontic, often in contrast to the term ontological, when he gives descriptive characteristics of a particular thing and the \"plain facts\" of its existence. What is ontic is what makes something what it is.\n\nFor an individual discussing the nature of \"being\", one's ontic could refer to the physical, factual elements that produce and/or underlie one's own reality - the physical brain and its substructures. Moralists raise the question of a moral ontic when discussing whether there exists an external, objective, independent source or wellspring for morality that transcends culture and time.\n\nAs opposed to \"ontic\" (\"ontisch\"), ontological is used when the nature, or meaningful structure of existence is at issue. Ontology, a discipline of philosophy, focuses on the formal study of Being. Thus, something that is ontological is concerned with understanding and investigating Being, the ground of Being, or the concept of Being itself.\n\nFor an individual discussing the nature of \"being\", the ontological could refer to one's own first-person, subjective, phenomenological experience of being.\n\nA term used only once in a particular edition of \"Being and Time\". In the text, the term appears to denote \"the possibility whose probability it is solely to be possible\". At least, if it were used in context, this is the only plausible definition.\n\nWith the present-at-hand one has (in contrast to \"ready-to-hand\") an attitude like that of a scientist or theorist, of merely looking at or observing something. In seeing an entity as present-at-hand, the beholder is concerned only with the bare facts of a thing or a concept, as they are present and in order to theorize about it. This way of seeing is disinterested in the concern it may hold for Dasein, its history or usefulness. This attitude is often described as existing in neutral space without any particular mood or subjectivity. However, for Heidegger, it is not completely disinterested or neutral. It has a mood, and is part of the metaphysics of presence that tends to level all things down. Through his writings, Heidegger sets out to accomplish the \"Destruktion\" (see above) of this metaphysics of presence.\n\nPresence-at-hand is not the way things in the world are usually encountered, and it is only revealed as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.\n\nHowever, in almost all cases we are involved in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).\n\nImportantly, the ready-to-hand only emerges from the prior attitude in which we care about what is going on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there \"in order to\" do something. In this sense the \"ready-to-hand\" is \"primordial\" compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and \"close\" to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our \"average-everyday\" understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.\n\nFor Heidegger in \"Being and Time\" this illustrates, in a very practical way, the way the present-at-hand, as a present in a \"now\" or a present eternally (as, for example, a scientific law or a Platonic Form), has come to dominate intellectual thought, especially since the Enlightenment. To understand the question of being one must be careful not to fall into this leveling off, or forgetfulness of being, that has come to assail Western thought since Socrates, see the metaphysics of presence.\n\nResoluteness refers to one's ability to \"unclose\" one's framework of intelligibility (i.e., to make sense of one's words and actions in terms of one's life as a whole), and the ability to be receptive to the \"call of conscience.\"\n\nOne of the most interesting and important 'concepts' in \"Being and Time\" is that of \"Das Man\", for which there is no exact English translation; different translations and commentators use different conventions. It is often translated as \"the They\" or \"People\" or \"Anyone\" but is more accurately translated as \"One\" (as in \"'one' should always arrive on time\"). \"Das Man\" derives from the impersonal singular pronoun \"man\" ('one', as distinct from 'I', or 'you', or 'he', or 'she', or 'they'). Both the German \"man\" and the English 'one' are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word \"man\" in German is nearly identical to that of the word \"one\" in English.\n\nHeidegger refers to this concept of \"the One\" in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because \"That is what one does\" or \"That is what people do\". Thus, \"das Man\" is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility.\n\n\"Das Man\" constitutes a possibility of Dasein's Being, and so \"das Man\" cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of 'the They' is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, \"The \"they\" prescribes one's state-of-mind, and determines what and how one 'sees'\".\n\nTo give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says \"one does not do such a thing\"; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of 'the They'. This is a feature of 'the They' as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts \"the authentic self\" (\"my owned self\") with \"the they self\" (\"my un-owned self\").\n\nA related concept to this is that of the \"apophantic assertion\".\n\nHeidegger gives us four ways of using the term world:\n\nNote, it is the third definition that Heidegger normally uses.\n\n\nAll citations referring to texts authored by Heidegger use \"H.\"x\"\" to refer to the original page number.\n\n"}

{"id": "272231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272231", "title": "ISDB", "text": "ISDB\n\nThe Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB; Japanese: , \"Tōgō dejitaru hōsō sābisu\") is a Japanese standard for digital television (DTV) and digital radio used by the country's radio and television networks. ISDB replaced NTSC-J analog television system and the previously used \"MUSE Hi-vision\" analogue HDTV system in Japan, and will be replacing NTSC, PAL-M and PAL-N in South America and the Philippines. Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (DTTB) services using ISDB-T started in Japan in December 2003 and in Brazil in December 2007 as a trial. Since then, many countries have adopted ISDB over other digital broadcasting standards.\n\n\n\n\nISDB is maintained by the Japanese organization ARIB. The standards can be obtained for free at the Japanese organization DiBEG website and at ARIB.\n\nThe core standards of ISDB are ISDB-S (satellite television), ISDB-T (terrestrial), ISDB-C (cable) and 2.6 GHz band mobile broadcasting which are all based on MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 standard for multiplexing with transport stream structure and video and audio coding (MPEG-2 or H.264), and are capable of high definition television (HDTV) and standard definition television. ISDB-T and ISDB-Tsb are for mobile reception in TV bands. 1seg is the name of an ISDB-T service for reception on cell phones, laptop computers and vehicles.\n\nThe concept was named for its similarity to ISDN, because both allow multiple channels of data to be transmitted together (a process called multiplexing). This is also much like another digital radio system, Eureka 147, which calls each group of stations on a transmitter an ensemble; this is very much like the multi-channel digital TV standard DVB-T. ISDB-T operates on unused TV channels, an approach taken by other countries for TV but never before for radio.\n\nThe various flavors of ISDB differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12 GHz band ISDB-S uses PSK modulation, 2.6 GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses CDM, and ISDB-T (in VHF and/or UHF band) uses COFDM with PSK/QAM.\n\nBesides audio and video transmission, ISDB also defines data connections (Data broadcasting) with the internet as a return channel over several media (10Base-T/100Base-T, Telephone line modem, Mobile phone, Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11) etc.) and with different protocols. \nThis is used, for example, for interactive interfaces like data broadcasting (ARIB STD-B24) and electronic program guides (EPG).\n\nThe ISDB specification describes a lot of (network) interfaces, but most importantly the Common Interface for Conditional Access System (CAS). While ISDB has examples of implementing various kinds of CASes, in Japan CAS called \"B-CAS\" is used. (ARIB STD-B25) defines the Common Scrambling Algorithm (CSA) system called MULTI2 required for (de-)scrambling television.\n\nThe ISDB CAS system in Japan is operated by a company named \"B-CAS\"; the CAS card is called \"B-CAS card\". The Japanese ISDB signal is always encrypted by the B-CAS system even if it is a free television program. That is why it is commonly called \"Pay per view system without charge\". An interface for mobile reception is under consideration.\n\nISDB supports RMP (Rights management and protection). Since all digital television (DTV) systems carry digital data content, a DVD or high-definition (HD) recorder could easily copy content losslessly.\nHollywood requested copy protection; this was the main reason for RMP being mandated. The content has three modes: “copy once”, “copy free” and “copy never”. In “copy once” mode, a program can be stored on a hard disk recorder, but cannot be further copied; only moved to another copy-protected media—and this move operation will mark the content “copy one generation”, which is mandated to permanently prevent further copying. “Copy never” programming may only be timeshifted and cannot be permanently stored. In 2006, the Japanese government is evaluating using the Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) \"Encryption plus Non-Assertion\" mechanism, to allow making multiple copies of digital content between compliant devices.\n\nThere are two types of ISDB receiver: Television and set-top box. The aspect ratio of an ISDB-receiving television set is 16:9; televisions fulfilling these specs are called \"Hi-Vision TV\". There are four TV types: Cathode ray tube (CRT), plasma display panel (PDP), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and liquid crystal display (LCD), with LCD being the most popular \"Hi-Vision TV\" on the Japanese market nowadays. The cheapest 32-inch LCD is ¥27,800 (approx. 360 US$) and 22-inch for ¥17,970 (approx. $233 US) for retail price as of November 2011.\n\nThe LCD share as measured by JEITA in November 2004 was about 60%. While PDP sets occupy the high end market with units that are over 50 inches (1270 mm), PDP and CRT set shares are about 20% each. CRT sets are considered low end for Hi-Vision. An STB is sometimes referred to as a digital tuner.\n\nTypical middle to high-end ISDB receivers marketed in Japan have several interfaces:\n\n\nAll TV broadcasters in Japan is encrypted with \"Copy-Once\", which allows users to record to a digital medium (D-VHS, DVD, HDD, etc.) but does not allow dubbing to another digital medium. On the other hand, the \"Copy-Once\" technology does not prohibit all types of dubbing. It is possible to dub to an analog medium (such as standard VHS) and if recorded to an HDD, it will allow users to \"Move\" the contents to a D-VHS, but not copy. In contrast, 1seg digital broadcasts which are for low-bandwidth mobile reception and occupy 1/13th of a digital channel, are transmitted \"in the clear\" and do not carry copy protection information.\n\nMany users are also very worried about the recent news of severe protection in the future.\nThere are modes in ISDB that do not allow the output of signal from an Analog connector (D-connector, Component, Composite, S-Video, etc.). There are already plans to not allow analog output for \"Copyright Protection\" reasons. (Same as Blu-ray and HD DVD) This will make all currently sold STB Tuners, and the majority of LCD/Plasma TVs without HDMI inputs unusable. Plus all analog VHS, D-VHS that can only record via analog input, and all DVD players will also become unusable. These more limiting copy protection technologies will all start after analog broadcasting ends (when there won't be any choice for viewers). Currently, no financial assistance schemes have been announced, and viewers without proper devices will be forced to buy a new compatible TV or set top box in order to view ISDB broadcasts. Though not clear, it is said that there are also plans to protect all programs with \"Copy-Never\".\n\nThe copy protection on ISDB broadcasts can be circumvented with the proper hardware and software.\n\nBrazilian standard ISDB-Tb does not implement this copy protection mechanism. For other countries, there are some examples of implementing CAS system (such as verimatrix) by the operators' choice.\n\nThe B-CAS card is required to decode all broadcasts in Japan. These cards are included with every digital TV or tuner at no charge. To use this card, the end user must agree to the statement written on the registration card. Despite the fact that the card must be inserted to watch TV, if the end user refuses to accept the terms/conditions contained within the statement, the user cannot watch digital broadcasts. Essentially, users are \"forced\" to agree with the statement. Though registration is not required, it is recommended to fully enjoy interactive programs. Unregistered B-CAS card displays a watermark in a corner of the screen, suggesting the user to register. However, many viewers worry about the leaking of personal information, and the power/rights the TV stations have to access personal information for almost every citizen in Japan. In case of loss or destruction, new B-CAS card of the same number can be issued for a fee of 2,000 yen.\n\nTypical Japanese broadcast service consists as follows:\n\nThere are examples providing more than 10 SDTV services with H.264 coding in some countries.\n\nJapan started digital broadcasting using the DVB-S standard by PerfecTV in October/1996, and DirecTV in December/1997, with communication satellites. Still, DVB-S did not satisfy the requirements of Japanese broadcasters, such as NHK, key commercial broadcasting stations like Nippon Television, TBS, Fuji Television, TV asahi, TV Tokyo, and WOWOW (Movie-only Pay-TV broadcasting). Consequently, ARIB developed the ISDB-S standards. The requirements were HDTV capability, interactive services, network access and effective frequency utilization, and other technical requirements. The DVB-S standard allows the transmission of a bit stream of roughly 34 Mbit/s with a satellite transponder, which means the transponder can send one HDTV channel. Unfortunately, the NHK broadcasting satellite had only four vacant transponders, which led ARIB and NHK to develop ISDB-S: The new standard could transmit at 51 Mbit/s with a single transponder, which means that ISDB-S is 1.5 times more efficient than DVB-S and that one transponder can transmit two HDTV channels, along with other independent audio and data. Digital satellite broadcasting (BS digital) was started by NHK and followed commercial broadcasting stations on 1 December 2000. Today, SKY PerfecTV!, successor of Skyport TV, and Sky D, CS burn, Platone, EP, DirecTV, J Sky B, and PerfecTV!, adopted the ISDB-S system for use on the 110 degree (east longitude) wide-band communication satellite.\n\nThis table shows the summary of ISDB-S (satellite digital broadcasting).\n\nFrequency and channel specification of Japanese Satellites using ISDB-S\n\nHDTV was invented at NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories (Japan Broadcasting Corporation's Science & Technical Research Laboratories). The research for HDTV started as early as the 1960s, though a standard was proposed to the ITU-R (CCIR) only in 1973.\n\nBy the 1980s, a high definition television camera, cathode-ray tube, video tape recorder and editing equipment, among others, had been developed. In 1982 NHK developed MUSE (Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding), the first HDTV video compression and transmission system. MUSE used digital video compression, but for transmission frequency modulation was used after a digital-to-analog converter converted the digital signal.\n\nIn 1987, NHK demonstrated MUSE in Washington D.C. and NAB. The demonstration made a great impression in the U.S. As a result, the U.S. developed its own ATSC terrestrial DTV system. Europe also developed their own DTV system called DVB. Japan began R&D of a completely digital system in the 1980s that led to ISDB. Japan began terrestrial digital broadcasting, using ISDB-T standard by NHK and commercial broadcasting stations, on 1 December 2003.\n\nISDB-T is characterized by the following features:\n\n\nISDB-T was adopted for commercial transmissions in Japan in December 2003. It currently comprises a market of about 100 million television sets. ISDB-T had 10 million subscribers by the end of April 2005. Along with the wide use of ISDB-T, the price of receivers is getting low. The price of ISDB-T STB in the lower end of the market is ¥19800 as of 19 April 2006. By November 2007 only a few older, low-end STB models could be found in the Japanese market (average price U$180), showing a tendency towards replacement by mid to high-end equipment like PVRs and TV sets with inbuilt tuners. In November 2009, a retail chain AEON introduced STB in 40 USD, followed by variety of low-cost tuners. The Dibeg web page confirms this tendency by showing low significance of the digital tuner STB market in Japan.\n\nBrazil, which currently uses an analogue TV system (PAL-M) that slightly differs from any other countries, has chosen ISDB-T as a base for its DTV format, calling it ISDB-Tb or \"internally\" SBTVD (\"Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão Digital-Terrestre\"). The Japanese DiBEG group incorporated the advancements made by Brazil -MPEG4 video codec instead of ISDB-T's MPEG2 and a powerful interaction middleware called Ginga- and has renamed the standard to \"ISDB-T International\". Other than Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Ecuador which have already selected ISDB-Tb, there are other South American countries, mainly from Mercosur, such as Venezuela, that are considering ISDB-Tb, which could provide economies of scale and common market benefits from the regional South American manufacturing instead of importing ready-made STBs as is the case with the other standards. Also, it has been confirmed with extensive tests realized by Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (ABERT), Brazilian Television Engineering Society (SET) and Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie the insufficient quality for indoor reception presented by ATSC and, between DVB-T and ISDB-T, the latter presented superior performance in indoor reception and flexibility to access digital services and TV programs through non-mobile, mobile or portable receivers with impressive quality.\n\nThe ABERT–SET group in Brazil did system comparison tests of DTV under the supervision of the CPqD foundation. The comparison tests were done under the direction of a work group of SET and ABERT. The ABERT/SET group selected ISDB-T as the best choice in digital broadcasting modulation systems among ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T. Another study found that ISDB-T and DVB-T performed similarly, and that both were outperformed by DVB-T2.\n\nISDB-T was singled out as the most flexible of all for meeting the needs of mobility and portability. It is most efficient for mobile and portable reception. On June 29, 2006, Brazil announced ISDB-T-based SBTVD as the chosen standard for digital TV transmissions, to be fully implemented by 2016. By November 2007 (one month prior DTTV launch), a few suppliers started to announce zapper STBs of the new Nippon-Brazilian SBTVD-T standard, at that time without interactivity.\n\nThe implementation rollout in Brazil is proceeding successfully although some voice like Philips' say that its implementation could be faster. It terms of broadcasting, the implementation plan seems to be on target. In only eight months since the start, the digital signal is present in four state capitals and by the end of 2008 another three capitals will receive the signal. In terms of end-customers the implementation could be better, since at the moment it is estimated only 20,000 set-top boxes have been sold. Part of this low sales number can be explained by the prices that in the beginning ranged from BRL 600 to BRL 1,100. However, recently new set-top boxes were launched in market at R$300 (approx US$150) that will probably increase set-top box sales. Another reason to explain low sales level is the interactivity service not available yet. That is because the \"middleware\" developed by Brazilian universities (PUC Rio and Federal University of Paraiba) was finished in October 2008. It is expected the interactivity will be a strong appeal bringing more and more people to digital TV world.\n\nAdditionally, mobile TV started successfully with the launch of Samsung and Toshiba cell phones with ISDB-T \"one-seg\" tuners. Its main appeal is that the service is free. That is a very impressive accomplishment in a short period since Brazil launched its digital mobile TV for free. In other countries such accomplishment occurred years later, and in others like the U.S. and Europe this is far from reality and probably won't be for free . Subscription mobile TV in Germany using DVB-H has been dubbed \"a failure\". In Italy the cost of receiving mobile TV over DVB-H costs the user €9.90 per month just for the basic channel package.\n\nThis lists the countries who adopted the ISDB-T standard, chronologically arranged.\n\n\n\n\n Segment structure \n\nARIB has developed a segment structure called BST-OFDM (see figure).\nISDB-T divides the frequency band of one channel into thirteen segments. The broadcaster can select which combination of segments to use; this choice of segment structure allows for service flexibility. For example, ISDB-T can transmit both LDTV and HDTV using one TV channel or change to 3 SDTV, a switch that can be performed at any time. ISDB-T can also change the modulation scheme at the same time.\n\nThe above figure shows the spectrum of 13 segments structure of ISDB-T.\n<br>(\"s0\" is generally used for 1seg, \"s1\"-\"s12\" are used for one HDTV or three SDTVs)\n\n\nSpecification of Japanese terrestrial digital broadcasting using ISDB-T.\n\nMobaHo! is the name of the services that uses the Mobile satellite digital audio broadcasting specifications. MobaHo! started its service on 20 October 2004. Ended on 31 March 2009\n\nISDB-Tsb is the terrestrial digital sound broadcasting specification. The technical specification is the same as ISDB-T.

It is a common method for writing news stories (and has adaptability to other kinds of texts, e.g., blogs and editorial columns). This is a way to communicate the basics about a news report in the initial sentences. It is widely taught to mass communication and journalism students, and is systematically used in Anglophone media.\n\nThe inverted or upside-down pyramid can be thought of as a triangle with one side horizontally at the top and the body pointing down. The widest part at the top represents the most substantial, interesting, and important information that the writer means to convey, illustrating that this kind of material should head the article, while the tapering lower portion illustrates that other material should follow in order of diminishing importance.\n\nIt is sometimes called a summary news lead style, or bottom line up front (BLUF). The opposite, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the opening paragraphs, is called \"burying the lead\".\n\nOther styles are also used in news writing, including the \"anecdotal lead\", which begins the story with an eye-catching tale or anecdote rather than the central facts; and the Q&A, or question-and-answer format. The inverted pyramid may also include a \"hook\" as a kind of prologue, typically a provocative quote, question, or image, to entice the reader into committing to the story.\n\nThis format is valued for two reasons. First, readers can leave the story at any point and understand it, even if they do not have all the details. Second, it conducts readers through the details of the story.\n\nThis system also means that information less vital to the reader's understanding comes later in the story, where it is easier to edit out for space or other reasons. This is called \"cutting from the bottom\". Rather than petering out, a story may end with a \"kicker\" – a conclusion, perhaps call to action – which comes \"after\" the pyramid. This is particularly common in feature style.\n\nHistorians disagree about when the form was created. Many say the invention of the telegraph sparked its development by encouraging reporters to condense material, to reduce costs, or to hedge against the unreliability of the telegraph network. Studies of 19th-century news stories in American newspapers, however, suggest that the form spread several decades later than the telegraph, possibly because the reform era's social and educational forces encouraged factual reporting rather than more interpretive narrative styles.\n\nChip Scanlan's essay on the form includes this frequently cited example of telegraphic reporting:\n\nWho, when, where, why, what, and how are addressed in the first paragraph. As the article continues, the less important details are presented. An even more pyramid-conscious reporter or editor would move two additional details to the first two sentences: That the shot was to the head, and that it was expected to prove fatal. The transitional sentence about the Grants suggests that less-important facts are being added to the rest of the story.\n\nOther news outlets such as the Associated Press did not use this format when covering the assassination, instead adopting a chronological organization.\n\n"}

In his youth, he studied with Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv at the Talmud Torah in Grobiņa, Latvia, but was eventually expelled from the school for his \"heretical tendencies.\" He went on to attend a high school in Switzerland, and he then studied medicine and biology in Heidelberg and Berlin.\n\nElyashev's pen name was Bal-Makhshoves (), meaning \"Master [of] Thoughts\" or \"The Thinker\".\n\nElyashev is best known for his work as a literary critic, writing in Yiddish. He translated Theodor Herzl's \"Altneuland\" from German into Yiddish, upon Herzl's personal request. His Yiddish translation of Herzl's work is the language that by far- most of European Jewry had read of Herzl's calling for a Modern Jewish State.\n\nHis attitude to Jewish literature, Yiddish, and Hebrew is summed up by something that he wrote in 1918:\n\n[W]e have two languages and a dozen echoes from other foreign languages, but… we have only one literature. And therefore the reader who seeks to become acquainted with the currents of Jewish life, to comprehend the spirit of the Jewish individual and multitude and how they find expression in Jewish literature, that reader does not separate Hebrew writers from Yiddish ones. …All are representatives of our literature, all embody a piece of Jewish life in their writings; all of them are Jewish artists.\n\nElyashev was also politically active, as a forerunner of the Zionist Movement. He participated in the First Zionist Congress, held in Basel, Switzerland in August 1897, as a delegate from Germany .\n\n"}

He has made significant contributions to philosophy in the fields of philosophy of language, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. He is known primarily for his work on situation semantics (together with Jon Barwise), reflexivity, indexicality, personal identity, and self-knowledge.\n\nJohn Perry was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on January 16, 1943. He received his B.A. in philosophy from Doane College in 1964 and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Cornell University in 1968 under the supervision of Sydney Shoemaker. He taught philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, before joining the faculty at Stanford University where he is Henry Waldgrave Professor of Philosophy Emeritus. He subsequently taught at the University of California, Riverside, where he is now Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.\n\nHe was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize in 1999. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nIn 2004, he became co-host, with Kenneth Taylor, of \"Philosophy Talk,\" the radio program that \"questions everything... except your intelligence.\" He is also part of the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI)—an independent research center founded in 1983.\n\nPerry has made contributions to many areas of philosophy, including logic, philosophy of language, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.\n\nPerry's 1978 book \"A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality\" deals with standard problems in the theory of personal identity in the form of a dialogue between a mortally wounded university professor, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of Bernard Williams, John Locke, and Derek Parfit. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls David Hume's \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\".\n\nIn 1979, Perry published \"The Problem of the Essential Indexical\" in which he combined his work on philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. Essential indexicals (I, here, and now) are parts of language that cannot be paraphrased away. They are seen as locating beliefs and are essential to understand the speaker's belief. Perry presents a now famous example to illustrate his point:\n\n\"I once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my cart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I was the shopper I was trying to catch.\"\n\nIn this example, the pronoun \"I\" is essentially indexical because it allowed Perry to realize that it was he himself making the mess. This realization caused him to change his behavior. Essential indexicals create the impetus for action. They cannot be paraphrased away while retaining their immediacy. If Perry were to say \"Perry realized that Perry was making a mess\", it would still not be essentially indexical because Perry would still have to understand that he himself is Perry. Without that extra step, there would be no reason for him to change his action. \"I\" is the only essential indexical in that situation.\n\nIn logic, Perry and Jon Barwise are known for discussion of the slingshot argument, especially in their 1981 article \"Semantic Innocence and Uncompromising Situations\".\n\nIn his 2001 book \"Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness\", Perry argues for what he calls \"antecedent physicalism\", according to which physicalism is antecedently taken to be a plausible and reasonable position, provided that there are no better rival theories. Thus, Perry defends a version of type physicalism against three major philosophical arguments for dualism: the zombie argument, the knowledge argument, and the modal argument.\n\nPerry also produces non-technical work that reaches a wider audience, such as his humorous 1996 online essay entitled \"Structured Procrastination\". Perry was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in Literature for this essay in 2011. It states that \"[t]o be a high achiever, always work on something important, using it as a way to avoid doing something that's even more important\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5527901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5527901", "title": "Languages of Taiwan", "text": "Languages of Taiwan\n\nThe languages of Taiwan consist of several varieties of languages under families of Austronesian languages and Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in Taiwan. The Formosan languages, a branch of Austronesian languages, have been spoken by the Taiwanese aborigines in Taiwan for thousands of years. Researches on historical linguistics recognize Taiwan as the Urheimat (homeland) of the whole Austronesian languages family owing to the highest internal variety of the Formosan languages. In the last 400 years, several waves of Chinese emigrations brought several different Sino-Tibetan languages into Taiwan, these languages include Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, and Mandarin. These became the major languages of today's Taiwan, and make Taiwan an important center of Hokkien pop and Mandopop. \n\nFormosan languages were the dominant language of the Prehistory of Taiwan. The long colonial and immigration history of Taiwan brought in several languages such as Dutch, Spanish, Hokkien, Hakka, Japanese and Mandarin. Due to its colonial history, Japanese is also spoken and a large amount of loanwords from Japanese still exists in several languages of Taiwan.\n\nAfter World War II, a long martial law era was held in Taiwan. Policies of the government in this era suppressed languages other than Mandarin in public use. This has significantly damaged the evolution of local languages including Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, Formosan languages and Matsu dialect. The situation has slightly changed after the 2000s. The government has put some efforts to protect and revitalize local languages. Local languages is now a part of elementary school education in Taiwan. Laws and regulations regarding local language protection were established for Hakka and Formosan languages. Public TV and radio stations exclusively for the two languages were also established. Currently, the government of Taiwan also maintains standards of several widely spoken languages listed below, the percentage of users are from the \"2010 population and household census in Taiwan\"\n\nThe Taiwanese indigenous languages or Formosan languages are the languages of the aboriginal tribes of Taiwan. Taiwanese aborigines currently comprise about 2.3% of the island's population. However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language, after centuries of language shift. It is common for young and middle-aged Hakka and aboriginal people to speak Mandarin and Hokkien better than, or to the exclusion of, their ethnic languages. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are extinct, another five are moribund, and several others are to some degree endangered. Currently the government recognized 16 languages and 42 accents of the indigenous languages, they are\n\nThe governmental agency — Council of Indigenous Peoples — maintains the orthography of the writing systems of Formosan languages. Due to the era of Taiwan under Japanese rule, a large amount of loanwords from Japanese language also appears in Formosan languages. There is also Yilan Creole Japanese as a mixture of Japanese and Atayal.\n\nAll Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Mandarin. In recent decades the government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan mother tongue education in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing. Television station — Taiwan Indigenous Television, and radio station — \"Alian 96.3\" were created as an efforts to revive the indigenous languages. Formosan languages were made an official language in July 2017.\n\nAmis is the most widely spoken aboriginal language. The government estimates put the number of Amis people at a little over 200,000, but number of people who speak Amis as their first language like lower than 10,000. Amis has appeared in some mainstream popular music. Other significant indigenous languages includes Atayal, Paiwan, and Bunun. In addition to the recognized languages, there are around 10 to 12 groups of Taiwanese Plains Indigenous Peoples with their respective languages. Some indigenous people and languages are recognized by local governments, these include Siraya, Makatao and Taivoan. Some other language revitalization movements are going on Basay, Pazeh, Babuza-Taokas.\n\nMandarin is commonly known and officially referred to as the national language (, \"Guóyǔ\") in Taiwan. In 1945, following the end of World War II, Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. (Before 1945, Japanese was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a lingua franca among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority Taiwanese-speaking Hoklo (Hokkien), the Hakka who have their own spoken language, the aboriginals who speak aboriginal languages, as well as Mainland Chinese immigrated in 1949 whose native tongue may be any Chinese variant.\n\nPeople who emigrated from China after 1949 (12% of the population) mostly speak Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is almost universally spoken and understood. It was the only officially sanctioned medium of instruction in schools in Taiwan from late 1940s to late 1970s, following the handover of Taiwan to the government of the Republic of China in 1945, until English became a high school subject in the 1980s and local languages became a school subject in the 2000s.\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin (as with Singlish and many other situations of a creole speech community) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers. Formal occasions call for the acrolectal level of Standard Chinese of Taiwan (, \"Guóyǔ\"), which differs little from the Standard Chinese of China (, \"Pǔtōnghuà\"). Less formal situations may result in the basilect form, which has more uniquely Taiwanese features. Bilingual Taiwanese speakers may code-switch between Mandarin and Taiwanese, sometimes in the same sentence.\n\nMandarin is spoken fluently by almost the entire Taiwanese population, except for some elderly people who were educated under Japanese rule. In Taipei, where there is a high concentration of Mainland Chinese whose native language is not Taiwanese, Mandarin is used in greater frequency than in southern Taiwan and more rural areas. Many Taiwanese, particularly the younger generations, speak Mandarin better than Hakka or Hokkien.\n\nCommonly known as Taiwanese (, \"Tâi-gí\") and officially referred as Taiwanese Hokkien (, \"Tâi-oân Bân-lâm-gú\"). Taiwanese Hokkien is the most-spoken native language in Taiwan, spoken by about 70% of the population. Linguistically, it is a subgroup of Southern Min languages variety originating in southern Fujian and is spoken by many overseas Chinese throughout Southeast Asia. \n\nThere are both colloquial and literary registers of Taiwanese. Colloquial Taiwanese has roots in Old Chinese. Literary Taiwanese, which was originally developed in the 10th century in Fujian and based on Middle Chinese, was used at one time for formal writing, but is now largely extinct. Due to the era of Taiwan under Japanese rule, a large amount of loanwords from Japanese language also appears in Taiwanese. The loanwords may be read in Kanji through Taiwanese pronunciation or simply use the Japanese pronunciation. These reasons makes the modern writing Taiwanese in a mixed script of traditional Chinese characters and Latin-based systems such as pe̍h-ōe-jī or Taiwanese romanization system. \n\nRecent work by scholars such as Ekki Lu, Sakai Toru, and Lí Khîn-hoāⁿ (also known as Tavokan Khîn-hoāⁿ or Chin-An Li), based on former research by scholars such as Ông Io̍k-tek, has gone so far as to associate part of the basic vocabulary of the colloquial language with the Austronesian and Tai language families; however, such claims are not without controversy. Recently there has been a growing use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media.\n\nThe accents of Taiwanese is relatively small but still exist, the standard accent — Thong-hêng accent () is sampled from Kaohsiung city. while other accents fall into a spectrum between \n\nA great part of Taiwanese Hokkien is generally understood by other dialects of Hokkien as spoken in China and South-east Asia but has a degree of intelligibility with the Teochew variant of Southern Min spoken in Eastern Guangdong, China. It is, however, mutually unintelligible with Mandarin or other Chinese languages.\n\nHakka (, \"Hak-kâ-ngî\") is mainly spoken in Taiwan by people who have Hakka ancestry. These people are concentrated in several places throughout Taiwan. The majority of Hakka Taiwanese reside in Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli. Hakka was made an official language in December 2017. Currently the Hakka language in Taiwan is maintained by the Hakka Affairs Council. This governmental agency also runs Hakka TV and Hakka Radio stations. The government currently recognizes and maintains six Hakka dialects in Taiwan.\n\nMatsu dialect (, \"Mā-cū-huâ\") is the language spoken in Matsu islands. It is a dialect of Fuzhou dialect, Eastern Min.\n\nTraditional Chinese characters is widely used in Taiwan to write Sinitic languages including Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka. The Ministry of Education maintains standards of writing for these languages, publications including the Standard Form of National Characters and the recommended characters for Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka.\n\nWritten vernacular Chinese is the standard of written Chinese used in official documents, general literature and most aspects of everyday life, and has grammar based on Modern Standard Mandarin. Vernacular Chinese is the modern written variant of Chinese that supplanted the use of classical Chinese in literature following the New Culture Movement of the early 20th Century, which is based on the grammar of Chinese spoken in ancient times. In recent times, following the Taiwan localization movement and an increasing presence of Taiwanese literature, written Hokkien based on the vocabulary and grammar of Taiwanese Hokkien is occasionally used in literature and informal communications.\n\nTraditional Chinese characters are also used in Hong Kong, a small number of characters are written differently in Taiwan; the Standard Form of National Characters is the orthography standard used in Taiwan and administered by the Ministry of Education, and has minor variances compared with the standardised character forms used in Hong Kong. Such differences relate to orthodox and vulgar variants of Chinese characters.\n\nLatin alphabet is native to Formosan languages and partially native to Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka. With the early influences of European missionaries, writing systems such as Sinckan Manuscripts, Pe̍h-ōe-jī, and Pha̍k-fa-sṳ were based on in Latin alphabet. Currently the official Writing systems of Formosan languages is solely based on Latin and maintained by the Council of Indigenous Peoples. The Ministry of Education also maintains Latin based systems Taiwanese Romanization System for Taiwanese Hokkien, and Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System for Hakka. The textbook of Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka are written in a mixed script of Traditional Chinese characters and Latin alphabet.\n\nChinese language romanization in Taiwan tends to be highly inconsistent. Taiwan still uses the Zhuyin system and does not use the Latin alphabet as the language phonetic symbol. Traditionally Wade–Giles is used, the central government adopted Tongyong Pinyin as the official romanization in 2002 but local governments are permitted to override the standard as some have adopted Hanyu Pinyin and retained old romanizations that are commonly used. However, in August 2008 the central government announced that Hanyu Pinyin will be the only system of Romanization in Taiwan as of January 2009.\n\n\"Zhuyin Fuhao\", often abbreviated as \"Zhuyin\", or known as \"Bopomofo\" after its first four letters, is the phonetic system of Taiwan for teaching the pronunciation of Chinese characters, especially in Mandarin. Mandarin uses 37 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 consonants and 16 rimes. Taiwanese Hokkien uses 45 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 consonants and 24 rimes. There is also a system created for Hakka language. \n\nThese phonetic symbols sometimes appear as ruby characters printed next to the Chinese characters in young children's books, and in editions of classical texts (which frequently use characters that appear at very low frequency rates in newspapers and other such daily fare). In advertisements, these phonetic symbols are sometimes used to write certain particles (e.g., ㄉ instead of 的); other than this, one seldom sees these symbols used in mass media adult publications except as a pronunciation guide (or index system) in dictionary entries. Bopomofo symbols are also mapped to the ordinary Roman character keyboard (1 = \"bo\", q = \"po\", a = \"mo\", and so forth) used in one method for inputting Chinese text when using the computer.\n\nThe sole purpose for Zhuyin in elementary education is to teach standard Mandarin pronunciation to children. Grade one textbooks of all subjects (including Mandarin) are entirely in zhuyin. After that year, Chinese character texts are given in annotated form. Around grade four, presence of Zhuyin annotation is greatly reduced, remaining only in the new character section. School children learn the symbols so that they can decode pronunciations given in a Chinese dictionary, and also so that they can find how to write words for which they know only the sounds.\n\nThe Japanese language was compulsorily taught while Taiwan was under Japanese rule (1895 to 1945). Although fluency is now largely limited to the elderly, most of Taiwan's youth who look to Japan as the trend-setter of the region's youth pop culture now might know a bit of Japanese through the media, their grandparents, or classes taken from private \"cram schools\".\n\nThere are a significant immigrant and spouses in Taiwan are from South-East Asia. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 2008, the Nunn Center has been directed by Doug Boyd, Ph.D. The Center is named after former Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn.\n\nThe Nunn Center contains over 8,000 interviews featuring a variety of individuals and projects. Major projects have included the Family Farm Project, the Colonel Arthur L. Kelly Veterans Oral History Project, oral history projects on University of Kentucky history, African American history in Kentucky, Kentucky writers, Kentucky's medical history, the history of professional baseball, as well as more recent project featuring the Horse Industry in Kentucky, as well as on the Kentucky General Assembly.\n\nThe Nunn Center has aggressively undertaken efforts to digitize its collection.\n\nIn 2008, the Nunn Center launched the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS) online interface that synchronizes searchable text to audio and video. This system, designed by Nunn Center director Doug Boyd in partnership with Digital Library Services from the United Kingdom, allows users to link from their search results tom the corresponding moments in the interview. The OHMS was featured in an article in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" in July 2011.\n\nIn October 2011, the Nunn Center launched SPOKE, the online catalog containing records for each interview and project.\n\n"}

{"id": "21176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21176", "title": "Nominalism", "text": "Nominalism\n\nIn metaphysics, nominalism is a philosophical view which denies the existence of universals and abstract objects, but affirms the existence of general or abstract terms and predicates. There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals – things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects – objects that do not exist in space and time.\n\nMost nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only \"post res\", that is, subsequent to particular things. However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities – entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., pillars, snakes, bananas).\n\nNominalism is primarily a position on the problem of universals, which dates back at least to Plato, and is opposed to realist philosophies, such as Platonic realism, which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars. However, the name \"nominalism\" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus.\n\nThe term 'nominalism' stems from the Latin \"nomen\", \"name\". For example, John Stuart Mill once wrote, that \"there is nothing general except names\".\n\nIn philosophy of law, nominalism finds its application in what is called constitutional nominalism.\n\nPlato was perhaps the first writer in Western philosophy to clearly state a non-nominalist position:\n\nWhat about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself…? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? (\"Republic\" 476c)\n\nThe Platonic universals corresponding to the names \"bed\" and \"beautiful\" were the Form of the Bed and the Form of the Beautiful, or the \"Bed Itself\" and the \"Beautiful Itself\". Platonic Forms were the first universals posited as such in philosophy.\n\nOur term \"universal\" is due to the English translation of Aristotle's technical term \"katholou\" which he coined specially for the purpose of discussing the problem of universals. \"Katholou\" is a contraction of the phrase \"kata holou\", meaning \"on the whole\".\n\nAristotle famously rejected certain aspects of Plato's Theory of Forms, but he clearly rejected nominalism as well:\n\n...'Man', and indeed every general predicate, signifies not an individual, but some quality, or quantity or relation, or something of that sort. (\"Sophistical Refutations\" xxii, 178b37, trans. Pickard-Cambridge)\n\nThe first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.\n\nIn medieval philosophy, the French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism. Nominalist ideas can be found in the work of Peter Abelard and reached their flowering in William of Ockham, who was the most influential and thorough nominalist. Abelard's and Ockham's version of nominalism is sometimes called conceptualism, which presents itself as a middle way between nominalism and realism, asserting that there \"is\" something in common among like individuals, but that it is a concept in the mind, rather than a real entity existing independently of the mind. Ockham argued that only individuals existed and that universals were only mental ways of referring to sets of individuals. \"I maintain\", he wrote, \"that a universal is not something real that exists in a subject... but that it has a being only as a thought-object in the mind [objectivum in anima]\". As a general rule, Ockham argued against assuming any entities that were not necessary for explanations. Accordingly, he wrote, there is no reason to believe that there is an entity called \"humanity\" that resides inside, say, Socrates, and nothing further is explained by making this claim. This is in accord with the analytical method that has since come to be called Ockham's razor, the principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible. Critics argue that conceptualist approaches only answer the psychological question of universals. If the same concept is \"correctly\" and non-arbitrarily applied to two individuals, there must be some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept and that is just the metaphysical problem that universals were brought in to address, the starting-point of the whole problem (MacLeod & Rubenstein, 2006, §3d). If resemblances between individuals are asserted, conceptualism becomes moderate realism; if they are denied, it collapses into nominalism.\n\nIn modern philosophy, nominalism was revived by Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi.\n\nIn contemporary analytic philosophy, it has been defended by Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman, H. H. Price, and D. C. Williams.\n\nNominalism arose in reaction to the problem of universals, specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type. For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green. One wants to know by virtue of \"what\" are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and \"what\" makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green.\n\nThe Platonist answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the existence of a universal; a single abstract thing that, in this case, is a part of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green things.\n\nNominalism denies the existence of universals. The motivation for this flows from several concerns, the first one being where they might exist. Plato famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see theory of the forms). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal. But this raises the question: Where is this universal realm? One possibility is that it is outside space and time. A view sympathetic with this possibility holds that, precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are \"transcendent\" only insofar as they are \"immanent\" in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. (Nor, in this view, would there be a separate \"world\" or \"realm\" of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a \"universal realm\".) However, naturalists assert that nothing is outside of space and time. Some Neoplatonists, such as the pagan philosopher Plotinus and the Christian philosopher Augustine, imply (anticipating conceptualism) that universals are contained within the \"mind\" of God. To complicate things, what is the nature of the instantiation or exemplification relation?\n\nConceptualists hold a position intermediate between nominalism and realism, saying that universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.\n\nModerate realists hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather universals are located in space and time wherever they are manifest. Now, recall that a universal, like greenness, is supposed to be a single thing. Nominalists consider it unusual that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously. The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but this relation cannot be explained.\n\nFinally, many philosophers prefer simpler ontologies populated with only the bare minimum of types of entities, or as W. V. O. Quine said \"They have a taste for 'desert landscapes.'\" They try to express everything that they want to explain without using universals such as \"catness\" or \"greenness.\"\n\nThere are various forms of nominalism ranging from extreme to almost-realist. One extreme is predicate nominalism, which states that Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate 'is a cat' applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.\n\nProponents of resemblance nominalism believe that 'cat' applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an exemplar cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its kind, or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together. Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular, and is a resemblance relation simply in virtue of its resemblance to other resemblance relations. This generates an infinite regress, but many argue that it is not vicious.\n\nClass nominalism argues that class membership forms the metaphysical backing for property relationships: two particular red balls share a property in that they are both members of classes corresponding to their properties—that of being red and being balls. A version of class nominalism that sees some classes as \"natural classes\" is held by Anthony Quinton.\n\nConceptualism is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind's perception of them.\n\nAnother form of nominalism is trope nominalism. A trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific greenness of a shirt. One might argue that there is a primitive, objective resemblance relation that holds among like tropes. Another route is to argue that all apparent tropes are constructed out of more primitive tropes and that the most primitive tropes are the entities of complete physics. Primitive trope resemblance may thus be accounted for in terms of causal indiscernibility. Two tropes are exactly resembling if substituting one for the other would make no difference to the events in which they are taking part. Varying degrees of resemblance at the macro level can be explained by varying degrees of resemblance at the micro level, and micro-level resemblance is explained in terms of something no less robustly physical than causal power. David Armstrong, perhaps the most prominent contemporary realist, argues that such a trope-based variant of nominalism has promise, but holds that it is unable to account for the laws of nature in the way his theory of universals can.\n\nIan Hacking has also argued that much of what is called social constructionism of science in contemporary times is actually motivated by an unstated nominalist metaphysical view. For this reason, he claims, scientists and constructionists tend to \"shout past each other\".\n\nA notion that philosophy, especially ontology and the philosophy of mathematics should abstain from set theory owes much to the writings of Nelson Goodman (see especially Goodman 1940 and 1977), who argued that concrete and abstract entities having no parts, called \"individuals\" exist. Collections of individuals likewise exist, but two collections having the same individuals are the same collection. Goodman was himself drawing heavily on the work of Stanisław Leśniewski, especially his mereology, which was itself a reaction to the paradoxes associated with Cantorian set theory. Leśniewski denied the existence of the empty set and held that any singleton was identical to the individual inside it. Classes corresponding to what are held to be species or genera are concrete sums of their concrete constituting individuals. For example, the class of philosophers is nothing but the sum of all concrete, individual philosophers.\n\nThe principle of extensionality in set theory assures us that any matching pair of curly braces enclosing one or more instances of the same individuals denote the same set. Hence {\"a\", \"b\"}, {\"b\", \"a\"}, {\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\"} are all the same set. For Goodman and other nominalists, {\"a\", \"b\"} is also identical to {\"a\", {\"b\"} }, {\"b\", {\"a\", \"b\"} }, and any combination of matching curly braces and one or more instances of \"a\" and \"b\", as long as \"a\" and \"b\" are names of individuals and not of collections of individuals. Goodman, Richard Milton Martin, and Willard Quine all advocated reasoning about collectivities by means of a theory of \"virtual sets\" (see especially Quine 1969), one making possible all elementary operations on sets except that the universe of a quantified variable cannot contain any virtual sets.\n\nIn the foundation of mathematics, nominalism has come to mean doing mathematics without assuming that sets in the mathematical sense exist. In practice, this means that quantified variables may range over universes of numbers, points, primitive ordered pairs, and other abstract ontological primitives, but not over sets whose members are such individuals. To date, only a small fraction of the corpus of modern mathematics can be rederived in a nominalistic fashion.\n\nAs a category of late medieval thought, the concept of 'nominalism' has been increasingly queried. Traditionally, the fourteenth century has been regarded as the heyday of nominalism, with figures such as John Buridan and William of Ockham viewed as founding figures. However, the concept of 'nominalism' as a movement (generally contrasted with 'realism'), first emerged only in the late fourteenth century, and only gradually became widespread during the fifteenth century. The notion of two distinct ways, a \"via antiqua\", associated with realism, and a \"via moderna\", associated with nominalism, became widespread only in the later fifteenth century – a dispute which eventually dried up in the sixteenth century.\n\nAware that explicit thinking in terms of a divide between 'nominalism' and 'realism' only emerged in the fifteenth century, scholars have increasingly questioned whether a fourteenth-century school of nominalism can really be said to have existed. While one might speak of family resemblances between Ockham, Buridan, Marsilius and others, there are also striking differences. More fundamentally, Robert Pasnau has questioned whether any kind of coherent body of thought that could be called 'nominalism' can be discerned in fourteenth century writing. This makes it difficult, it has been argued, to follow the twentieth century narrative which portrayed late scholastic philosophy as a dispute which emerged in the fourteenth century between the \"via moderna\", nominalism, and the \"via antiqua\", realism, with the nominalist ideas of William of Ockham foreshadowing the eventual rejection of scholasticism in the seventeenth century.\n\nA critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished two types of nominalist reconstructions. Thus, \"hermeneutic nominalism\" is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already dispenses with mathematical objects\n(entities) such as numbers and sets. Meanwhile, \"revolutionary nominalism\" is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives dispensing with mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p. 96). A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass that dispensed with infinitesimals; the constructivist re-reconstruction of Weierstrassian analysis by Errett Bishop that dispensed with the law of excluded middle; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by Carl Boyer, Judith Grabiner, and others, of Cauchy's foundational contribution to analysis that dispensed with Cauchy's infinitesimals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "164089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164089", "title": "Politeness", "text": "Politeness\n\nPoliteness is the practical application of good manners or etiquette. It is a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in one culture can sometimes be quite rude or simply eccentric in another cultural context.\n\nWhile the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be manipulated to inflict shame on a designated party.\n\nAnthropologists Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson identified two kinds of politeness, deriving from Erving Goffman's concept of face:\n\nSome cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In this way politeness is culturally bound.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment era, a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile middle class bourgeoisie increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show emotion, the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher Lord Shaftesbury in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:\nPeriodicals, such as \"The Spectator\", founded as a daily publication by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to be a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was \"to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality...to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses\" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.\n\nThe art of polite conversation and debate was particularly cultivated in the coffeehouses of the period. Conversation was supposed to conform to a particular manner, with the language of polite and civil conversation considered to be essential to the conduct of coffeehouse debate and conversation. The concept of 'civility' referred to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest. Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as conventions, were outlined by gentleman's clubs, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including \"The Tatler\" and \"The Spectator\", infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.\n\n\nSome studies have shown that women are more likely to use politeness formulas than men, though the exact differences are not clear. Most current research has shown that gender differences in politeness use are complex, since there is a clear association between politeness norms and the stereotypical speech of middle class white women, at least in the UK and US. It is therefore unsurprising that women tend to be associated with politeness more and their linguistic behaviour judged in relation to these politeness norms.\n\nBesides and additionally to the above, many languages have specific means to show politeness, deference, respect, or a recognition of the social status of the speaker and the hearer. There are two main ways in which a given language shows politeness: in its lexicon (for example, employing certain words in formal occasions, and colloquial forms in informal contexts), and in its morphology (for example, using special verb forms for polite discourse). The T-V distinction is a common example in Western languages.\n\nBrown and Levinson's theory of politeness has been criticised as not being universally valid, by linguists working with East-Asian languages, including Japanese. Matsumoto and Ide claim that Brown and Levinson assume the speaker's volitional use of language, which allows the speaker's creative use of face-maintaining strategies toward the addressee. In East-Asian cultures like Japan, politeness is achieved not so much on the basis of volition as on discernment (\"wakimae\", finding one's place), or prescribed social norms. \"Wakimae\" is oriented towards the need for acknowledgment of the positions or roles of all the participants as well as adherence to formality norms appropriate to the particular situation.\n\nJapanese is perhaps the most widely known example of a language that encodes politeness at its very core. Japanese has two main levels of politeness, one for intimate acquaintances, family and friends, and one for other groups, and verb morphology reflects these levels. Besides that, some verbs have special hyper-polite suppletive forms. This happens also with some nouns and interrogative pronouns. Japanese also employs different personal pronouns for each person according to gender, age, rank, degree of acquaintance, and other cultural factors. See Honorific speech in Japanese, for further information.\n\n\n\n"}

It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.\n\nThe purpose of eIDAS was to create a set of standards to ensure that electronic signatures could be used in a secure manner while conducting business online or while conducting official business across borders between EU member states. The qualified electronic signature is one such standard that has been outlined under eIDAS.\n\nA qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature with a qualified digital certificate that has been created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). For an electronic signature to be considered as a qualified electronic signature, it must meet three main requirements: First, the signatory must be linked and uniquely identified to the signature. The second point is that data used to create the signature must be under the sole control of the signatory. And last it must have the ability to identify if the data that accompanies the signature has been tampered with since the signing of the message.\n\nIt is important to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a qualified certificate to an advanced electronic signature. The signature must also be created using a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). This device is responsible for qualifying digital signatures by using specific hardware and software that ensures that the signatory only has control of their private key. In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remain unique, confidential and protected from forgery.\n\nQualified electronic signatures that comply with eIDAS may be technically implemented through three specific digital signature standards XAdES, PAdES and CAdES that were developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and then need to be complemented with a qualified digital certificate through the procedures described above:\n\nThe qualified trust service provider has a crucial role in the process of qualified electronic signing. A trust service provider must receive qualified status from a supervisory governmental body that allows the entity to provide qualified trust services to be used in creating qualified electronic signatures. Regulated in eIDAS, the European Union published an EU Trust List with constitutive effect, meaning that a provider or service will only be qualified if it appears in the Trusted List.\nQualified trust service providers are required to abide by the strict guidelines outlined under the eIDAS Regulation, which include as part of the certificate creation process:\n\nUnder eIDAS, the intent of the implementation of qualified electronic signatures is to serve several purposes, such as the facilitation of business and public services processes, including those that go across borders. These processes can be safely expedited using electronic signing. Under eIDAS, EU member states have been charged with establishing \"points of single contact\" (PSCs) for trust services to ensure that electronic ID schemes may be used in cross-border public sector transactions, such as exchanging and accessing healthcare information across borders.\n\nPreviously, a signatory would sign a document or message and then return it to the intended recipient via the postal service, facsimile service, by hand or by scanning and then attaching it to an email. The issue with these methods is that they are not always secure or timely. Delays in delivery could occur, and there exists the possibility that signatures could be forged or the enclosed documents may be altered. The risk increases as multiple signatures are required from different people who may be located in different locations. These problems are alleviated by using qualified electronic signatures, which save time, are legally binding, and provide a higher level of technical security.\n\nThe increased transparency in the electronic signing and transaction process and the enhanced interoperability are expected to spur innovation in the European internal market.\n\neIDAS requires that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures. The qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high. All EU member states are required to recognize a qualified electronic signature as valid, as long as it has been created with a qualified certificate that has been issued by another member state.\n\nUnder eIDAS Regulation, Article 27, \"Electronic signatures in public services\", member states are prohibited from requesting signatures of a higher level than qualified electronic signature. Article 25 (2) of eIDAS allows a qualified electronic signature to carry the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.\n\n"}

He joined government service and served variously as Income Tax Assessor, Deputy Collector and Deputy Magistrate.\n\nBandyopadhyay's first, and perhaps most important, literary achievement is \"Padmini Upakhyan\" (1858), a historical romance of Rajput Rani Padmini based on Todd's Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan. His important poetical works include \"Karmadevi\" (1862), \"Shurasundari\" (1868) and \"Kanchi Kaveri\" (1879). In 1872 he rendered Kalidas's \"Ritusanghar\" and \"Kumarsambhav\" into verse. His Nitikusumanjali is another poetical translation of Sanskrit poems. His Kalikata Kalpalata is considered to be the first historical work about Kolkata. In 1882 he edited and published Mukundaram's Kavikankan Chandi. The other important books of this poem, which are varied in various fields of Bengali literature, are:\n"}
{"id": "1324735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1324735", "title": "Subvocalization", "text": "Subvocalization\n\nSubvocalization, or silent speech, is the internal speech typically made when reading; it provides the sound of the word as it is read. This is a natural process when reading, and it helps the mind to access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read, potentially reducing cognitive load. This inner speech is characterized by minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles involved in the articulation of speech. Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by the person who is reading. It is one of the components of Baddeley and Hitch's phonological loop proposal which accounts for the storage of these types of information into short-term memory. \n\nSubvocalization has been considered as far back as 1868. Only in 1899 did an experiment take place to record movement of the larynx through silent reading by a researcher named Curtis, who concluded that silent reading was the only mental activity that created considerable movement of the larynx.\nIn 1950 Edfelt reached a breakthrough when he created an electrically powered instrument that can record movement. He concluded that newer techniques are needed to accurately record information and that efforts should be made to understand this phenomenon instead of eliminating it. After failed attempts trying to reduce silent speech in study participants, in 1952, it came to the conclusion that silent speech is a developmental activity which reinforces learning and should not be disrupted during development. In 1960, Edfelt seconded this opinion.\n\nSubvocalization is commonly studied using electromyography (EMG) recordings, concurrent speaking tasks, shadowing, and other techniques. \n\nEMG can be used to show the degree to which one is subvocalizing or to train subvocalization suppression. EMG is used to record the electrical activity produced by the articulatory muscles involved in subvocalization. Greater electrical activity suggests a stronger use of subvocalization. In the case of suppression training, the trainee is shown their own EMG recordings while attempting to decrease the movement of the articulatory muscles. The EMG recordings allows one to monitor and ideally reduce subvocalization.\n\nIn concurrent speaking tasks, participants of a study are asked to complete an activity specific to the experiment while simultaneously repeating an irrelevant word. For example, one may be asked to read a paragraph while reciting the word \"cola\" over and over again. Speaking the repeated irrelevant word is thought to preoccupy the articulators used in subvocalization. Subvocalization, therefore, cannot be used in the mental processing of the activity being studied. Participants who had undergone the concurrent speaking task are often compared to other participants of the study who had completed the same activity without subvocalization interference. If performance on the activity is significantly less for those in the concurrent speaking task group than for those in the non-interference group, subvocalization is believed to play a role in the mental processing of that activity. The participants in the non-interference comparison group usually also complete a different, yet equally distracting task that does not involve the articulator muscles (i.e. tapping). This ensures that the difference in performance between the two groups is in fact due to subvocalization disturbances and not due to things such as task difficulty or a divide in attention. \n\nShadowing is conceptually similar to concurrent speaking tasks. Instead of repeating an irrelevant word, shadowing requires participants to listen to a list of words and to repeat those words as fast as possible while completing a separate task being studied by experimenters. \n\nTechniques for subvocalization interference other may also include counting, chewing or locking one's jaw while placing the tongue on the roof of one's mouth.\n\nSubvocal recognition involves monitoring actual movements of the tongue and vocal cords that can be interpreted by electromagnetic sensors. Through the use of electrodes and nanocircuitry, synthetic telepathy could be achieved allowing people to communicate silently.\n\nThe exploration into the evolutionary background of subvocalization is currently very limited. The little known is predominantly about language acquisition and memory. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the development of subvocalization is related to modular aspects of the brain. There has been a great amount of exploration on the evolutionary basis of universal grammar. The idea is that although the specific language one initially learns is dependent on one's culture, all languages are learned through the activation of universal \"language modules\" that are present in each of us. This concept of a modular mind is a prevalent idea that will help explore memory and its relation to language more clearly, and possibly illuminate the evolutionary basis of subvocalization. Evidence for the mind having modules for superior function is the example that hours may be spent toiling over a car engine in an attempt to flexibly formulate a solution, but, in contrast, extremely long and complex sentences can be comprehended, understood, related and responded to in seconds. The specific inquiry into subvocalization may be minimal right now but there is a lot to investigate in regard to the modular mind.\n\nThe brain mechanics of subvocalization are still not well understood. It is safe to say that more than one part of the brain is used, and that no single test can reveal all the relevant processes. Studies often use event-related potentials; brief changes in an EEG (electroencephalography) to show brain activation, or fMRIs.\n\nSubvocalization is related to inner speech; when we use inner speech there is bilateral activation in predominantly the left frontal lobe. This activation could suggest that the frontal lobes may be involved in motor planning for speech output.\n\nSubvocal rehearsal is controlled by top-down processing; conceptually driven, it relies on information already in memory. There is evidence for significant left hemisphere activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri and inferior parietal gyrus during subvocal rehearsal. Broca's area has also been found to have activation in other studies exploring subvocal rehearsal.\n\nSilent speech-reading and silent counting are also examined when experimenters look at subvocalization. These tasks show activation in the frontal cortices, hippocampus and the thalamus for silent counting. Silent-reading activates similar areas of the auditory cortex that are involved in listening.\nFinally, the phonological loop; proposed by Baddeley and Hitch as “being responsible for temporary storage of speech-like information” is an active subvocal rehearsal mechanism, activation originating mostly in the left hemispheric speech areas: Broca's, lateral and medial premotor cortices and the cerebellum.\n\nThe ability to store verbal material in working memory, and the storage of verbal material in short-term memory relies on a phonological loop. This loop, proposed by Baddeley and Hitch, represents a system that is composed of a short-term store in which memory is represented phonologically, and a rehearsal process. This rehearsal preserves and refreshes the material by re-enacting it and re-presenting it to short-term storage, and subvocalization is a major component of this rehearsal. The phonological loop system features an interaction between subvocal rehearsal and specific storage for phonological material. The phonological loop contributes to the study of the role of subvocalization and the inner voice in auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological loop interact in a non-dependent manner demonstrated by their differential requirements on different tasks. The role of subvocalization within the workings of memory processes is heavily reliant on its involvement with Baddeley's proposed phonological loop.\n\nThere have been findings that support a role of subvocalization in the mechanisms underlying working memory and the holding of information in an accessible and malleable state. Some forms of internal speech-like processing may function as a holding mechanism in immediate memory tasks. The working memory span is a behavioural measure of “exceptional consistency” and is a positive function of the rate of subvocalization. Experimental data has shown that this span size increases as the rate of subvocalization increases, and the time needed to subvocalize the number of items comprising a span is generally constant. fMRI data suggests that a sequence of five letters approaches the individual capacity for immediate recall that relies on subvocal rehearsal alone.\n\nThe role of subvocal rehearsal is also seen in short-term memory. Research has confirmed that this form of rehearsal benefits some cognitive functioning. Subvocal movements that occur when people listen to or rehearse a series of speech sounds will help the subject to maintain the phonemic representation of these sounds in their short-term memory, and this finding is supported by the fact that interfering with the overt production of speech sound did not disrupt the encoding of the sound's features in short term memory. This suggests a strong role played by subvocalization in the encoding of speech sounds into short-term memory. It has also been found that language differences in short-term memory performance in bilingual people is mediated, but not exclusively, by subvocal rehearsal.\n\nThe production of acoustic errors in short-term memory is also thought to be, in part, due to subvocalization. Individuals who stutter and therefore have a slower rate of subvocal articulation also demonstrate a short-term reproduction of serial material that is slower as compared to people who do not stutter.\n\nSubvocalization plays a large role in memory encoding. Subvocalization appears to facilitate the translating of visual linguistic information into acoustic information and vice versa. For example, subvocalization occurs when one sees a word and is asked to say it (see-say condition), or when one hears a word and is asked to write it (hear-write condition), but not when one is asked to see a word and then write it (see-write condition) or hear and word and then say it (hear-say condition). The see-say condition converts visual information into acoustic information. The hear-write condition converts acoustic information into visual information. The see-write and hear-say conditions, however, remain in the same sensory domain and do not require translation into a different type of code.\n\nThis is also supported by findings that suggest that subvocalization is not required for the encoding of speech, as words being heard are already in acoustic form and therefore enter short term memory directly without use of subvocal articulation. Furthermore, subvocalization interference impedes reading comprehension but not listening comprehension.\n\nSubvocalization's role in reading comprehension can be viewed as a function of task complexity. Subvocalization is involved minimally or not at all in immediate comprehension. For example, subvocalization is not used in the making of homophone judgements (are heir and air homophones?) but is used more for the comprehension of sentences and even more still for the comprehension of paragraphs. Subvocalization, which translates visual reading information into a more durable and flexible acoustic code is thought to allow for the integration of past concepts with those currently being processed.\n\nAdvocates of speed reading generally claim that subvocalization places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus, slowing the reading down. Speedreading courses often prescribe lengthy practices to eliminate subvocalizing when reading. Normal reading instructors often simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the lips, jaw, or throat.\n\nFurthermore, fMRI studies comparing fast and slow readers (during a reading task) indicate that between the two groups there are significant differences in the brain areas being activated. In particular, it was found that rapid readers show lower activation in the brain regions associated with speech, which indicates that the higher speeds were attained, in part, by the reduction in subvocalization.\n\nAt the slower rates (memorizing, learning, and reading for comprehension), subvocalizing by the reader is very detectable. At the faster rates of reading (skimming and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable. For competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.\n\nTypically, subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word. Micro-muscle tests suggest that full and permanent elimination of subvocalizing is impossible. This may originate in the way people learn to read by associating the sight of words with their spoken sounds. Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the nervous system—even of deaf people, since they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound or a sign in a particular sign language.\n\nAt the slower reading rates (100–300 words per minute), subvocalizing may improve comprehension. Subvocalizing or actual vocalizing can indeed be of great help when one wants to learn a passage verbatim. This is because the person is repeating the information in an auditory way, as well as seeing the piece on the paper.\n\nThe definition of auditory imagery is analogous to definitions used in other modalities of imagery (such as visual, auditory and olfactory imagery) in that it is, according to Intons-Peterson (1992), “the introspective persistence of an auditory experience, including one constructed from components drawn from long-term memory, in the absence of direct sensory instigation of that experience.”. Auditory imagery is often but not necessarily influenced by subvocalization, and has ties to the rehearsal process of working memory. The conception of working memory relies on a relationship between the \"inner ear\" and the \"inner voice\" (subvocalization), and this memory system is posited to be at the basis of auditory imagery. Subvocalization and the phonological store work in partnership in many auditory imagery tasks.\n\nThe extent to which an auditory image can influence detection, encoding and recall of a stimulus through its relationships to perception and memory has been documented. It has been suggested that auditory imagery may slow the decay of memory for pitch, as demonstrated by T. A. Keller, Cowan, and Saults (1995) who demonstrated that the prevention of rehearsal resulted in decreased memory performance for pitch comparison tasks through the introduction of distracting and competing stimuli. It has also been reported that auditory imagery for verbal material is impaired when subvocalization is blocked. These findings suggest that subvocalization is common to both auditory imagery and rehearsal.\n\nIn objection to a subvocalization mechanism basis for auditory imagery is in the fact that a significant amount of auditory imagery does not involve speech or stimuli similar to speech, such as music and environmental sounds.\nHowever, to combat this point, it has been suggested that rehearsal of non-speech sounds can indeed be carried out by the phonological mechanisms previously mentioned, even if the creation of nonspeech sounds within this mechanism isn't possible.\n\nThere are two general types of individuals when it comes to subvocalization. There are Low-Vocalizers and High-Vocalizers. Using electromyography to record the muscle action potential of the larynx (i.e. muscle movement of the larynx), an individual is categorized under a high or low vocalizer depending on how much muscle movement the muscles in the larynx undergo during silent reading.\n\nOften in both high and low vocalizers, the rate of speech is constantly regulated depending on intensity/volume of words (said to be affected by long delays between readings) and increasing the delay of speech and hearing ones' voice is an effect called “delayed auditory feedback”. Increasing the voice intensity while reading was found to be higher in low-vocalizers than high-vocalizers. It is believed that because high-vocalizers have greater muscle movement of the larynx during silent reading, low-vocalizers read louder to compensate for this lack of movement so they can understand the material. When individuals undergo “feedback training”, where they are conscious of these muscle movements, this difference diminishes.\n\nArticulation during silent speech is important, though speech is not solely dependent on articulation alone. Impairing articulation can reduce sensory input from the muscle movements of the larynx to the brain to understand information being read and it also impaires on-going speech production during reading to direct thinking. Words that are of high similarity minimizes articulation causing interference and may reduce subvocal rehearsal. As articulation of similar words is effecting subvocalization, there is an increase in acoustic errors for short term memory and recall.\n\nImpairing or suppressing articulation causes a greater impact on performance. An example of articulation suppression is repeating the same word over many times such as ' \"the\" ' and attempting to memorise other words into short term memory. Even though primary cues may be given for these words in attempt to retrieve them, words will either be recalled for the incorrect cue or will not be recalled at all \n\nSchizophrenics known to experience auditory hallucinations could show the result of over-activation of the muscles in the larynx. Using an electromyography to record muscle movement, individuals experiencing hallucinations showed greater muscle activation before these hallucinations occurred. Unfortunately, this muscle activation is not easily detected which means the muscle movement must be measured on a wider range.\nThough a wider range is needed to detect the muscle movement, it is still considered as subvocalization. Much more research is needed to link subvocalization with hallucination but many schizophrenics report \"hearing voices\" (as hallucinations) coming from their throat. This small fact could be a clue to finding if there is a true link between subvocalization and hallucinations, but it is very difficult to see this connection because not many patients experience hallucinations.\n\n"}

It was the second book produced by the two in an effort to raise awareness of issues concerning gender in the English language.\n\nThe first section of the handbook is entitled \"\"Man\" as a False Generic.\" False generics are defined as \"terms used of a class or group that are not applicable to all its members.\" A brief history of the subject describes the origin of 'man' to mean \"person\" or \"human being,\" but observes that this broad definition of 'man' was becoming questionable in the 1980s. \"Because gender in modern English corresponds to sex or its absence, native speakers of the language increasingly sense the same contradiction in calling women 'men' that they would feel in calling girls 'boys' or daughters 'sons.'\"\n\nThey give the following as an example for where the generic use of 'man' is not applicable:\n\"One author, ostensibly generalizing about all human beings, wrote:\n'As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth...'\nIf \"man\" and \"he\" were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been \"he has difficulties in childbirth.\"\n\nSwift and Miller offer a list of substitute titles for words including man such as 'salesman' or 'fisherman.' They also suggest using synonyms for words that refer to gender, such as 'man the station,' and so on.\n\nThis section goes into detail about the history and problems that arise from using male pronouns as generic pronouns (i.e. \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his\"). They offer this section from a \"New York Times\" response to an article in support of gendered pronouns to be used generically:\n\n\"Knowing that \"he\" and \"his\" can be gender neutral, I shall no longer feel there is an odd image filtering through something like: 'The average American needs the small routines of getting ready for work. As he shaves or blow-dries his hair or pulls on his panty hose, he is easing himself by small stages into the demands of the day.'...How liberating common sense can be.\"\n\nAs a solution to this issue of pronouns, Swift and Miller suggest using 'they' in place of a gendered pronoun, or specifically stating \"he or she/his or hers\" as a substitute for just the male pronoun.\n\nThe 'Generalizations' section describes the reverse of the 'Pronoun Problem' - it is when gender neutral terms are assumed to be gender specific. Often, the gender assumed is male. This section also describes problems with the use of female-gendered words in ways that are condescending, but may not be intentional. As an example, they offer this statement about a fictional television show: \n\"Powerful lady attorney and confident young lawyer team up to defend a wealthy contractor accused of murder.\"\n\nUsing \"lady\" in this way implies that the 'confident young lawyer' and the 'wealthy contractor' are both male, and also suggests that a woman needs to be explicitly described as powerful. They go on to urge that qualifiers not be used with just women, and instead suggest that the above statement read:\n\n\"Powerful attorney and her young male colleague team up to defend a wealthy businessman accused of murder.\"\n\nThe \"Handbook\" includes suggestions on how to avoid sexist language. The recurring theme is using inclusive language that is not gender biased. Miller and Swift offer a historical account of how language norms have developed in the English language, and then suggest alternatives that do not make gender assumptions.\n\n\"A Few More Words\" is a chapter that includes in depth case studies on specific words such as \"Feminist,\" \"Hero/Heroine,\" and \"Midwife.\" These sections offer a detailed history of specific words and phrases, and put them in gendered context.\n\nThe \"Handbook\" also contains a brief thesaurus of terms to use in place of terms that are not gender neutral. Examples include 'married woman' instead of 'matron' and 'person/individual' instead of 'man' when meant to mean \"person.\"\n\nCasey Miller and Kate Swift have been advocating for gender-inclusive language since the early 1970s, when they wrote the essay, \"Desexing the English Language.\" Their intent in \"The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing\" was \"to give people the background, to make them aware of what was happening right underneath their noses...we didn’t want to tell people, Do This or Don’t Do That!” Due in large part to their work on the topic, by 1980 when \"The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing\" was written the movement supporting non-sexist language was gaining traction.\n\nNearly 20 years after its publication, the \"Handbook\" was still considered the standard reference book on how to avoid degrading women with words. It is used as an example of unbiased review on the topic of gendered and sexist language.\n\n"}

Perceptual psychologist Karl Zener (1903–1964) designed the cards in the early 1930s for experiments conducted with his colleague, parapsychologist J. B. Rhine (1895–1980). The original series of experiments have been discredited and replication has proved elusive.\n\nThe Zener cards are a deck of twenty five cards, five of each symbol. The five symbols are: a hollow circle, a plus sign, three vertical wavy lines, a hollow square, and a hollow five-pointed star. They are used to test for ESP.\n\nIn a test for ESP, the experimenter picks up a card in a shuffled pack, observes the symbol, and records the answer of the person being tested, who would guess which of the five designs is on the card. The experimenter continues until all the cards in the pack are tested.\n\nPoor shuffling methods can make the order of cards in the deck easier to predict and the cards could have been inadvertently or intentionally marked and manipulated. In his experiments, J. B. Rhine first shuffled the cards by hand but later decided to use a machine for shuffling.\n\nIn his book, \"The New Apocrypha\", John Sladek expressed incredulity at the tests stating, \"It's astonishing that playing cards should have been chosen for ESP research at all. They are, after all, the instrument of stage magicians and second-dealing gamblers; they can be marked and manipulated in many traditional ways. At the best of times, card-shuffling is a poor way of getting a random distribution of symbols.\"\n\nRhine's experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to sensory leakage or cheating. Such as the subject being able to read the symbols from slight indentations on the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to not facial expressions and breathing patterns.\n\nTerence Hines has written of the original experiments:\n\nThe methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent’s glasses. Even if the agent isn’t wearing glasses it is possible to see the reflection in his cornea.\n\nOnce Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.\n\nJames Alcock notes that, \"Despite Rhine’s confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine’s work.\"\n\nThe chemist Irving Langmuir called Rhine's experiments an example of \"pathological science\" - the science of things that aren't so - and criticized its practitioners not as dishonest people but as ones that have sufficiently fooled themselves.\n\nDuring James Randi's TV special \"Exploring Psychic Powers Live!\" a psychic was tested on a deck of 250 Zener cards and was only able to predict 50 of them correctly, which is the expected result of random guessing the cards.\n\nIn 2016 Massimo Polidoro tested an Italian mother and daughter that were claiming a 90% and above success rate of psychic transmission using Zener cards. Upon restricting them from seeing each other's faces and to the use of a silent writing method their success rate dropped to no better than chance. The women were cognizant of the fact that they required visual contact to achieve transmission of the symbols saying, \"This kind of understanding is so natural to us, all this attention to us is also very surprising. There are no tricks, but surely we understand each other with looks. It always happens.\"\n\nThe results of many tests using Zener cards fit with a typical normal distribution.\n\nProbability predicts these test results for a test of 25 questions with five possible answers if chance is operating:\n\nMost people (79%) will get between 3 and 7 correct (probability is a more precise calculation).\n\nThe probability of guessing 8 or more correctly is 10.9% (in a group of 25, you can expect several scores in this range by chance).\n\nThe chances of getting 15 correct is about 1 in 90,000.\n\nGuessing 20 out of 25 has a probability of about 1 in 5 billion.\n\nGuessing all 25 correct has a chance of (.2) = 3.3 x 10, or about 1 in 300 quadrillion.\n\nRather than applying Ockham's razor and accepting the null hypothesis for non-results parapsychology has invented many \"post-hoc\" constructions to explain away failure, for example:\n\n"}
