It is called \"annobonense\" or \"annobonés\" in Spanish.\n\nThe attitude in the country towards this language is positive. It is taught in special courses in the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo.\n\nThe creole language was spoken originally by the descendants of intermixing between Portuguese men and African women slaves imported from other places, especially from São Tomé and Angola, and therefore descends from Portuguese and Forro, the creole of the freed slaves of São Tomé. The government of Equatorial Guinea financed an Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa (IILP) sociolinguistic study in Annobón, which noticed strong links with the Portuguese creole populations in São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAnnobonese is analogous to Forro. In fact, it may be derived from Forro as it shares the same structure and 82% of its lexicon. After Annobón passed to Spain, the language incorporated some words of Spanish origin (10% of its lexicon), but it is often difficult to say from which language the word derive, given the similarity between Spanish and Portuguese. Today, the Spanish language is the official language of the island, although it is not much spoken and the Portuguese creole has vigorous use in the island and in the capital Malabo and with some speakers in Equatorial Guinea's mainland. Noncreolized Portuguese is used as liturgical language. Portuguese has been declared an official language in Equatorial Guinea, but so far is rarely used in Bioko and Rio Muñi.\n"}

Freud himself wrote of \"interest (Besetzung)\", in an early letter to Ernest Jones.\n\nPeter Gay objected that Strachey's use of cathexis was an unnecessarily esoteric replacement for Freud's use of \"Besetzung\" – \"a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of electricity)\".\n\nFreud defined cathexis as an investment of libido, pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of affect. A cathexis or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a cathexis of mortido. Freud called a group of cathected ideas a complex.\n\nFreud frequently described the functioning of psychosexual energies in quasi-physical terms, representing frustration of libidinal desires, for example, as a blockage of (cathected) energies which would eventually build up and require release in alternative ways. This release could occur, for example, by way of regression and the \"re-cathecting\" of former positions or fixations, or the autoerotic enjoyment (in phantasy) of former sexual objects: \"object-cathexes\".\n\nFreud used the term \"anti-cathexis\" or counter-charge to describe how the ego blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to repress such desires. Like a steam engine, the libido's cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, which can lead to sublimation, reaction formation, or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.\n\nM. Scott Peck distinguishes between love and cathexis, with cathexis being the initial in-love phase of a relationship, and love being the ongoing commitment of care.\n\nFreud saw the early cathexis of objects with libidinal energy as a central aspect of human development. In describing the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the foundation of object relations theory.\n\nFreud saw thinking as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of cathexis, “in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map”.\n\nIn delusions, it was the hypercathexis (or over-charging) of ideas previously dismissed as odd or eccentric which he saw as causing the subsequent pathology.\n\nEric Berne raised the possibility that child art often represented the intensity of cathexis invested in an object, rather than its objective form.\n\nCritics charge that the term provides a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the cathexis of ideas but certainly not of objects.\n\nFurther ambiguity in Freud's usage emerges in the contrast between cathexis as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect – as in a \"cathexis of longing\".\n\n"}

When defining a concept using diairesis, one starts with a broad concept, then divides this into two or more specific sub-concepts, and this procedure is repeated until a definition of the desired concept is reached. Apart from this definition, the procedure also results in a taxonomy of other concepts, ordered according to a general–specific relation.\n\nThe founder of diairesis as a method was Plato. Later ancient logicians (including Aristotle) and practitioners of other ancient sciences have employed diairetic modes of classification, e.g., to classify plants in ancient biology. Although classification is still an important part of science, diairesis has been abandoned and is now of historical interest only.\n\nDiairesis is Plato's later method of definition based on division, developed in the Platonic dialogues \"Phaedrus\", \"Sophist\", \"Statesman\", and \"Philebus\". Further applications are found in the \"Laws\" and \"Timaeus\". It is a means of attempting to reach a definition by which a collection of candidates is repeatedly divided into two parts with one part eliminated until a suitable definition is discovered.\n\nA complementary term is \"merismos\" (cf. English merism: parsing or the distinguishing of parts, as opposed to \"diairesis\", which is the division of a genus into its parts).\n\nFor example, in the \"Sophist\" (§235B), the Eleatic Stranger is examining illusions, which consist of words and \"visual objects.\" By using \"diairesis\", he divides visual objects, by which it becomes clear he means works of art, into two categories: \"eikastikē technē\", the art of making likenesses or \"eikones\"; and \"phantastikē technē\", the art of creating illusionary appearances. The Stranger is much more fond of the former; the latter are only created to produce an appearance of beauty.\n\nOpinions about possible forerunners of Platonic \"diairesis\" are varying; they even reach back until Homer. Also an adoption from the fields of mathematics has been considered, like one from musicology, one from pre-scientific and everyday divisions and one from medicine. About forerunners in the field of philosophy there are as well different opinions. Under consideration are Prodicus of Ceos, Democritus, Leucippus, and the sophists. It was even suggested that Plato says that he himself found the new method, which shows that it is possible that Plato had no forerunners at all.\n\nThe platonic method of division is found to be applicated at the first steps of classifying biology, namely in the zoology of Aristotle and in the botany of Theophrastus. Diairesis is central to Galen's therapeutics; see for example 'Therapeutics to Glaucon' 1 (XI, 4 K), where Galen, attributing the method to Plato, asserts that 'the errors of the [medical] sects and whatever mistakes the majority of physicians make in the care of the sick have incompetent division as their principal and major cause' (tr. Dickson.) Philosophically relevant methodical divisions or statements about the method of \"diairesis\" can be found at exponents of the Platonic Academy (especially Speusippus and Xenocrates), exponents of the Peripatetic school (especially Aristotle, Aristoxenus, Theophrastus), at the Stoicism (especially Chrysippus), at the Middle Platonism (especially Alcinous, Maximus of Tyre, Philo) and at the Neoplatonism (especially Plotinus, Porphyry). In medieval times the so-called method of \"divisio\" was a common method.\n\n"}

Authors of another study conclude that \"the OA advantage is a quality advantage, rather than a quality bias\", that authors make a \"self-selection toward using and citing the more citable articles—once OA self-archiving has made them accessible\", and that open access \"itself will not make an unusable (hence uncitable) paper more used and cited\".\n\nThe related no abstract available bias is a scholar's tendency to cite journal articles that have an abstract available online more readily than articles that do not— this affects articles' citation count similarly to FUTON bias.\n\n"}

{"id": "70603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70603", "title": "Hermeneutics", "text": "Hermeneutics\n\nHermeneutics () is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts.\n\nModern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.\n\nHermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or exegesis, of scripture, and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation. The terms \"hermeneutics\" and \"exegesis\" are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and non-verbal communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.\n\nHermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, double hermeneutic).\n\n\"Hermeneutics\" is derived from the Greek word (\"hermēneuō\", \"translate, interpret\"), from (\"hermeneus\", \"translator, interpreter\"), of uncertain etymology (R. S. P. Beekes (2009) suggests a Pre-Greek origin). The technical term (\"hermeneia\", \"interpretation, explanation\") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of Aristotle's work (\"Peri Hermeneias\"), commonly referred to by its Latin title \"De Interpretatione\" and translated in English as \"On Interpretation\". It is one of the earliest (c. 360 ) extant philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.\n\nThe early usage of \"hermeneutics\" places it within the boundaries of the sacred. A divine message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.\n\nFolk etymology places its origin with Hermes, the mythological Greek deity who was the 'messenger of the gods'. Besides being a mediator between the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the underworld upon death.\n\nHermes was also considered to be the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief and a trickster. These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way. The Greek view of language as consisting of signs that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.\n\nSummaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, Hillel the Elder, although the thirteen principles set forth in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., \"a fortiori\" argument [known in Hebrew as קל וחומר —  \"kal v'chomer\"]) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears (Gezerah Shavah). The rabbis did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.\n\nTraditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the Tanakh (the Jewish bibilical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found secret or mystical levels of understanding.\n\nVedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the Vedas, the earliest holy texts of Hinduism. The Mimamsa was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what Dharma (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.\n\nThe foundational text is the Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by Śabara (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.\n\nBuddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast Buddhist literature, particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the Buddha (Buddhavacana) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract skillful means of reaching spiritual enlightenment or nirvana. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.\n\nBiblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.\n\nThe early patristic traditions of biblical exegesis had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.\n\nAugustine offers hermeneutics and homiletics in his \"De doctrina christiana\". He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine’s hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the Platonism of his time, he corrects and recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.\n\nThere are traditionally fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means “a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the ‘plain meaning’ expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.” The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.\n\nMoral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.\n\nAllegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as typological, where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as “types” (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah’s Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a “type” of the Christian church that God designed from the start.\n\nThis type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It purports to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the Jewish Kabbalah, which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of Hebrew words and letters.\n\nIn Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval Zohar. In Christianity, it can be seen in Mariology.\n\nThe discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new humanist education of the 15th century as a historical and critical methodology for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla proved in 1440 that the \"Donation of Constantine\" was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.\n\nHowever, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the Protestant Reformation brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. Martin Luther and John Calvin emphasized \"scriptura sui ipsius interpres\" (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used \"brevitas et facilitas\" as an aspect of theological hermeneutics.\n\nThe rationalist Enlightenment led hermeneutists, especially Protestant exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.\n\nThe interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.\n\nDuring Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.\n\n19th- and 20th-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (\"Verstehen\") through the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher (Romantic hermeneutics and methodological hermeneutics), August Böckh (methodological hermeneutics), Wilhelm Dilthey (epistemological hermeneutics), Martin Heidegger (ontological hermeneutics, hermeneutic phenomenology, and transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology), Hans-Georg Gadamer (ontological hermeneutics), Leo Strauss (Straussian hermeneutics), Paul Ricœur (hermeneutic phenomenology), Walter Benjamin (Marxist hermeneutics), Ernst Bloch (Marxist hermeneutics), Jacques Derrida (radical hermeneutics, namely deconstruction), Richard Kearney (diacritical hermeneutics), Fredric Jameson (Marxist hermeneutics), and John Thompson (critical hermeneutics).\n\nRegarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of analytic philosophy, there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger’s philosophy of science, an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning realism and anti-realism: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's hermeneutic idealism (the thesis that meaning determines reference or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities) and for Heidegger's hermeneutic realism (the thesis that (a) there is a nature in itself and science can give us an explanation of how that nature works, and (b) that (a) is compatible with the ontological implications of our everyday practices). \n\nPhilosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include Georg Henrik von Wright and Peter Winch. Roy J. Howard termed this approach analytic hermeneutics.\n\nOther contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include Charles Taylor (engaged hermeneutics) and Dagfinn Føllesdal. \n\nWilhelm Dilthey broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, \"The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life\" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on empathy. Empathy involves a direct identification with the Other. Interpretation involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.\n\nDilthey divided sciences of the mind (human sciences) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Martin Heidegger's philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to existential understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct — and thus more authentic — way of being-in-the-world (\"In-der-Welt-sein\") than merely as \"a way of knowing.\" For example, he called for a \"special hermeneutic of empathy\" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of \"other minds\" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)\n\nAdvocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same scientific methods that are used in the natural sciences, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of antipositivism. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the social context in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.\n\nThe reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the hermeneutic circle. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the sociologist Max Weber.\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.\n\nGadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not \"per se\" without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.\n\nBernard Lonergan's (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the postmodern hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist Frederick G. Lawrence.\n\nPaul Ricœur (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.\n\nKarl-Otto Apel (b. 1922) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American semiotics. He applied his model to discourse ethics with political motivations akin to those of critical theory.\n\nJürgen Habermas (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized Marxism and previous members of the Frankfurt School for missing the hermeneutical dimension of critical theory.\n\nHabermas incorporated the notion of the lifeworld and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.\n\nAndrés Ortiz-Osés (b. 1943) has developed his symbolic hermeneutics as the Mediterranean response to Northern European hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that meaning is a symbolic healing of injury.\n\nTwo other important hermeneutic scholars are Jean Grondin (b. 1955) and Maurizio Ferraris (b. 1956).\n\nMauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of analogic hermeneutics, which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the history of thought.\n\nTwo scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist Emilio Betti and the American literary theorist E. D. Hirsch.\n\nNew hermeneutic is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through existentialism. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life. This is called the event of language. Ernst Fuchs, Gerhard Ebeling, and James M. Robinson are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.\n\nThe method of Marxist hermeneutics has been developed by the work of, primarily, Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study \"Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels\" (\"Trauerspiel\" literally means \"mourning play\" but is often translated as \"tragic drama\"). Fredric Jameson draws on Biblical hermeneutics, Ernst Bloch, and the work of Northrop Frye, to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential \"The Political Unconscious\". Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled \"On Interpretation\" Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the Mode of Production, and eventually, history.\n\nKarl Popper first used the term \"objective hermeneutics\" in his \"Objective Knowledge\" (1972).\n\nIn 1992, the Association for Objective Hermeneutics (AGOH) was founded in Frankfurt am Main by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.\n\nIn one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:\n\nIn archaeology, hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and social uses.\n\nProponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in stone tools, where descriptions such as \"scraper\" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of microwear analysis some thirty years ago.\n\nOpponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too relativist and that their own interpretations are based on common-sense evaluation.\n\nThere are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer, such as Christian Norberg-Schulz, and Nader El-Bizri in the circles of phenomenology. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians). Dalibor Vesely situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture. This tradition fits within a critique of the Enlightenment and has also informed design-studio teaching. Adrian Snodgrass sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness. He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation. Along with Richard Coyne, he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.\n\nEnvironmental hermeneutics applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including \"nature\" and \"wilderness\" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.\n\nInsofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both critical theory and constitutive theory (both of which have made important inroads into the postpositivist branch of international relations theory and political science), it has been applied to international relations.\n\nSteve Smith refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding a foundationalist yet postpositivist theory of international relations.\n\nRadical postmodernism is an example of a postpositivist yet anti-foundationalist paradigm of international relations.\n\nSome scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to legal theory since at least the 11th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance, the schools of \"glossatores\", \"commentatores\", and \"usus modernus\" distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of \"laws\" (mainly Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis). The University of Bologna gave birth to a \"legal Renaissance\" in the 11th century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as Irnerius and Johannes Gratian. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by Thomas Aquinas and Alberico Gentili.\n\nSince then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Emilio Betti, among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. Legal interpretivism, most famously Ronald Dworkin's, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.\n\nItalian philosopher Gianni Vattimo and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book \"Hermeneutic Communism\", when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, \"A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history).\"\n\nVattimo and Zabala also stated that they view interpretation as anarchy and affirmed that \"existence is interpretation\" and that \"hermeneutics is weak thought.\"\n\nPsychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since Sigmund Freud first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" 'makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[\"i.e.\"] \"interpreting\" a dream implies assigning a \"meaning\" to it.'\n\nThe French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's hermeneutical phenomenology.\n\nPsychologists and computer scientists have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to cognitivism.\n\nHubert Dreyfus's critique of conventional artificial intelligence has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger (cf. Embodied cognition) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (cf. Discursive psychology).\n\nHermeneutics is also influential in humanistic psychology.\n\nThe understanding of a theological text depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as Paul Ricœur, have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).\n\nMircea Eliade, as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane. The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a hierophany. The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered. Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.\n\nIn the field of safety science, and especially in the study of human reliability, scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.\n\nIt has been proposed by ergonomist Donald Taylor that mechanist models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.\n\nOther scholars in the field have attempted to create safety taxonomies that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of qualitative data.\n\nIn sociology, hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes the importance of both context and form within any given social behaviour.\n\nThe central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or world view from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the \"thumbs-up\" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult. Similarly, putting a piece of paper into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of democratic elections (the act of putting a ballot paper into a box).\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher, widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's \"hermeneutic circle\" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part. Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer.\n\nJürgen Habermas criticizes Gadamer's hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.\n\nMurray Rothbard and Hans Hermann-Hoppe, both economists of the Austrian school, have criticized the hermeneutical approach to economics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36118415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36118415", "title": "Hotel rating", "text": "Hotel rating\n\nHotel ratings are often used to classify hotels according to their quality. From the initial purpose of informing travellers on basic facilities that can be expected, the objectives of hotel rating has expanded into a focus on the hotel experience as a whole. Today the terms 'grading', 'rating', and 'classification' are used to generally refer to the same concept, that is to categorize hotels.\n\nThere is a wide variety of rating schemes used by different organizations around the world. Many have a system involving stars, with a greater number of stars indicating greater luxury. Forbes Travel Guide, formerly Mobil Travel Guide, launched its star rating system in 1958. The AAA and their affiliated bodies use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel and restaurant ratings levels.\n\nFood services, entertainment, view, room variations such as size and additional amenities, spas and fitness centers, ease of access and location may be considered in establishing a standard. Hotels are independently assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.\n\nThe more common classification systems include \"star\" rating, letter grading, from \"A\" to \"F\", such as hotels and motels. Systems using terms such as Deluxe/Luxury, First Class/Superior, Tourist Class/Standard, and Budget Class/Economy are more widely accepted as hotel types, rather than hotel standard. \n\nSome countries have rating by a single public standard—Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Hungary have laws defining the hotel rating. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the rating is defined by the respective hotel industry association using a five-star system—the German classifications are Tourist (*), Standard (**), Comfort (***), First Class (****) and Luxury (*****), with the mark \"Superior\" to flag extras beyond the minimum defined in the standard, but not enough to move the hotel up to the next tier ranking. The Swiss hotel rating was the first non-government formal hotel classification beginning in 1979. It influenced the hotel classification in Austria and Germany. The formal hotel classification of the DEHOGA (German Hotel and Restaurant Association) started on 1 August 1996 and proved successful with 80% of guests citing the hotel stars as the main criteria in hotel selection. This implementation influenced the creation of a common European Hotelstars rating system that started in 2010 (see below).\n\nIn France, the rating is defined by the public tourist board Atout France using a four-star system (plus \"L\" for Luxus) which has changed to a five-star system from 2009 on. In South Africa, the Tourist Grading Council of South Africa has strict rules for a hotel types granting up to 5 stars. In India, the classification of hotels is based on two categories such as \"Star\" and \"Heritage\". Hotels in India are classified by Hotel and Restaurant Association Classification Committee (HRACC), Ministry of Tourism, India. In New Zealand, hotels and other tourism services are graded by Qualmark, which is owned by Tourism New Zealand, a government organisation.\n\nIn Australia the independent accommodation rating scheme and Star Rating trademarks (the 'stars') are owned by the Australian Auto Clubs – the NRMA, RACV, RACQ, RAC, RAA and RACT. A Star Rating represents the quality and condition of guest facilities and is determined by more than 200 criteria that have been ranked by Australian travellers according to what's important to them. Star Ratings are awarded to properties across six accommodation types – hotels, motels, serviced apartments, self-catering, hosted accommodation and caravan-holiday parks – following a physical inspection by qualified reviewers.\n\nIn 2015 Star Ratings Australia became one of the first independent accommodation classification systems in the world to incorporate a consumer 'voice'. An exclusive Travellers' Rating is presented in parallel to the independent Star Rating and is an aggregate of past guest ratings and reviews from more than 100 websites in 45 different languages. A property must have a minimum of 25 reviews (across all sites) to produce an aggregate Travellers' Rating. Weighting applies to the popularity of the source site and the date of the last guest review. The William Angliss Institute in Melbourne has developed an independent benchmarking framework to show if a property has met or exceeded guest expectations.\n\nStar Ratings in Australia stand for independently reviewed quality standards and are easily defined:\n\nOn 28 February 2017, Michael Reed CEO Australian Motoring Services, advised clients via email of the closure of Star Ratings Australia effective from mid 2017.\n\nAustralia's star ratings have been operating since the 1950s first with the state based automobile clubs, then about 10 years ago with AAA Tourism as a peak body. However the booking service in the motoring clubs was not continued and later the annual accommodation guide book ceased to be printed with the accommodation guide going on-line. Finally AAA Tourism closed a few years ago and Star Ratings Australia continued the inspection and star rating service only, as well as the accommodation website. Reed asked clients to remove star rating and automobile club logos from their accommodation and promotional information by mid year. Competition from international websites lead to its demise.\n\nIn the United Kingdom hotels are rated from one-star to five stars. The RAC pulled out of accommodation grading in 2008 so the only grading schemes in operation are those operated by the AA (Automobile Association) and the national tourist boards: Visit England, Visit Wales, the Scottish Tourist Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. The schemes were all 'harmonised' to ensure consistency between the schemes. This applies to all accommodation types apart from self-catering that the AA started offering in 2009. The AA criteria are available on its website. In addition to the usual black stars (ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest), the AA awards red stars to the highest-rated, which are deemed 'Inspectors' Choice'. Each of the national tourist boards have grading explanations on their web sites.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Department of Tourism has an accreditation system for hotels, apartment hotels and resorts. The current system which uses a \"star system\" which rates establishments from 1 to 5 stars was adopted in 2012. The rating of the aforementioned facilities are determined through a points system. Hotels, apartment hotels, and resorts are graded according to their service, facility quality and condition, and business practices. The Department of Tourism classifies the criteria used into seven dimensions or \"business area\" namely: Arrival & Departure, Public Areas, Bedrooms, Food & Beverage, Lounge Area, Kitchen Area, Amenities, and Business Practices, all common to the three categories except Kitchen and Lounge Area which is only applicable to apartment hotels. 1,000 points is the maximum number of points an establishment can attain.\n\nThe HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants & Cafés in Europe) is an umbrella organization for 39 associations from 24 European countries. At a conference in Bergen in 2004, the partners drafted a hotel classification system in order to harmonize their national standards. In 2007 HOTREC launched the European Hospitality Quality scheme (EHQ) which has since accredited the existing national inspection bodies for hotel rating.\n\nUnder the patronage of HOTREC, the hotel associations of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland created the Hotelstars Union. On 14 September 2009, the Hotelstars Union classification system was established at a conference in Prague. This system became effective in these countries in January 2010, with the exception of Hungary, Switzerland and the Netherlands, who have chosen later dates for the change. Later more countries have joined the HOTREC hotelstars system: Estonia (2011), Latvia (2011), Lithuania (2011), Luxembourg (2011), Malta (2012), Belgium (2013), Denmark (2013) and Greece (2013).\n\nThe European Hotelstars Union system is based on the earlier German hotelstars system that had widely influenced the hotel classifications in central Europe, with five stars and a Superior mark to flag extras. Instead of a strict minimum in room size and required shower facilities (e.g. a bath tub in a four-star hotel) there is a catalogue of criteria with 21 qualifications encompassing 270 elements, where some are mandatory for a star and others optional. The main criteria are in quality management, wellness and sleeping accommodation. In the catalogue of criteria each entry is associated with a number of points – each Hotelstars level requires a minimal sum of points besides some criteria being obligatory for the level. The minimum requirement for the Superior flag requires the same sum of points as for the next Hotelstars level which however was not awarded due to at least one obligatory requirement being left out.\n\nFor hotels with three to five stars, the Hotelstars Union will use \"mystery guests\" to check the service quality regularly.\n\nThere is so far no international classification which has been adopted. There have been attempts at unifying the classification system so that it becomes an internationally recognized and a reliable standard, but they have all failed.\n\nIt has been considered that, as it has been the case in other areas (e.g. international accounting standards), hotel classification standards should result from a private and independent initiative. This may be the case of the World Hotel Rating (WHR) project, which notably aims to set international classification standards and rating criteria along the lines of a world star-rating system. It will also establish an information platform on the hotel industry which will be multilingual and multicultural. WHR intends to play a key role in the development of quality hotel services, as well as equitable and sustainable tourism, and the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage. In addition, WHR will develop labels to promote hotels distinguished by specific features, such as a family and child-friendly disposition. A test period was scheduled for 2010.\n\nSome hotels have been advertised as seven star hotels. The Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai was opened in 1998 with a butler for every room – this has been the first hotel being widely described as a \"seven-star\" property, but the hotel says the label originates from an unnamed British journalist on a press trip and that they neither encourage its use nor do they use it in their advertising. Similarly the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi (open since 2005) is sometimes described as seven star as well, but the hotel uses only a five star rating.\n\nThe Galleria in Milan, Italy was opened in 2007 and it claims to have a seven star certificate from SGS Italy2008. However the SGS Italy (not the official tourism agency) only has five stars in the general hotel stars categorization, with the full title of the certificate being left unknown, just as the renewal process is unknown. Overall, as no traditional organization or formal body awards or recognizes any rating over five-star deluxe, such claims are meaningless and predominantly used for advertising purposes.\n\nHistorically, luxury hotels have used the membership in The Leading Hotels of the World to document regular inspection on an additional level. This organization had been formed in 1928 and it reorganized in 1971 introducing a worldwide inspection service.\n\nIn recent years, alternative hotel ratings are starting to appear in an effort to promote sustainability or cultural diversity in international tourism.\n\nGreen Key International is a voluntary eco-classification awarded to around 2,900 hotels and other establishments in 57 countries by the Foundation for Environmental Education. \n\nGreen Key Global is a voluntary eco-classification awarded to around 1,850 hotels and venues in 15 countries. In 2009, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts joined the Green Key Global program.\n\nGreen Globe is the global certification for sustainable tourism. Membership is reserved for companies and organizations who are committed to making positive contributions to the planet. The Green Building Initiative (GBI) acquired the U. S. rights to the Canadian Green Globes building assessment and certification for the program in 2004 and adapted it for the U.S. market.\n\nSalam Standard is a classification system for Muslim-friendly hotels. Hotels can get certified based on certain Muslim-friendly criteria such as offering prayer mats, removing alcohol from the room and offering halal restaurant recommendations and is divided into 4 tiers (bronze, silver, gold and platinum). Archipelago Hotels, Indonesia's biggest hospitality firm, is a prominent member of the Salam Standard system.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4524265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4524265", "title": "Huddle", "text": "Huddle\n\nIn sport, a huddle is an action of a team gathering together, usually in a tight circle, to strategize, motivate or celebrate. It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on-field communication is difficult. Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire other team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the teams success, or to commiserate a defeat. The term \"huddle\" can be used as a verb as in \"huddling up.\"\n\nThe huddle is commonly used in American football and Canadian football to strategize before each play; the offensive team's huddle is almost always led by the quarterback, and the defensive huddle is typically led by one of the linebackers. It is also popular in basketball, football, volleyball and cricket.\n\nThe huddle became more widely used in cricket after the India national team used it to great success during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The England team has imitated this technique with some success, notably in the 2005 Ashes series.\n\nThe modern-day circular huddle, in which the players all face inward in a tight circle, was invented by Gallaudet University quarterback Paul D. Hubbard in 1894. Gallaudet was among the first schools intended for the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and the first intended for their postsecondary education. When quarterbacking, Hubbard realized that his hand signals could be read by opposing players, a particular concern when Gallaudet played other schools for the deaf. To remedy this, he had his players form a circle so that his sign-language signals could be sent and received without anyone on the sidelines or on the opposing team seeing.\n\nThis type of huddle is still in common use today, typically between plays in American Football as the quarterback assigns the next play to the offense.\n\nThe typewriter huddle is a huddle formation created by former Florida State Head Coach Tom Nugent in the mid-1950s. It is typically used between a coach and multiple players, or when a quarterback or other player wants to create an image of being separate from the team, dictating to them, rather than being a part of the group, as with the circular huddle. The players being spoken to are arranged in two or more rows, the front row often kneeling or crouching. The player or coach speaking can then be assured that he has the attention of the entire audience, something that often is not possible if that person is in the center of a circular huddle. Though allowing players breathing room and providing space for more participants than a circular huddle, it is not as secure, as observers on the sidelines may be able to see hand signals or read the speaker's lips.\n\nIn American football, though seemingly random, huddles can have several forms. Before the 1890s, football players didn’t form huddles; they instead discussed the play far enough from the other team that they could not be overheard. As American football became more organized and formalized, so too did the huddle.\n\nThe football team at Oregon Agricultural College was one of the very first schools nationally to use the huddle formation in a game. It happened against the University of Washington in Seattle during the 1918 season. Head coach Bill Hargiss instructed the starters that once they returned to the field, they were to stand 10 yards behind the ball before the beginning of each play and whisper to one another what they were going to do next. An eyewitness to the game was veteran Seattle sports columnist Royal Brougham, whose stories of the contest give testimony today to the program's early use of this pioneering new formation. Others trace the huddle to the 1890s in Gallaudet College.\n\nAnother instance of its use was when the huddle was formed by Paul Hubbard, a deaf player who went to Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. To avoid having the other team see his sign language between plays, he and his team huddled to conceal the signs.\n\nDuring a game, the quarterback uses the huddle to communicate the next play to the offense. National Football League Rule 5 Section 2 stipulates that no more than eleven players may be in the offensive huddle. An offensive substitute who communicates with a teammate in a huddle would be penalized for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\"; this is to prevent teams from feigning a substitution and taking advantage of the chaos to confuse opponents.\n\nIn some situations, teams may choose not to call a huddle and employ a hurry-up no-huddle offense to maximize time and surprise the defense.\n\nIn a snap, the snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as \"...on <number>.\" being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start.\n\nIn Association football (soccer), the huddle has been used before games by Brazil and the Ireland national teams and club teams such as Derry City FC. Celtic FC from Scotland have used the huddle as a pre-match ritual since 1995, although this was pre-dated by St. Mirren FC (also from Scotland) who had been using the huddle since 1993. Celtic copied this and in turn is now carried out by all levels and ages of the Celtic club and often imitated by the supporters. The supporting visual aspect of this, although culturally unrelated can also be seen as similar to The Poznan.\n\nIn contrast to other sports, the huddle is a specific tactic in Australian football, used by the team kicking in after a behind is scored, or some delayed stoppage. All players in the backline gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means that there will be several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first kick-in. It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.\n\n"}
{"id": "37042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37042", "title": "Indonesian language", "text": "Indonesian language\n\nIndonesian ( ) is the official language of Indonesia. It is a standardised register of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world. Of its large population, the majority speak Indonesian, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world.\n\nMost Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages; examples include Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese, which are commonly used at home and within the local community. However, most formal education, and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, judiciary, and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian.\n\nThe Indonesian name for the language () is also occasionally found in English and other languages.\n\nIndonesian is a standardized register of \"Riau Malay\", which despite its common name is not the Malay dialect native to the Riau Islands, but rather the Classical Malay of the Malaccan royal courts. Originally spoken in Northeast Sumatra, Malay has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for half a millennium. It might be attributed to its ancestor, the Old Malay language (which can be traced back to the 7th century). The Kedukan Bukit Inscription is the oldest surviving specimen of Old Malay, the language used by Srivijayan empire. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language has been used in Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago), evidenced by Srivijaya inscriptions and by other inscriptions from coastal areas of the archipelago, such as those discovered in Java.\n\nTrade contacts carried on by various ethnic peoples at the time were the main vehicle for spreading the Old Malay language, which was the main communications medium among the traders. Ultimately, the Old Malay language became a lingua franca and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago.\n\nIndonesian (in its normative form) has essentially the same material basis as the standard Malaysian register of Malay, and is therefore considered to be a variety of the pluricentric Malay language. However, it does differ from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the (literally \"market Malay\"), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.\n\nMalaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the Johor Sultanate and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of Riau-Lingga, while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.\n\nWhen the Dutch East India Company (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of Malaccan Sultanate and later the Portuguese. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the bankruptcy of the VOC, the Batavian Republic took control of the colony in 1799 and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the colony. Even then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the era of colonization the language that would be standardized as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of loanwords.\n\nThe nationalist movement that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected Dutch from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonized countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, bureaucracy, education, technology, and other important areas for a significant time after independence. Soenjono Dardjowidjojo even goes so far as to say that \"Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense\" since it truly dominates in all spheres of Indonesian society. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch policy as by Indonesian nationalism, though. In marked contrast to the French, Spanish and Portuguese, who pursued an assimilation colonial policy, or even the British, the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals. Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.\n\nDutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the pro-independence struggle. As of it, Mohammad Husni Thamrin inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the \"Volksraad\" sessions held in July 1938. By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia and outlawed the use of the Dutch language. Three years later, the Indonesians themselves formally abolished the language and established \"Bahasa Indonesia\" as the national language of the new nation.\n\nThe adoption of Indonesian as the country's national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states, as neither the language with the most native speakers (in this case, Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (in this case, Dutch) was to be adopted, but rather a local language with many fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).\n\nIn 1945 when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language, although then it was the native language of only about 5 per cent of the population, whereas Javanese and Sundanese were the mother tongues of 42–48 percent and 15 percent respectively. It was a combination of nationalistic, political, and practical concerns that ultimately led to the successful adoption of Indonesian as a national language.\nIn 1945, Javanese was easily the most prominent language in Indonesia. It was the native language of nearly half the population, the primary language of politics and economics, and the language of courtly, religious, and literary tradition. What it lacked, however, was the ability to unite the diverse Indonesian population as a whole. With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favoring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use; in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period of time, Malay, which would later become standardized as Indonesian, was the primary language of commerce and travel. In addition, it was the language used for the propagation of Islam in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to Christianity. The combination of all of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of Brunei and of the future Malaysia, on which some Indonesian nationalists had claims (see Greater Indonesia).\n\nOver the first 53 years of Indonesian independence, the country's first two presidents, Sukarno and Suharto constantly nurtured the sense of national unity embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an important component of Indonesian identity today. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of politics, education, and nation-building in general, Indonesia became one of the few success stories of an indigenous language effectively overtaking that of a country's colonizers to become the \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" official language. It is a unique and somewhat unusual story, especially considering the historical dominance of Javanese; a diverse collection of peoples were able to compromise to hold the nation together. Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of national identity as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and it also serves as the language of education, literacy, modernization, and social mobility. Despite still being a second language to most Indonesian citizens, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivaled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.\n\nWhile Indonesian is spoken as a mother tongue by only a small proportion of Indonesia's large population (i.e. mainly those who reside within the vicinity of Jakarta and other large predominantly Indonesian-speaking cities such as Medan and Balikpapan), over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that boasts more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, government bodies, schools, universities, workplaces, among members of the Indonesian upper-class or nobility and also in many other formal situations, although the 2010 Indonesian Census shows that only 19.94% of people over 5 years old speak mainly Indonesian at home.\n\nStandard and formal Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts; however, few native Indonesian speakers use the formal language in their daily conversations. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and Chinese) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of Indonesian slang, particularly in the cities.\n\nThe most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the Betawi language, a Malay-based creole of Jakarta, amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta's status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form or the even simpler , while (like, similar to) is often replaced with (pronounced \"kai-yah\"). or (very), the term to express intensity, is often being replaced with the Javanese-influenced .\n\nAs for pronunciation, the diphthongs \"ai\" and \"au\" on the end of base words are typically pronounced as and . In informal writing the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, becomes or , becomes , becomes .\n\nIn verbs, the prefix \"me-\" is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when becomes (the basic word is ). The suffixes \"-kan\" and \"-i\" are often replaced by \"-in\". For example, becomes , becomes . The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.\n\nIndonesian is one of the many varieties of Malay. Malay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western Borneo stretching to the Bruneian coast. A form known as Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE and was, it has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent Malayan languages. Its ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, a descendant of the Proto-Austronesian language, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly as a result of the southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into Maritime Southeast Asia from the island of Taiwan. Indonesian, which originated from Malay, is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, which includes languages from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia. Malagasy, a geographic outlier spoken in Madagascar in the Indian Ocean; the Philippines national language, Filipino; and the native language of New Zealanders, Māori language are also members of this language family. Although each language of the family is mutually unintelligible, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.\n\nHowever, Indonesian as it is known today was heavily influenced by several languages due to historical ties with other nations. Dutch made the highest contribution to the language, especially in vocabulary due to the Dutch's colonization for over three centuries, from the 16th century until the mid-20th century. Asian languages also influenced the language, with Chinese influencing Indonesian during the 15th and 16th centuries due to the spice trade; Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrit \nand Hindi contributing during the flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms from the 2nd to the 14th century; followed by Arabic after the spread of Islam in the archipelago in the 13th century. Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian also receives many of English words as results of globalization and modernization, especially since the 1990s, as far as the Internet's emergence and development until now. Some Indonesian words have also been borrowed into English, among them the common words , , , , , and the less common words such as , and . The phrase \"to run amok\" comes from the Indonesian verb \"amuk\" (to run out of control, to rage). Due to the complexity of historical background of the language, Indonesian has become more advanced, even when compared to its own ancestor, Malay.\n\nIndonesian is neither pidgin or creole since the feature characteristics do not meet any of the criteria for either. It is believed that the Indonesian language was one of the means to achieve independence, but it is opened to receive vocabulary from other foreign languages aside from Malay that it has made contact with since the colonialism era, such as Dutch, English and Arabic among others, as the loan words keep increasing each year.\n\nIn 2010, Indonesian had 42.8 million native speakers, and 154.9 million second-language speakers, who speak it alongside their local mother tongue, giving a total number of speakers in Indonesia of 197.7 million. It is common as a first language in urban areas, and as a second language by those residing in more rural parts of Indonesia.\n\nThe VOA and BBC use Indonesian as their standard for broadcasting in Malay. In Australia, Indonesian is one of three Asian target languages, together with Japanese and Mandarin, taught in some schools as part of the Languages Other Than English programme. Indonesian has been taught in Australian schools and universities since the 1950s.\n\nIn East Timor, which was occupied by Indonesia between 1975 and 1999, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese. Its understood by among the Malay people of Australia's Cocos Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, also in some parts of the Sulu area of the southern Philippines and traces of it are to be found among people of Malay descent in Sri Lanka, South Africa, Suriname, and other places.\n\nIndonesian is the official language of the Republic of Indonesia, thus its usage is encouraged throughout the Indonesian archipelago. It's regulated in Chapter XV, Constitution of Indonesia 1945 about the flag, official language, coat of arms, and national anthem of Indonesia. Also in Chapter III, Section 25 to 45, Government regulation No. 24/ 2009 specifically mentions the status of the Indonesian language.<ref name=\"UU No 24/2009\"></ref>\n\nIndonesian functions as a symbol of national identity and pride, and is a unifying language among the diverse Indonesian ethnic groups. It also serves as a vehicle of communication among the Indonesian provinces and different regional cultures in Indonesia. The language is used as the national official language, the language of education, communication, transaction and trade documentation, the development of national culture, science, technology, and mass media in Indonesia.\n\nAccording to Indonesian law, the Indonesian language was proclaimed as the unifying language during Sumpah Pemuda on 28 October 1928, developed further to accommodate the dynamics of Indonesian civilization. As mentioned previously, the language was based on Riau Malay, though linguists note that this is not the local dialect of Riau, but the Malaccan dialect that was used in the Riau court. Since its conception in 1928 and its official recognition in 1945 Constitution, the Indonesian language has been loaded with a nationalist political agenda to unify Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies). This status has made the Indonesian language relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group in Indonesia, and Dutch as the previous colonizer. Compared to the indigenous dialects of Malay spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large amount of Javanese loanwords incorporated into its already rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has wider sources of loanwords, compared to Malaysian Malay. It is sometimes said that the Indonesian language is an artificial language made official in 1928. By artificial, it means that Indonesian was designed by academics rather than evolving naturally as most common languages have, in order to accommodate the political purpose of establishing an official unifying language of Indonesia. By borrowing heavily from numerous other languages it expresses a natural linguistic evolution; in fact, it is as natural as the next language, as demonstrated in its exceptional capacity for absorbing foreign vocabulary.\n\nThe disparate evolution of Indonesian and Malaysian has led to a rift between the two standardized registers. This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardization rather than cultural reasons, and as a result there are asymmetrical views regarding each other's variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is called either Malay or Malaysian; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages. The result of this attitude is that Indonesians feel little need to harmonize their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with Indonesians, although the 1972 Indonesian alphabet reform was largely seen as a concession of Dutch-based Indonesian to the English-based spelling of Malaysian.\n\nIt is usually said that there are six vowels in Indonesian. These six vowels are shown in the table below. However, other analyses set up a system with other vowels, particularly the open-mid vowels and .\n\nIn standard Indonesian orthography, the Latin alphabet is used, and five vowels are distinguished: \"a, i, u, e, o\". In materials for learners, the mid-front vowel /e/ is sometimes represented with a diacritic as \"é\" to distinguish it from the mid-central vowel /ə/.\n\nSome analyses claim that Indonesian has three native diphthong phonemes only in open syllables, they are:\n\nOthers assume that these diphthongs are actually a monophthong followed by an approximant, so represents , represents , and represents . On this basis, there are no phonological diphthongs in Indonesian.\n\nDiphthongs are differentiated from two vowels in two syllables, such as:\n\nThe consonants of Indonesian are shown below. Non-native consonants that only occur in borrowed words, principally from Arabic and English, are shown in parentheses. Some analyses list 19 \"primary consonants\" for Indonesian as the 18 symbols that are not in parentheses in the table as well as the glottal stop . The secondary consonants /f/, /v/, /z/, /ʃ/ and /x/ only appear in loanwords. Some speakers pronounce /v/ in loanwords as [v], otherwise it is [f]. [z] can also be an allophone of /s/ before voiced consonants..\n\nOrthographic note:\nThe sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:\n\n\nIndonesian has light stress that falls on either the final or penultimate syllable, depending on regional variations as well as the presence of the schwa () in a word. It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa . If the penult has a schwa, then stress moves to the ante-penultimate syllable if there is one, even if that syllable has a schwa as well; if the word is disyllabic, the stress is final. In disyllabic stress with a closed penultimate syllable, such as \"tinggal\" ('stay') and \"rantai\" ('chain'), stress falls on the penult.\n\nHowever, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.\n\nThe classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic. Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English, even though doubts remain about whether the syllable is the appropriate unit for the study of Malay prosody. However, many linguists suggest that rhythm in Indonesian is not payed, because Indonesian is not a kind of tonal language like Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese.\n\nWord order in Indonesian is generally subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to that of most modern European languages, such as English. However considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as Japanese or Korean, for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for grammatical case nor does it make use of grammatical gender.\n\nIn Indonesian, affixes take on an important role because slightly different affixes may have very different meanings. There are four types of affixes: prefixes (\"awalan\"), suffixes (\"akhiran\"), circumfixes (\"apitan\") and infixes (\"sisipan\"). Affixes are categorized into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Root words are either nouns or verbs, which can take on affixes to generate new words, for example, \"masak\" (to cook) may become \"memasak\" (cooks), \"memasakkan\" (cooks for), \"dimasak\" (cooked), \"pemasak\" (a cook), \"masakan\" (a meal, cookery), ‘’termasak’’ (accidentally cooked). Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: \"sapu\" (to sweep) becomes \"menyapu\" (sweeps/sweeping); \"panggil\" (to call) becomes \"memanggil\" (calls/calling), \"tapis\" (to sieve) becomes \"menapis\" (sieves).\n\nOther examples of the use of affixes to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word \"ajar\" (teach):\n\nNoun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:\n\nThe prefix \"per-\" drops its \"r\" before \"r, l\" and frequently before \"p, t, k.\" In some words it is \"peng-\"; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.\n\nSimilarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:\n\nAdjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:\n\nIn addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, \"maha-\", \"pasca-\", \"eka-\", \"bi-\", \"anti-\", \"pro-\" etc.\n\nCommon derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).\n\nIndonesian does not make use of grammatical gender, and there are only selected words that use natural gender. For instance, the same word is used for \"he/him\" and \"she/her\" ( or ) or for \"his\" and \"her\" (, or ). No real distinction is made between \"girlfriend\" and \"boyfriend\", both (although more colloquial terms as girl/girlfriend and boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.\n\nThere are some words that have gender, for instance means \"daughter\", and means \"son\" and also means \"male flight attendant\" and meaning \"female flight attendant\". Another example would be , which equates to \"sportsman\", and , meaning sportswoman. Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as \"-a\" and \"-i\" or \"-wan\" and \"wati\") are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from Sanskrit through the Old Javanese language).\nIn some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, (a gender-specific term meaning \"older brother\") is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while (a non-gender specific term meaning \"older sibling\") is often used to mean \"older sister\". Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: (\"older brother\"), (\"older sister\"), (\"older brother\") and (\"older sister\").\n\nIndonesian grammar does not regularly mark plurals. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds \"para\" before it (the latter for living things only); for example, \"students\" can be either or . Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily discourse, speakers of Indonesian usually use other methods to indicate the concept of something being \"more than one\". Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.\n\nReduplication is commonly used to emphasize plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, \"orang-orang\" means \"(all the) people\", but \"orang-orangan\" means \"scarecrow\". Similarly, while \"hati\" means \"heart\" or \"liver\", \"hati-hati\" is a verb meaning \"to be careful\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as \"orang-orangan\" \"scarecrow/scarecrows\", \"biri-biri\" \"a/some sheep\" and \"kupu-kupu\" \"butterfly/butterflies\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in \"sayur-mayur\" \"(all sorts of) vegetables\".\n\nDistributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: \"pohon\" \"tree\", \"pepohonan\" \"flora, trees\"; \"rumah\" \"house\", \"perumahan\" \"housing, houses\"; \"gunung\" \"mountain\", \"pegunungan\" \"mountain range, mountains\".\n\nQuantity words come before the noun: \"seribu orang\" \"a thousand people\", \"beberapa pegunungan\" \"a series of mountain ranges\", \"beberapa kupu-kupu\" \"some butterflies\".\n\nPlural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, \"Ani membeli satu kilo mangga\" (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, \"mangoes\", which is plural, is not said as \"mangga-mangga\" because the plurality is implicit: the amount a kilogram means more than one mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a pleonasm (in Indonesian often called \"pemborosan kata\").\n\nPersonal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \"you\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\"does Johnny want to go?\", \"would Madam like to go?\"); kin terms, including fictive kinship, are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns \"ini\" \"this, the\" and \"itu\" \"that, the\".\n\nFrom the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker.\n\nThis table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Indonesian language:\nNotable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between two forms of \"we\": \"kita\" (you and me, you and us) and \"kami\" (us, but not you). The distinction is increasingly confused in colloquial Indonesian.\n\n\"Saya\" and \"aku\" are the two major forms of \"I\". \"Saya\" is the more formal form, whereas \"aku\" is used with family, friends, and between lovers. \"Sahaya\" is an old or literary form of \"saya\". \"Sa(ha)ya\" may also be used for \"we\", but in such cases it is usually used with \"sekalian\" or \"semua\" \"all\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive \"kami\" or exclusive \"kita\". Less common are \"hamba\" \"slave\", \"hamba tuan, hamba datuk\" (all extremely humble), \"beta\" (a royal addressing oneselves), \"patik\" (a commoner addressing a royal), \"kami\" (royal or editorial \"we\"), \"kita\", \"təman\", and \"kawan.\"\nThere are three common forms of \"you\", \"Anda\" (polite), \"kamu\" (familiar), and \"kalian\" \"all\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). \"Anda\" is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show respect (though terms like \"tuan\" \"sir\" and other titles also show respect), while \"kamu\" is used in situations where the speaker would use \"aku\" for \"I\". \"Anda sekalian\" is polite plural.\n\n\"Engkau\" (\"əngkau\"), commonly shortened to \"kau\", and \"hang\" are used to social inferiors, \"awak\" to equals, and \"əncik\" (\"cek\" before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds \"makcik\" and \"pakcik\" are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of.\nThe common word for \"s/he\" and \"they\" is \"ia\", which has the object and emphatic/focused form \"dia\". \"Bəliau\" \"his/her Honour\" is respectful. As with \"you\", names and kin terms are extremely common. \"Mereka\" \"someone\", \"mereka itu\", or \"orang itu\" \"those people\" are used for \"they\".\nThere are a large number of other words for \"I\" and \"you\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. \"Saudara\" \"you\" (male) and \"saudari\" (female) (plural \"saudara-saudara\" or \"saudari-saudari\") show utmost respect. \"Daku\" \"I\" and \"dikau\" \"you\" are poetic or romantic. Indonesian \"gua\" \"I\" (from Hokkien ) and \"lu\" \"you\" () are slang and extremely informal.\n\nThe pronouns \"aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,\" and \"kita\" are indigenous to Indonesian.\n\n\"Aku, kamu, engkau\", and \"ia\" have short possessive enclitic forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic \"dia\": \"meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia\" \"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\".\n\nThere are also proclitic forms of \"aku\", \"ku-\" and \"kau-\". These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:\n\nHere \"ku-\"verb is used for a general report, \"aku\" verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic \"aku-lah meng-\"verb (≈ \"I am the one who...\") for focus on the pronoun.\n\nThere are two demonstrative pronouns in Indonesian. \"Ini\" \"this, these\" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. \"Itu\" \"that, those\" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \"the\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a \"ini\" or \"itu\". The word \"yang\" \"which\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English \"this one\" or \"that one\".\n\nVerbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \"yesterday\") or by other tense indicators, such as \"sudah\" \"already\" and \"belum\" \"not yet\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.\n\nExamples of these are the prefixes \"di-\" (patient focus, traditionally called \n\"passive voice\", with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), \"meng-\" (agent focus, traditionally called \n\"active voice\", with AVO word order), \"memper-\" and \"diper-\" (causative, agent and patient focus), \"ber-\" (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and \"ter-\" (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes \"-kan\" (causative or benefactive) and \"-i\" (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes \"ber-...-an\" (plural subject, diffuse action) and \"ke-...-an\" (unintentional or potential action or state).\n\n\nForms in \"ter-\" and \"ke-...-an\" are often equivalent to adjectives in English.\n\nFour words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely \"tidak\", \"bukan\", \"jangan\", and \"belum\".\n\nFor example:\nFor negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word \"jangan\" (do not) is used before the verb. For example,\n\nThere are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. Stative verbs are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. Hence, \"rumah saya\" means \"my house\", while \"saya rumah\" means \"I am a house\". \nTo say that something \"is\" an adjective, the determiners \"itu\" and \"ini\" (\"that\" and \"this\") are often used. For example, in the sentence \"anjing itu galak\", the use of \"itu\" gives a meaning of \"the/that dog is ferocious\", while \"anjing ini galak\", gives a meaning of \"this dog is ferocious\". However, if \"itu\" or \"ini\" were not to be used, then \"anjing galak\" would meaning only \"ferocious dog\", a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, \"yang\", is also often used before adjectives, hence \"anjing yang galak\" also means \"ferocious dog\" or more literally \"dog which is ferocious\"; \"yang\" will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as \"saya didekati oleh anjing galak\" which means \"I was approached by a ferocious dog\", the use of the adjective \"galak\" is not stative at all.\n\nOften the \"ber-\" intransitive verb prefix, or the \"ter-\" stative prefix is used to express the meaning of \"to be...\". For example, \"beda\" means \"different\", hence \"berbeda\" means \"to be different\"; \"awan\" means \"cloud\", hence \"berawan\" means \"cloudy\". Using the \"ter-\" prefix, implies a state of being. For example, \"buka\" means \"open\", hence \"terbuka\" means \"is opened\"; \"tutup\" means \"closed/shut\", hence \"tertutup\" means \"is closed/shut\".\n\nAdjectives, demonstrative determiners, and possessive determiners follow the noun they modify.\n\nIndonesian does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.\n\nEither the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:\n\n\nFor example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:\n\n\nFor example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:\nUltimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.\n\nWord order is frequently modified for focus or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in intonation):\n\n\nThe last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of measure words, also called classifiers (\"kata penggolong\"). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Bengali.\n\nMeasure words are also found in English such as \"two head of cattle\", \"a loaf of bread\", or \"this sheet of paper\", where \"*two cattle, a bread,\" and \"this paper\" (in the sense of \"this piece of paper\") would be ungrammatical. The word \"satu\" reduces to \"se-\" , as it does in other compounds:\n\n\"Example\":\nMeasure words are not necessary just to say \"a\": \"burung\" \"a bird, birds\". Using \"se-\" plus a measure word is closer to English \"one\" or \"a certain\":\n\nIndonesian is written with the Latin script. It was originally based on the Dutch spelling and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to Italian, although is always (like English ), is always (\"hard\") and represents as it does in English. In addition, represents the palatal nasal , is used for the velar nasal (which can occur word-initially), for (English ) and for the voiceless velar fricative . Both and are represented with .\n\nSpelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:\nIntroduced in 1901, the \"van Ophuijsen\" system, (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardization of romanized spelling. It was most influenced by the then current Dutch spelling system. In 1947, the spelling was changed into \"Republican Spelling\" or \"Soewandi Spelling\" (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled \"oe\" into \"u\" (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the Perfected Spelling System, an officially mandated spelling reform in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from Dutch orthography) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written \"Soeharto\", and the central Java city of Yogyakarta is sometimes written \"Jogjakarta\".\n\nThe Indonesian alphabet is exactly the same as in English and ISO basic Latin alphabet.\n\nIndonesian follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet. Indonesian alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.\n\nIn addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:\n\nAs a modern variety of Malay, Indonesian has been influenced by other languages, including Dutch, English, Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, and Persian. It is estimated that there are some 750 Sanskrit loanwords in modern Indonesian, 1,000 Arabic loans, some of Persian and Hebrew origin, some 125 words of Portuguese, some of Spanish and Italian origin, and 10,000 loanwords from Dutch. The vast majority of Indonesian words, however, come from the root lexical stock of Austronesian (including Old Malay).\n\nThe study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reveals both its historical and social contexts. Examples are the early Sanskrit borrowings from the 7th century during the trading era, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian during the time of the establishment of Islam in particular, and those from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.\n\nList of loan words of Indonesian language published by the Badan Pengembangan dan Pembinaan Bahasa (The Language Center) under Ministry of Education and Culture:\n\nNote: This list only lists foreign languages, and thus omitting numerous local languages of Indonesia that have also been major lexical donors, such as Javanese, Sundanese, Betawi, etc. For a more complete list of these, see List of loanwords in Indonesian.\n\nThe Sanskrit influence came from contacts with India since ancient times. The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the Old Javanese language. Although Hinduism and Buddhism are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, Sanskrit, which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of Latin in English and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for neologisms, these are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of religion, art and everyday life.\n\nFrom Sanskrit came such words as स्वर्ग \"surga\" (heaven), भाषा \"bahasa\" (language), काच \"kaca\" (glass, mirror), राज- \"raja\" (king), मनुष्य \"manusia\" (mankind), चिन्ता \"cinta\" (love), भूमि \"bumi\" (earth), भुवन \"buana\" (world), आगम \"agama\" (religion), स्त्री \"Istri\" (wife/woman), जय \"Jaya\" (victory/victorious), पुर \"Pura\" (city/temple/place), रक्षस \"Raksasa\" (giant/monster), धर्म \"Dharma\" (rule/regulations), मन्त्र \"Mantra\" (words/poet/spiritual prayers), क्षत्रिय \"Satria\" (warrior/brave/soldier), विजय \"Wijaya\" (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. Sanskrit words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: \"Bhayangkara\", \"Laksamana\", \"Jatayu\", \"Garuda\", \"Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka\", \"Jalesveva Jayamahe\", \"Kartika Eka Paksi\", \"Swa Bhuwana Paksa\", \"Rastra Sewakottama\", \"Yudha Siaga\", etc.\n\nBecause Sanskrit has long been known in the Indonesian archipelago, Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using only Sanskrit words. The short story below consists of approximately 80 words in Indonesian that are written using Sanskrit words alone, except for a few particles.\n\nThe relationship with China has been going since the 7th century when Chinese merchants traded in some areas of the archipelago such as Riau, West Borneo, East Kalimantan, and North Maluku. At the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited Kahuripan in East Java. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left Mainland China and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called as Indonesia).\n\nThe Chinese loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include \"pisau\" (匕首 bǐshǒu  – knife), \"loteng\", (樓/層 = lóu/céng – [upper] floor/ level), \"mie\" (麵 > 面 Hokkien mī – noodles), \"lumpia\" (潤餅 (Hokkien = lūn-piáⁿ) – springroll), \"cawan\" (茶碗 cháwǎn – teacup), \"teko\" (茶壺 > 茶壶 = cháhú [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), 苦力 kuli = 苦 khu (hard) and 力 li (energy) and even the widely used slang terms \"gua\" and \"lu\" (from the Hokkien 'goa' 我 and 'lu/li' 汝 – meaning 'I/ me' and 'you').\n\nMany Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from Arab Peninsula like Arabian, Persian, and from the western part of India, Gujarat where many Muslims lived. As a result, many Indonesian words come from the Arabic language. Especially since the late 12th century, Old Malay was heavily influenced by the language and produced many great literary works such as Syair, Babad, Hikayat, and Suluk. This century is known as \"The Golden Age of Indonesian Literature\".\n\nMany loanwords from Arabic are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with Islam, and by extension, with greetings such as the word, \"selamat\" (from ' = health, soundness) means \"safe\" or \"lucky\". Words of Arabic origin include \"dunia\" (from ' = the present world), names of days (except \"Minggu\"), such as \"Sabtu\" (from ' = Saturday), \"iklan\" ( ' = advertisement), \"kabar\" ( ' = news), \"Kursi\" ( ' = a chair), \"jumat\" ( ' = Friday), \"ijazah\" ( ' = 'permission', certificate of authority, e.g. a school diploma certificate), \"kitab\" ( ' = book), \"tertib\" ( ' = order/arrangement) and \"kamus\" ( ' = dictionary). Allah (), as it is mostly the case for Arabic speakers, is the word for God even in Christian Bible translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual Hebrew words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to Greek names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name Jesus was initially translated as \"'Isa\" (), but is now spelt as \"Yesus\". Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for \"bishop\" is \"uskup\" (from ' = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for archbishop \"uskup agung\" (literally \"great bishop\"), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term \"imam\" (from ' = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic priest, beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation \"jemaat\" (from ' = group, a community). Even the name of the Bible in Indonesian translation is \"Alkitab\" (from \"\" = the book), which literally means \"the Book\".\n\nAlongside Malay, Portuguese was the \"lingua franca\" for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the \"Spice Islands\". Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include \"meja\" (from mesa = table), \"bangku\" (from banco = bench), \"lemari/almari\" (from armário = closet), \"boneka\" (from boneca = doll), \"jendela\" (from janela = window), \"Gereja\" (from Igreja = Church), \"Misa\" (from Missa = Mass), \"Natal\" (from Natal = Christmas), \"Paskah\" (from Páscoa = Easter), \"pesta\" (from festa = party), \"dansa\" (from dança = dance), \"pesiar\" (from passear = cruise), \"bendera\" (from bandeira = flag), \"sepatu\" (from sapato = shoes), \"garpu\" (from garfo = fork), \"kemeja\" (from camisa = shirt), \"kereta\" (from carreta = chariot), \"pompa\" (from bomba hidráulica = pump), \"pigura\" (from figura = picture), \"roda\" (from roda = wheel), \"nona\" (from dona = young woman), \"sekolah\" (from escola = school), \"lentera\" (from lanterna = lantern), \"paderi\" (from padre = priest), \"Santo, Santa\" (from Santo, Santa = Saint), \"puisi\" (from poesia = poetry), \"keju\" (from queijo = cheese), \"mentega\" (from manteiga = butter), \"serdadu\" (from soldado = soldier), \"meski\" (from mas que = although), \"kamar\" (from câmara = room), \"laguna\" (from laguna = lagoon), \"lelang\" (from leilão = auction), \"persero\" (from parceiro = company), \"markisa\" (from maracujá = passion fruit), \"limau\" (from limão = lemon), \"kartu\" (from cartão = card), \"Inggris\" (from inglês = English), \"Sabtu\" (from sábado = Saturday), \"Minggu\" (from domingo = Sunday), etc.\n\nThe former colonial power, the Netherlands, left a sizable amount of vocabulary that can be seen in words such as \"polisi\" (from politie = police), \"kualitas\" (from kwaliteit = quality), \"aktual\" (from actueel = current), \"rokok\" (from roken = smoking cigarettes), \"korupsi\" (from corruptie = corruption), \"kantor\" (from kantoor = office), \"resleting\" (from ritssluiting = zipper), \"pelopor\" (from voorloper = frontrunner), \"persneling\" (from versnelling = transmission gear), \"setrum\" (from stroom = electricity current), \"maskapai\" (from maatschappij = company), \"apotek\" (from apotheek = pharmacy), \"handuk\" (from handdoek = towel), \"setrika\" (from strijkijzer = clothes iron), \"bioskop\" (from bioscoop = cinema), \"spanduk\" (from spandoeken = banner), \"korsleting\" (from kortsluiting = short circuit), \"om\" (from oom = uncle), \"tante\" (from tante = aunt), \"traktir\" (from trakteer = treat) and \"gratis\" (from gratis = free). These Dutch loanwords, and many other non-Italo-Iberian, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the schwa. For example, Dutch \"schroef\" > \"sekrup\" (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words are inspired by the Dutch language.\n\nBefore the standardization of the language, many Indonesian words follow standard Dutch alphabet and pronunciation such as \"oe\" for vowel \"u\" or \"dj\" for consonant \"j\" [dʒ]. As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: for the word or for the word , older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.\n\nMany English words were incorporated into Indonesian through globalization. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. This is due to the Germanic traces that exist in the two languages. Indonesian adopts English words with standardization. For example: from , from , from , from , from , from , and so other. However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardization that have same meanings in English such as: \"bus\", \"data\", \"domain\", \"detail\", \"internet\", \"film\", \"golf\", \"lift\", \"monitor\", \"radio\", \"radar\", \"unit\", \"safari\", \"sonar\", and \"video\", \"riil as real\".\n\nModern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources, there are many synonyms. For example, Indonesian has three words for \"book\", i.e. (from Sanskrit), (from Arabic) and (from Dutch ); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, means a library. A is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the Bible and Gospel are and , both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the . is the most common word for books.\n\nThere are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as \"karaoke\" (from ) from Japanese, and \"ebi\" (from ) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalization: although the word (Dutch: ) still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word is more common. Greek words such as \"demokrasi\" (from δημοκρατία \"dēmokratía\"), \"filosofi\" (from φιλοσοφία \"philasophia\"), \"mitos\" (from μῦθος \"mythos\") came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.\n\nIt is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilizes words that reflect the English usage (as used by its former colonial power, the British), while Indonesian uses a Latinate form reflected in the Dutch usage (e.g. \"aktiviti\" (Malaysian) vs. \"aktivitas\" (Indonesian), \"universiti\" (Malaysian) vs. \"universitas\" (Indonesian)).\n\nIndonesia hosts a sparkling variety of traditional verbal arts such as poetry, historical narratives, romances, and drama; which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly through Indonesian. Some of Indonesian great classic stories including Sitti Nurbaya by Marah Rusli, Azab dan Sengsara by Merari Siregar, and Sengsara Membawa Nikmat by Tulis Sutan Sati. Modern literature like novels, short stories, stage plays, and free-form poetry has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced such internationally recognised figures as novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer, dramatist W.S. Rendra, poet Chairil Anwar, and cinematographer Garin Nugroho. Indonesia's classic novels itself, have their own charm, offering insight into local culture and traditions and the historical background prior to and immediately after the country gained independence. One of the great is \"Shackles\" which was written by Armijn Pane in 1940. Originally titled \"Belenggu\" and translated into many languages including English and German.\n\nOver the past few years, interest in learning Indonesian has grown among non-Indonesians. Various universities have started to offer courses that emphasise the teaching of the language to non-Indonesians. In addition to National Universities, private institutions have also started to offer courses, like the Indonesia Australia Language Foundation and the .\nAs early as 1988, teachers of the language have expressed the importance of a standardised (also called BIPA, literally \"Indonesian Language for Foreign Speaker\") materials (mostly books), and this need became more evident during the 4th International Congress on the Teaching of Indonesian to Speakers of Other Languages held in 2001.\n\nSince 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Due to increasing demand among students, the Embassy will open an intermediate Indonesian language course later in the year.\nIn an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malay, which are related to Filipino. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.\n\nThe Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., USA also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.\n\nThe following texts are excerpts from the official translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Indonesian and Malay, along with the original declaration in English.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5272547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5272547", "title": "Languages of Brazil", "text": "Languages of Brazil\n\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil, and is widely spoken by most of population. Brazilian Sign Language is also an official language. Minority languages include indigenous languages and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants. The population speaks or signs approximately 210 languages, of which 180 are indigenous. Less than forty thousand people actually speak any one of the indigenous languages in the Brazilian territory.\n\nLanguage is one of the strongest elements of Brazil's national unity. As time progresses, fewer people speak dialects drastically different from Portuguese to make it easier for people to communicate with one another from one location to the next. Plenty Brazilians do speak their dialect. On top of that, within Portuguese between states there's a moderate regional variation in accent, vocabulary, and use of personal nouns, pronouns, and verb conjugations. Variations are beginning to diminish as a result of mass media, especially national television networks that are viewed by the majority of Brazilians.\n\nThe written language is uniform across Brazil, and follows national rules of spelling and accentuation that are revised from time to time for simplification. With the implementation of the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the orthographic norms of Brazil and Portugal were made virtually identical, with some minor differences. Brazil enacted these changes in 2009, and Portugal enacted them in 2012.\n\nWritten Brazilian Portuguese differs significantly from the spoken language, with only an educated subsection of the population adhering to prescriptive norms. The rules of grammar are complex and allow more flexibility than English or Spanish. Many foreigners who speak Portuguese fluently have difficulty writing it properly. Because of Brazil's size, self-sufficiency, and relative isolation, foreign languages are not widely spoken. English is often studied in school and is increasingly studied in private courses. It has replaced French as the principal second language among educated people.\n\nIn 2002, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) was made the official language of the Bennidorm deaf community.\n\nBefore the first Portuguese arrived in 1500, what is now Brazil was inhabited by several Amerindian people, who spoke different languages. According to Aryon Dall'Igna Rodrigues there were six million Indians in Brazil speaking 1,000 different languages. When the Portuguese settlers arrived, they encountered the Tupi people, who dominated most of the Brazilian coast and spoke a set of closely related languages. The Tupi called the non-Tupi peoples \"Tapuias\", a designation that the Portuguese adopted; however, there was little unity among the diverse Tapuia tribes other than their not being Tupi. In the first two centuries of colonization, a language based on Tupian languages (known as Língua geral) was widely spoken in the colony, not only by the Amerindians, but also by the Portuguese settlers, Africans and their descendants. This language was spoken in a vast area from São Paulo to Maranhão, as an informal language for domestic use, while Portuguese was the language used for public purposes. Língua Geral was spread by the Jesuit missionaries and Bandeirantes to other areas of Brazil where the Tupi language was not spoken. Then, until the 1940s this language based on Tupi was widely spoken in some Northern Amazonian areas where the Tupi people were not present. In 1775, Marquês de Pombal prohibited the use of Língua geral or any other indigenous language in Brazil.\n\nHowever, before that prohibition, the Portuguese language was dominant in Brazil. Most of the other Amerindian languages gradually disappeared as the populations that spoke them were integrated or decimated when the Portuguese-speaking population expanded to most of Brazil. The several African languages spoken in Brazil also disappeared. Since the 20th century there are no more records of speakers of African languages in the country. However, in some isolated communities settled by escaped slaves (Quilombo) the Portuguese language spoken by its inhabitants still preserves some lexicon of African origin, which is not understood by other Brazilians. Due to the contact with several Amerindian and African languages, the Portuguese spoken in Brazil absorbed many influences from these languages, which led to a notable differentiation from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal.\n\nStarting in the early 19th century, Brazil started to receive substantial immigration of non-Portuguese-speaking people from Europe and Asia. Most immigrants, particularly Italians and Spaniards, adopted the Portuguese language after a few generations. Other immigrants, particularly Germans, Japanese, Arabs, Poles and Ukrainians, preserved their languages for more generations. German-speaking immigrants started arriving in 1824. They came not only from Germany, but also from other countries that had a substantial German-speaking population (Switzerland, Poland, Austria, Romania and Russia (Volga Germans). During over 100 years of continuous emigration, it is estimated that some 300,000 German-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil. Italian immigration started in 1875 and about 1.5 million Italians immigrated to Brazil until World War II. They spoke several dialects from Italy. Other sources of immigration to Brazil included Spaniards, Poles, Ukrainians, Japanese and Middle-easterns. With the notable exception of the Germans, who preserved their language for several generations, and in some degree the Japanese, Poles, Ukrainians, Arabs, Kurds and Italians, most of the immigrants in Brazil adopted Portuguese as their mother tongue after a few generations.\n\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil, and is the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio and TV. It is used for all business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, giving it a national culture sharply distinct from its Spanish-speaking neighbours and also being a major factor contributing to the differentiation between Brazilians and people from the rest of South America. Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, influenced by the other European Languages such as Italian in the South and Southeast, Native American and African Languages in the Northeast. Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly due to phonological differences, of similar importance to the differences between British English and American English.\n\nDuring the 18th century, other differences between the Brazilian and European Portuguese developed, mainly through the introduction of lexicon from African and Tupi languages, such as words related to fauna and flora. At that time Brazilian Portuguese failed to adopt linguistic changes taking place in Portugal produced by French influence. The Brazilian Portuguese remained loyal to the pronunciation used at the time of its discovery. However, when Don João, the Portuguese king, and the royal entourage took refuge in Brazil in 1808 (when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal), he influenced the Portuguese spoken in the cities, making it more similar to the Portuguese of Portugal. After Brazilian independence in 1822, Brazilian Portuguese became influenced by Europeans who had migrated to the country. This is the reason that, in those areas (such as Rio de Janeiro and Recife), one finds variations in pronunciation (for instance, palatalization of post-vocalic /s/) and a few superficial lexical changes. These changes reflect the linguistics of the nationalities settling in each area. In the 20th century, the divide between the Portuguese and Brazilian variants of Portuguese widened as the result of new words for technological innovations. This happened because Portuguese lacked a uniform procedure for adopting such words. Certain words took different forms in different countries. For example: in Portugal one hears \"comboio,\" and in Brazil one hears \"trem\", both meaning train. \"Autocarro\" in Portugal is the same thing as \"ônibus\" in Brazil, both meaning bus.\n\nDespite the fact that Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the vast majority of Brazilians speak only Portuguese, there are several other languages spoken in the country. According to the president of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) there are an estimated 210 languages spoken in Brazil. Eighty are Amerindian languages, while the others are languages brought by immigrants. The 1950 Census was the last one to ask Brazilians which language they speak at home. Since then, the Census does not ask about language. However, the Census of 2010 asked respondents which languages they speak, allowing a better analysis of the languages spoken in Brazil.\n\nAt least one of the indigenous languages, Nheengatu, became an official language alongside Portuguese in the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira.\n\nAccording to the 1940 Census, after Portuguese, German was the most widely spoken language in Brazil. Although the Italian immigration to Brazil was much more significant than the German one, the German language had many more speakers than the Italian one, according to the Census. The Census revealed that two-thirds of the children of German immigrants spoke German at home. In comparison, half of the children of Italians spoke Portuguese at home. The stronger preservation of the German language when compared to the Italian one has many factors: Italian is closer to Portuguese than German, leading to a faster assimilation of the Italian speakers. (One might compare this to the United States, where a huge wave of German immigrants almost completely switched to English and assimilated more thoroughly than the Italian-Americans.) Also, the German immigrants used to educate their children in German schools. The Italians, on the other hand, had less organized ethnic schools and the cultural formation was centered in church, not in schools. Most of the children of Italians went to public schools, where Portuguese was spoken. Until World War II, some 1.5 million Italians had immigrated to Brazil, compared to only 250,000 Germans. However, the 1940 Census revealed that German was spoken as a home language by 644,458 people, compared to only 458,054 speakers of Italian.\n\nSpaniards, who formed the third largest immigrant group in Brazil (after the Portuguese and Italians) were also quickly assimilated into the Portuguese-speaking majority. Spanish is similar to Portuguese, which led to a fast assimilation. Moreover, many of the Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, where they also speaks Galician, which is closer to Portuguese, sometimes even being considered two dialects of the same language. Despite the large influx of Spanish immigrants to Brazil from 1880 to 1930 (over 700,000 people) the Census of 1940 revealed that only 74,000 people spoke Spanish in Brazil.\n\nOther languages such as Polish and Ukrainian, along with German and Italian, are spoken in rural areas of Southern Brazil, by small communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual. There are whole regions in southern Brazil where people speak both Portuguese and one or more of these languages. For example, it is reported that more than 90% of the residents of the small city of Presidente Lucena, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, speak Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, a Brazilian form of the Hunsrückisch dialect of German.\n\nSome immigrant communities in southern Brazil, chiefly the German and the Italian ones, have lasted long enough to develop distinctive dialects from their original European sources. For example, Brazilian German, also known as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch. In the Serra Gaúcha region, we can find Italian dialects such as Talian or \"italiano riograndense\", based on the Venetian language.\n\nOther German dialects were transplanted to this part of Brazil. For example, the Austrian dialect spoken in Dreizehnlinden or Treze Tílias in the state of Santa Catarina; or the dialect Schwowisch (Standard German: \"Schwäbisch\"), from Donauschwaben immigrants, is spoken in Entre Rios, Guarapuava, in the state of Paraná; or the East Pomeranian dialect spoken in many different parts of southern Brazil (in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, etc.). Plautdietsch is spoken by the descendants of Russian Mennonites. However, these languages have been rapidly replaced by Portuguese in the last few decades, partly due to a government decision to integrate immigrant populations. Today, states like Rio Grande do Sul are trying to reverse that trend and immigrant languages such as German and Italian are being reintroduced into the curriculum again, in communities where they originally thrived. Meanwhile, on the Argentinian and Uruguayan border regions, Brazilian students are being introduced to the Spanish language.\n\nIn the city of São Paulo, Korean, Chinese and Japanese can be heard in the immigrants districts, like Liberdade.\nA Japanese-language newspaper, the \"São Paulo Shinbun\", has been published in the city of São Paulo since 1946. There is a significant community of Japanese speakers in São Paulo, Paraná, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará and Amazonas. Much smaller groups exist in Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and other parts of Brazil. Some Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Portuguese-based creole language called Macanese (\"patuá\" or \"macaísta\"), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese. Brazil has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan.\n\nMany Amerindian minority languages are spoken throughout Brazil, mostly in Northern Brazil. Indigenous languages with about 10,000 speakers or more are Ticuna (language isolate), Kaingang (Gean family), Kaiwá Guarani, Nheengatu (Tupian), Guajajára (Tupian), Macushi (Cariban), Terena (Arawakan), Xavante (Gean) and Mawé (Tupian). Tucano (Tucanoan) has half that number, but is widely used as a second language in the Amazon.\n\nOne of the two Brazilian \"línguas gerais\" (general languages), Nheengatu, was until the late 19th century the common language used by a large number of indigenous, European, African, and African-descendant peoples throughout the coast of Brazil—it was spoken by the majority of the population in the land. It was proscribed by the Marquis of Pombal for its association with the Jesuit missions. A recent resurgence in popularity of this language occurred, and it is now an official language in the city of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Today, in the Amazon Basin, political campaigning is still printed in this Tupian language.\n\nSpanish is understood to various degrees by many but not all Brazilians, due to the similarities of the languages. However, it is hardly spoken well by individuals who have not taken specific education in the language, due to the substantial differences in phonology between the two languages. In some parts of Brazil, close to the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians will use a rough mixture of Spanish and Portuguese that is sometimes known as Portuñol to communicate with their neighbors on the other side of the border; however, these Brazilians continue to speak Portuguese at home. In recent years, Spanish has become more popular as a second or third language in Brazil due in large part to the economic advantages that Spanish fluency brings in doing business with other countries in the region, since seven of the 11 countries that border Brazil use Spanish as an official language but falls behind English due to lack of interest by Brazilians in learning Spanish.\n\nIn São Paulo, the German-Brazilian newspaper \"Brasil-Post\" has been published for over fifty years. There are many other media organizations throughout the land specializing either in church issues, music, language etc.\n\nThe online newspaper \"La Rena\" is in Talian dialect and it offers Talian lessons. There are many other non-Portuguese publications, bilingual web sites, radio and television programs throughout the country.\n\nOn the Paraná state, there are several communities of Poles, Ukrainians and other Slavics that live in rural areas and in some municipalities such as Curitiba, Irati, Guarapuava, Ponta Grossa and Prudentópolis. Polish and Ukrainian are still spoken, mainly by oldest people. In the City of Foz do Iguaçu (on the border with Paraguay and Argentina), there are many Arabic speakers, these people are mainly immigrants from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nOn the Rio Grande do Sul state, there are several German and Italian colonized cities, communities and groups. Most small cities have German or Italian as their second language. In the capital Porto Alegre, it is easy to find people who speak one of those or both.\n\nThere are also at least two ethnic neighborhoods in the country: Liberdade, bastion of Japanese immigrants, and Bixiga, stronghold of Italian immigrants, both in São Paulo; however, these neighborhoods do not count yet with specific legislation for the protection of Japanese and Italian languages in these sites.\n\nThis century has seen the growth of a trend of co-official languages in cities populated by immigrants (such as Italian and German) or indigenous in the north, both with support from the Ministry of Tourism, as was recently established in Santa Maria de Jetibá, Pomerode and Vila Pavão, where German also has co-official status.\n\nThe first municipality to adopt a co-official language in Brazil was São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in 2002. Since then, other municipalities have attempted to adopt their own co-official languages.\n\nThe states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul have Talian officially approved as a heritage language in these states, and Espírito Santo has the East Pomeranian dialect, along with the German language as cultural heritage.\n\nAlso in production is the documentary video \"Brasil Talian\", with directed and written by André Costantin and executive producer of the historian Fernando Roveda. The pre-launch occurred on 18 November 2011, the date that marked the start of production of the documentary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ethnologue lists 215 living languages. The official language, inherited from the colonial period, is French. Four indigenous languages have the status of national language: Kituba (called \"Kikongo\"), Lingala, Swahili and Tshiluba.\n\nWhen the country was a Belgian colony, it had already instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. During the colonial period Dutch and French were the official languages but French was by far the more important.\n\nFrench is the official language of the country since its colonial period under Belgian rule. Therefore, the variety of French used in the DRC has many similarities with Belgian French. French has been maintained as the official language since the time of independence because it is widely spoken around the educated groups in the country, it belongs to none of the indigenous ethnic groups and eases communication between them as well as with the rest of the Francophonie, which includes many African countries. According to a 2014 OIF report, 33 million Congolese people (47% of the population) can read and write in French. In the capital city Kinshasa, 67% of the population can read and write French, and 68.5% can speak and understand it. The Democratic Republic of the Congo currently has the largest French-speaking population of any country outside France.\n\nThe constitution says Kikongo is one of the national languages, but in fact it is a Kikongo-based creole, Kituba (\"Kikongo ya Leta\" \"Kikongo of the government\", \"Leta\" being derived from French \"l'État\" \"the State\") that is used in the constitution and by the administration in the provinces of Bas-Congo (which is inhabited by the Bakongo), Kwango, and Kwilu. Kituba has become a vernacular language in many urban centres including Kikwit, Bandundu, Matadi, Boma and Muanda.\n\nLingala is a language which gained its modern form in the colonial period, with the push of missionaries to standardize and teach a local \"lingua franca\". It was originally spoken in the upper Congo river area but rapidly spread to the middle Congo area and eventually became the major Bantu language in Kinshasa for many reasons.\n\nLingala was made the official language of the army under Mobutu, but since the rebellions, the army has also used Swahili in the east. With the transition period and the consolidation of different armed groups into the Congolese Army, the linguistic policy has returned to its previous form and Lingala is again the official language of the Army.\n\nSwahili is the most widespread \"lingua franca\" spoken in Eastern Equatorial Africa. Many variations of Swahili are spoken in the country but the major one is Kingwana, sometimes called \"Copperbelt Swahili\", especially in the Katanga area.\n\nThe constitution does not specify which of the two major variations of Tshiluba is the national language. Luba-Kasai is spoken in the East Kasai Region (Luba people) and Luba-Lulua is used in the West Kasai Region among the Bena Lulua people. Luba-Kasai seems to be the language used by the administration. A related language, known as Luba-Katanga, is spoken in Katanga Province.\n\nThere are 12 deaf institutions in the country, and most teach French Sign Language or variations. American Sign Language is also practiced in the country.\n\nThe most notable other languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are Mashie, Mongo, Lunda, Kilega, Tetela, Chokwe, Budza, Ngbandi, Lendu, Mangbetu, Nande, Ngbaka, Zande, Lugbara and Komo.\n\nAs of 2010 the government decided to include Portuguese as an optional language at schools as a reflex of Brazil's increasing influence on the continent, and of the growing and considerable Angolan and Mozambican immigrant communities.\n\nAmong the slangs spoken in the Congo, Indubil has been noted since around the sixties and continues to evolve today.\n\n"}
{"id": "493820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493820", "title": "Languages of the European Union", "text": "Languages of the European Union\n\nThe languages of the European Union are languages used by people within the member states of the European Union (EU).\n\nThe EU has 24 official languages, of which three (English, French and German) have the higher status of \"procedural\" languages of the European Commission (whereas the European Parliament accepts all official languages as working languages). One language (Irish) previously had the lower status of \"treaty language\" before being upgraded to an official and working language in 2007, although it has been temporarily derogated as a working language until 2021 due to difficulty finding qualified translators. The three procedural languages are those used in the day-to-day workings of the institutions of the EU. The designation of Irish as a \"treaty language\" meant that only primary legislation (the treaties) was to be translated into Irish, whereas secondary legislation (Directives and Regulations) did not have to be.\n\nThe EU asserts that it is in favour of linguistic diversity. This principle is enshrined in the EU Charter (art. 22) and in the Treaty on European Union (art. 3(3) TEU).\n\nIn the European Union, language policy is the responsibility of member states and EU does not have a common language policy; European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, based on the principle of \"subsidiarity\", they promote a European dimension in the member states' language policies. The EU encourages all its citizens to be multilingual; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their native language. Though the EU has very limited influence in this area as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states, a number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity.\n\nThe most widely spoken language in the EU is English, which is understood by 51% of all adults, while German is the most widely used mother tongue, spoken by 18%. All 24 official languages of the EU are accepted as working languages, but in practice only two – English and French – are in wide general use and of these English is the more commonly used. French is an official language in all three of the cities that are political centres of the Union: Brussels (Belgium), Strasbourg (France) and Luxembourg City (Luxembourg).\n\n, the official languages of the European Union, as stipulated in the latest amendment of \"Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community\" of 1958, are:\n\nThe number of member states exceeds the number of official languages, as several national languages are shared by two or more countries in the EU. Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, and Swedish are all official languages at the national level in multiple countries (see table above). In addition, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Slovak, and Slovene / Slovenian are official languages in multiple EU countries at the regional level.\n\nFurthermore, not all national languages have been accorded the status of official EU languages. These include Luxembourgish, an official language of Luxembourg since 1984, and Turkish, an official language of Cyprus.\n\nAll languages of the EU are also working languages. Documents which a member state or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a member state sends to institutions of the Community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender. The reply is drafted in the same language. Regulations and other documents of general application are drafted in the twenty-four official languages. The \"Official Journal of the European Union\" is published in the twenty-four official languages.\n\nLegislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all official languages, but that accounts for a minority of the institutions′ work. Other documents—e.g., communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence—are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, English, French, and German (sometimes called \"procedural languages\"), and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset. Non-institutional EU bodies are not legally obliged to make language arrangement for all the 24 languages (\"Kik v. Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market\", Case C-361/01, 2003 ECJ I-8283).\n\nThe linguistic translations are expensive. According to the EU's English-language website, the cost of maintaining the institutions’ policy of multilingualism—i.e., the cost of translation and interpretation—was €1,123 million in 2005, which is 1% of the annual general budget of the EU, or €2.28 per person per year. The EU Parliament has made clear that its member states have autonomy for language education, which by treaty the European Community must respect.\n\nThe vast majority of EU languages belong to the Indo-European family, the three dominant subfamilies being the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic. Germanic languages are spoken in central and northern Europe and include Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Romance languages are spoken in western, southern European regions; they include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The Slavic languages are to be found in the central Europe and the Balkans in southern Europe. They include Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The Baltic languages, Latvian and Lithuanian; the Celtic languages, including Irish; and Greek are also Indo-European.\n\nOutside the Indo-European family, Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian are Uralic languages while Maltese is the only Afroasiatic language with official status in the EU. The Basque language, a language isolate whose roots are unknown, is an official language in some parts of northern Spain, but not an official language of the EU.\n\nMost official EU languages are written in the Latin script. The two exceptions are Greek, which is written in the Greek script, and Bulgarian, which is written in Cyrillic script. With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts. The current design of euro banknotes has the word \"euro\" written in both the Latin and Greek (Ευρώ) alphabets; the Cyrillic spelling (Eвро) was added to the new Europa series of banknotes started in 2013 (see Linguistic issues concerning the euro).\n\nAlthough Maltese is an official language, the Council set a transitional period of three years from 1 May 2004, during which the institutions were not obliged to draft all acts in Maltese. It was agreed that the Council could extend this transitional period by an additional year, but decided not to. All new acts of the institutions were required to be adopted and published in Maltese from 30 April 2007.\n\nWhen Ireland joined the EEC (now the EU) in 1973, Irish was accorded \"Treaty Language\" status. This meant that the founding EU Treaty was restated in Irish. Irish was also listed in that Treaty and all subsequent EU Treaties as one of the authentic languages of the Treaties. As a Treaty Language, Irish was an official procedural language of the European Court of Justice. It was also possible to correspond in written Irish with the EU Institutions.\n\nHowever, despite being the first official language of the Republic of Ireland and having been accorded minority-language status in the UK region of Northern Ireland, Irish was not made an official working language of the EU until 1 January 2007. On that date an EU Council Regulation making Irish an official working language of the EU came into effect. This followed a unanimous decision on 13 June 2005 by EU foreign ministers that Irish would be made the 21st official language of the EU. However, a derogation stipulates that not all documents have to be translated into Irish as is the case with the other official languages.\n\nThe regulation means that legislation approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers is translated into Irish, and interpretation from Irish is available at European Parliament plenary sessions and some Council meetings. The cost of translation, interpretation, publication, and legal services involved in making Irish an official EU language is estimated at just under €3.5 million a year. On December 3, 2015, a new regulation passed by the Council has set a definitive schedule on the gradual reduction of the derogation of the Irish language. This new regulation outlines an actual schedule of gradual reduction spread across five years starting from 2016. If EU institutions have sufficient available translation capacity, and if no other Council regulations state otherwise, the derogation completely ends by January 2022.\n\nIrish is the only official language of the Union that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state. According to the 2006 Irish census figures, there are 1.66 million people in Ireland with some ability to speak Irish, out of a population of 4.6 million, though only 538,500 use Irish on a daily basis (counting those who use it mainly in the education system) and just over 72,000 use Irish as a daily language outside the education system.\n\nDue to the close similarity between Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrinwhich are mutually intelligibleit was proposed that only one hybrid language be accepted as an official EU language as opposed to four separate ones (as in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia) in order to reduce translation costs. In negotiations with Croatia, however, it was accepted that Croatian would become a separate official EU language.\n\nWhen the United Kingdom and Ireland joined the EU's predecessor in 1973, French was the dominant language of the institutions. With the addition of Sweden and Finland in the 1990s, and the Eastern European states in the 2000s, English slowly supplanted French as the dominant working language of the institutions. In 2015, it was estimated that 80% of legislative proposals were drafted first in English. The role of English as a lingua franca is believed to be likely to continue, given how heavily staff rely on it.\n\nThe interpretation of the legal rules covering the use of Official Languages has been open to speculation following the result of the Brexit referendum. Danuta Hübner, the head of the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, has claimed that, after Brexit, English will no longer be an official EU language. However, this statement has been contradicted by the European Commission Representation in Ireland, whose spokesperson described Ms Hübner's claim as \"incorrect\", as well as by President Jean-Claude Juncker in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 9 August 2017.\n\nAccording to the Euromosaic study, some regional or minority languages spoken within the EU do not have official recognition at EU level. Some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser-used official languages. The official languages of EU are in bold.\n\nIn the list those idioms deemed by member states as mere dialects of an official language are not included. However many of these dialects are often viewed as separate languages: Scots—the Germanic language descended from Old English, not the Celtic language known as Scottish Gaelic—and several Romance languages spoken in Portugal, France and Italy, such as Mirandese, Lombard, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian, Corsican, Neapolitan, and Sicilian.\n\nThe French constitution stipulates French as the sole language of the Republic. Since the 2008 modifications, article 75-1 of the Constitution adds that \"regional languages form part of the French heritage\".\n\nNevertheless, there exist a number of languages spoken by sizeable minorities, such as Breton (a Celtic language), Basque, and several Romance languages such as Occitan, Catalan, Corsican and the various langues d'oïl (other than French), as well as Germanic languages spoken in Alsace-Lorraine (Central Franconian, High Franconian, Luxembourgish, and Alemannic) and French Flanders (Dutch).\n\nThese languages enjoy no official status under the French state and regions are not permitted to bestow any such status themselves. Since December 2004, Breton and Gallo are officially recognized in Brittany.\n\nThe Spanish governments have sought to give some official status in the EU for the languages of the autonomous communities of Spain, Catalan/Valencian, Galician and Basque. The 667th Council Meeting of the Council of the European Union in Luxembourg on 13 June 2005, decided to authorise limited use at EU level of languages recognised by member states other than the official working languages. The Council granted recognition to \"languages other than the languages referred to in Council Regulation No 1/1958 whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law.\" The official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the Council and the requesting member state.\n\nAlthough Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician are not nationwide official languages in Spain, as co-official languages in the respective regions – pursuant to Spanish constitution, among other documents – they are eligible to benefit from official use in EU institutions under the terms of the 13 June 2005 resolution of the Council of the European Union. The Spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages.\n\nThe status of Catalan, spoken by over 9 million EU citizens (just over 1.8% of the total), has been the subject of particular debate. On 11 December 1990, the use of Catalan was the subject of a European Parliament Resolution (resolution A3-169/90 on languages in the [European] Community and the situation of Catalan).\n\nOn 16 November 2005, the President Peter Straub of the Committee of the Regions signed an agreement with the Spanish Ambassador to the EU, , approving the use of Spanish regional languages in an EU institution for the first time in a meeting on that day, with interpretation provided by European Commission interpreters.\n\nOn 3 July 2006, the European Parliament's Bureau approved a proposal by the Spanish State to allow citizens to address the European Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, two months after its initial rejection.\n\nOn 30 November 2006, the European Ombudsman, Nikiforos Diamandouros, and the Spanish ambassador in the EU, Carlos Bastarreche, signed an agreement in Brussels to allow Spanish citizens to address complaints to the European Ombudsman in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, all four co-official languages in Spain. According to the agreement, a translation body, which will be set up and financed by the Spanish government, will be responsible for translating complaints submitted in these languages. In turn, it will translate the Ombudsman's decisions from Spanish into the language of the complainant. Until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective; so far the body has not been created nor there is any budget allocated to this end. This leaving Catalan speakers without access to EU institutions in their mother tongue.\n\nGalician in particular, not being itself a European Parliament official language, can be used and is in fact used by some European Parliament constituents as a spoken dialect of Portuguese due to its similarity with this language.\n\nLuxembourgish (Luxembourg) and Turkish (Cyprus) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Neither Luxembourg nor Cyprus have yet used the provision of the 13 June 2005 resolution to benefit from use in official EU institutions. On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a “gesture” that could help reunification and improve EU–Turkey relations. Already in 2004, it was planned that Turkish would become an official language when Cyprus reunites.\n\nOn 15 July 2008 the EU Council approved the naming of Welsh as a co-official language of the European Union. Scottish Gaelic received the same status in October 2009.\n\nThe Romani people, numbering over two million in the EU, speak the Romani language, which is not official in any EU member state or polity. Moreover, Romani mass media and educational institution presences are near-negligible.\n\nThough not an official language of the European Union, Russian is widely spoken in all member states that were part of the Soviet Union (and before that the Russian Empire). Russian is the native language of about 1.6 million Baltic Russians residing in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, as well as a sizeable community of about 3.5 million in Germany and as a major immigrant language elsewhere in the EU. Russian is also understood by a majority of ethnic Latvians, Estonians, and Lithuanians born before c. 1980, since, as official language of the Soviet Union, it was a compulsory school subject in those countries during the Soviet era. To a lesser extent, this legacy also holds true among the older generation in parts of the EU that were formerly part of the Eastern bloc, such as the GDR.\n\nOn March 2010 fact-sheets in Russian produced by the EU executive's offices in Latvia were withdrawn, provoking criticism from Plaid Cymru MEP and European Free Alliance group President Jill Evans who called European Commission to continue to provide information in non-official EU languages and commented that \"it's disappointing to hear that the EU is bowing to pressure to exclude Russian speakers in the Baltic in this way\".\n\nIn Finland, the Sami languages Northern Sami (ca. 2000 speakers), Skolt Sami (400) and Inari Sami (300) have limited local recognition in certain municipalities of Finnish Lapland. Furthermore, legislation specifically concerning the Sami must be translated to these languages. Bilingualism with Finnish is universal, though.\n\nThree different Sami languages are spoken in Sweden, but \"Sami language\" (undifferentiated) is recognised as an official minority language in Sweden, and is co-official with Swedish in four municipalities in Norrbotten County (Swedish Lapland). Most of Sami speakers speak Northern Sami (5,000–6,000 speakers), although there are ca. 1,000–2,000 Lule Sami speakers and 600 Southern Sami speakers.\n\nFor millennia, Latin has served as a \"lingua franca\" for administrative, scholarly, religious, political, etc. purposes in the area of the present-day European Union. After the unique case of Athens and other Greek city-states of the 6th to 4th centuries B.C., the first documented political entity historically verifiable in Europe was the Roman Republic (traditionally founded in 509 B.C.) - the successor-state to the Etruscan city-state confederacies.\nLatin as a \"lingua franca\" of Europe was rivalled only by Greek. It still served as the official language in universities in the 20th century, and has operated as the official language of the Roman Catholic Church until today. Latin, along with Greek, has been at the core of education in Europe from the schools of rhetoric of the Roman Republic in all of its provinces and territories, through the medieval \"trivium\" and \"quadrivium\", through the humanists and the Renaissance, all the way to Newton's \"Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis\" (just to name one example of thousands of scientific works written in this language), to the public schools of all European countries, where Latin (along with Greek) is at the core of their curricula. Latin served as the undisputed European \"lingua franca\" until the 19th century, when the cultures of unwritten languages and the \"national languages\" started to gain ground and claim status. Today, several institutions of the European Union use Latin in their logos and domain names instead of listing their names in all the official languages. For example, the Court of Justice has its website at \"curia.europa.eu\". The Court of Auditors uses \"Curia Rationum\" in its logo. The Council of the European Union has its website at http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ and its logo showing \"Consilium\". The European Union itself has a Latin motto: \"In varietate concordia\". Under the European Company Regulation, companies can be incorporated as \"Societas Europaea\" (Latin for \"European Company\", often shortened to \"SE\" after the company's own proper name). Latin is one of the languages of IATE (the inter-institutional terminology database of the European Union).\n\nEsperanto is part of the educational system in several member states. In Hungary it is officially recognised by the Ministry of Education as a foreign language; and examinations in Esperanto may be used to meet the requirements of knowledge of foreign languages needed to complete university or high school. Every year, since 2001, between 1000 and 3000 people have passed examinations in Esperanto, making up for a sum of more than 35,000 up to 2016; it is recognised by the Hungarian state. The Hungarian census 2001 found 4575 Esperanto speakers in Hungary (4407 of them learned the language, for 168 of them it is a family or native language); In 2011 it found 8397 Esperanto speakers. 25 years ago, in 1990 there were only 2083 Esperanto speakers in Hungary following the census.\n\nEsperanto is not mentioned by the EU Commission as an EU language; the Commission mentions only official, indigenous regional and minority languages as well as languages of immigrants. Following estimates there are approximately 100,000 Europeans sometimes using Esperanto (and several millions having learned Esperanto); the language has several thousand native speakers, some of them of the second or third generation.\n\nThe European party Europe – Democracy – Esperanto seeks to establish the planned language as an official second language in the EU in order to make international communication more efficient and fair in economical and philosophical terms. They are based on the conclusions of the Grin Report, which concluded that it would hypothetically allow savings to the EU of €25 billion a year (€54 for every citizen) and have other benefits. However, the EU Parliament has stated clearly that language education is the responsibility of member states.\n\nThe European Esperanto Union also promotes Esperanto as the international auxiliary language of Europe.\n\nA wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by immigrant communities in EU countries. Turkish is spoken as a first language by an estimated 1% of the population in Belgium and the western part of Germany, and by 1% in the Netherlands. Other widely used migrant languages include Berber languages which is spoken by about 1% of the population of both the Netherlands and Belgium and by many Berbers migrants in France, Spain, Italy and Germany. Arabic is spoken in many EU countries mainly in its two varieties Maghrebi Arabic and Levantine Arabic. The Maghrebi Arabic is spoken by migrants in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The Levantine Arabic is spoken by migrants in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Greece. Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, and Punjabi are spoken by immigrants from the Indian sub-continent in the United Kingdom. Languages from former Yugoslavia (Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, Albanian, etc.) are spoken in many parts of the EU by migrants and refugees who have left the region as a result of the Yugoslav wars and unrest there.\n\nThere are large Chinese communities in France, the UK, Spain, Italy, and other countries. Some countries have Chinatowns. Old and recent Chinese migrants speak a number of Chinese varieties, in particular Cantonese and other southern Chinese varieties. However, Mandarin is becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the opening of the People's Republic of China.\n\nThere are many Russian-speaking immigrants in Germany, France and United Kingdom.\n\nMany immigrant communities in the EU have been in place for several generations now and their members are bilingual, at ease both in the local language and in that of their community.\n\nA wide variety of sign languages are used in the EU, with around 500,000 people using a sign language as their first language. None of these languages are recognised as an official language of an EU member state, and only two states (Finland and Portugal) refer to sign languages in their constitution.\n\nSeveral NGOs exist which support signers, such as the European Union of the Deaf and the European Sign Language Centre. The European Commission has also supported some initiatives to produce digital technologies that can better support signers, such as Dicta-Sign and SignSpeak.\n\nThe sign languages in use in the EU are more difficult to classify into language families than the spoken languages, because of language contact and creolization. Important families include the British, French, and German sign language families.\n\nMacedonian, Yiddish and Serbian are not official languages of the EU.\n\nThe five most spoken languages in the EU are English (51%), German (32%), French (26%), Italian (16%) and Spanish (15%). At 18% of the total number of speakers, German is the most widely spoken native language, followed by Italian, English, French and Spanish. The knowledge of foreign languages varies considerably in the specific countries, as the table below shows. The most spoken second or foreign languages in the EU are English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Italian. In the table, boxes coloured light blue mean that the language is an official language of the country, while the main language spoken in the country is coloured dark blue.\n\n56% of citizens in the EU member states are able to hold a conversation in one language apart from their native language. This is nine points higher than reported in 2001 among the 15 member states at the time. 28% of the respondents state that they speak two foreign languages well enough to have a conversation. Almost half of the respondents—44%—do not know any other language than their native language. Approximately 1 in 5 Europeans can be described as an active language learner (i.e., someone who has recently improved his/her language skills or intends to do so over the following 12 months).\n\nEnglish remains by far the most widely spoken foreign language throughout Europe. 95% of students in the EU study English at secondary level and 38% of EU citizens state that they have sufficient skills in English to have a conversation (excluding citizens of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the two English-speaking countries). 28% of Europeans indicate that they know either French (14%) or German (14%), along with their native language. French is most commonly studied and used in southern Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries, in Germany, Portugal, Romania, the UK, and Ireland. German, on the other hand, is commonly studied and used in the Benelux countries, in Scandinavia, and in the newer EU member states. Spanish is most commonly studied in France, Italy, Luxembourg, and Portugal. In 19 out of 29 countries polled, English is the most widely known language apart from the native language, this being particularly the case in Sweden (89%), Malta (88%); the Netherlands (87%); and Denmark (86%). 77% of EU citizens believe that children should learn English. English was considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research was conducted except for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Luxembourg. English, either as a native language or as a second/foreign language, is spoken by 51% of EU citizens, followed by German with 32% and French with 26%.\nWith the enlargement of the European Union, the balance between French and German is slowly changing. More citizens in the new member states speak German (23% compared with 12% in the EU15) while fewer speak French or Spanish (3% and 1% respectively compared with 16% and 7% among the EU15 group). A notable exception is Romania, where 24% of the population speaks French as a foreign language compared to 6% who speak German as a foreign language. At the same time, the balance is being changed in the opposite direction by growth of the French-speaking population and decrease of the German-speaking population.\n\nLanguage skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of Europe and over sociodemographic groups. Reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small member states with several state languages, lesser used native languages or \"language exchange\" with neighbouring countries. This is the case in Luxembourg, where 92% speak at least two languages. Those who live in southern European countries or countries where one of the major European languages is a state language have a lower likelihood of speaking multiple foreign languages. Only 5% of Turkish, 13% of Irish, 16% of Italians, 17% of Spanish and 18% from the UK speak at least two languages apart from their native language.\n\nWhile documents for and communication with citizens are in every official EU language as a right, day-to-day work in the European Commission is based around its three working languages: English, French, and German. Of these English and French are used the most often. The use of English vs. French depends a lot on the unit or directorate. Only a few of the Commissioners use a language other than English or French as their working language. German is rarely used as a true working language in the Commission, and German media have called the dominance of English and French a discrimination against German (which is by far the most spoken mother tongue of the EU) and a violation of the regulations pertaining to the EU's working languages. The German Bundestag has repeatedly called for German to finally receive an equal position in the EU Commission alongside English and French. The language situation also disappoints many in France, and Kristalina Georgieva, who is from Bulgaria, gained a round of applause when she told Parliament she would learn French while in the Commission. Parliament itself translates its proceedings into all official languages, although the actual spoken language of MEPs is sometimes English or French, so that fellow MEPs can understand them better than if they had the delayed translation. Committee meetings also often default to the language most understood by those attending instead of listening to the translation.\n\nThe working language of the Court of Justice of the European Union is French. The judges deliberate in French, pleadings and written legal submissions are translated into French, and the judgment is drafted in French. The Advocates-General, by contrast, may work and draft their opinions in any official language, as they do not take part in any deliberations. These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations.\n\nThe working language of the ECB is English.\n\nThe European Union's legal powers on legislative acts and other initiatives on language policy are based on the provisions of the Treaties of the European Union. In the EU, language policy is the responsibility of member states, and the European Union does not have a common \"language policy\". Based on the principle of subsidiarity, European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in the member states' language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states (Article 149.2). The rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in the Statute of the Court of Justice, be determined by the Council, acting unanimously (Article 290). All languages, in which was originally drawn up or was translated due to enlargement, are legally equally authentic. Every citizen of the Union may write to any of the EU institutions or bodies in one of these languages and receive an answer in the same language (Article 314).\n\nIn the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding since its inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty, the EU declares that it respects linguistic diversity (Article 22) and prohibits discrimination on grounds of language (Article 21). Respect for linguistic diversity is a fundamental value of the European Union, in the same way as respect for the person, openness towards other cultures, and tolerance and acceptance of other people.\n\nBeginning with the \"\" in 1990, the European Union invests more than €30 million a year (out of a €120 billion EU budget) promoting language learning through the \"Socrates\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci\" programmes in bursaries to enable language teachers to be trained abroad, placing foreign language assistants in schools, funding class exchanges to motivate pupils to learn languages, creating new language courses on CDs and the Internet, and projects that raise awareness of the benefits of language learning.\n\nThrough strategic studies, the Commission promotes debate, innovation, and the exchange of good practice. In addition, the mainstream actions of Community programmes which encourage mobility and transnational partnerships motivate participants to learn languages.\n\nYouth exchanges, town twinning projects, and the European Voluntary Service also promote multilingualism. Since 1997, the Culture 2000 programme has financed the translation of around 2,000 literary works from and into European languages.\n\nThe new programmes proposed for implementation for the financial perspective 2007–2013 (Culture 2007, Youth in Action, and Lifelong Learning) will continue and develop this kind of support.\n\nThe EU used to provide the main financial support to the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages until 2010, a non-governmental organisation which represents the interests of the over 40 million citizens who belong to a regional and minority language community, and for the Mercator networks of universities active in research on lesser-used languages in Europe. Following a request from the European Parliament, the Commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new EU agency, the \"European Agency for Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity.\" The study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field, and proposes two options: creating an agency or setting up a European network of \"Language Diversity Centres.\" The Commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and, where possible, should build on existing structures; it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi-annual basis through the proposed Lifelong Learning programme. Another interesting step would be to translate important public websites, such as the one of the European Central Bank, or Frontex web site also, in at least one other language than English or French.\n\nAlthough not an EU treaty, most EU member states have ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nTo encourage language learning, the EU supported the Council of Europe initiatives for European Year of Languages 2001 and the annual celebration of European Day of Languages on 26 September.\n\nTo encourage the member states to cooperate and to disseminate best practice the Commission issued a Communication on 24 July 2003, on Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: an Action Plan 2004 – 2006 and a Communication on 22 November 2005, on A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism.\n\nFrom 22 November 2004, the European Commissioner for Education and Culture portfolio included an explicit reference to languages and became European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism with Ján Figeľ at the post. From 2007 until 2010, the European Commission had a special portfolio on languages, European Commissioner for Multilingualism. The post was held by Leonard Orban. Since 2010, the portfolio was merged with education and culture, again.\n\nEU devotes a specialised subsite of its \"Europa\" portal to languages, the EUROPA Languages portal.\n\n\n\n"}

Firth, Benjamin Lee Whorf, Louis Hjelmslev, and Michael Halliday.\n\nThe paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” \n\n“System” is used in two related ways in systemic functional linguistics (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from Hjelmslev In this context, Jay Lemke describes language as an open, dynamic system.\n\nThere is also the notion of “system” as used by J.R. Firth, where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure. Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.\n\nIn this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.\n\nIn Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” \n\nIn adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of complex systems.\n"}
{"id": "907167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=907167", "title": "Logocentrism", "text": "Logocentrism\n\n\"Logocentrism\" is a term coined by the German philosopher Ludwig Klages in the 1920s. It refers to the tradition of Western science and philosophy that regards words and language as a fundamental expression of an external reality. It holds the logos as epistemologically superior and that there is an original, irreducible object which the logos represents. It, therefore, holds that one's presence in the world is necessarily mediated. According to logocentrism, the logos is the ideal representation of the Platonic ideal.\n\nWith the logos as the site of a representational unity, linguistics dissects the structure of the logos further and establishes the sound of the word, coupled with the sense of the word, as the original and ideal location of metaphysical significance. Logocentric linguistics proposes that \"the immediate and privileged unity which founds significance and the acts of language is the articulated unity of sound and sense within the phonic.\" As the science of language, linguistics is a science by way of this semiotic phonology. It follows, therefore, that speech is the primary form of language and that writing is secondary, representative, and, importantly, outside of speech. Writing is a \"sign of a sign\" and, therefore, is basically phonetic.\n\nJonathan Culler in his book \"Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction\" says:\n\nThis notion that the written word is a sign of a sign has a long history in Western thought. According to Aristotle (384BC-322BC), \"Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken words.\" Jean-Jacques Rousseau similarly states, \"Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre that one gives more care to the determining of the image than to the object.\"\n\nFerdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) follows this logocentric line of thought in the development of his linguistic sign and its terminology. Where the word remains known as the whole sign, the unification of concept and sound-image becomes the unification of the signified and the signifier respectively. The signifier is then composed of an indivisible sound and image whereby the graphic form of the sign is exterior.\n\nAccording to Saussure in his \"Course in General Linguistics\", \"The linguistic object is not defined by the combination of the written word and the spoken word: the spoken form alone constitutes the object.\" Language has, he writes, \"an oral tradition that is independent of writing.\"\n\nFrench philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) in his book \"Of Grammatology\" responds in depth to what he believes is Saussure's logocentric argument. Derrida deconstructs the apparent inner, phonological system of language, stating in Chapter 2, \"Linguistics and Grammatology\", that in fact and for reasons of essence Saussure's representative determination is \"...an ideal explicitly directing a functioning which...is never completely phonetic\". The idea that writing might function other than phonetically and also as more than merely a representative delineation of speech allows an absolute concept of logos to end in what Derrida describes as infinitist metaphysics. The difference in presence can never actually be reduced, as was the logocentric project; instead, the chain of signification becomes the trace of presence-absence.\n\nInherent in Saussure’s reasoning, a structuralist approach to literature began in the 1950s to assess the literary text, or utterance, in terms of its adherence to certain organising conventions which might establish its objective meaning. Again, as for Saussure, structuralism in literary theory is condemned to fail on account of its own foundation: ‘...language constitutes our world, it doesn’t just record it or label it. Meaning is always attributed to the object or idea by the human mind, and constructed by and expressed through language: it is not already contained within the thing’.\nThere is, therefore, no absolute truth outside of construction no matter how scientific or prolific that construction might be. Enter Derrida and post-structuralism. Other like-minded philosophers and psychoanalysts in the vein of post-structuralism include Nietzsche, Heidegger and Freud. Literary critic Roland Barthes (1915–1980), with his essay \"The Death of the Author\" (1968), converted from structuralism to post-structuralism.\n\nFor the post-structuralist the writer must be present in a kind of absence, or ‘dead’, according to Barthes; just as the reader is absent in a kind of presence at the ‘moment’ of the literary utterance. Post-structuralism is therefore against the moral formalism of the Western literary tradition which maintains only The Greats should be looked to for literary inspiration and indeed for a means of political control and social equilibrium.\n\nModernism, with its desire to regain some kind of lost presence, also resists post-structuralist thought; whereas Post-modernism accepts the loss (the loss of being as ‘presence’) and steps beyond the limitations of logocentrism.\n\nSome researchers consider that logocentrism may not be something which exists across all cultures, but instead has a particular bias in Western culture. Tedlock’s study of stories in the Quiché Maya culture leads him to suggest that the development of alphabetic writing systems may have led to a logocentric perspective, but this is not the case in all writing systems, and particularly less prevalent in cultures where writing has not been established. Tedlock writes, “The voice is linear, in [Derrida’s] view; there is only one thing happening at a time, a sequence of phonemes,” and this is reflected in writing and even the study of language in the field of linguistics and what Tedlock calls “mythologics (or larger-scale structuralism)”, “are founded not upon a multidimensional apprehension of the multidimensional voice, but upon unilinear writing of the smallest-scale articulations within the voice.” This one dimensionality of writing means that only words can be represented through alphabetic writing, and, more often than not, tone, voice, accent and style are difficult if not impossible to represent. Geaney, in writing about ming (names) in early Chinese reveals that ideographic writing systems present some difficulty for the idea of logocentrism, and that even Derrida wrote of Chinese writing in an ambivalent way, assuming firstly that “writing has a historical telos in which phonetic writing is the normal ‘outcome’”, but also “speculat[ing] without irony about Chinese writing as a ‘movement of civilization outside all logocentrism’”.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3194958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3194958", "title": "Loxian", "text": "Loxian\n\nLoxian is a fictional artistic language and alphabet created by Irish poet and lyricist Roma Ryan. A longtime recording and business partner of Irish singer-songwriter and musician Enya, she created the language during the production of the latter's sixth studio album, \"Amarantine\" (2005).\n\nDuring the recording of \"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\", a track on \"Amarantine\", Enya had sung its lyrics in English, Gaelic and Latin but found none was suitable in getting the message of the song across in a way that they were happy with. Ryan then wrote the first expression in Loxian, pronounced in English as \"Syoombraya\". After Enya sang it and was pleased with it, Ryan developed the language further and used it for two other tracks on \"Amarantine\"—\"Less Than a Pearl\" and \"The River Sings\". In the liner notes to the 2009 compilation album \"The Very Best of Enya\", \"It has been a truly unique journey ... We have journeyed from Aldebaran, the track that tells of the future migration of the Celts through space, to the three Loxian songs of \"Amarantine\", which were born of Aldebaran\". Enya recorded \"Aldebaran\" and released it on her 1987 debut album, \"Enya\".\n\nThe name \"Loxian\" was taken from the epithet of the Greek and Roman god Apollo, the god of prophecy, truth, the sun, among others. As Ryan wrote: \"A God of the sun whose name we have given to those who travel to the moon. It is a subtle irony. So, too, is the language of the Loxians, whose words we have woven into these songs, yet those very words belong to a future migration travelling beyond Aldebaran.\" Ryan used this particular name to link the history of this future generation of space travellers to us, their ancestors.\n\nLoxian has six basic scripts or alphabets: \"ea\" (the Water Script), \"pirrro\" (the Rain Script also called the Vernal Script), \"luua\" (the Shadow Script of summer), \"essa\" (the Autumnal Scripts of the winds – this particular season of scripts has many forms), \"ju\" (the Winter Script which has two visual alphabets) and \"kan\" (the Moon Script or Archer Script).\n\nThe Loxian scripts draw on visual origins. The script used in the booklet for \"Amarantine\" and in Ryan's book \"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\" is the ea script. Ryan has combined two influences in this particular script. She says \"The Old English word for water is 'ea' (in Middle English the word came to mean 'river' or 'running water') and the design for the alphabet came from water – the letters are, in fact, the common English alphabet used today. The shapes for this alphabet were created from water. I made the letters from water, which, being a fluid form, metamorphosed into the Loxian alphabet of Ea.\" All of the remaining scripts are based on visual inspiration. As Ryan says – \"Loxian began its life as a series of sounds. It was originally meant for only one song, and was to have no meaning, to be a 'soundscape'. The soundscape was Nicky’s idea. I had difficulty with the idea of having purely sounds in the song, and so began to create a meaning and a history behind them purely for myself. Then, as Enya wanted to use the ‘sounds’ or ‘words’ in two other tracks, Loxian was born. It developed into what I would call an art language. I was trying to create an experience; an expression that portrayed Nicky and Enya’s vision. I was not trying to create a new language, per se. Yet ironically, even now, the Loxian language continues to grow.”\n\nRyan, however, has said that while creating this ‘new language’ she was also very much aware of the fact that many of the languages of our world were dying. She said “Loxian is purely artistic and, although I have given it a history and culture, its primary function is still artistic. We are losing so many world languages. Language is more than everyday communication, it holds history, customs and information about its people and their way of life. As the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered languages tells us – roughly every two weeks a language dies”. \n\nRoma Ryan has written a book which explores some of the world of the Loxians and gives some background information on the three Loxian songs. The book \"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\" was released in two formats. The original, issued in 2005, is now out of print. A second publication was released by Warner Music in 2006. Each of these publications contains a book of poetry within it; the first contains the \"Amarantine\" poetry, and the latter poetry from \"The Way Obsidian Sings\".\n\nRyan also created an interactive, on-line game – The Loxian Games – which also explores the Loxian language and the Loxian world. It takes the form of riddles, quests and ‘treasure hunts’ and again has a strong visual aspect to it. \n\nThe language is used for the second time in song in Enya's 2015 album \"Dark Sky Island\", on two tracks which follow the 'intergalactic' theme of the title - 'The Forge of The Angels' and 'The Loxian Gate'. The narratives of these songs were said to continue the futuristic narrative Loxian is used for.\n\n"}
{"id": "574964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=574964", "title": "Motorboat", "text": "Motorboat\n\nA motorboat, speedboat, or powerboat is a boat which is powered by an engine. Some motorboats are fitted with inboard engines, others have an outboard motor installed on the rear, containing the internal combustion engine, the gearbox and the propeller in one portable unit.\n\nAn inboard-outboard contains a hybrid of an and an outboard, where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.\n\nThere are two configurations of an inboard, V-drive and direct drive. A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near the middle of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back, where a V-drive has the powerplant mounted in the back of the boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a \"V\" towards the rear. The V-drive has become increasingly popular due to wakeboarding and wakesurfing.\n\nAlthough the screw propeller had been added to an engine (steam engine) as early as the 18th century in Birmingham, England, by James Watt, boats powered by a petrol engine only came about in the later part of the 19th century with the invention of the internal combustion engine.\n\nThe earliest boat to be powered by a petrol engine was tested on the Neckar River by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in 1886, when they tested their new \"longcase clock\" engine. It had been constructed in the former greenhouse (converted into a workshop) in Daimler's back yard. The first public display took place on the Waldsee in Cannstatt, today a suburb of Stuttgart, at the end of that year. The engine of this boat had a single cylinder of 1 horse power. Daimler's second launch in 1887 had a second cylinder positioned at an angle of 15 degrees to the first one, and was known as the \"V-type\".\n\nThe first successful motor boat was designed by the Priestman Brothers in Hull, England, under the direction of William Dent Priestman. The company began trials of their first motorboat in 1888. The engine was powered with kerosene and used an innovative high-tension (high voltage) ignition system. The company was the first to begin large scale production of the motor boat, and by 1890, Priestman's boats were successfully being used for towing goods along canals.\n\nAnother early pioneer was Mr. J. D. Roots, who in 1891 fitted a launch with an internal combustion engine and operated a ferry service between Richmond and Wandsworth along the River Thames during the seasons of 1891 and 1892.\nThe eminent inventor Frederick William Lanchester recognized the potential of the motorboat and over the following 15 years, in collaboration with his brother George, perfected the modern motorboat, or powerboat. Working in the garden of their home in Olton, Warwickshire, they designed and built a river flat-bottomed launch with an advanced high-revving engine that drove via a stern paddle wheel in 1893. In 1897, he produced a second engine similar in design to his previous one but running on benzene at 800 r.p.m. The engine drove a reversible propeller. An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary carburettor, for mixing the fuel and air correctly. His invention was known as a \"wick carburetor\", because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks, from where it was vaporized. He patented this invention in 1905.\n\nThe Daimler Company began production of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in Coventry. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by air pressure to a large surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel friction wheels which engaged with two larger bevel friction wheels, the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.\n\nInterest in fast motorboats grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century. The Marine Motor Association was formed in 1903 as an offshoot of the Royal Automobile Club. \"Motor Boat & Yachting\" was the first magazine to address technical developments in the field and was brought out by Temple Press, London from 1904. Large manufacturing companies, including Napier & Son and Thornycroft began producing motorboats.\n\nThe first motorboating competition was established by Alfred Charles William Harmsworth in 1903. The Harmsworth Cup was envisioned as a contest between nations, rather than between boats or individuals. The boats were originally to be designed and built entirely by residents of the country represented, using materials and units built wholly within that country.\n\nThe first competition, held in July 1903, at Cork Harbour in Ireland, and officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club, was a very primitive affair, with many boats failing even to start. The competition was won by Dorothy Levitt in a Napier launch designed to the specifications of Selwyn Edge. This motorboat was the first proper motorboat designed for high speed. She set the world's first water speed record when she achieved in a steel-hulled, 75-horsepower Napier speedboat fitted with a three-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, \"S. F. Edge\" was engraved on the trophy as the winner.\nAn article in the \"Cork Constitution\" on 13 July reported \"A large number of spectators viewed the first mile from the promenade of the Yacht Club, and at Cork several thousand people collected at both sides of the river to see the finishes.\" Levitt was then commanded to the Royal yacht of King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill, and they discussed the performance of the motorboat and its potential for British government despatch work.\n\nFrance won the race in 1904, and the boat \"Napier II\" set a new world water speed record for a mile at almost 30 knots (56 km/h), winning the race in 1905.\n\nThe acknowledged genius of motor boat design in America, was the naval architect John L. Hacker. His pioneering work, including the invention of the V-hull and the use of dedicated petrol engines revolutionized boat design from as early as 1908, when he founded the Hacker Boat Co. In 1911, Hacker designed the \"Kitty Hawk\", the first successful step hydroplane which exceeded the then-unthinkable speed of and was at that time the fastest boat in the world. The Harmsworth Cup was first won by Americans in 1907. The US and England traded it back and forth until 1920. From 1920-1933, Americans had an unbroken winning streak. Gar Wood won this race eight times as a driver and nine times as an owner between 1920 and 1933.\n\nA motorboat has one engine or more that propel the vessel over the top of the water. Boat engines vary in shape, size and type. Engines are installed either inboard or outboard. Inboard engines are part of the boat construction, while outboatboard engines are secured to the transom and hangs off the back of the boat. Motorboat engines run on gasoline or diesel fuel. Engines come in various types. Engines vary in fuel type such as: gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, rotary combustion or steam. Motorboats are commonly used for recreation or racing. Boat racing is a sport where drivers and engineers compete for fastest boat. The American Powerboat Association (APBA) splits the sport into categories. The categories include: inboard, inboard endurance, professional outboard, stock outboard, unlimited outboard performance craft, drag, modified outboard and offshore. Engines and hulls categorize racing. The two types of hull shape are runabout and hydroplane. Runabout is a v-shape and hydroplane is flat and stepped. The type of hull used depends on the type of water the boat is in and how the boat is being used. Hulls can be made of wood, fiberglass or metal but most hulls today are fiberglass.\n\nHigh performance speedboats can reach speeds of over 50 knots. Their high speed and performance can be attributed to their hull technology and powerful engine. With a more powerful and heavier engine, an appropriate hull shape is needed. High performance boats include yachts, HSIC (high speed interceptor craft) and racing powerboats.\n\nA V-type hull helps a boat cut through the water. A deep V-hull helps keep the boat’s bow down at low speeds, improving visibility. V-hulls also improve a boat’s speed and maneuvering capabilities. They stabilize a boat in rough conditions.\n\nThe type of hull depends on the usage and type of water that the boat is being used in. Types of hulls include displacement hulls, vee-bottom hulls, modified vee-bottom hulls, deep-vee hulls and trim tabs for vee-bottom hulls. Hulls can be made of different materials. The three main materials are wood, reinforced fiberglass and metal. Wood hulls may be made of planks or plywood. Fiberglass hulls are reinforced with balsa wood. Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel.\n\nPowerboat racing engine categories for inboard and outboard engines range from 7.5 cu in to 60 cu in. Categories range from 44 cu in to 450 cu in for inboard only. The two types of motorboat races are speed races and predicted-log race. Speed races involve boats with powerful engines competing for quickest time and take place on freshwater bodies of water on a closed course. Races are marked by buoys. For unlimited hydroplanes the race distance ranges from 5 miles to 30 miles. Hydroplanes are drag raced. Predicted-log races involve slow cabin cruisers. Predicted-log races is a competition of planning and carrying out a sea voyage. The contestants evaluate different factors and variables that they will encounter along the way. The contestant with the least error at the end of the race is the winner. \n\nSome motorboats are also sailboats. Motorsailers are adaptable and can both sail and motor in all conditions. They tend to be inefficient in certain conditions where either a sail-only or motor-only boat would be ideal. \n\nA fast craft is a vessel capable of speeds over 30 knots. HSICs (High Speed Interceptor Craft) however, trump fast craft with speeds of over 50 knots. HSICs are usually either custom or law enforcement craft. Law enforcement use these extremely fast boats to catch criminals such as smugglers or drug traffickers who use fast craft as well. The military have started to use HSICs to stop international threats such as pirates, militias, terrorists and weapons traffickers. Originally HSICs were not meant to carry large weapons. Now that the military is using them, they are being built with heavy machine guns. The boats have to be fitted with robust weight control and at the same time have heavy amour. HSICs must do without propellers to account for cavitation and vibrations. Instead HSICs use surface drivers or water jets.\n\n"}

{"id": "37413241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37413241", "title": "School branding", "text": "School branding\n\nThe term “School Brand”, similar to \"brand\" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.\n\nWhile “branding” has history as far back as 1100 BCE, in a period referred to as the Vedic Period, “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.\n\nAccording to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges. Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as Procter & Gamble began using it in their marketing.\n\nHigher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers. The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nToday’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like. However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.\n\nSchools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message. For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.\n\nOne recent rebranding occurred when Beaver College, in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as Arcadia University in 2001.\n\nHarvard University, viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations. The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines \"Ask what you can do\" and \"Lessons learned\". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.\n\nAlthough colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States. Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.\n\nThe missing ingredient is brand development, as Columbia University discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.\n\nEven as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility. Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding. The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.\n\nToday’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products. Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.\n\nWhile many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The Sanford Herald notated a recent case with Lake Mary High School out of Florida, was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the Dodge Ram logo. In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.\n\nIn addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1324345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1324345", "title": "Shaka sign", "text": "Shaka sign\n\nThe shaka sign, sometimes known as \"hang loose,\" is a gesture of friendly intent often associated with Hawaii, and surf culture. It consists of extending the thumb and smallest finger while holding the three middle fingers curled, and gesturing in salutation while presenting the front or back of the hand; the hand may be rotated back and forth for emphasis. The shaka sign was adopted from local Hawaiian culture and customs by visiting surfers in the 1960s, and its use has spread around the world. It is primarily used as a greeting gesture or one to express thanks, acknowledgement, or even praise from one individual to another.\n\nResidents of Hawaii use the shaka to convey the \"Aloha Spirit\", a concept of friendship, understanding, compassion, and solidarity among the various ethnic cultures that reside in Hawaii, lacking a direct semantic to literal translation. The shaka can also be used to express \"howzit?\", \"thanks, eh?\", and \"all right!\". Drivers will often use it on the road to communicate distant greetings and gratitude.\n\nIn California, the shaka sign may be referred to as \"hang loose\" or \"hang ten\", both associated with surfer culture.\n\nThe gesture enjoys common use in American hang gliding culture, for both sentiment and word play, in part due to the simultaneous rise of surfing and hang gliding in California in the 1960s and 1970s. It is also widely used among triathletes, skydivers, base jumpers, wakeboarders, scuba divers, paragliders, skateboarders, & speed-flyers .\n\nAlong coastal Brazil, the shaka sign, known as the \"hang loose\" (also derived from an eponymous clothing brand, which uses the shaka as a logo), is a common gesture; Ronaldinho usually celebrated the goals he scored by giving the crowd a double shaka. It is also associated with the Brazilian jiu jitsu community internationally.\n\nThere are several Emoticon representations of the shaka sign - \\,,/, \\m/, and \\,,_. The earliest known use of the first two, with three commas or a lower case \"m\" corresponding to a hand's three middle fingers, is from 2006. The last, similar to the first except that it represents the thumb extended horizontally (as if perpendicular to the wrist) is reported, together with the first form, from Brigham Young University in 2016.\n\nThe sign can also be used to indicate the imbibing of a bottled drink, as attested to below, by placing the thumb to the mouth and motioning the little finger upward as if tipping up a bottle's bottom end. A similar meaning can be achieved by pressing the thumb up against the tip of the nose with the little finger raised upwards parallel to the bridge of the nose. Referred to as \"schooies\" (Australian slang for a schooner) the sign is thought to have originated in Perth.\n\nWith the thumb held near the ear and the little finger pointed at the mouth, the gesture is commonly understood to mean \"call me\", as it resembles a hand held telephone. The Unicode 9.0 emoji 🤙 \"Call me hand\" can be mistaken for a shaka sign.\n\nWith the fingers facing forward, the same gesture is the letter Y in the American manual alphabet. \n\nIn China, this gesture means \"6\". Often, “6” is used to praise someone who has done well in something as it has the same pronunciation as the word “溜”, which means “smooth”. Therefore, the gesture and the emoji 🤙 are also used as a compliment.\n\nIn Australia and Russia raising the thumb to the mouth while pointing the little finger to the air is seen as invitation for one to smoke marijuana, the posture resembling the use of a pipe. Similarly in New Zealand, this gesture symbolises smoking a \"P\" (methamphetamine) pipe, as well as variations of the shaka sign being the recognised gang salute for the Mongrel Mob.\n\nSince 2015, fans of the Mormon-sponsored Brigham Young University (also known colloquially as \"The Y\") have started using the gesture, in deference to newly hired Kalani Sitake, BYU's Polynesian head football coach, and because of its similarity with the letter Y in the American manual alphabet that is used with American Sign Language. Perhaps most importantly there, it is used as a nod of respect to Hamana Kalili, a native Hawaiian Mormon who according to locals is the founder of the popular sign.\n\nAccording to the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\", prevailing local lore credits the gesture to Hamana Kalili of Laie, who lost the three middle fingers of his right hand while working at the Kahuku Sugar Mill. Kalili was then shifted to guarding the sugar train, and his all-clear wave of thumb and pinkie is said to have evolved into the shaka as children imitated the gesture.\n\nAnother theory relates the origin of the shaka to the Spanish immigrants, who folded their middle fingers and took their thumbs to their lips as a friendly gesture to represent sharing a drink with the natives they met in Hawaii.\n\nYet another theory relates the origin to visiting whalers who signaled a catch with a \"tails up\" shaka.\n\nShaka and its very positive associations may simply derive from the popular World War II \"V for Victory\" hand sign, in Hawaii often held up and rotated rapidly back and forth, \"shaken\", hence shaka.\n\nThe late Lippy Espinda, a used car salesman and Oahu-based entertainer, has also been named as a possible creator of the shaka. Espinda, who frequently appeared as an extra in \"Hawaii Five-O\" as well as \"The Brady Bunch\" episodes shot in Hawaii, used the term and the sign during his television ads in the '60s. Though the claim that he is the originator of the shaka sign is debatable, he is credited with increasing its popularity and of Hawaiian Pidgin as well. The shaka has achieved great popularity in Australia, primarily among teenagers on social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary gives this etymology of 'shaka': Origin uncertain; perhaps < Japanese shaka, a byname of the historical Buddha (ultimately < Sanskrit śākyamuni, a byname of the Buddha, probably via Chinese), although if so the relationship with the hand gesture is unclear. U.S. colloq. (orig. and chiefly regional (Hawaii)). The definition is given as: Used to express affirmation, approval, solidarity, etc., often when greeting or parting from someone. Frequently in 'shaka brah'. The significant quote from the Oxford Dictionary is from an article in the May 1986 issue of the now defunct \"Surfing\" Magazine.\n\n"}

He is widely known as the Rashba (Hebrew: ), the Hebrew acronym of his title and name: Rabbi Shlomo ben Avraham.\n\nThe Rashba was born in Barcelona, Crown of Aragon, in 1235. He became a successful banker and leader of Spanish Jewry of his time. As a rabbinical authority his fame was such that he was designated as El Rab d'España (\"The Rabbi of Spain\"). He served as rabbi of the Main Synagogue of Barcelona for 50 years. He died in 1310.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nHis teachers were Nahmanides and Yonah Gerondi. He was a master in the study of the Talmud, and was not opposed to the Cabala. Adret was very active as a rabbi and as an author. Under his auspices and through his recommendation, part of the commentary on the Mishnah by Maimonides was translated from the Arabic into Hebrew. His Talmudic lectures were attended by throngs of disciples, many of whom came from distant places. Questions in great number, dealing with ritual, with the most varied topics of the Halakah, and with religious philosophy, were addressed to him from Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, and even from Asia Minor. His responsa show evidence of wide reading, keen intelligence, and systematic thought. They also afford a clear insight into the communal life of the time, portraying Adret's contemporaries, and are of value for the study not only of rabbinical procedure but also of the intellectual development of the age in which he lived. Only half of these responsa have been published, as they number three thousand.\n\nAmong his numerous students were Yom Tov Asevilli and Bahya ben Asher.\n\nA manuscript purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness, dated 1262, in favor of a certain Solomon Adret, Jew of Barcelona, and a passport for the same Adret, dated 1269, are still extant (Jacobs, \"Sources,\" pp. 16, 43, No. 130). \n\nAdret had to contend with the external enemies of Judaism, as well as with religious dissensions and excesses within its own ranks. He wrote a refutation of the charges of Raymond Martini, a Dominican monk of Barcelona, who, in his work, \"Pugio Fidei,\" had collected passages from the Talmud and the Midrash and interpreted them in a manner hostile to Judaism. These charges also induced Adret to write a commentary on the Haggadot, of which only a fragment is now extant. He refuted also the attacks of a Muslim who asserted that the priests had falsified the Bible. M. Schreiner (\"Z. D. M. G.\" xlviii, 39) has shown that this Muslim was Aḥmad ibn Ḥazm, and the book referred to was \"Al-Milal wal-Niḥal\" (Religions and Sects).\n\nAdret opposed also the increasing extravagances of the Kabbalists, who made great headway in Spain and were represented by Nissim ben Abraham of Avila, a pretended worker of miracles, and by Abraham Abulafia, the kabbalistic visionary. He combated these with vigor, but displayed no less animosity toward the philosophic-rationalistic conception of Judaism then prevailing, particularly in France, which was represented by Levi ben Abraham ben Ḥayyim, who treated most important religious questions with the utmost freedom, and who was joined by the Spaniard Isaac Albalag and others.\n\nOpposed to these was another tendency, the chief object of which was the preservation of the pure faith of Judaism. At the head of this movement stood Abba Mari ben Moses ha-Yarḥi. He appealed to Adret for assistance. An extensive correspondence ensued between the authorities of southern France and northern Spain, Adret taking a most important part. Afterward this correspondence was collected and published by Abba Mari, in a separate work, entitled \"Minḥat Ḳenaot\".\n\nAdret, whose disposition was peaceable, at first endeavored to conciliate the opposing spirits. Ultimately he was called upon to decide the affair, and on July 26, 1305, together with his colleagues of the rabbinate of Barcelona, he pronounced the ban of excommunication (ḥerem) over all who studied physics or metaphysics before the completion of their thirtieth year. A protest against this ban may be found in a poem in which Philosophy \"calls out in a loud voice against . . . Solomon ben Adret and against all the rabbis of France . . . who have placed under the ban all people who approach her\" (see H. Hirschfeld, \"Jew. Quart. Rev.\" xii. 140). Those who desired to study medicine as a profession were exempted from the ban. A special ban was pronounced against the rationalistic Bible exegetes and the philosophic Haggadah commentators, their writings and their adherents. The enforcing of these bans caused Adret much trouble and embittered the closing years of his life. He left three sons, Isaac, Judah, and Astruc Solomon, all of whom were learned in the Talmud.\n\nThe Rashba defended Rambam (Maimonides) during contemporary debates over his works, and he authorized the translation of Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah from Arabic to Hebrew.\n\nNevertheless, the Rashba was opposed to the philosophic-rationalistic approach to Judaism often associated with Rambam, and he was part of the \"beit din\" (rabbinical court) in Barcelona that forbade men younger than 25 from studying secular philosophy or the natural sciences (although an exception was made for those who studied medicine). On July 26, 1305, the Rashba wrote:\n\n\"In that city [Barcelona] are those who write iniquity about the Torah and if there would be a heretic writing books, they should be burnt as if they were the book of sorcerers.\"\n\nOf the works of Solomon ben Adret there have appeared in print:\n\nAderet was considered an outstanding rabbinic authority, and more than 3,000 of his responsa are known to be extant. Questions were addressed to him from Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, and even from Asia Minor. His responsa, which cover the entire gamut of Jewish life, are concise and widely quoted by halakhic authorities.\n\nAderet's responsa also illustrate his opposition to messianism and prophetic pretensions as a general phenomenon, with examples against Nissim ben Abraham and Abraham Abulafia.\n\nHis responsa were printed in Bologna (1539), Venice (1545), Hanau (1610), and other places. The second part of his responsa appeared under the title \"Toledot Adam\" (The Generations of Man) at Leghorn in 1657, the third part at the same place in 1778, the fourth part at Salonica in 1803, and the fifth part at Leghorn in 1825.\n\n\n\"In particular, the following articles were used as references:\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2980969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2980969", "title": "Shoring", "text": "Shoring\n\nShoring is the process of temporarily supporting a building, vessel, structure, or trench with shores (props) when in danger of collapse or during repairs or alterations. \"Shoring\" comes from \"shore\" a timber or metal prop. Shoring may be vertical, angled, or horizontal.\n\nRaking Shores consist of one or more timbers sloping between the face of the structure to be supported and the ground. The most effective support is given if the raker meets the wall at an angle of 60 to 70 degrees. A wall-plate is typically used to increase the area of support.\n\nFoundations\n\nShoring is commonly used when installing the foundation of a building. A shoring system such as piles and lagging or shotcrete will support the surrounding loads until the underground levels of the building are constructed.\n\nDuring excavation, shoring systems provide safety for workers in a trench and speeds up excavation. In this case, shoring should not be confused with shielding. Shoring is designed to prevent collapse where shielding is only designed to protect workers when collapses occur.\nConcrete-structure and stone-building shoring, in these cases also referred to as falsework, provides temporary support until the concrete becomes hard and achieves the desired strength to support loads.\n\nHydraulic Shoring\n\nHydraulic shoring is the use of hydraulic pistons that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or plywood, either being 1-1/8\" thick plywood, or special heavy Finland Form (FINFORM) 7/8\" thick.\n\nBeam and Plate\n\nBeam and Plate steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.\n\nSoil Nailing\n\nSoil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements - normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.\n\nShoring is used on board when damage has been caused to a vessel's integrity, and to hold leak-stopping devices in place to reduce or stop incoming water. Generally consists of timber 100 mm x 100 mm and used in conjunction with wedges, to further jam shoring in place, pad pieces to spread the load and dogs to secure it together. also used on board is mechanical shoring as a quick, temporary solution, however it isn't favoured due to its inability to move with the vessel.\n\nProud\n\nThis consists of a timber member jammed on a pad piece on either the deck or deck head depending on water levels in the compartment and a strong point, this is called the proud. Then there is a horizontal timber cut to size to fit between this and what it is shoring up, e.g. a splinter box, bulkhead or door. Timber wedges are then used to tighten up the structure if necessary.\n\nVertical Shoring\nThis is to support a hatch or splint box on the deck, consisting of a vertical timber between the deck and deck head, with to wedges used opposing each other to tighten it. pad pieces are used to spread the load on weak structures.\n\n\n"}

The mathematics involved include modular arithmetic, a bit of number theory, some linear algebra of two dimensions with matrices, some combinatorics, and a little statistics. \n\nSinkov did not explain the theoretical underpinnings of his statistics, or characterized its distribution, nor did he give a decision procedure for accepting or rejecting candidate plaintexts on the basis of their S scores. The situation becomes more difficult when comparing strings of different lengths because Sinkov does not explain how the distribution of his statistics changes with length, especially when applied to higher-order grams. As for how to accept or reject a candidate plaintext, Sinkov simply said to try all possibilities and to pick the one with the highest S value. Although the procedure works for some applications, it is inadequate for applications that require on-line decisions.

{"id": "10823878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10823878", "title": "Swarf", "text": "Swarf\n\nSwarf, also known as chips or by other process-specific names (such as turnings, filings, or shavings), are pieces of metal, wood, or plastic that are the debris or waste resulting from machining, woodworking, or similar subtractive (material-removing) manufacturing processes. Swarf or chips can be small particles (such as the gritty swarf from grinding metal or the sawdust from sawing or sanding wood); long, stringy tendrils (such as the springy chips from turning tough metals, or long shavings from whittling); slag-like waste (such as is produced within pipe during pipefitting work); or stone fragments and dust (as in masonry).\n\nSome of these terms are mass nouns (such as \"swarf\" and \"sawdust\") and some of them are count nouns (such as \"chips\", \"filings\", or \"shavings\"). \n\nThe rest of this article discusses metalworking swarf. Wood swarf is discussed at \"sawdust\".\n\nChips can be extremely sharp, and this creates a safety problem, as they can cause serious injuries if not handled correctly. Depending on the composition of the material, it can persist in the environment for a long time before degrading. This, combined with the small size of some chips (e.g. those of brass or bronze), allows them to disperse widely by piggy-backing on soft materials and also to penetrate the skin as deep splinters. \n\nIt is standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to avoid handling swarf with bare hands. Similarly, it is also standard training for machinists, and usually a standing workplace rule, to minimize or entirely avoid handling swarf by blowing chips away with compressed air, but this practice is considered burdensome or impractical by some machinists - the rule of thumb is to reduce the potential hazard by trying to eliminate the problem as far as reasonably practicable this could simply be done by keeping a clean working environment. Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a coolant hose discharging at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them). \n\nIt is not uncommon for chips flying off the cutter to be ejected with great force and to fly several metres. These flying chips present a hazard that is deflected with safety glasses, face shields, and other personal protective equipment, as well as the sheet-metal enclosures (and polycarbonate windows) that surround most commercial computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools.\n\nDue to its high surface area, swarf composed of some reactive metals can be highly flammable. Caution should be exercised to avoid ignition sources when handling or storing swarf in loose form, especially swarf of pure magnesium, magnesium alloy, pure titanium, titanium alloy, iron, and non-stainless steel.\n\nSwarf stored in piles or bins may also spontaneously combust, especially if the swarf is coated with cutting oil. \n\nTo extinguish swarf fires, a special fire extinguisher is needed, designed for fighting (metal) fires.\n\nSome common engineering materials such as beryllium are hazardous when finely divided and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent exposure.\n\nOptimum cutting efficiencies often generate long spring-like swarf. This is hard to deal with as it is bulky and can clog the nozzle of a shop vac. Clean-up and disposal of this continuous-cutting swarf is made simpler by using a cutting tool with a chip-breaker. This results in denser, more manageable waste.\nChip breaking tool geometry is generally designed to break the chip by having it curl back onto itself. This action produces many small spiral shaped rings instead of one long helical chip.\n\nDisposing of swarf is a tedious but necessary task. For ease of transport and handling, swarf may be compressed into \"bricks\", which greatly reduces associated problems with storing and cost; it also improves material handling for all concerned with its reclamation and recycling.\n\nMetal swarf can usually be recycled, and this is the preferred method of disposal due to the environmental concerns regarding potential contamination with cutting fluid or tramp oil. The ideal way to remove these liquids is by the use of a centrifuge which will separate the fluids from the metal, allowing both to be reclaimed and prepared for further treatment.\nSmall bundles of stainless steel or bronze swarf are sold as excellent scourers for dishwashing or cleaning encrustations of dirt.\nRecycling chips rather than putting them in the garbage stream (heading to landfilling or incineration) has various advantages: \n\nMachine shops are typically required by the scrap collector to: \n"}

{"id": "32881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32881", "title": "Warez", "text": "Warez\n\nWarez is a common computing and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of \"ware\" (short for computer software), and is intended to be pronounced like the word wares, . The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of warez groups has been referred to as \"The Scene,\" deriving from its earlier description as \"the warez scene.\" Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international copyright laws and agreements. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported (abandonware) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and \"enthusiast\" generators and distributors of such items.\n\nWarez, and its leetspeak form \"W4r3z\", are plural representations of the word \"ware\" (short for computer software), and are terms used to refer to \"[p]irated software distributed over the Internet,\" that is, \"[s]oftware that has been illegally copied and made available\" e.g., after having \"protection codes de-activated\". \"Cracking, or circumventing copy protection, is an essential part of the warez process,\" and via this commonality, the definition focused on computer software has been extended to include other forms of material under copyright protection, especially movies. As Aaron Schwabach notes, the term covers both supported and unsupported materials (the latter unsupported, termed abandonware), and legal recourses aimed at stemming the creation and distribution of warez are designed to cover both profit-driven and \"enthusiast\" practitioners. Hence, the term refers to copyrighted works that are distributed without fees or royalties and so traded in general violation of copyright law.\n\nThe term \"warez,\" which is intended to be pronounced like the word \"wares\" (/ˈwɛərz/), was coined in the 1990s; its origin is with an unknown member of an underground computing circle, but has since become commonplace among Internet users and the mass media. It is used most commonly as a noun: \"My neighbour downloaded 10 gigabytes of warez yesterday\"; but has also been used as a verb: \"The new Windows was warezed a month before the company officially released it\". The global collection of warez groups has been referred to as \"The Warez Scene,\" or more ambiguously \"The Scene.\" \n\nWhile the term 'piracy' is commonly used to describe a significant range of activities, most of which are unlawful, the relatively neutral meaning in this context is \"...mak[ing] use of or reproduc[ing] the work of another without authorization\". Some groups (including the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation, FSF) object to the use of this and other words such as \"theft\" because they represent an attempt to create a particular impression in the reader:The FSF advocates the use of terms like \"prohibited copying\" or \"unauthorized copying\", or \"sharing information with your neighbor.\" Hence, the term \"software pirate\" is controversial; FSF derides its use, while many self-described pirates take pride in the term, and some groups (e.g., Pirates with Attitudes) fully embrace it.\n\n\"Direct download [DDL] sites\" are web locations that index links to locations where files can be directly downloaded to the user's computer; many such sites link to free file hosting services, for the hosting of materials. DDL sites do not directly host the material and can avoid the fees that normally accompany large file hosting.\n\nThe production and/or distribution of warez is illegal in most countries due to the protections provided in the TRIPS Agreement. Software infringers generally exploit the international nature of the copyright issue to avoid law enforcement in specific countries. Violations are typically overlooked in poorer third world countries, and other countries with weak or non-existent protection for intellectual property. Additionally, some first world countries have loopholes in legislation that allow the warez to continue.\n\nThere is also a movement, exemplified by groups like The Pirate Party and scholars at The Mises Institute, that the very idea of intellectual property is an anathema to free society. This is in contrast to some of the more traditional open source advocates such as Lawrence Lessig, who advocate for middle ground between freedom and intellectual property.\n\nGenerally, there are four elements of criminal copyright infringement: the existence of a valid copyright, that copyright was infringed, the infringement was willful, and the infringement was either substantial, or for commercial gain (at levels often set by statute). Offering warez is generally understood to be a form of copyright infringement that is punishable as either a civil wrong or a crime.\n\nOften sites hosting torrent files claim that they are not breaking any laws because they are not offering the actual data, rather only a link to other places or peers that contain the infringing material. However, many prosecution cases and convictions argue to the contrary. For instance, Dimitri Mader, the French national who operates a movie distribution warez site, Wawa-Mania, was fined 20,000 € and sentenced, in absentia, to a year in jail by a European court (after fleeing France for the Philippines), for his role in managing the site. In the U.S., through 2004, more than 80 individuals had been prosecuted and convicted for trade in warez products (under the NET Act and other statutes), for movie and software pirating in particular, with a number of individuals being imprisoned, including some enthusiast traders. \n\nHowever, laws and their application to warez activities may vary greatly from country to country; for instance, while Wawa-Mania is under sanction in France, it remains in operation via a host in Moldova, and through use of an Ecuadorian top-level domain. Hence, while high-profile web hosts and domain providers generally do not permit the hosting of warez, and delete sites found to be hosting them, private endeavours and small commercial entities continue to allow the trade in warez to continue. And, in some countries, and at some times, software \"piracy\" has been encouraged, and international and usual national legal protections ignored. A dispute between Iran and United States over membership in WTO and subsequent U.S. block of Iran's attempts at full-membership has led Iran to encourage the copying of U.S. software; hence, there has been a subsequent surge in Iranian \"warez\" and \"crackz\" websites (as Iranian laws do not forbid hosting them inside Iran. The same policy has been adopted by Antigua, and others.\n\nWarez are often distributed outside of The Scene (a collection of warez groups) by torrents (files including tracker info, piece size, uncompressed file size, comments, and vary in size from 1 k, to 400 k.) uploaded to a popular P2P website by an associate or friend of the cracker or cracking crew. An nfo or FILE ID.DIZ is often made to promote who created the release. It is then leeched (downloaded) by users of the tracker and spread to other sharing sites using P2P, or other sources such as newsgroups. From there, it can be downloaded by millions of users all over the world. Often, one release is duplicated, renamed, then re-uploaded to different sites so that eventually, it can become impossible to trace the original file. Another increasingly popular method of distributing Warez is via one-click hosting websites. In the early 1990s, warez were often traded on cassette tapes with different groups and published on bulletin boards that had a warez section.\n\nUnauthorized copying has been an ongoing phenomenon that started when high quality, commercially produced software was released for sale. Whether the medium was cassette tape or floppy disk, cracking enthusiasts found a way to duplicate the software and spread it without the permission of the maker. Thriving bootlegging communities were built around the Apple II, Commodore 64, the Atari 400 and Atari 800 line, the ZX Spectrum, the Amiga, and the Atari ST, among other personal computers. Entire networks of BBSes sprang up to traffic illegal software from one user to the next. Machines like the Amiga and the Commodore 64 had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via bulletin board systems.\n\nIt was also quite common in the 1980s to use physical floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as \"mail trading\". Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc to be in the drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.\nCopy-protection schemes for the early systems were designed to defeat casual duplication attempts, as \"crackers\" would typically release a copied game to the \"pirate\" community the day they were earmarked for market.\n\nA famous event in the history of software copyright policy was an open letter written by Bill Gates of Microsoft, dated February 3, 1976, in which he argued that the quality of available software would increase if \"software piracy\" were less prevalent. However, until the early 1990s, software copyright infringement was not yet considered a serious problem by most people. In 1992, the Software Publishers Association began to battle against this phenomenon, with its promotional video \"Don't Copy That Floppy\". It and the Business Software Alliance have remained the most active anti-infringement organizations worldwide, although to compensate for extensive growth in recent years, they have gained the assistance of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), as well as American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).\n\nToday most warez files are distributed to the public via bittorrent and One-click hosting sites. Some of the most popular software companies that are being targeted are Adobe, Microsoft, Nero, Apple, DreamWorks, and Autodesk, to name a few. To reduce the spread of illegal copying, some companies have hired people to release \"fake\" torrents (known as Torrent poisoning), which look real and are meant to be downloaded, but while downloading the individual does not realize that the company that owns the software has received his/her IP address. They will then contact his/her ISP, and further legal action may be taken by the company/ISP.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, computers became more popular. This was largely attributed to Microsoft and the release of Windows 95, which made using an IBM PC compatible computer much easier for home users. Windows 95 became so popular that in developed countries nearly every middle-class household had at least one computer. Similar to televisions and telephones, computers became a necessity to every person in the information age. As the use of computers increased, so had software and cyber crimes.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the average Internet user was still on dial-up, with average speed ranging between 28.8 and 33.6 kbit/s. If one wished to download a piece of software, which could run about 200 MB, the download time could be longer than one day, depending on network traffic, the Internet Service Provider, and the server. Around 1997, broadband began to gain popularity due to its greatly increased network speeds. As \"large-sized file transfer\" problems became less severe, warez became more widespread and began to affect large software files like animations and movies.\n\nIn the past, files were distributed by point-to-point technology: with a central uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, a large number of downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the \"more\" downloaders the \"faster\" the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.\n\nPrior to the development of modern peer-to-peer sharing systems and home broadband service, sharing warez sometimes involved warez groups scanning the Internet for weakly secured computer systems with high-speed connections. These weakly secured systems would be compromised by exploiting the poor FTP security, creating a special directory on the server with an unassuming name to contain the illegal content.\n\nA common mistake of early FTP administrators was to permit a directory named /incoming that allows full read and write access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in and go to a location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.\n\nHackers would also use known software bugs to illicitly gain full administrative remote control over a computer, and install a hidden FTP service to host their wares. This FTP service was usually running on an unusual port number, or with a non-anonymous login name like \"login: warez / Password: warez\" to help prevent discovery by legitimate users; information about this compromised system would then be distributed to a select group of people who were part of the warez scene.\n\nIt was important for warez group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the network bandwidth usage low. A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage would then inevitably result in discovery and removal of the warez, and tightening of the site security.\n\nAs the ability to compromise and attain full remote control of business servers became more developed, the warez groups would hack a server and install an IRC bot on the compromised systems alongside the FTP service, or the IRC bot would provide file sharing directly by itself. This software would intelligently regulate access to the illicit data by using file queues to limit bandwidth usage, or by only running during off-hours overnight when the business owning the compromised hardware was closed for the day.\n\nIn order to advertise the existence of the compromised site, the IRC software would join public IRC \"warez\" channels as a \"bot\" and post into the channel with occasional status messages every few minutes, providing information about how many people are logged into the warez host, how many files are currently being downloaded, what the upload/download ratio is (to force users into contributing data of their own before they can download), which warez distributor is running the bot, and other status information.\n\nThis functionality still exists and can still be found on IRC \"warez\" channels, as an alternative to the modern and streamlined P2P distribution systems. The opportunity to find and compromise poorly secured systems on which to create an illicit warez distribution site has only increased with the popular use of broadband service by home users who may not fully understand the security implications of having their home computer always turned on and connected to the Internet.\n\nThere is generally a distinction made between different sub-types of warez. The unusual spellings shown here were commonly used as directory names within a compromised server, to organize the files rather than having them all thrown together in a single random collection.\n\n\n\nMovie copyright infringement was looked upon as impossible by the major studios. When dial-up was common in early and mid-1990s, movies distributed on the Internet tended to be small. The technique that was usually used to make them small was to use compression software, thus lowering the video quality significantly. At that time, the largest copyright violation threat was software.\n\nHowever, along with the rise in broadband internet connections beginning around 1998, higher quality movies began to see widespread distribution – with the release of DeCSS, ISO images copied directly from the original DVDs were slowly becoming a feasible distribution method. Today, movie sharing has become so common that it has caused major concern amongst movie studios and their representative organizations. Because of this the MPAA is often running campaigns during movie trailers where it tries to discourage people from copying material without permission. Unlike the music industry, which has had online music stores available for several years, the movie industry moved to online distribution only in 2006, after the launch of Amazon Unbox.\n\nBecause of this, cameras are sometimes forbidden in movie theaters.\n\nA CD software release can contain up to 700 megabytes of data, which presented challenges when sending over the Internet, particularly in the late 1990s when broadband was unavailable to most home consumers. These challenges apply to an even greater extent for a single-layer DVD release, which can contain up to 4.7 GB of data. The warez scene made it standard practice to split releases up into many separate pieces, called disks, using several file compression formats: (historical TAR, LZH, ACE, UHA, ARJ), ZIP, and most commonly RAR. The original purpose of these \"disks\" was so that each .rar file could fit on a single 1.44 MB 3½ inch floppy disk. With the growing size of games, this is no longer feasible, as hundreds of disks would need to be used. The average size of disks released by groups today are 50 megabytes or 100 megabytes, however it is common to find disks up to 200 megabytes.\n\nThis method has many advantages over sending a single large file:\n\nDespite the fact that many modern ftp programs support segmented downloading, the compression via RAR, ZIP, and breaking up of files has not changed.\n\nReleases of software titles often come in two forms. The full form is a full version of a game or application, generally released as CD or DVD-writable disk images (BIN or ISO files). A rip is a cut-down version of the title in which additions included on the legitimate DVD/CD (generally PDF manuals, help files, tutorials, and audio/video media) are omitted. In a game rip, generally all game video is removed, and the audio is compressed to MP3 or Vorbis, which must then be decoded to its original form before playing. These rips are very rare today, as most modern broadband connections can easily handle the full files, and the audio is usually already compressed by the original producer in some fashion.\n\nThere is a common perception that warez sites represent high risk in terms of malware. In addition, there are several papers showing there is indeed correlation between warez/file sharing sites and malware. In particular, one study shows that out of all domains the study classified as \"pirate\", 7.1% are infected (while out of \"random\" domains only 0.4% were infected); another study maintains that '\"maliciousness\" of the content for sites they classified as \"pirate\" (which specifically included \"warez\" sites) is the highest among all the researched site categories. Domains related to anti-copy protection tools are among the most malicious sites. Another study specifically targeted anti-copy protection tools such as cracks and key generators. They conclude that the majority of these programs aim to infect the user's computer with one or more types of malware. The chance of the end-user being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50%.\n\nThese statistical data can be questionable though, because most prominent Antivirus software programs tend to classify KeyGens as viruses \"a priori\", although most keygens do not infect the users' computers in any way.\n\nInfected warez directly from the warez scene on the other hand, is a very unusual occurrence. The malicious content is usually added at a later stage by third parties.\n\nWarez traders share many similarities to both hackers and crackers. Primary warez distribution groups include a single cracker that renders all copy protected technologies in a warez inoperable. Unlike the typical age of a hacker and cracker, the general age and demographics of a warez trader are older and married IT professionals. The need for attention is another similarity between the groups as well as believe that digital property should be free.\n\n\n"}

This research was largely focused on two areas: the credibility of information that can be found on the World Wide Web and the difference that hypertext makes to 'reading' and 'writing'. These skills were included in definitions of information literacy and included in a SCONUL position paper in 1999. This paper became the '7 Pillars of Information Literacy', which was last updated in 2011.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet. It has created a Web Literacy Map in consultation with a community of stakeholders from formal and informal education, as well as industry. Web literacy is described as \"the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing and participating on the web\". Work on what was originally entitled a Web Literacy 'Standard' began in early 2013. Version 1.0 was launched at the Mozilla Festival later that year. Going forward, 'standard' was seen to be problematic and against the ethos of what the Mozilla community was trying to achieve.\n\n\"Literacy Version 1.1\" of the Web Literacy Map was released in early 2014 and underpins the Mozilla Foundation's Webmaker resources section, where learners and mentors can find activities that help teach related areas. Although the Web Literacy Map is a list of strands, skills and competencies, it is most commonly represented as a competency grid.\n\nThe Mozilla community finalised the version 1.5 of the Web Literacy Map at the end of March 2015. This involves small changes to the competencies layer and a comprehensive review of the skills they contain.\n\n\"(Navigating the Web)\"\n\n\"(Creating for the Web)\"\n\n\"(Participating on the Web)\"\n\n"}

The contest was established in honor of Watson's adoptive mother and the birth mother he had never known. In a limited amount of words, children are asked to write essays explaining why their mother deserves a diamond.\n\nHundreds of thousands of American children have participated, and dozens of kids have won the grand prize of a diamond to give to their mothers (and other precious gems).\n\nOn Mother’s Day, May 9, 1993, sophomore Margaret Ketchersid from Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California was awarded the grand prize of a quarter-carat diamond to give to her mother, Ruth. Following is her winning essay.\n\nHer love is not blind - it is clear and forgiving\nHer touch is all-knowing - her joy life giving\nThis angel, my mother, gives of herself\nAnd illuminates me with compassion’s true wealth\n\nA symbol of courage and strength she remains\nAnd understands all my joys and pains\nTo gaze at my mother, who strives beyond duty\nIs to see radiate her unique, warming beauty!\n\nThe sweet voice of mother - her strong, safe, embrace\nI long to possess her pure, natural, grace\nMy Mother, my guide, and gemstone so rare\nDeserves out of likeness a diamond as fair\"\n\nMichael (Diamond Mike) Watson was born and adopted in Indianapolis in 1958. He spent his early life in New Albany, where his adopted parents raised him. The foundation of the contest began while Watson was searching for his own birth mother when he was 17. [Source: “For the Love of Mom.” Daily Pilot. April 30, 1992.]\n\nAbout the same time he started his quest, Watson entered the jewelry industry as an errand boy for a store in New Albany. He joined a retail chain and worked in jewelry stores in Indiana, Kentucky and Kansas City, then moved to California in 1989. [Source: “Watson Strikes Gold with Diamond Shop.” Tribune. Pg 6. August 6, 1992.]\n\nHis first job ended when the store was sold and the next one when the store went out of business. In 1991, Watson opened Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers in Costa Mesa, California. [Source: “Mother’s Day Contest Builds Business and Goodwill.” Jewelers Circular Keystone. April 1996.]\n\nWatson obtained a copy of his hospital bill from Community Hospital, which showed his mother's name (Betty Price) and age. Armed with this information, he embarked on a search that lasted nearly 20 years. [Source: Ibid. pg. 144.]\n\nWatson found the judge who had presided over the adoption only to learn that the records were sealed. The judge did, however, give Watson the report by the Department of Public Welfare, which contained information about his birth mother. [Source: “One Man’s Search.” New Albany Tribune. 1995.]\n\nThe report listed names and a wedding date, and he contacted every county in Indiana to locate a wedding license. In mid-1994 he heard from the courthouse in Coatesville that the information on the license matched. He found that his birth mother's maiden name was Stewart, and also discovered her parent's address and telephone number. [Source: “The Search is Finally Over.” Newport Beach/ Costa Mesa Daily Pilot. September 16, 1994.]\n\nWhen calling his biological grandmother, she said that no one knew he was alive because his birth mother told the family he was stillborn. He then learned that his mother had died in 1981. [Source: “Surprising Twists in Two Searches for Family Roots.” Los Angeles Times. January 28, 1998.]\n\nThe Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest became increasingly important for Watson to allow kids to express their appreciation for their own mothers, especially while they are still living.\n\nOver the years, the Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest brought thousands of ethnically diverse families to Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers. In an effort to educate people of a broadened concept of mutual love and respect for people of foreign countries, Watson conceptualized a word that would mean, \"the intense love and respect of persons from diverse backgrounds.” In 2016, with the help of wordsmith Doug Lowry, the word “uniphilarsian” was created, meaning “one who loves, regards, and watches over the unique aspect of every other person.”\n\nFrom 1993-2012, Watson published the winning entries in an annual book to raise money for the local county's library. “Area Library Shines from Essay Sales.” Costa Mesa Daily Pilot. September 2, 1997. To date, approximately 20,000 kids submit their essays to the company's headquarters in Santa Ana, California, and nearly four thousand families come to Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers every year.

He is the author of Moon Over Mountains- The Search for Mom, The Legend of Why Mom Deserves a Diamond, Tales of Imagination- Everything is Real, In Search of Mom- Journey of an Adoptee, and Adopted Like Me- Chosen to Search for a Birthmother. “Search for Birth Mother Results in Special Book for Watson.” New Albany Ledger Tribune.

The Orange County Register newspaper named him the winner of the \"Holiday Spirit Award\" in 1995, awarded to business owners who display the holiday spirit throughout the year. “It’s Your Business.” [Source: Orange County Register. December 25, 1995.]\n\nThe trademark Why Mom Deserves a Diamond was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark office on July 27, 2001. Registration number 2,620,840. The trademark, The Legendary Contest, received registration on April 17, 2007, as \"A writing contest in which kids can honor their mothers and have the chance to win a diamond or gemstone.\" Reg #3229618.\n\nIn 2009, the Why Mom Deserves a Diamond contest became incorporated and in 2010 it became a franchise with the mission of \"giving every child the opportunity to express their words of appreciation to the mothers.\" [Source: “Why Mom Deserves a Diamond Expands Contest to Jewelers.” Diamond News. January 30, 2012.]\n\nFrom 1993-2012, Gallery of Diamonds Jewelers, the founding sponsor of the contest, published an annual anthology of the winners. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of these books were donated to the Orange County Library system in Orange County, California. Following are the book titles and the years they were published. \n\n"}

She was trained in Yamāma. She was sold to Abū Khālid al-Nāṭifī, who brought her to Baghdad.\n\nIn the assessment of Fuad Matthew Caswell,\nHer salon at the house of al-Nāṭifī was frequented by the celebrated poets and men of letters of the time, including Abū Nuwās, Di‘bil al-Khuzā‘ī, Marwān b. Abī Ḥafṣa, al-‘Abbās b. al-Aḥnaf and al-Ma’mūn's tutor al-Yazīdī al-Ḥimyarī, among a host of others, one of the attractions being that her master was devoid of jealously and tolerated the ease with which she bestowed her favours.\n\n‘Inān's fame led Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd to seek to buy her, but he refused al-Nāṭifī's asking price of 100,000 dīnārs. However, on al-Nāṭifī's death, al-Rashīd had ‘Inān put up for auction, ostensibly to help clear al-Nāṭifī's debts. Via an agent, al-Rashīd then acquired her for 225,000 dirhams. As al-Rashīd's concubine, ‘Inān bore him two sons, both of whom died young. She accompanied him to Khurāsān where he, and, soon after, she died.\n\n‘Inān was noted for her rapier-like repartee, which was often sexual or even vulgar in tone, and this will have been an important aspect of her fame/infamy. A large part of her surviving corpus comprises her responses to male poets' challenges in verse-capping contests. A significant proportion of her surviving verse is dialogue with the famed poet Abū Nuwās.\n\nAs rendered by Eric Ormsby, one of the virtuosic yet obscene exchanges between ‘Inān and Abū Nuwās runs thus:\n\nOne day she asked him whether he was any good at scansion; when Abu Nuwas replied boastfully that he was superb at it, she said, \"Try scanning this verse:\n\nAbu Nuwas broke the line into metrical feet and responded:\n\nwhich means:\n\nThe assembled courtiers broke into loud laughter at the poet's expense. Not to be outdone, he asked ‘Inān whether she could scan the following (rather nonsensical) verse:\n\nShe too had to break up the metrical feet to produce:\n\nwhich comes out as\n\n"}
