She is a recipient of the 2001 Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi for her novel \"Kalikatha: Via Bypass\".\n\nAlka Saraogi was born in a Marwari family of Rajasthani origin in Kolkata. She studied at Calcutta University, receiving a PhD for her thesis on the poetry of Raghuvir Sahay.\n\nFollowing her marriage and the birth of two children, Saraogi began to write short stories. Her first published work was \"Āp kī haṁsī\" (\"Your laughter\"), a story taking its title from one of Raghuvir Sahay's poems. Saraogi's mentor, Ashok Seksaria, sent it to Vartaman Sahitya, a Hindi literary journal, where it received favourable notice. She then published \"Kahānī kī talāś meṁ\" in 1996, a collection of short stories.\n\nHer first novel, \"Kalikatha: Via Bypass\", came out in 1998. It was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi literature in 2001. She followed this up with four further novels, the latest – \"Jānkidās Tejpāl mansion\" – published in 2015.\n\nMarwaris and Bengalis, despite coexisting in Kolkata for many generations, have led largely disjoint lives. In Bengali literature and art, the Marwari appears typically as a stereotype, a money-making reactionary. Saraogi's writing is in Hindi, albeit neither overly Sanskritised, nor informed by the popular Hindi film industry. Though she often uses Bengali expressions in her novels, especially in the speech of Bengali characters, even in her oeuvre the breach between the Hindi- and Bengali-speaking communities remains unbridged.\n\nSaraogi's first novel, \"Kalikatha: Via Bypass\", is a work of historical fiction. It examines the Marwari community, long established in Kolkata as a merchants yet still exploring its position among the Bengali culture. It is written from the point of view of a male protagonist, Kishore Babu, who following an operation for a head injury, begins to wander around the city, observing its economic life and histories. He compares its majoritarian society against the patriarchal mores of his Marwari community, contrasts his own memories with popular memory, and experiences the ways in which Kolkata of the 1940s melds into that of the 1990s. As Kishore Babu wanders across the city and his own memories, pondering the loves and lives of his ancestors and descendants, his ruminations enliven the entire community, and the narrative structure of the novel too flips between the ages. Saraogi's unflinching prose does not flatter the Marwaris, though the privations of a community on the margin are described evocatively. Kolkata Marwaris have often been accused of making money at the expense of the Bengalis, but this is not addressed in the novel. Rather, it sets in stark contrast the ostensible nobility of their spirit against the parochiality of their lives.\n\nThe protagonist of this novel, Ruby Gupta, is a Marwari woman who faces the dichotomy of two social values: the wealth and enterprise of her Marwari father versus the austere and intellectual nature of her mother's family. Saraogi addresses the nuances of cultural differences through Ruby's eyes. Once again, the narrative oscillates between periods of Ruby's childhood and her old age. Having been wealthy in a city of poverty is a stigma she finds hard to atone. Discovering the source of her father's wealth - the opium trade - adds further discomfort. Meanwhile, she recognises the innate hypocrisy of her mother's relatives who disparage her father and his business, yet continue to live off him.\n\nFollowing the male-dominated viewpoint of her first novel, Saraogi's switch to a female perspective offers further reinforcement of the weight of cultural expectation. Despite being a patriarch, Kishore Babu in \"Kalikatha: Via Bypass\" was unable to step outside his social mores to ameliorate his widowed sister-in-law's life. In \"Shesh Kadambari\", seeking an understanding of self for all her seventy years of life, Ruby Gupta comes to realise that her social work has not resulted in any social justice for herself.\n\nThe story of a US-educated engineer who returns to India and gets embroiled in the Naxalite movement, Saraogi's novel sweeps across the early optimism of India's freedom to the broken dreams of the present. Jaygovind's life follows the disappointments of the first post-Independence generation, mirrored in the social schisms of America, from the Vietnam war to Wikileaks.\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, this adversity comprises the challenges of low pay, family commitments, environmental hardships and lack of personal recognition. It is a term of respect and endearment intended to empower and recognize those who feel as though they exist at the bottom of society. The term has seen recent use in mainstream politics to describe a demographic section of the Australian people.\n\nThe term \"Aussie Battler\" generally refers to working class Australians, specifically, those who feel they must work hard at a low paying job to earn enough money, is actually well respected by Australian society at large as they stoically face perceived financial hardships, in spite of Australian workers being among some of the highest paid and resourceful in the western world. The concept of an \"Aussie battler\" is an example of self-aggrandizing language, designed to counter feelings of stigma or inadequacy, and to bolster confidence in being a member of the Australian underclass. It refers to an Australian who continues to struggle in the face of hardship. It is a term of respect and endearment, not simply used to assess someone's financial situation; the ordinary working-man earning a living against the odds.\nThe common variation little Aussie battler further adds to the notion that the battler is at the bottom of society, working under bigger things above.\n\nIn Australian English, the concept of a \"battler\" is a power word similar to the concept of the \"hardworking family\". It is used by various political personages and entities for their own purposes. Where in one context a person may use the term to refer to people of low socioeconomic status to call for greater welfare, others may use it to refer to a family saving for a private education to call for government payments to private schools.\n\nSome individuals are self-defined \"battlers\" without fitting the above definition because of their own interpretations of \"earning enough money.\" Social scientist and author Michael Pusey has described this as \"Middle Class Battler syndrome\" because these \"battlers\" earn more than the average wage but see expensive homes and consumer goods as necessities. As a result, they have very little disposable income after servicing debts for these items. Despite the self-inflicted hardship, the myth of the \"battler\" remains.\n\nFollowing the election of the conservative coalition government under the leadership of John Howard in 1996, the phrase was adapted and widely adopted within Australian public discourse. Howard scored a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections, an achievement some commentators explained by reference to his winning over many traditional Labor Party voters, whom they now termed \"Howard's battlers\".\nThe term was allegedly popularised by Andrew Robb, the 1996 Liberal Party campaign director, who used it to describe those blue-collar voters who felt ignored by Labor and who were successfully targeted by the Liberals during the election campaign.\n\nIn a radio interview in 2004, Howard was asked what he thought a 'battler' was and replied that:\n\nDuring the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Sydney in September 2007, US President George W. Bush referred to Howard himself as being a 'battler'.\n\n"}

Kershul, a language scholar and teacher planning a career in academia and working towards a doctorate in Medieval German Languages and Literature. While teaching at the university level, she observed that the majority of her students were learning a foreign language for personal reasons such as an upcoming trip abroad, researching family history, or dating someone who spoke the language. Seeing that the traditional academic methods, designed for those majoring in the language, were not best suited to help her students achieve their goals she decided to develop a way to learn, in a short amount of time, practical and relevant conversation skills they could use.\n\nKershul authored her first book, \"German in 10 Minutes a Day\", with the intention to return to her academic career, but the success of the publication became the catalyst for more books in other languages and within a year, the Seattle company began worldwide distribution with five titles, adding French, Italian, Spanish and Chinese.\n\nThe company was sold to Sunset Books and Magazine in 1988 and seven years later, in 1995, Kershul reacquired it.\n\nIn 1999, the first Language Maps were published in Spanish, French, German and Italian, as an alternative to traditional phrase guides.\n\nIn 2004, the company continued its expansion by publishing audio programs for its Spanish, French, German and Italian titles.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Bilingual Books developed computer software as a complement to the 10 Minutes a Day books.\n\nBy 2011, the company had published more than 50 titles in 20 languages.\n\nIn 2003, as part of the company's commitment to support U.S. military forces deployed to Iraq, \"Arabic a Language Map\" was released.\n\nIn 2010, a Pashto version of the Language Map was released for troops serving in Afghanistan.

{"id": "9568471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9568471", "title": "Biolinguistics", "text": "Biolinguistics\n\nBiolinguistics is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language.\n\nThe biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid-twentieth century, among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics. Eric Lenneberg’s \"Biological Foundations of Language\" remains a basic document of the field. In 1974, the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, bringing together evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution.\n\nRecent work in theoretical linguistics and cognitive studies at MIT construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. Noam Chomsky's latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the minimalist program. In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental recursion.\n\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to natural laws (such as for example, the Fibonacci sequence—an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005). According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\nDavid Poeppel, a neuroscientist and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization\", arguing that there is a \"Granularity Mismatch Problem\", as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the \"Ontological Incommensurability Problem\", where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that neurolinguistic research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of biosemiotics, claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35619802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35619802", "title": "Body cathexis", "text": "Body cathexis\n\nBody cathexis is defined as the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction one feels towards various parts and aspects of his or her own body. This evaluative dimension of body image is dependent on a person’s investment of mental and emotional energy in body size, parts, shape, processes, and functions, and is integral to one’s sense of self-concept. First recognized by Jourard and Secord, body cathexis is assessed by examining correlations between measures of self-concept or esteem and bodily attitudes. An individual’s evaluation of his or her own body tends to drive various behaviors, including clothing choices and weight management, and the existence of a universal ideal for certain dimensions of body type is, in many cases, a source of anxiety and insecurity.\n\nWhile the body has been studied by psychologists from numerous different viewpoints, few recent reports of systematic empirical research into feelings about the body exist. However, body cathexis is of crucial importance to understanding personality, since feelings about the body closely correspond to feelings about the self and produce marked behavioral consequences. Due to the substantial amount of attention individuals devote to the grooming and concern for bodily appearance, body cathexis is believed to be intrinsically related to the self-concept, with high self-esteem and self-acceptance serving as preventative factors against body dissatisfaction.\n\nAmong females in particular, one’s general attitude about the body is a significant personality variable with mental health implications. Recent studies have examined the effects of bodily attitudes on consumer dissatisfaction or satisfaction with fit of apparel, disordered eating, and participation in weight loss programs.\n\nFirst introduced by Secord and Jourard in 1953, the Body Cathexis Scale provides an objective measure of one’s feelings towards various aspects of his or her body. Originally composed of 46 items, the questionnaire asks individuals to indicate the strength and direction of feeling he or she has about certain bodily parts and functions according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1, “strongly negative,” to 5, “strongly positive.”\n\nThe body cathexis items used in the scale include body characteristics such as “width of shoulders,” “facial complexion,” and “body build.” Individuals are to consider each of the items listed and assign a numerical score that best represents his or her feelings about the various body aspects. Total body cathexis (BC) is obtained by summing the ratings for each of the 46 characteristics and dividing by total number of items.\n\nBody image is one of the most significant components of an individual’s self-concept. One's perception of his or her body and the feelings associated with this perceived image greatly influence overall satisfaction with the self and can predict levels of self-esteem. The relationship between body image and the self-concept has been investigated extensively by Secord and Jourard, and as their research indicates, self-esteem scores and personal identification are highly correlated with body cathexis, acceptance, and overall satisfaction with physical body traits and functions.\n\nAmong the few empirical studies relevant to the relatedness of the body and the self is that of Schilder, who – through a series of self-report questionnaires – procured evidence suggesting that negative feelings, associations, and memories about the body can probe higher levels of dissatisfaction with the self. In approaching the problem of body cathexis appraisal, Secord and Jourard adapted Shilder’s methods to test their hypothesis that feelings about the body are correlated with overall feelings about the self. In their study, the researchers developed a method for assessing an individual’s feelings towards his or her bodily features in order to ascertain whether or not the variables attained through these methods are relevant to personality theory. Using scales of body cathexis and self cathexis, the Maslow Test of Psychological Security-Insecurity, and an anxiety-related body cathexis homonym test, Secord and Jourard concluded that the body and self tend to be cathected to the same degree. Consequently, as suggested by the results of both the body cathexis and self cathexis scales (which represent attitudes about conceptual aspects of the self in correlation to the body), low body cathexis is significantly associated with anxiety, insecurity, and negative perceptions of the self.\n\nLikewise, an individual’s perception of self-worth is a fluctuating attitude that can rise and fall with changing components of the physical self. This attitude, coined self-esteem, is an evaluative component of the psychological self that is partially dependent upon one’s satisfaction with physical appearance. As various studies indicate, changes in body composition, perceptions of physical attractiveness, and overall body condition provide inferential support for the claim that body image is related to an individual’s self-esteem and perceived worth.\n\nBecause body image and body weight are a high priority in western culture, men and women alike face gender-based societal pressures to achieve an ideal body image, which in turn influences feelings about the body and preoccupation with size, shape, weight, and appearance. According to Salusso-Deonier and Schwarzkopf, gender is a salient factor in body image development, and due to sex differences in the management and enhancement of appearance, females tend to exhibit more negative cathexis responses to the body and self as compared to men.\n\nAs their study suggests, body cathexis scores among females tend to decrease as body type varies from the ideal thin, while body cathexis scores among males show similar trends when one’s perceived body is fatter or thinner than the muscular ideal. However, though previous literature demonstrates that both men and women are concerned with weight and appearance, men generally have higher body cathexis than women. Cultural scripting, particularly male socialization that fosters exercise involvement and physical fitness, may be partially responsible for higher body cathexis scores among males, since participation in fitness activities tends to yield significant improvement in body satisfaction. Similarly, dysphoric body image experiences often mediated by specific contextual cues also promote sizable sex differences in body cathexis and the occurrence of negative body image emotions. Relative to men, women are more strongly invested in their looks and tend to report a more negative overall body image evaluation. As the findings of their study confirm, Muth and Cash suggest that the gender-differential societal and personal standards of body attractiveness place women at a higher predisposition for less favorable, more invested, and more distressing body image attitudes.\n\nFeelings about the body have marked behavioral consequences, and as both casual and clinical observations suggest, body cathexis and body perceptions play a significant role in garment fit satisfaction. While the physical dimensions and product design of apparel are partially responsible for consumers’ dissatisfaction with clothing fit, consumers are often quick to blame themselves and their body type when a product does not work. For females in particular, fashionable clothing is often designed to fit a specific body type; thus, when a clothing article does not fit properly, the consumer tends to blame the poor fit on their body and not the design of the apparel – a result of the individual’s low body cathexis.\n\nSimilarly, social stimuli may play a reciprocal role in anticipating behavior, contributing to the formation of negative feelings about the body. Since consumers often rely on social information and preconceived notions of the ideal body image when shaping their self-concept, apparel fit may contribute to body cathexis and overall feelings about the self. Therefore, dissatisfaction with the fit of garments can lead to lower body cathexis and negative attitudes regarding overall appearance, body dimensions, and weight.\n\nAlong with garment fit satisfaction, research also indicates that body image attitudes and emotions may be correlated with disordered eating behaviors. Body dissatisfaction, especially negative attitudes about weight, is a significant risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms and low self-esteem, as well as unhealthy weight control strategies, such as skipping meals, fasting, crash dieting, and self-induced purging. Low body cathexis and preoccupation can contribute to the development of eating disorders among female adolescents in particular, often a result of societal pressures and expectations to achieve the ideal, thin body type.\n"}
{"id": "240046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240046", "title": "Butch and femme", "text": "Butch and femme\n\nButch and femme are terms used in the lesbian subculture to ascribe or acknowledge a masculine (butch) or feminine (femme) identity with its associated traits, behaviors, styles, self-perception, and so on. The terms were founded in lesbian communities in the twentieth century. This concept has been called a \"way to organize sexual relationships and gender and sexual identity\". Butch-femme culture is not the sole form of a lesbian dyadic system, as there are many women in butch–butch and femme–femme relationships.\n\nBoth the expression of individual lesbians of butch and femme identities and the relationship of the lesbian community in general to the notion of butch and femme as an organizing principle for sexual relating varied over the course of the 20th century. Some lesbian feminists have argued that butch–femme is a replication of heterosexual relations while other commentators argue that, while it resonates with heterosexual patterns of relating, butch–femme simultaneously challenges it. Research in the 1990s in the United States showed that \"95% of lesbians are familiar with butch/femme codes and can rate themselves or others in terms of those codes, and yet the same percentage feels that butch/femme was 'unimportant in their lives.\n\nThe word \"femme\" is taken from the French word for woman. The word \"butch\", meaning \"masculine\", may have been coined by abbreviating the word \"butcher\", as first noted in George Cassidy's nickname, \"Butch Cassidy\". However, the exact origin of the word is still unknown.\n\nThe butch web designer Daddy Rhon created a symbol of a black triangle intersecting a red circle to represent butch/femme sexuality, which was first used at the beginning of the 21st century on the website \"butch-femme.com\" and has started to be used elsewhere.\n\nThere is debate about to whom the terms butch and femme can apply, and particularly whether transgender individuals can be identified in this way. For example, Jack Halberstam argues that FTM transgender persons cannot be considered butch since it constitutes a conflation of maleness with butchness. He further argues that butch–femme is uniquely geared to work in lesbian relationships. Stereotypes and definitions of butch and femme vary greatly, even within tight-knit LGBT communities. On the other hand, the writer Jewelle Gomez muses that butch and femme women in the earlier twentieth century may have been expressing their closeted transgender identity. Antipathy toward female butches and male femmes has been interpreted by some commentators as transphobia, although female butches and male femmes are not always transgender or identified with the transmovement, and indeed some heterosexuals of both genders display these attributes.\n\nScholars such as Sigmund Freud, Judith Butler, and Anne Fausto-Sterling suggest that butch and femme are not attempts to take up \"traditional\" gender roles. Instead, they argue that gender is socially and historically constructed, rather than essential, \"natural\", or biological. The femme lesbian historian Joan Nestle argues that femme and butch may be seen as distinct genders in and of themselves.\n\n\"Butch\" can be used as an adjective or a noun to describe an individual's gender or gender performance. A masculine person of any gender can be described as butch, even though it is more common to use the term towards females with more masculine traits. The term butch tends to denote a degree of masculinity displayed by a female individual beyond what would be considered typical of a tomboy. It is not uncommon for women with a butch appearance to face harassment or violence. A butch woman could be compared to an effeminate man in the sense that both genders are historically linked to homosexual communities and stereotypes. A 1990s survey of butches showed that 50% were primarily attracted to femmes, while 25% reported being usually attracted to other butches.\n\n\"Butch Voices\" biennial conferences \"for masculine of center people\" were held in 2009, 2011 and 2013, the last being supported by a fundraiser called \"Beauty and the BUTCH\"—\"an evening of deliciously BUTCH revelry, thrilling show of tantalizing teases from queers of all genders, and choose-your-own play party adventures\".\n\nLike the term \"butch,\" femme can be used as an adjective or a noun. Femmes are not \"read\" as lesbians or queer unless they are with a butch partner, because they conform to traditional standards of femininity. Because they do not express masculine qualities, femmes were particularly vexing to sexologists and psychoanalysts who wanted to argue that all lesbians wished to be men. Traditionally, the femme in a butch-femme couple was expected to act as a stereotypical feminine woman and provide emotional support for her butch partner. In the first half of the twentieth century, when butch-femme gender roles were constrained to the underground bar scene, femmes were considered invisible without a butch partner - that is, they could pass as straight because of their gender conformity. However, Joan Nestle asserts that femmes in a butch-femme couple make both the butch and the femme exceedingly visible. By daring to be publicly attracted to butch women, femmes reflected their own sexual difference and made the butch a known subject of desire.\n\nThe separatist feminist movement of the late 1960s and 1970s forced butches and femmes underground, as radical lesbian feminists found lesbian gender roles to be a disappointing and oppressive replication of heterosexual lifestyle. However, the 1980s saw a resurgence of butch and femme gender roles. In this new configuration of butch and femme, it was acceptable, even desirable, to have femme-femme sexual and romantic pairings. Femmes gained value as their own lesbian gender, making it possible to exist separately from butches. For example, Susie Bright, the founder of On Our Backs, the first lesbian sex periodical of its kind, identifies as femme. Beyond depictions in pornography, the neo-butch and neo-femme aesthetic in day-to-day life helped add a sense of visual identity to lesbians who had abandoned these roles in the name of political correctness.\n\nIn \"Negotiating Dyke Femininity\", lesbian scholar Wendy Somerson, explains that women in the lesbian community who are more feminine and do not fit into the \"butch\" stereotype can pass as straight. She believes the link between appearance and gender performance and one's sexuality should be disrupted, because the way someone looks should not define their sexuality. In her article, Somerson also clearly talks about how within the lesbian community some are considered more masculine than others.\n\nFemmes still combat the invisibility their presentation creates and assert their sexuality through their femininity. The dismissal of femmes as illegitimate or invisible also happens within the queer community itself, which creates the push for femmes to self-advocate as an empowered identity not inherently tied to butches.\n\nSome women in lesbian communities eschew butch or femme classifications, believing that they are inadequate to describe an individual, or that labels are limiting in and of themselves. Other people within the queer community have tailored the common labels to be more descriptive, such as \"soft stud,\" \"hard butch,\" \"gym queen,\" or \"tomboy femme.\" Comedian Elvira Kurt contributed the term \"fellagirly\" as a description for queer females who are not strictly either femme or butch, but a combination. In the 1950s and 1960s the term chi-chi was used to mean the same thing.\n\nThose who identify as butch and femme today often use the words to define their presentation and gender identity rather than strictly the role they play in a relationship, and that not all butches are attracted exclusively to femmes and not all femmes are exclusively attracted to butches, a departure from the historic norm. Besides the terms \"butch\" and \"femme\", there are a number of other terms used to describe the dress codes, the sexual behaviours and/or the gender identities of the sexual subcultures who use them. The meanings of these terms vary and can evolve over time.\n\n\"Lipstick lesbians\" are feminine lesbians. A woman who likes to receive and not give sexually is called a \"pillow queen\". Conversely, a butch woman may be described as a \"stone butch\", \"diesel dyke\" \"bulldyke\", \"bull bitch\" or \"bulldagger\" or simply just as a \"dyke\". The term boi is typically used by younger LGBT women. Defining the difference between a butch and a boi, one boi told a reporter: \"that sense of play - that's a big difference from being a butch. To me, butch is like an adult...You're the man of the house.\" There is also an emerging usage of the terms soft butch \"stem\" (stud-femme), \"futch\" (feminine butch) or \"chapstick lesbian\" as terms for women who have characteristics of both butch and femme. Lesbians who are unisex and neither butch nor femme are called \"androgynous\" or \"andros\".\n\nAnother common term is \"Stud\". A stud is a dominant lesbian, usually butch. They tend to be influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut off from the rest of the gay and lesbian community. \"A lot of it has to do with this kind of pressure to articulate and express your masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm...\" The AG culture has also been represented on film by Black lesbian filmmaker Dee Rees' 2011 work, \"Pariah\".\n\nPrior to the middle of the 20th century in Western culture, homosexual societies were mostly underground or secret, making it difficult to determine how long butch and femme roles have been practiced by women.\n\nIt is known that butch–femme dress codes date back at least to the beginning of the 20th century as photographs have survived of butch–femme couples in the decade of 1910–1920 in the United States; they were then called \"transvestites\". However, according to the \"Routledge International Encyclopaedia of Women\", although upper-class women like Radclyffe Hall and her lover Una Troubridge lived together in unions that resembled butch–femme relationships, \"The term butch/femme would have been categorically inconsequential, however, and incomprehensible to these women.\"\n\nButch and femme lesbian genders were only starting to become apparent in the 1940s, since it started to become common to allow women to enter bars without men. In the 1940s in the U.S., most butch women had to wear conventionally feminine dress in order to hold down jobs, donning their starched shirts and ties only on weekends to go to bars or parties as \"Saturday night\" butches.\n\nThe 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of butches who refused to live double lives and wore butch attire full-time, or as close to full-time as possible. This usually limited them to a few jobs, such as factory work and cab driving, that had no dress codes for women. Their increased visibility, combined with the anti-gay rhetoric of the McCarthy era, led to an increase in violent attacks on gay and bisexual women, while at the same time the increasingly strong and defiant bar culture became more willing to respond with force. Although femmes also fought back, it became primarily the role of butches to defend against attacks and hold the bars as gay women's space. While in the '40s, the prevailing butch image was severe but gentle, it became increasingly tough and aggressive as violent confrontation became a fact of life. In 1992, a \"groundbreaking\" anthology about the butch-femme socialization that took place in working class bars of the 40s and 50s was published—\"The Persistent Desire: A Femme–Butch Reader\", edited by femme Joan Nestle.\n\nAlthough butch–femme wasn't the only organizing principle among lesbians in the mid-20th century, it was particularly prominent in the working-class lesbian bar culture of the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, where butch–femme was the norm, while butch–butch and femme–femme relationships were taboo. Those who switched roles were called \"ki-ki\", a pejorative term, and they were often the butt of jokes. In the 1950s, in an early piece of lesbian studies, the gay rights campaigning organisation ONE, Inc. assigned Stella Rush to study \"the butch/femme phenomenon\" in gay bars. Rush reported that women held strong opinions, that \"role distinctions needed to be sharply drawn,\" and that not being one or the other earned strong disapproval from both groups. It has been noted that, at least in part, kiki women were unwelcome where lesbians gathered because their apparent lack of understanding of the butch–femme dress code might indicate that they were policewomen.\n\nIn contrast to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, such as the Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch-femme roles and identities. This was especially true in relation to the butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was the goal of the homophile movement. Gender expressions outside of the norm prevented assimilation.\n\nIn the 1970s, the development of lesbian feminism pushed butch-femme roles out of popularity. Lesbian separatists such as Sheila Jeffreys argued that all forms of masculinity, including masculine butch women, were negative and harmful to women. The group of radical lesbians often credited with sparking lesbian feminism, Radicalesbians, called butch culture “male-identified role-playing among lesbians”. This encouraged the emergence of androgyny in lesbian feminist circles, with many women wearing clothing like T-shirts, jeans, flannels, and boots. This dress was very similar to butch dress, weakening a key identifier of butch lesbians. \n\nWhile butch-femme roles had previously been the primary way of identifying lesbians and quantifying lesbian relationships in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, lesbian feminist ideology had turned these roles into a \"perversion of lesbian identity\". Lesbian feminism was publicly represented though white feminism, and often excluded and alienated working class lesbians and lesbians of color. In these excluded communities, butch-femme roles persisted and grew throughout the 1970s. Despite the criticism from both middle-class lesbians and lesbian feminists, butch and femme roles reemerged in the 1980s and 1990s, but were no longer relegated to only working-class lesbians.\n\n\n"}

It may be a result of gentrification, the informal redevelopment that occurs when new, and typically more affluent people, move into a neighborhood. It is the result of urban redevelopment of a residential neighborhood to non-residential uses including retail, education, healthcare, and transportation. It is often criticized because the current residents have limited options to buy or rent equivalent housing in alternative areas at the same price. If they stay, prices for products, services, and taxes in the local area rise and existing social networks are disturbed.\n\nThe 1949 Housing Act described the movement of populations out of blighted areas as \"planned shrinkage\". The academic literature describes this movement as \"serial displacement\". Recently, the terms \"urban displacement\" and \"community displacement\" are used commonly.\n\nCommunity displacement is not \"gentrification\". It may be a byproduct, but it is not a necessary result of gentrification. New York City's gentrification of the financial district produced no outflow of population. It did not significantly change the cost of living in the neighborhood.\n\nEconomist Lance Freeman came to this conclusion: \"displacement and higher mobility play minor if any roles as forces of change in gentrifying neighborhoods.\"\n\n\"Community displacement\" is not white flight—when residents voluntarily move away as a neighborhood declines.\n\n\"Community displacement\" is the movement of a population out of a neighborhood as formal or informal redevelopment occurs. The predominant generator of population displacement is government sponsored projects: new highways, education campuses, hospitals, and other urban renewal projects. Housing projects may displace people temporarily. In the 1960s, the preference was for high-density projects which did not result in net displacement. Low-density projects may or may not cause a net displacement.\n\n\"Community displacement\" is used to describe movement in urban areas. A related term, Development-induced displacement, typically describes movement connected with rural projects, such as dam projects.\n\n\"Community displacement\" is a key argument against informal and formal urban renewal projects. The implication is that the benefits calculus undervalues the interests of the community residents who will be displaced.\n"}
{"id": "221632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221632", "title": "Eskimo–Aleut languages", "text": "Eskimo–Aleut languages\n\nThe Eskimo–Aleut languages (), Eskaleut languages, or Inuit-Yupik-Unangan languages are a language family native to Alaska, the Canadian Arctic (Nunavut and Inuvialuit Settlement Region), Nunavik, Nunatsiavut, Greenland and the Chukchi Peninsula, on the eastern tip of Siberia. It is also known as \"Eskaleutian\", \"Eskaleutic\" or \"Inuit–Yupik-Unangan\".\n\nThe Eskimo–Aleut language family is divided into two branches: the Eskimo languages and the Aleut language. The Aleut branch consists of a single language, Aleut, spoken in the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands. It is divided into several dialects. The Eskimo languages are divided into two branches: the Yupik languages, spoken in western and southwestern Alaska and in easternmost Siberia, and the Inuit languages, spoken in northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Inuit, which covers a huge range of territory, is divided into several varieties. Neighbouring varieties are quite similar, although those at the farthest distances from the centre in the Diomede Islands and East Greenland are quite divergent.\n\nThe proper place of one language, Sirenik, within the Eskimo family has not been settled. While some linguists list it as a branch of Yupik, others list it as a separate branch of the Eskimo family, alongside Yupik and Inuit.\n\nThe Alaska Native Language Center believes that the common ancestral language of the Eskimo languages and of Aleut divided into the Eskimo and Aleut branches at least 4,000 years ago. The Eskimo language family split into the Yupik and Inuit branches around 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Eskimo–Aleut languages are among the native languages of the Americas. This is a geographical category, not a genealogical one. The Eskimo–Aleut languages are not demonstrably related to the other language families of North America and are believed to represent a separate, and the last, prehistoric migration of people from Asia.\n\nAlexander Vovin (2015) notes that Northern Tungusic languages, which are spoken in eastern Siberia and northeastern China, have Eskimo-Aleut loanwords that are not found in Southern Tungusic, implying that Eskimo-Aleut was once much more widely spoken in eastern Siberia. Vovin (2015) estimates that the Eskimo-Aleut loanwords in Northern Tungusic had been borrowed no more than 2,000 years ago, which was when Tungusic was spreading up north from its homeland in the middle reaches of the Amur River. Vovin (2015) considers the homeland (\"Urheimat\") of Proto-Eskimo-Aleut to be in Siberia rather than in Alaska.\n\nEskimo–Aleut does not have any genetic relationship to any of the world's other language families that is generally accepted by linguists at the present time. There is general agreement that it is not closely related to the other language families of North America. The more credible proposals on the external relations of Eskimo–Aleut all concern one or more of the language families of northern Eurasia, such as Chukotko-Kamchatkan just across the Bering Strait. One of the first such proposals was made by the pioneering Danish linguist Rasmus Rask in 1818, upon noticing similarities between Greenlandic and Finnish. Perhaps the most fully developed such proposal to date is Michael Fortescue's Uralo-Siberian hypothesis, published in 1998.\n\nMore recently Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) suggested grouping Eskimo–Aleut with all of the language families of northern Eurasia (Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Korean, Japanese, Ainu, Nivkh/Gilayak, and Chukchi-Kamchatkan), with the exception of Yeniseian, in a proposed language family called Eurasiatic. Such proposals are not generally accepted. Criticisms have been made stating that Greenberg's hypothesis is ahistorical, meaning that it lacks and sacrifices known historical elements of language in favour of external similarities. Although the Eurasiatic hypothesis is generally disregarded by linguists, one critique by Stefan Georg and Alexander Vovin, stated that they were not willing to disregard the theory immediately, although ultimately agreed that Greenberg's conclusion was dubious. Greenberg explicitly states that his developments were based on the previous macro-comparative work done by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Bombard and Kerns. By providing evidence of lexical comparison, Greenberg hoped that it would strengthen his hypothesis.\n\nDespite all these efforts, the Eurasiatic language theory was overruled on the basis that mass comparison is not accurate enough an approach. In comparative linguistics, the comparative method bases its validity on highly regular changes, not occasional semantic and phonological similarities, which is what the Eurasiatic hypothesis provides.\n\nIn the 1960s Swadesh suggested a connection with the Wakashan languages. This was picked up and expanded by Holst (2005).\n\nEvery word must have only one root (free morpheme) always at the beginning. Eskimo–Aleut languages have a relatively small number of roots: in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, around two thousand. Following the root are a number of \"postbases\", which are bound morphemes that add to the basic meaning of the root. If the meaning of the postbase is to be expressed alone, a special neutral root (in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik and Inuktitut \"pi\") is used.\n\nThe basic word schema is as follows: root-(affixes)-inflection-(enclitic). Below is an example from Central Siberian Yupik. \n\nThere are a total of three affixes internal to the word 'angyagh.' The root (or free morpheme) 'angyagh' and the inflection '-tuq' on the right consist of the indicative mood marker plus third person singular. The enclitic –lu ‘also’ follows the inflection.\n\nFollowing the postbases are non-lexical suffixes that indicate case on nouns and person and mood on verbs. The number of cases varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to Eskimo. The Eskimo languages are ergative–absolutive in nouns and in Yup'ik languages, also in verbal person marking. All Eskimo–Aleut languages have obligatory verbal agreement with agent and patient in transitive clauses, and there are special suffixes used for this purpose in subordinate clauses, which makes these languages, like most in the North Pacific, highly \"complement deranking\".\n\nAt the end of a word there can be one of a small number of clitics with meanings such as \"but\" or indicating a polar question.\n\nPhonologically, the Eskimo–Aleut languages resemble other language families of northern North America (Na-Dene and Tsimshianic) and far-eastern Siberia (Chukotko-Kamchatkan). There are usually only three vowels—, , —though some Yup'ik dialects also have . All Eskimo–Aleut languages lack ejectives, in which they resemble the Siberian languages more than the North American ones. Eskimo–Aleut languages possess voiceless plosives at four positions (bilabial, coronal, velar and uvular) in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops (though it has retained the nasal). There are contrasting voiced and voiceless fricatives at the same positions, and in the Eskimo subfamily a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is also present. A rare feature of many dialects of Yup'ik and Aleut is contrasting voiceless nasals.\n\nThe following vowels and consonants were taken from Michael Fortescue et al., 2010\n\nEskimo /ə/ corresponds to Aleut /i/.\n\nInuit allows only a single initial consonant and no more than two successive consonants between vowels.\n\nYupik lacks the consonant assimilation process so common to Inuit.\n\nConsonants in parentheses are non-Proto-Eskimo phonemes.\nThe following vowels and consonants were taken from Knut Bergsland, (1997).\n\nThe Aleut language has six vowels in total: three short vowels /i/, /u/, /a/, and three long vowels /iː/, /uː/, /aː/. Orthographically, they would be spelled \"ii\", \"uu\", and \"aa\". There are no diphthongs in Aleut vowels. The length of the vowel is dependent upon three characteristics: stress, surrounding consonants, and in particularly Eastern Aleut, surrounding vowels. Short vowels are in initial position if a following consonant is velar or labial. For example: the demonstratives \"uka\", \"ika\", and \"aka\".\n\nLong vowels are lower than their short counterpart vowels, but are less retracted if they make contact with a uvular consonant. For example: \"uuquchiing\" 'blue fox,' \"qiiqix̂\" 'storm-petrel', and \"qaaqaan\" 'eat it!'\n\nThe Aleut consonants featured below include single Roman letters, digraphs, and one trigraph. Phonemes in parenthesis are found only in Russian and English loanwords, the phoneme in italics is found only in Eastern Aleut, and the bold phonemes are a part of the standard Aleut inventory.\n\nAleut lacks labial stops and allows clusters of up to three consonants as well as consonant clusters in word initial position.\n\nNoteworthy phonological features: lack of a [p] and its unaspirated nasals\n\nEskimo-Aleut is a polysynthetic language, which is the process in which a single word is able to contain multiple post-bases or morphemes. The Eskimo–Aleut languages are exclusively suffixing (with the exception of one prefix in Inuktitut which appears in demonstratives). Suffixes are able to combine and ultimately create an unlimited number of words. Some of the morphemes that are able to attach contain features such as, carrying nominal subjects and objects, adverbial information, direct objects, and spatial noun phrases. Polysynthetic languages are said to have come from a form of extreme agglutination, which allows single words to carry the same information that another language expresses in whole clauses. For example, in central Alaskan Yupik, one can say:\nAs a polysynthetic language, Eskimo-Aleut is concerned with what \"each morpheme means, which categories it can attach to, whether there is any category change, etc. and what type of morphophonological effect occurs to the left as it attaches to the stem.\"\n\n\"Ergative-Absolutive Language:\"\n\nEskimo-Aleut follows the basic word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).\n\nEskimo is an Ergative-Absolutive language. This means subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs are marked with the absolutive case, while subjects of transitive verbs are marked with the ergative case.\n\nAleut is not an ergative-absolutive language. It doesn't matter if the verb is transitive or intransitive—subjects and objects are not marked differently.\n\nIf a transitive object or an object of possession is openly communicated, ergative case marking will not be expressed. If a transitive object or object of possession is not openly communicated, then ergative case marking will be expressed.\n\nExample of case marking in Aleut:\n\nThe syntax of Eskimo-Aleut is concerned with the functional use of its morphological structure. The two language branches, although part of the same family, have separated and detached themselves in relation to grammatical similarities. Bergsland states that Aleut, which was once a language more similar to Proto-Eskimo than the current Eskimo languages themselves, has distanced itself from the ancient language.\n\nThe case inflections, \"relative *-m, instrumental *-mEk/meN, and locative *-mi have undergone phonological merger and led to a completely different explanation of ergative morphology in Proto-Eskimo.\n\nIn order to further explain the profound changes that have occurred in Aleutian syntax, Bergsland proposed the Domino Effect, which is ultimately the chronological order of Aleut’s unique features. Below is a step by step list of the 'domino effect':\n\n\"The Domino Effect:\"\n\nThe following is a comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Eskimo–Aleut language family (about 122 words). Note that empty cells do not imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language is formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row. Also, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the \"common meaning\" given is only approximate. In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language. Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.\n\nCognates of the Eskimo language can be found in Michael Fortescue et al., 2010.\n\nCognates of the Aleut language can be found in Knut Bergsland, 1997.\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nPersons:\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nPersonal Pronouns:\n\nThere are two types of pronouns in Eskimo- Aleut: Independent Pronouns and Pronominal Pronouns.\n\n\"Pronouns in relation to Nouns:\"\n\nIn Eskimo-Aleut, singular, dual and plural nouns are marked by inflectional suffixes, and if they are possessed the number marker is followed by pronominal suffixes that specify the (human) possessor. There are no genders in the Eskimo–Aleut languages, and this can be seen in the 4 persons: my, your, his/her, his/her own.\n\n'His/her own' specifies ownership in contrast with 'his/her' that does not. E.g., his house versus his own house.\n\n\"Pronouns in relation to Verbs:\"\n\nAleut uses independent pronouns, instead of pronominal marking on verbs. Eskimo, on the other hand has 4 persons and 3 numbers marked by pronominal suffixes.\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nBody Parts:\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nAnimals:\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nOther Nouns:\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nAdjectives:\n\n<div style=\"overflow:auto\">\nNumbers:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19278637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19278637", "title": "Fingerspitzengefühl", "text": "Fingerspitzengefühl\n\nFingerspitzengefühl is a German term, literally meaning \"finger tips feeling\" and meaning intuitive flair or instinct, which has been appropriated by the English language as a loanword. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond most appropriately and tactfully. It can also be applied to diplomats, bearers of bad news, or to describe a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation. The term is sometimes used to describe the instinctive play of certain football players.\n\nIn social context, fingerspitzengefuhl suggests a combination of \"tact, diplomacy and a certain amount of sensitivity to the feelings of others\". It is a quality that can enable a person to \"negotiate tricky social situations\".\n\nIn military terminology, it is used for the stated ability of some military commanders, such as Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel, to describe \"the instinctive and immediate response to battle situations\", a quality needed to maintain, with great accuracy and attention to detail, an ever-changing operational and tactical situation by maintaining a mental map of the battlefield. The idiom is intended to evoke a military commander who is in such intimate communication with the battlefield that it is as though he has a fingertip on each critical point. In this sense the term is synonymous with the English expression of \"keeping one's finger on the pulse\", and was expressed in the 18th and 19th centuries as \"having a feel for combat\".\n\nThe term is only figurative, and cannot in itself give a realistic picture of the ability being described. It is cognitively related to personal possession of multiple intelligences, notably those pertinent to visual and spatial data processing. The term suggests that in addition to any discursive processing of information that the commander may be conducting (such as mentally considering a specific plan), the commander is automatically establishing cognitive relationships between disparate pieces of information as they arrive, and is able to immediately re-synthesise their mental model of the battlefield.\n\nEven though there is no physical connection between the commander and his troops, other than conduits for discursive information such as radio signals, it is \"as if\" the commander had their own sensitive presence in each spot.\n\nOne of the functions of a static map is to allow a traveler to decide upon a course of action suitable for getting from one point to another. In times of war, the terrain and the troops and weapons deployed upon it can be changed much more rapidly than cartographers can change their maps. A commander with \"fingerspitzengefühl\" would hold such a map in their mind, and adjust it by incorporating any significant information that was received.\n\nThe concept may be compared to ideas about intuition and neural net programming. The same phenomenon, but conceptualized in a radically different way, seems to be described by D.T. Suzuki in swordsmanship teaching stories recounted in his \"Zen and Japanese Culture,\" and given in analytical detail in \"Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis\".\n"}

{"id": "24708461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24708461", "title": "Gaius Valerius Troucillus", "text": "Gaius Valerius Troucillus\n\nGaius Valerius Troucillus or Procillus (\"fl.\" mid-1st century BC) was a Helvian Celt who served as an interpreter and envoy for Julius Caesar in the first year of the Gallic Wars. Troucillus was a second-generation Roman citizen, and is one of the few ethnic Celts who can be identified both as a citizen and by affiliation with a Celtic polity. His father, Caburus, and a brother are named in Book 7 of Caesar's \"Bellum Gallicum\" as defenders of Helvian territory against a force sent by Vercingetorix in 52 BC. Troucillus plays a role in two episodes from the first book of Caesar's war commentaries (58 BC), as an interpreter for the druid Diviciacus and as an envoy to the Suebian king Ariovistus, who accuses him of spying and has him thrown in chains.\n\nTroucillus was an exact contemporary of two other notable Transalpine Gauls: the Vocontian father of the historian Pompeius Trogus, who was a high-level administrator on Caesar's staff; and Varro Atacinus, the earliest Transalpiner to acquire a literary reputation in Rome as a Latin poet. Their ability as well-educated men to rise in Roman society is evidence of early Gallo-Roman acculturation.\n\nCaesar first mentions Valerius Troucillus in \"Bellum Gallicum\" 1.19, when the Roman commander is made aware of questionable loyalties among the Celtic Aedui, Rome's allies in central Gaul since at least the 120s BC. Caesar represents this divided allegiance in the persons of two brothers, the druid Diviciacus, who had appeared before the Roman senate a few years earlier to request aid against Germanic invaders, and the enterprising populist Dumnorix, who was the leading Aeduan in terms of wealth and military power. Dumnorix stood accused of conspiring with the enemy Helvetii; when Caesar holds a confidential discussion with his friend Diviciacus, he dismisses the usual interpreters and calls in Troucillus. Caesar describes Troucillus as a leading citizen of the province of Gallia Narbonensis and his personal friend (\"familiaris\"), adding that he placed the highest trust (\"fides\") in the Helvian in all matters.\n\nAt \"Bellum Gallicum\" 1.46 and 52, Caesar names a Transalpine Gaul, this time according to the manuscripts as Gaius Valerius Procillus, whom he again calls his \"familiaris\" as well as his \"hospes\". The \"hospes\", sometimes translatable as a \"family friend\" and meaning \"guest\" or \"host\" in Latin interchangeably, is a participant in the mutual social relationship of \"hospitium\", reciprocal guest-host hospitality. Caesar's use of the term may imply that he was a guest of the Helvian Valerii when he traveled through the Narbonensis, as he did to or from one of his two postings in Hispania during the 60s, or that the Helvian had been a guest of Caesar in Rome before the war. Most scholars assume that the two names refer to a single man; although \"Troucillus\" is a problematic reading of the text, it is a well-established Celtic name, whereas \"Procillus\" appears to have been confused with a Roman name. In this episode, Caesar sends Troucillus as a diplomatic envoy to the Suebian king Ariovistus, and again commends his linguistic skills and his \"fides\", his loyalty or trustworthiness.\n\nCaesar identifies Troucillus as an \"adulescens\", a young man, generally in Caesarian usage between the ages of 20 and 30 and not having yet entered the political career track or held a formal command. The term is used elsewhere in the \"Bellum Gallicum\" for Publius Crassus and Decimus Brutus, who were born in the mid-80s.\n\nCaesar's identification of Troucillus's citizen status provides a piece of evidence for the history of Roman provincial administration in Gaul. Caesar notes that he is the son of Gaius Valerius Caburus, who was granted citizenship by G. Valerius Flaccus during his governorship in the 80s. Caburus took his patron's gentilic name, as was customary for naturalized citizens. Although Caburus's two sons retain a Celtic \"cognomen\" (personal name), by the third generation a member of such a family is likely to be using a more typically Roman name, and the Helvian Valerii cannot be identified further in the historical record.\n\nThe reference to Caburus's grant of citizenship in 83 BC helps date the term of Flaccus in his Transalpine province, and shows that Gauls were receiving Roman citizenship soon after annexation. As indicated by his closeness in age to Crassus and Brutus, Troucillus was born shortly before or after his father became a citizen, and was among the first Transalpiners to grow up with a dual Gallo-Roman identity.\n\nAlthough no title or rank is given for Troucillus, Caesar calls him a \"princeps Galliae provinciae\", \"a leading citizen of the Province of Gaul\". His father, Caburus, is called \"princeps civitatis\" of the Helvii, who are identified in this phrase not as a \"pagus\", much less a \"tribe\" (Latin \"tribus\"), but as a \"civitas\", a polity with at least small-scale urban centers (\"oppida\"). It has been argued that \"princeps\" denotes a particular office in the Narbonensis, but the word is usually taken to mean simply a \"leader\" or \"leading citizen.\" Troucillus is listed among legates and envoys for 58 BC in Broughton's \"Magistrates of the Roman Republic\". Erich S. Gruen notes the presence of Troucillus among those who demonstrate that Caesar favored men of non-Roman and equestrian origin among his junior officers and lieutenants. Ronald Syme calls the Helvian \"a cultivated and admirable young man.\"\n\nTroucillus was accompanied on the mission to Ariovistus by Marcus Mettius (or Metius), a Roman who had a formal social relationship (\"hospitium\") with the Suebian king. Since Ariovistus had been declared a Friend of the Roman People (\"amicus populi romani\") during Caesar's consulship in 59 BC, the \"hospitium\" between him and Mettius might have had to do with the diplomacy that led to the declaration of friendship; business dealings involving goods, slaves, or animals are also not out of the question. In 60 BC, the senate had sent three legates on a diplomatic mission to shore up relations to key Gallic \"civitates\", including the Aedui, against the threatened invasion or inducements of the Helvetii, whose entry into Allobrogian and Aeduan territory two years later provided Caesar with a \"casus belli\". One of these legates was Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the nephew of the Valerius Flaccus who had granted Caburus's citizenship. Lucius had served under his uncle in the Narbonensis at the beginning of his career. Because of their ties to the Valerii Flacci, Troucillus or another member of his family might have traveled with Flaccus as interpreter or liaison. Caesar explains his decision to send Troucillus to Ariovistus on linguistic grounds, saying that the Suebian king had learned to speak Celtic.\n\nDespite Caesar's assertion that the king should have no cause to find fault with Troucillus, Ariovistus immediately accuses the pair of envoys of spying and refuses to allow them to speak. He has Troucillus thrown in chains. Such treatment of envoys was a violation of the \"ius gentium\", the customary law of international relations, but it has been observed that Ariovistus's charge may not have been groundless.\n\nTroucillus is held by the Suebi until the decisive battle, in which the Romans are victorious. Caesar gives the recovery of the young Celt an emphatic place in the penultimate paragraph of the book; several scholars have detected a degree of personal warmth in the passage that is atypical of the commentaries:\n\nIn his discussion of racial stereotyping among the Romans, A.N. Sherwin-White takes note of this passage in Caesar's overall depiction of Ariovistus as \"an impossible person\" who thought \"nothing of frying an envoy.\" For reasons that are unclear, the Roman Mettius seems to have received better treatment during his captivity than did the Celtic envoy. The episode allows Caesar himself to display by contrast the aristocratic virtue of treating one's dependent friends well, which fosters obligations that enhance the important man's prestige.\n\nH.R. Ellis Davidson views the casting of lots and proposed immolation of Troucillus as a form of human sacrifice in the context of Germanic religious practice. Both Celtic and Germanic peoples were said to practice human sacrifice, and it had been banned from Roman religious use by law only about forty years before the Gallic War. In his ethnography \"Germania\", Tacitus notes that divination by means of lots was pervasive among the Germans, and records a rite of human sacrifice among the Semnones, \"the most ancient and noble of the Suebi,\" that involves binding the participant in a chain; in his edition, J.B. Rives connects the practice to the incident involving Troucillus. Tacitus describes the use of twigs with markings in the casting of lots, and it has been suggested that these were used to cast the lots for Troucillus, with the markings an early form of runes. An 8th-century source says that the Germanic Frisians cast lots over a period of three days to determine the death penalty in cases of sacrilege, and the lots were cast three times for Troucillus; spying in the guise of diplomatic envoy would violate the sacred trust under the aegis of \"hospitium\".\n\nNo polity within Caesar's Narbonese province joined the pan-Gallic rebellion of 52 BC, nor engaged in any known acts of hostility against Rome during the war. The family of Troucillus, in fact, plays a key role in securing Caesar's rear militarily against Vercingetorix, who sent forces to invade Helvian territory. In his 1861 history of the Vivarais, Abbé Rouchier conjectured that Caesar, seeing the strategic utility of Helvian territory on the border of the Roman province along a main route into central Gaul, was able to cultivate the Valerii by redressing punitive measures taken against the \"civitas\" by Pompeius Magnus (\"Pompey the Great\") in the 70s. During the secession of Quintus Sertorius in Spain, Celtic polities in Mediterranean Gaul were subjected to troop levies and forced requisitions to support the military efforts of Metellus Pius, Pompeius, and other Roman commanders against the rebels. Some Celts, however, supported Sertorius. After the renegade Roman was assassinated, Metellus and Pompeius were able to declare a victory, and the Helvii along with the Volcae Arecomici were forced to cede a portion of their lands to the Greek city-state Massilia (present-day Marseilles), a loyal independent ally of Rome for centuries, located strategically at the mouth of the Rhône. Caesar mentions the land forfeiture in his account of the civil war, without detailing Helvian actions against Rome. During the Roman civil wars of the 40s, Massilia chose to maintain its longstanding relationship with Pompeius even in isolation, as the Gallic polities of the Narbonensis continued to support Caesar. The Massiliots were besieged and defeated by Caesar, and as a result lost their independence, as well as possibly the land they had taken from the Helvii. Rouchier presents an extended portrait of Troucillus in his history, viewing the educated young Celt through Caesar's eyes as an example of a visionary meritocracy in Rome.\n\nDuring his dictatorship, Caesar extended full rights of Roman citizenship to ethnically Celtic Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), and filled the roll of the Roman senate with controversial appointments that included Cisalpine and possibly a few Narbonese Gauls. Although accusations of degrading the senate with uncivilized \"trouser-wearing Gauls\" were exaggerations meant to disparage Caesar's inclusive efforts, Ronald Syme has pointed out that men such as Troucillus and Trogus were educated citizens worthy of such appointments:\n\nTroucillus's fluent bilingualism is asserted by Caesar. The French scholar Christian Goudineau found it \"perplexing\" to have Caesar take special note that a native Gaul spoke Gaulish, and suggests that this emphasis on Troucillus's retention of what should have been his first language indicates that the Helvian had been given the same education as a Roman, perhaps even in Rome and maybe as a hostage.\n\nSyme points out that the Gauls of the \"Provincia\" had direct exposure to the Greek language and to Hellenic culture through the regional influence of Massilia, which had well-established contact with the Helvii (see \"The Helvii and Roman politics\" above). The cultural and linguistic complexity of Mediterranean Gaul is asserted by Varro, who says Massilia is \"trilingual, because they speak Greek, Latin, and Gaulish.\"\n\nCaesar employs two abstract nouns from the Roman moral vocabulary to describe Troucillus: he is said to be outstanding for his \"humanitas\" and his \"virtus\". \"Humanitas\" was \"a keyword for late Republican elite self-definition\"; it embraced a range of ideals including culture, civilization, education, and goodwill toward one's fellow human beings. Cicero considered \"humanitas\" to be one of Caesar's own outstanding qualities, and often pairs it with \"lepos\", \"charm\"; in his speech arguing for the extension of Caesar's proconsular command, he distinguishes Roman culture from Gallic by mockingly asking whether \"the culture and charm of those people and nations\" could possibly be the attraction for Caesar, rather than the war's usefulness to the state (\"utilitas rei publicae\"). Cicero also associates \"humanitas\" with speaking well, the ability to hold a cultivated conversation free of vulgarity and to speak in an urbane manner.\n\nA hundred and fifty years later, Tacitus takes a more cynical view of \"humanitas\" as an illusion of civilization that is in fact submission to the dominant culture. Tacitus observes that as governor of Roman Britain, Agricola had engaged in a program of\n\nThe Roman concept of \"humanitas\" as it took shape in the 1st century BC has been criticized from a postcolonial perspective as a form of imperialism, \"a civilizing mission: it was Rome's destiny and duty to spread humanitas to other races, tempering barbarian practices and instituting the \"pax Romana\".\"\n\nThe word \"humanitas\" appears only twice throughout the entirety of Caesar's \"Bellum Gallicum\", both times in Book 1. In the famous opening, in which the commander parcels out Gaul into three divisions (\"Belgae ... Aquitani ... Celtae\", 1.1.1) for potential conquest, Caesar reports that the Belgic Gauls are the bravest (\"fortissimi\") fighters, \"because they are at the farthest remove from the cultivation (\"cultus\") and civilization (\"humanitas\") of the Province.\" By contrast, Troucillus is said to possess the highest level of both \"humanitas\" and \"virtus\". \"Virtus\", which shares a semantic element with the Latin word \"vir\", \"man,\" is most commonly translated by either \"virtue\" or \"courage, valor\"; it is \"the quality of manliness or manhood.\" As an active quality, appropriate to the man of action, \"virtus\" balances the potentially enervating effects of civilization in the natural aristocrat. Caesar's prolific use of the word \"virtus\" — fourteen instances in Book 1 alone, in reference to Celtic nations as a whole, and to the Roman army — points to \"no easily articulated essential meaning\": \"\"Virtus\" was whatever it was that Romans liked when they saw it.\" Although the word appears frequently throughout the \"Bellum Gallicum\", Caesar attributes the quality of \"virtus\" to only a few individuals: Troucillus; three Roman officers; and two Celts, Commius of the Atrebates and Tasgetius of the Carnutes.\n\nT.P. Wiseman saw the role of Troucillus in \"Bellum Gallicum\" 1 as one indication of the breadth of Caesar's intended audience. Wiseman argues that the commentaries were first published serially, with a year-by-year account to keep Caesar and his achievements vivid in the mind of the public (\"populus\") on whose support he counted as a popularist leader. The seven individual books were then collected and supplemented by Aulus Hirtius at the end of the 50s or beginning of the 40s. \"Publication\" in ancient Rome relied less on the circulation of written copies than on public and private readings, which were an important form of entertainment; this circumstance, Wiseman intuits, goes a long way toward explaining Caesar's narrative use of the third person in regard to himself, since the audience would be hearing the words spoken by a reader. In addition to public relations efforts among the Roman people, Wiseman believes that Caesar would have sent readers to the Narbonensis, the Mediterranean region of Gaul already under Roman administration, because he required Narbonese support at his back if he was to succeed in independent Gaul.\n\nThe prominent attention given to the recovery of Troucillus from the Suebi at the end of Book 1, and the unusual warmth with which Caesar speaks of him, suggests that the proconsul valued his friends to the south and was careful to show it. In another indication of Narbonese regard for Caesar, the poet Varro Atacinus, the contemporary of Troucillus, wrote an epic poem called the \"Bellum Sequanicum\" (\"Sequanian War\"), no longer extant, about the first year of Caesar's war in Gaul.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11884", "title": "German language", "text": "German language\n\nGerman ( ) is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, although those belong to the North Germanic group. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English.\n\nOne of the major languages of the world, German is the first language of almost 100 million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the European Union. Together with French, German is the second most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English, making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers. German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level), the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US (after Spanish, French and American Sign Language), and the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the second most widely used language on websites after English. The German-speaking countries are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in the German language. In the United Kingdom, German and French are the most-sought after foreign languages for businesses (with 49% and 50% of businesses identifying these two languages as the most useful, respectively).\n\nGerman is an inflected language with four cases for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and strong and weak verbs. German derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. A portion of German words are derived from Latin and Greek, and fewer are borrowed from French and Modern English. With slightly different standardized variants (German, Austrian and Swiss Standard German), German is a pluricentric language. Like English, German is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and Standard German, as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. Low German or Plautdietsch) are alternatively referred to as \"languages\" and \"dialects\".\n\nModern Standard German is a West Germanic language descended from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: North Germanic, East Germanic, and West Germanic. The first of these branches survives in modern Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Faroese, and Icelandic, all of which are descended from Old Norse. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is Gothic. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as English, German, Dutch, Yiddish, Afrikaans, and others.\n\nWithin the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the Benrath and Uerdingen lines (running through Düsseldorf-Benrath and Krefeld-Uerdingen, respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the High German consonant shift (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as High German dialects \"(nos. 29–34 on the map)\", while those spoken to the north comprise the Low German/Low Saxon \"(nos. 19–24)\" and Low Franconian \"(no. 25)\" dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as Irminonic, Ingvaeonic, and Istvaeonic, respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).\n\nStandard German is based on Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialects \"(no. 30 on the map)\", which are Central German dialects \"(nos. 29–31)\", belonging to the Irminonic High German dialect group \"(nos. 29–34)\". German is therefore most closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as Luxembourgish (based on Central Franconian dialects – \"no. 29\"), and Yiddish. Also closely related to Standard German are the Upper German dialects spoken in the southern German-speaking countries, such as Swiss German (Alemannic dialects – \"no. 34\"), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the French region of Grand Est, such as Alsatian (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and Upper Franconian \"(no. 32)\" dialects) and Lorraine Franconian (Central Franconian – \"no. 29\").\n\nAfter these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern Germany and southern Denmark), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages—North Frisian (spoken in Nordfriesland – \"no. 28\"), Saterland Frisian (spoken in Saterland – \"no. 27\"), and West Frisian (spoken in Friesland – \"no. 26\")—as well as the Anglic languages of English and Scots. These Anglo-Frisian dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.\n\nThe history of the German language begins with the High German consonant shift during the migration period, which separated Old High German (OHG) dialects from Old Saxon. This sound shift involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both voiced and voiceless stop consonants (\"b\", \"d\", \"g\", and \"p\", \"t\", \"k\", respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:\n\n\nWhile there is written evidence of the Old High German language in several Elder Futhark inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the Pforzen buckle), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the \"Abrogans\" (written c.765–775), a Latin-German glossary supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their Latin equivalents. Following the \"Abrogans\" the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the \"Muspilli\", the \"Merseburg Charms\", and the \"Hildebrandslied\", as well as a number of other religious texts (the \"Georgslied\", the \"Ludwigslied\", the \"Evangelienbuch\", and translated hymns and prayers). The \"Muspilli\" is a Christian poem written in a Bavarian dialect offering an account of the soul after the Last Judgment, and the \"Merseburg Charms\" are transcriptions of spells and charms from the pagan Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the \"Hildebrandslied\", a secular epic poem telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of Old Saxon and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the Alamanni, Bavarian, and Thuringian groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group (Irminones), which had settled in what is now southern-central Germany and Austria between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.\n\nIn general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of dialectal diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through monasteries and scriptoria as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary. At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.\n\nThe German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive oral tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of phonetic, phonological, morphological, and syntactic changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of standardization up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.\n\nWhile there is no complete agreement over the dates of the Middle High German (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350. This was a period of significant expansion of the geographical territory occupied by Germanic tribes, and consequently of the number of German speakers. Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the Elbe and Saale rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into Slavic territory (this is known as the \"Ostsiedlung\"). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature. A clear example of this is the \"mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache\" employed in the Hohenstaufen court in Swabia as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.\n\nWhile the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. diphthongization of certain vowel sounds: \"hus\" (OHG \"house\")\"→haus\" (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to schwa [ə]: \"taga\" (OHG \"days\")→\"tage\" (MHG)).\n\nA great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the \"Nibelungenlied\", an epic poem telling the story of the dragon-slayer Siegfried (c. 13th century), and the \"Iwein,\" an Arthurian verse poem by Hartmann von Aue (c. 1203), as well as several lyric poems and courtly romances such as \"Parzival\" and \"Tristan\". (Also noteworthy is the \"Sachsenspiegel\", the first book of laws written in Middle \"Low\" German (c. 1220)). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.\n\nThe Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of Europe in the Black Death of 1346–1353.\n\nModern German begins with the Early New High German (ENHG) period, which the influential German philologist Wilhelm Scherer dates 1350–1650, terminating with the end of the Thirty Years' War. This period saw the further displacement of Latin by German as the primary language of courtly proceedings and, increasingly, of literature in the German states. While these states were still under the control of the Holy Roman Empire and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking principalities and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible regional dialects being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the printing press c.1440 and the publication of Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.\n\nThe ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of chancery German, one being \"gemeine tiutsch,\" used in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and the other being \"Meißner Deutsch\", used in the Electorate of Saxony in the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg. Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (\"Druckersprachen\") aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible. The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the New Testament in 1522 and the Old Testament, published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the \"Meißner Deutsch\" of Saxony, spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of glosses for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German. When Christ says 'ex abundantia cordis os loquitur,' I would translate, if I followed the papists, \"aus dem Überflusz des Herzens redet der Mund\". But tell me is this talking German? What German understands such stuff? No, the mother in the home and the plain man would say, \"Wesz das Herz voll ist, des gehet der Mund über\".With Luther's rendering of the Bible in the vernacular German asserted itself against the dominance of Latin as a legitimate language for courtly, literary, and now ecclesiastical subject-matter. Further, his Bible was ubiquitous in the German states with nearly every household possessing a copy. Nevertheless, even with the influence of Luther's Bible as an unofficial written standard, it was not until the middle of the 18th century after the ENHG period that a widely accepted standard for written German appeared.\n\nGerman was the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-19th century, it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. Its use indicated that the speaker was a merchant or someone from an urban area, regardless of nationality.\n\nSome cities, such as Prague () and Budapest (Buda, ), were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as Pozsony (, now Bratislava), were originally settled during the Habsburg period, and were primarily German at that time. Prague, Budapest and Bratislava as well as cities like Zagreb (), and Ljubljana (), contained significant German minorities.\n\nIn the eastern provinces of Banat and Transylvania (), German was the predominant language not only in the larger towns – such as (Timișoara), (Sibiu) and (Brașov) – but also in many smaller localities in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe most comprehensive guide to the vocabulary of the German language is found within the . This dictionary was created by the Brothers Grimm and is composed of 16 parts which were issued between 1852 and 1860. In 1872, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the \"Duden Handbook\".\n\nIn 1901, the 2nd Orthographical Conference ended with a complete standardization of the German language in its written form and the \"Duden Handbook\" was declared its standard definition. The (literally, German stage language) had established conventions for German pronunciation in theatre (Bühnendeutsch) three years earlier; however, this was an artificial standard that did not correspond to any traditional spoken dialect. Rather, it was based on the pronunciation of Standard German in Northern Germany, although it was subsequently regarded often as a general prescriptive norm, despite differing pronunciation traditions especially in the Upper-German-speaking regions that still characterize the dialect of the area today – especially the pronunciation of the ending as [ɪk] instead of [ɪç]. In Northern Germany, Standard German was a foreign language to most inhabitants, whose native dialects were subsets of Low German. It was usually encountered only in writing or formal speech; in fact, most of Standard German was a written language, not identical to any spoken dialect, throughout the German-speaking area until well into the 19th century.\n\nOfficial revisions of some of the rules from 1901 were not issued until the controversial German orthography reform of 1996 was made the official standard by governments of all German-speaking countries. Media and written works are now almost all produced in Standard German (often called , \"High German\") which is understood in all areas where German is spoken.\n\nDue to the German diaspora as well as German being the second most widely spoken language in Europe and the third most widely taught foreign language in the US and the EU (in upper secondary education) amongst others, the geographical distribution of German speakers (or \"Germanophones\") spans all inhabited continents. As for the number of speakers of any language worldwide, an assessment is always compromised by the lack of sufficient, reliable data. For an exact, global number of native German speakers, this is further complicated by the existence of several varieties whose status as separate \"languages\" or \"dialects\" is disputed for political and/or linguistic reasons, including quantitatively strong varieties like certain forms of Alemannic (e.g., Alsatian) and Low German/Plautdietsch. Mostly depending on the inclusion or exclusion of certain varieties, it is estimated that approximately 90–95 million people speak German as a first language, 10–25 million as a second language, and 75–100 million as a foreign language. This would imply approximately 175–220 million German speakers worldwide. It is estimated that also including all persons who are or were taking German classes, i.e., regardless of their actual proficiency, would amount to about 280 million people worldwide with at least some knowledge of German.\n\nIn Europe, German is the second most widely spoken mother tongue (after Russian) and the second biggest language in terms of overall speakers (after English). The area in central Europe where the majority of the population speaks German as a first language and has German as a (co-)official language is called the \"German Sprachraum\". It comprises an estimated 88 million native speakers and 10 million who speak German as a second language (e.g. immigrants). Excluding regional minority languages, German is the only official language of\n\nIt is a co-official language of the\n\nAlthough expulsions and (forced) assimilation after the two World Wars greatly diminished them, minority communities of mostly bilingual German native speakers exist in areas both adjacent to and detached from the Sprachraum.\n\nWithin Europe and Asia, German is a recognized minority language in the following countries:\n\nIn France, the High German varieties of Alsatian and Moselle Franconian are identified as \"regional languages\", but the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages of 1998 has not yet been ratified by the government. In the Netherlands, the Limburgish, Frisian, and Low German languages are protected regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages; however, they are widely considered separate languages and neither German nor Dutch dialects.\n\nNamibia was a colony of the German Empire from 1884 to 1919. Mostly descending from German settlers who immigrated during this time, 25–30,000 people still speak German as a native tongue today. The period of German colonialism in Namibia also led to the evolution of a Standard German-based pidgin language called \"Namibian Black German\", which became a second language for parts of the indigenous population. Although it is nearly extinct today, some older Namibians still have some knowledge of it.\n\nGerman, along with English and Afrikaans was a co-official language of Namibia from 1984 until its independence from South Africa in 1990. At this point, the Namibian government perceived Afrikaans and German as symbols of apartheid and colonialism, and decided English would be the sole official language, claiming that it was a \"neutral\" language as there were virtually no English native speakers in Namibia at that time. German, Afrikaans and several indigenous languages became \"national languages\" by law, identifying them as elements of the cultural heritage of the nation and ensuring that the state acknowledged and supported their presence in the country. Today, German is used in a wide variety of spheres, especially business and tourism, as well as the churches (most notably the German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK)), schools (e.g. the ), literature (German-Namibian authors include Giselher W. Hoffmann), radio (the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation produces radio programs in German), and music (e.g. artist EES). The is one of the three biggest newspapers in Namibia and the only German-language daily in Africa.\n\nMostly originating from different waves of immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries, an estimated 12,000 people speak German or a German variety as a first language in South Africa. One of the largest communities consists of the speakers of \"\", a variety of Low German, concentrated in and around Wartburg. The small town of Kroondal in the North-West Province also has a mostly German-speaking population. The South African constitution identifies German as a \"commonly used\" language and the Pan South African Language Board is obligated to promote and ensure respect for it. The community is strong enough that several German International schools are supported such as the Deutsche Schule Pretoria.\n\nIn the United States, the states of North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states where German is the most common language spoken at home after English. German geographical names can be found throughout the Midwest region of the country, such as New Ulm and many other towns in Minnesota; Bismarck (North Dakota's state capital), Munich, Karlsruhe, and Strasburg (named after a town near Odessa in Ukraine) in North Dakota; New Braunfels, Fredericksburg, Weimar, and Muenster in Texas; Corn (formerly Korn), Kiefer and Berlin in Oklahoma; and Kiel, Berlin, and Germantown in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Brazil, the largest concentrations of German speakers are in the states of Rio Grande do Sul (where Riograndenser Hunsrückisch developed), Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo and Espírito Santo. There are also important concentrations of German-speaking descendants in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia. \n\n\nIn Australia, the state of South Australia experienced a pronounced wave of immigration in the 1840s from Prussia (particularly the Silesia region). With the prolonged isolation from other German speakers and contact with Australian English, a unique dialect known as Barossa German has developed and is spoken predominantly in the Barossa Valley near Adelaide. Usage of German sharply declined with the advent of World War I, due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment in the population and related government action. It continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century but now its use is limited to a few older speakers.\n\nGerman migration to New Zealand in the 19th century was less pronounced than migration from Britain, Ireland, and perhaps even Scandinavia. Despite this there were significant pockets of German-speaking communities which lasted until the first decades of the 20th century. German-speakers settled principally in Puhoi, Nelson, and Gore. At the last census (2013), 36,642 people in New Zealand spoke German, making it the third most spoken European language after English and French and overall the ninth most spoken language.\n\nThere is also an important German creole being studied and recovered, named , spoken in the former German colony of German New Guinea, across Micronesia and in northern Australia (i.e. coastal parts of Queensland and Western Australia), by a few elderly people. The risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars.\n\nLike French and Spanish, German has become a classic second foreign language in the western world, as English (Spanish in the US) is well established as the first foreign language. German ranks second (after English) among the best known foreign languages in the EU (on a par with French) as well as in Russia. In terms of student numbers across all levels of education, German ranks third in the EU (after English and French) as well as in the United States (after Spanish and French). In 2015, approximately 15.4 million people were in the process of learning German across all levels of education worldwide. As this number remained relatively stable since 2005 (± 1 million), roughly 75–100 million people able to communicate in German as foreign language can be inferred assuming an average course duration of three years and other estimated parameters. According to a 2012 survey, 47 million people within the EU (i.e., up to two thirds of the 75–100 million worldwide) claimed to have sufficient German skills to have a conversation. Within the EU, not counting countries where it is an official language, German as a foreign language is most popular in Eastern and Northern Europe, namely the Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Sweden and Poland. German was once and, to some extent, is still, a lingua franca in those parts of Europe.\n\nStandard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language. However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by new vernaculars based on standard German; that is the case in large stretches of Northern Germany but also in major cities in other parts of the country. It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.\n\nStandard German differs regionally between German-speaking countries in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation and even grammar and orthography. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a pluricentric language.\n\nIn most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to circumstances.\n\nIn German linguistics, German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German.\nThe \"varieties of standard German\" refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric standard German. They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.\n\nIn the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak \"High German\" (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants. This situation has been called a \"medial diglossia\". Swiss Standard German is used in the Swiss education system, whereas Austrian Standard German is officially used in the Austrian education system.\n\nA mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German \"variety\". Because their linguistic distance to it is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, Hessian) can.\n\nGerman is a member of the West Germanic language of the Germanic family of languages, which in turn is part of the Indo-European language family. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in lexicon, phonology and syntax. If a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the Ethnologue). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into High German and Low German, also called Low Saxon. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.\n\nMiddle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the Luther Bible was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the Early New High German. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on Central and Upper German varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low German and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education in Standard German in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as . Sometimes, Low Saxon and Low Franconian varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since World War II. The largest cities in the Low German area are Hamburg and Dortmund.\n\nThe Low Franconian dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to Dutch than to Low German. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the Netherlands and in Belgium, where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of North Rhine-Westphalia, along the Lower Rhine. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as Meuse-Rhenish or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of South Guelderish) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East Limburgish and, east of the Rhine, Bergish), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and Ripuarian (Central Franconian). The East Bergish dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and Westphalian (Low German), with most of its features however being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are Düsseldorf and Duisburg.\n\nThe High German dialects consist of the Central German, High Franconian, and Upper German dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, Yiddish, written with the Hebrew alphabet. \n\nThe Central German dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from Aachen in the west to Görlitz in the east. They consist of Franconian dialects in the west (West Central German), and non-Franconian dialects in the east (East Central German). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.\n\nThe Franconian, West Central German dialects are the Central Franconian dialects (Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian), and the Rhine Franconian dialects (Hessian and Palatine). These dialects are considered as\nLuxembourgish as well as the Transylvanian Saxon dialect spoken in Transylvania are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are Cologne and Frankfurt.\n\nFurther east, the non-Franconian, East Central German dialects are spoken (Thuringian, Upper Saxon, Ore Mountainian, and Lusatian-New Markish, and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of Silesia also Silesian, and in then German southern East Prussia also High Prussian). The largest cities in the East Central German area are Berlin and Leipzig.\n\nThe High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the East- and South Franconian dialects.\n\nThe East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of Franconia and in the central parts of Saxon Vogtland. Franconia consists of the Bavarian districts of Upper-, Middle-, and Lower Franconia, the region of South Thuringia (Thuringia), and the eastern parts of the region of Heilbronn-Franken (Tauber Franconia and Hohenlohe) in Baden-Württemberg. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are Nuremberg and Würzburg.\n\nSouth Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-Württemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of Alsace in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-Württemberg, they are considered as dialects of Alsatian in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however Low Alemannic). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are Karlsruhe and Heilbronn.\n\nThe Upper German dialects are the Alemannic dialects in the west, and the Bavarian dialects in the east.\n\nAlemannic dialects are spoken in Switzerland (High Alemannic in the densely populated Swiss Plateau, in the south also Highest Alemannic, and Low Alemannic in Basel), Baden-Württemberg (Swabian and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), Bavarian Swabia (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), Vorarlberg (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), Alsace (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), Liechtenstein (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the Tyrolean district of Reutte (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as Alsatian in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are Stuttgart and Zürich.\n\nBavarian dialects are spoken in Austria (Vienna, Lower- and Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Burgenland, and in most parts of Tyrol), Bavaria (Upper- and Lower Bavaria as well as Upper Palatinate), South Tyrol, southwesternmost Saxony (Southern Vogtlandian), and in the Swiss village of Samnaun. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are Vienna and Munich.\n\nGerman is a fusional language with a moderate degree of inflection, with three grammatical genders; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.\n\nGerman nouns inflect by case, gender and number:\n\nThis degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old High German and other old Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit, and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, Old English, modern Icelandic or Russian. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the definite article, which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive (only in archaic use in the dative), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech. The dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: .\n\nIn German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ( – \"On Friday I went shopping.\";  – \"One day he finally showed up.\") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxembourgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.\n\nLike the other Germanic languages, German forms noun compounds in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second,: (\"dog hut\"; specifically: \"dog kennel\"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in \"open\" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the \"closed\" form without spaces, for example: (\"tree house\"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also English compounds). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is , which, literally translated, is \"beef labelling supervision duty assignment law\" [from (cattle), (meat), (labelling), (supervision), (duties), (assignment), (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.\n\nThe inflection of standard German verbs includes:\n\nThe meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix ' refers to destruction, as in (to tear apart), (to break apart), (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; ' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in (to try) from (to seek), (to interrogate) from (to take), (to distribute) from (to share), (to understand) from (to stand).\n\nOther examples include the following:\n\nMany German verbs have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In finite verb forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a \"resultative particle\". For example, , meaning \"to go along\", would be split, giving (Literal: \"Go you with?\"; Idiomatic: \"Are you going along?\").\n\nIndeed, several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):\nA selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:\n\nGerman word order is generally with the V2 word order restriction and also with the SOV word order restriction for main clauses. For polar questions, exclamations and wishes, the finite verb always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.\n\nGerman requires for a verbal element (main verb or auxiliary verb) to appear second in the sentence. The verb is preceded by the topic of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:\n\nThe position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a declarative sentence in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.\n\nHowever, German's flexibile word order allows one to emphasise specific words:\n\nNormal word order:\n\nObject in front:\n\nAdverb of time in front:\n\nBoth time expressions in front:\n\nAnother possibility:\n\nSwapped adverbs:\n\nSwapped object:\n\nThe flexible word order also allows one to use language \"tools\" (such as poetic meter and figures of speech) more freely.\n\nWhen an auxiliary verb is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the perfect tense. Many word orders are still possible:\n\nThe main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The auxiliary verb is still in second position.\n\nSentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence \"Should he go home?\" would be rearranged in German to say \"Should he (to) home go?\" (). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: \"What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?\"\n\nGerman subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode future, passive, modality, and the perfect, very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in is often replaced by the infinitive.\n\nThe order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.\n\nMost German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the European language family. However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from Latin, Greek, Italian, French and most recently English. In the early 19th century, Joachim Heinrich Campe estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.\n\nLatin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the Roman Empire and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. , , , , from Latin , , , , ). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during Renaissance humanism. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.\n\nAt the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great. Thus, Notker Labeo was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000. The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like Joachim Heinrich Campe, who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German. Even today, there are movements that try to promote the (substitution) of foreign words deemed unnecessary with German alternatives. It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated and as well democratise public life.\n\nAs in English, there are many pairs of synonyms due to the enrichment of the Germanic vocabulary with loanwords from Latin and Latinized Greek. These words often have different connotations from their Germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly.\n\n\nThe size of the vocabulary of German is difficult to estimate. The (\"The German Dictionary\") initiated by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm already contained over 330,000 headwords in its first edition. The modern German scientific vocabulary is estimated at nine million words and word groups (based on the analysis of 35 million sentences of a corpus in Leipzig, which as of July 2003 included 500 million words in total).\n\nThe Duden is the \"de facto\" official dictionary of the German language, first published by Konrad Duden in 1880. The Duden is updated regularly, with new editions appearing every four or five years. , it is in its 27th edition and in 12 volumes, each covering different aspects such as loanwords, etymology, pronunciation, synonyms, and so forth.The first of these volumes, (German Orthography), has long been the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The \"Duden\" has become the bible of the German language, being the definitive set of rules regarding grammar, spelling and usage of German.\n\nThe (\"Austrian Dictionary\"), abbreviated , is the official dictionary of the German language in the Republic of Austria. It is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (). It is the Austrian counterpart to the German \"Duden\" and contains a number of terms unique to Austrian German or more frequently used or differently pronounced there. A considerable amount of this \"Austrian\" vocabulary is also common in Southern Germany, especially Bavaria, and some of it is used in Switzerland as well. The most recent edition is the 42nd from 2012. Since the 39th edition from 2001 the orthography of the was adjusted to the German spelling reform of 1996. The dictionary is also officially used in the Italian province of South Tyrol.\n\nThis is a selection of cognates in both English and German. Instead of the usual infinitive ending \"-en\" German verbs are indicated by a hyphen \"-\" after their stems. Words that are written with capital letters in German are nouns.\n\nGerman is written in the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut, namely \"ä\", \"ö\" and \"ü\", as well as the eszett or (sharp s): \"ß\". In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, \"ss\" is used instead of \"ß\". Since \"ß\" can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional uppercase form.\n\nWritten texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as umlauts and certain orthographical features – German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s) – and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. The longest German word that has been published is made of 79 characters. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, \"toilet bowl cleaner\".)\n\nBefore the German orthography reform of 1996, \"ß\" replaced \"ss\" after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, \"ß\" replaces \"ss\" only after long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nSince there is no traditional capital form of \"ß\", it was replaced by \"SS\" when capitalization was required. For example, (tape measure) became in capitals. An exception was the use of ß in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case \"ß\" was maintained (so, \" instead of \"). Capital ß (ẞ) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate.\n\nUmlaut vowels (ä, ö, ü) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner ß can be transcribed as ss. Some operating systems use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in Microsoft Windows this is done using Alt codes. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. \"Raesfeld\" , \"Coesfeld\" and \"Itzehoe\" , but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than proper nouns.)\n\nThere is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a telephone book occurs after but before (because Ä is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary comes after , but in some dictionaries and all other words starting with \"Ä\" may occur after all words starting with \"A\". In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial \"Sch\" and \"St\" are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after \"S\", but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.\n\nWritten German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma (quotation mark) as in .\n\nUntil the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in blackletter typefaces (mostly in Fraktur, but also in Schwabacher) and written in corresponding handwriting (for example Kurrent and Sütterlin). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans-serif Antiqua typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for Germanic languages. (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The Nazis initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered Aryan, but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish. It is also believed that the Nazi régime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during World War II.\n\nThe Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.\n\nA proper use of the long s, (), ſ, is essential for writing German text in Fraktur typefaces. Many Antiqua typefaces include the long s also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case \"s\" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words (guard-house) and (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which \"s\" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ( vs. ). The long s only appears in lower case.\n\nThe orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states () of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule – everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old comma rules were again put in force.\n\nThe most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter \"ß\", called (\"Sharp S\") or (pronounced \"ess-tsett\"). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:\n\n\nThus , , and . Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus , , and . The word 'foot' has the letter \"ß\" because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an 'ß' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words and .\n\nIn German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either \"short\" or \"long\", as follows:\n\nShort is realized as in stressed syllables (including secondary stress), but as in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short can be spelled either with \"e\" or with \"ä\" (for instance, \"would have\" and \"chain\" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open sound of long \"Ä\"; in some varieties of standard German, and have merged into , removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like 'bears/berries' or 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: Captain Bluebear).\n\nIn many varieties of standard German, an unstressed is not pronounced , but vocalised to .\n\nWhether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:\nBoth of these rules have exceptions (e.g. \"has\" is short despite the first rule; , \"moon\" is long despite the second rule). For an \"i\" that is neither in the combination \"ie\" (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany (Hessen), the \"o\" in the proper name \"Hoffmann\" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the \"e\" in the geographical name \"Mecklenburg\" for people in that region. The word \"cities\", is pronounced with a short vowel by some (Jan Hofer, ARD Television) and with a long vowel by others (Marietta Slomka, ZDF Television). Finally, a vowel followed by \"ch\" can be short ( \"compartment\", \"kitchen\") or long ( \"search\", \"books\") almost at random. Thus, is homographous between \"puddle\" and \"manner of laughing\" (colloquial) or \"laugh!\" (imperative).\n\nGerman vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, äu, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:\n\nAdditionally, the digraph \"ie\" generally represents the phoneme , which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised is not a phonemic diphthong: \"bear\", \"he\", \"we\", \"gate\", \"short\", \"words\".\n\nIn most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a glottal stop .\n\nWith approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual affricate . The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below.\n\n\n\nGerman does not have any dental fricatives (as English th). The th sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries. It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English th with d in German: \"Thank\" → in German , \"this\" and \"that\" → and , \"thou\" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) → , \"think\" → , \"thirsty\" → and many other examples.\n\nLikewise, the gh in Germanic English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an f, or not at all), can often be linked to German ch: \"to laugh\" → , \"through\" → , \"high\" → , \"naught\" → , \"light\" → or , \"sight\" → , \"daughter\" → , \"neighbour\" → .\n\nThe German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the Middle Ages, with the most notable authors of the period being Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach.\nThe , whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch.

In Vienna, he joined NSDAP as well as Sturmabteilung (SA) in which he was a lieutenant from 1930.\n\nAs an editor of \"Lebenschutz\" (Protection of Life), he has been repeatedly accused of racism.\n\nThrough Prof. Dr. Günther Schlesinger, an Austrian Nature Protection Referent, Günther Schwab got more involved with nature protection. He studied in those years, as expected of the family, at the commercial academy, but due to his love for nature he soon became a forest ranger.\n\nHis first book \"Abenteuer am Fluss\" (Adventures At The River), published by Franz-Eher-Verlag, the Central publishing house of the Nazi party, was proof of his love. as were all his following books \"Der Wind über den Feldern\" (The wind across the fields), \"Kamerad mit dem haarigen Gesicht\" (A story about a dog), \"Land voller Grande\" (Land of grace), \"Das Glück am Rand\" (Fortune at the edge).\n\nIn 1951, he gave up his profession, moved to Salzburg and dedicated his life to writing. He realised that the new upcoming 1950s affluent society threatened to destroy all that he loved: the countryside with all its inhabitants, the solitude of the wilderness, the wildlife as he knew it up to then. Günther Schwab proved to be almost clairvoyant when, at the age of 50, he held a lecture with the title \"The catastrophe has started already\", at the Audi Max in Vienna in 1954.\n\nTo explain his fears more plainly and understandably for the man in the street, Günther Schwab wrote his book \"Der Tanz mit dem Teufel\" (The dance with the devil). It reads like a subtle, interesting detective story, which he finished in 1958. The theme was mankind's industrial sins causing environmental damage in condemning many Americans as degenerates. The book prophesied that improperly-managed population sizes from other continents would avalanche Europe. This was an effort to renew Social Darwinism and eugenics theories. His hope was to awaken the people to this view. Strangely enough, although that book was on the market, there were some bookshops which denied the existence of this book. The book was translated into other languages; the English version was published in 1963.\n\n\nSchwab was a member of the Nazi party and during his life would serve on the advisory panel of the Society for Biological Anthropology, Eugenics, and Behavior Research.\n\nGünther Schwab reached 100 years of age in 2004 when he received the Cup of Honour of Salzburg and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class.

Ramachandra Guha called him the \"Rabindranath Tagore of Modern India, who has been one of the finest novelists-activists since independence\". He was the third writer to be decorated with the Jnanpith Award for Kannada, the highest literary honor conferred in India. His son Ullas is a conservationist.\n\nShivaram Karanth was born on 10 October 1902, in Kota near Udupi in the Udupi district of Karnataka to a Kannada-speaking family. The fifth child of his parents Shesha Karantha and Lakshmamma, he completed his primary education in Kundapura and Mangalore. Shivaram Karanth was influenced by Gandhi's principles and took part in Indian Independence movement when he was in college. His participation in the Non-cooperation movement did not allow him to complete his college education which he quit in February 1922. He canvassed for khadi and swadeshi in Karnataka led by Indian National Congress leader Karnad Sadashiva Rao, for five years till 1927. By that time Karanth had already started writing fiction novels and plays.\n\nKaranth began writing in 1924 and soon published his first book, \"Rashtrageetha Sudhakara\", a collection of poems. His first novel was \"Vichitrakoota\". Subsequent works like \"Nirbhagya Janma\" (\"Unfortunate Birth\") and \"Sooleya Samsara\" (\"Family of a Prostitute\") mirrored the pathetic conditions of the poor. His magnum opus \"Devaddhootaru\", a satire on contemporary India, was published in 1928.\n\nKaranth was an intellectual and environmentalist who made notable contribution to the art and culture of Karnataka. He is considered one of the most influential novelists in the Kannada language. His novels \"Marali Mannige\", \"Bettada Jeeva\", \"Alida Mele\", \"Mookajjiya Kanasugalu\", \"Mai Managala Suliyalli\", \"Ade OOru Ade Mara\", \"Shaneeshwarana Neralinalli\", \"Kudiyara Koosu\", \"Svapnada Hole\", \"Sarsammana Samadhi\", and \"Chomana Dudi\" are widely read and have received critical acclaim. He wrote two books on Karnataka's ancient stage dance-drama \"Yakshagana\" (1957 and 1975).\n\nHe was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels, but incurred financial losses. He was also a painter and was deeply concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment. At the age of 90, he wrote a book on birds (published during 2002 by Manohara Grantha Mala, Dharwad).\n\nHe wrote, apart from his forty seven novels, thirty one plays, four short story collections, six books of essays and sketches, thirteen books on art, two volumes of poems, nine encyclopedias, and over one hundred articles on various issues.\n\nKaranth married Leela Alva, a student in the school that Karanth would teach dance and direct plays in. The latter belonged to the Bunt community and was the daughter of a businessman, K. D. Alva. They married on 6 May 1936. The couple subsequently attracted ridicule from people in the region over their inter-caste marriage; Karanth belonged to an orthodox Brahmin community. Leela, who had her early education in Marathi language, re-learnt Kannada after marriage and translated the Marathi novel \"Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto\" into Kannada. As a dancer, she participated in Karanth's operas. The Karanths had four children together: sons, Harsha and Ullas, a conservationist; and daughters, Malavika and Kshama. His mother's influence on Karanth was described by Ullas as: \"It was our mother who shaped Karanth's life... She was the backbone of all his endeavours. She was also quite well-read, and she dedicated all of her talents to her husband. She took care of all household responsibilities.\" The family lived in the Puttur town of Dakshina Kannada, a district in the South Karnataka region, before moving to Saligrama, a town from Karanth's birthplace Kota, in 1974. A few years prior to this, their eldest son Harsha died leaving Leela suffer from \"depression and hallucinations\". She died in September 1986. It was also the year that Karanth's final novel was published.\n\nKaranth was admitted to Kasturba Medical College in Manipal on 2 December 1997 to be treated for viral fever. He suffered from a cardiac respiratory arrest two days later and slipped into a coma. On 8 December, his kidneys began to fail and subsequently developed severe acidosis and septicemia, following which he was put on dialysis.

These books written by him helped the cause of their caste to get Kshatriya status officially as Mahyavanshi by Government of India in 1939, in which other social and political leaders after his death in 1924, like Dr. Kanhaiyalal Munshi and Dr. Purshottam Solanki played the leading role.\n\nMakanji spent most of his wealth for the benefit of community and philanthropic works.

This allows layout editors to write notes to the printer on the print flat (the image that is to be photographed and sent to print) which will not show in the final form. It also allows artists to lay down sketch lines without the need to erase after inking.\nMore recently, with digital scanning and image manipulation, non-photo blue fulfills its function in a different way. The artist can do their sketch and inking in the traditional manner and scan the page. Most scanners \"will\" detect the light blue lines. However, shifting to greyscale and increasing the contrast and brightness of the scanned image causes the blue to disappear. Another common approach involves replacing the blue channel with another channel – typically the red channel. The exact processes may differ depending on the scanner, settings and image-editing software, but the concept remains the same.\n\nThe difference between the non-photo blue and black ink is vast enough that digital image manipulation can separate the two easily. If a black-and-white bitmap setting is scanned in, the exposure or threshold number can be set high enough to detect the black ink or dark images being scanned, but low enough to leave out the non-photo blue. On a threshold scale of 0–255, this number would be approximately 140. Only with a considerably high threshold setting will the blue be detected; this however may greatly distort black lines and add a lot of noise and black speckles, making the image potentially almost unrecognizable. Scanning in black-and-white makes it possible for the non-photo blue still to serve its original purpose, as notes and rough sketching lines can be placed throughout the image being scanned and remain undetected by the scan head.\n\n"}

{"id": "2938955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2938955", "title": "Pragma-dialectics", "text": "Pragma-dialectics\n\nPragma-dialectics, or pragma-dialectical theory, developed by Frans H. van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (see 1984; 1992; 2004) at the University of Amsterdam, is an argumentation theory that is used to analyze and evaluate argumentation in actual practice. Unlike strictly logical approaches (which focus on the study of argument as product), or purely communication approaches (which emphasize argument as a process), pragma-dialectics was developed to study the entirety of an argumentation as a discourse activity. Thus, the pragma-dialectical theory views argumentation as a complex speech act that occurs as part of natural language activities and has specific communicative goals.\n\nIn pragma-dialectics, argumentation is viewed as a communicative and interactional discourse phenomenon that is to be studied from a normative as well as a descriptive perspective. The dialectical dimension is inspired by normative insights from “critical rationalism” and formal dialectics, the pragmatic dimension by descriptive insights from speech act theory, Gricean language philosophy and discourse analysis.\n\nTo allow for the systematic integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions in the study of argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization is achieved by treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization is achieved by extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization is achieved by capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification is achieved by regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).\n\nBased on the meta-theoretical principles described above, the pragma-dialectical theory regards argumentation as ideally being part of a critical discussion (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1984, p. 17). The ideal model of a critical discussion treats argumentative discourse as a discussion in which argumentation is directed at the reasonable resolution of a difference of opinion. The ideal model can serve as a heuristic as well as a critical tool: it respectively constitutes an instrument for the argumentation analyst when deciding about the communicative functions of speech acts and provides a standard for argument evaluation (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1992, p.36).\n\nIn this ideal model of a critical discussion, four discussion stages are distinguished that the discussion parties have to go through to resolve their difference of opinion: the confrontation stage, opening stage, argumentation stage and concluding stage (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1984, pp.85-88; 1992, pp.34-35; 2004, pp.59-62). In the confrontation stage, the interlocutors establish that they have a difference of opinion. In the opening stage, they decide to resolve this difference of opinion. The interlocutors determine their points of departure: they agree upon the rules of the discussion and establish which propositions they can use in their argumentation. In the argumentation stage, the protagonist defends his/her standpoint by putting forward arguments to counter the antagonist’s objections or doubt. In the concluding stage, the discussion parties evaluate to what extent their initial difference of opinion has been resolved and in whose favor. The model also defines the nature and distribution of the speech acts that play a constructive part in the various stages of the resolution process.\n\nThe ideal model stipulates ten rules that apply to an argumentative discussion. Violations of the discussion rules are said to frustrate the reasonable resolution of the difference of opinion and they are therefore considered as fallacies.\n\nThe ten rules (see Van Eemeren, Grootendorst & Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, pp.182-183):\n\nRecently, the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation has incorporated insights from rhetoric into the analysis of argumentative discussion (Van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2002; 2006). Parties involved in a difference of opinion “maneuver strategically” to simultaneously realize their dialectical and their rhetorical aims. In other words, the parties in an argumentative discussion attempt to be persuasive (have their standpoint accepted) while observing the critical standards for argumentative discourse. In each of the critical discussion stages there is a rhetorical goal that corresponds with the dialectical goal and interlocutors can make use of three analytical aspects to balance effectiveness and reasonableness: making an opportune selection from the topical potential available at the stage concerned, approaching the audience effectively, and carefully exploiting presentational means. These three aspects correspond with some focal points of rhetorical study – topics, audience adaptation and presentational devices – so that insights acquired in rhetoric are brought to bear in explaining how rhetorical and dialectical considerations play a part in the various ways of strategic maneuvering.\n\nFrom a pragma-dialectical perspective, in order to get an overview of those aspects in argumentative discourse that are crucial for resolving a difference of opinion, the following analytical operations are carried out:\n\nAn analytical overview shows the differences of opinion, the distribution of dialectical roles, the expressed and unexpressed premises that make up the argument, and the argumentation structure (the relationship between a series of arguments presented to defend a standpoint) (see Snoeck Henkemans, 1992). The analytical overview can have critical or heuristic functions.\n\nStarting from the analytical overview, the evaluation of the quality of the argumentative discourse can be performed. In evaluating the arguments that are put forward in the argumentative discourse, the analyst should (1) check whether the discourse is free from logical and pragmatic inconsistencies, (2) determine whether the propositions put forward are acceptable, (3) evaluate whether the argumentation (can be made) logically valid, (4) check whether the argumentation schemes are appropriately applied, and (5) check for other fallacies.\n\nThe concept of the analytical overview can also be used in argument production. Since the analytical overview brings together concisely all the information necessary for evaluating an argumentative discussion, it can be used to check whether the argumentation can stand up to criticism. If weaknesses are found, the argumentation can be adjusted or expanded thus it makes a useful guide for the creation of written or oral argumentation.\n\nThe pragma-dialectical theory has been applied to understand several different types of argumentative discourse. For example, it has been used to analyze and evaluate legal argumentation, mediation, negotiation, (parliamentary) debate, interpersonal argumentation, political argumentation, health communication and visual argumentation (see, e.g., Van Eemeren (Ed.), 2002).\n\n\n"}

Of particular importance is the prediction of hazardous eruptions that could lead to catastrophic loss of life, property, and disruption of human activities.\n\n\nPatterns of seismicity are complex and often difficult to interpret; however, increasing seismic activity is a good indicator of increasing eruption risk, especially if long-period events become dominant and episodes of harmonic tremor appear.\n\nUsing a similar method, researchers can detect volcanic eruptions by monitoring infra-sound—sub-audible sound below 20 Hz. The IMS Global Infrasound Network, originally set up to verify compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, has 60 stations around the world that work to detect and locate erupting volcanoes.\n\nA relation between long-period events and imminent volcanic eruptions was first observed in the seismic records of the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia. The occurrence of long-period events were then used to predict the 1989 eruption of Mount Redoubt in Alaska and the 1993 eruption of Galeras in Colombia. In December 2000, scientists at the National Center for Prevention of Disasters in Mexico City predicted an eruption within two days at Popocatépetl, on the outskirts of Mexico City. Their prediction used research that had been done by Bernard Chouet, a Swiss volcanologist who was working at the United States Geological Survey and who first observed a relation between long-period events and an imminent eruption. The government evacuated tens of thousands of people; 48 hours later, the volcano erupted as predicted. It was Popocatépetl's largest eruption for a thousand years, yet no one was hurt.\n\nSimilarities between iceberg tremors, which occur when they run aground, and volcanic tremors may help experts develop a better method for predicting volcanic eruptions. Although icebergs have much simpler structures than volcanoes, they are physically easier to work with. The similarities between volcanic and iceberg tremors include long durations and amplitudes, as well as common shifts in frequencies.\n\nAs magma nears the surface and its pressure decreases, gases escape. This process is much like what happens when you open a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide is one of the main components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO/SO ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.\n\nSwelling of a volcano signals that magma has accumulated near the surface. Scientists monitoring an active volcano will often measure the tilt of the slope and track changes in the rate of swelling. An increased rate of swelling, especially if accompanied by an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions and harmonic tremors is a high probability sign of an impending event. The deformation of Mount St. Helens prior to the May 18, 1980 eruption was a classic example of deformation, as the north side of the volcano was bulging upwards as magma was building up underneath. Most cases of ground deformation are usually detectable only by sophisticated equipment used by scientists, but they can still predict future eruptions this way.\nThe Hawaiian Volcanoes show significant ground deformation; there is inflation of the ground prior to an eruption and then an obvious deflation post-eruption. This is due to the shallow magma chamber of the Hawaiian Volcanoes; movement of the magma is easily noticed on the ground above.\n\nBoth magma movement, changes in gas release and hydrothermal activity can lead to thermal emissivity changes at the volcano's surface. These can be measured using several techniques: \n\nThere are 4 main methods that can be used to predict a volcanic eruption through the use of hydrology:\n\n\nRemote sensing is the detection by a satellite’s sensors of electromagnetic energy that is absorbed, reflected, radiated or scattered from the surface of a volcano or from its erupted material in an eruption cloud.\n\nMonitoring mass movements and -failures uses techniques lending from seismology (geophones), deformation, and meteorology. Landslides, rock falls, pyroclastic flows, and mud flows (lahars) are example of mass failures of volcanic material before, during, and after eruptions.\n\nThe most famous volcanic \"landslide\" was probably the failure of a bulge that built up from intruding magma before the Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980, this landslide \"uncorked\" the shallow magmatic intrusion causing catastrophic failure and an unexpected lateral eruption blast. \n\"Rock falls\" often occur during periods of increased deformation and can be a sign of increased activity in absence of instrumental monitoring. \n\"Mud flows\" (\"lahars\") are remobilized hydrated ash deposits from pyroclastic flows and ash fall deposits, moving downslope even at very shallow angles at high speed. Because of their high density they are capable of moving large objects such as loaded logging trucks, houses, bridges, and boulders. Their deposits usually form a second ring of debris fans around volcanic edifices, the inner fan being primary ash deposits. Downstream of the deposition of their finest load, lahars can still pose a sheet flood hazard from the residual water. Lahar deposits can take many months to dry out, until they can be walked on. The hazards derived from lahar activity can exist several years after a large explosive eruption.\n\nA team of US scientists developed a method of predicting lahars. Their method was developed by analyzing rocks on Mt. Rainier in Washington. The warning system depends on noting the differences between fresh rocks and older ones. Fresh rocks are poor conductors of electricity and become hydrothermically altered by water and heat. Therefore, if they know the age of the rocks, and therefore the strength of them, they can predict the pathways of a lahar. A system of Acoustic Flow Monitors (AFM) has also been emplaced on Mount Rainier to analyze ground tremors that could result in a \"lahar\", providing an earlier warning.\n\nThe eruption of Mt. Nyiragongo on January 17, 2002 was predicted a week earlier by a local expert who had been studying the volcanoes for years. He informed the local authorities and a UN survey team was dispatched to the area; however, it was declared safe. Unfortunately, when the volcano erupted, 40% of the city of Goma was destroyed along with many people's livelihoods. The expert claimed that he had noticed small changes in the local relief and had monitored the eruption of a much smaller volcano two years earlier. Since he knew that these two volcanoes were connected by a small fissure, he knew that Mt. Nyiragongo would erupt soon.\n\nBritish geologists have developed a method of predicting future eruptions of Mt. Etna. They have discovered that there is a time lag of 25 years between events. Monitoring of deep crust events can help predict accurately what will happen in the years to come. So far they have predicted that between 2007 and 2015, volcanic activity will be half of what it was in 1972.\n\nSakurajima is possibly one of the most monitored areas on earth. The Sakurajima Volcano lies near Kagoshima City, which has a population of over 500,000 people. Both the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) and Kyoto University's Sakurajima Volcanological Observatory (SVO) monitors the volcano's activity. Since 1995, Sakurajima has only erupted from its summit with no release of lava.\n\nMonitoring techniques at Sakurajima:\n\n\nThe Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in Quito houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists whose responsibility is to monitor Ecuadors numerous active volcanoes in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador and in the Galápagos Islands. Ecuador is located in the Ring of Fire where about 90% of the world's earthquakes and 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur. The geologists study the eruptive activity for the volcanoes in the country, especially Tungurahua whose volcanic activity restarted on 19 August 1999, and several major eruptions since that period, the last starting on 1 February 2014.\n\nGoing beyond predicting volcanic activity, there are highly speculative proposals to prevent explosive volcanic activity by cooling the magma chambers using geothermal power generation techniques.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28020646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28020646", "title": "Regularization (linguistics)", "text": "Regularization (linguistics)\n\nRegularization is a linguistic phenomenon observed in language acquisition, language development, and language change typified by the replacement of irregular forms in morphology or syntax by regular ones. Examples are \"gooses\" instead of \"geese\" in child speech and replacement of the Middle English plural form for \"cow\", \"kine\", with \"cows\". Regularization is a common process in natural languages; regularized forms can replace loanword forms (such as with \"cows\" and \"kine\") or coexist with them (such as with \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" or \"hepatitides\" and \"hepatitises\").\n\nErroneous regularization is also called \"overregularization\". In overregularization the regular ways of modifying or connecting words are mistakenly applied to words that require irregular modifications or connections. It is a normal effect observed in the language of beginner and intermediate language-learners, whether native-speaker children or foreign-speaker adults. Because most natural languages have some irregular forms, moving beyond overregularization is a part of mastering them. Usually learners' brains move beyond overregularization naturally, as a consequence of being immersed in the language.\n\nThe same person may sometimes overregularize and sometimes say the correct form. Native-speaker adults can overregularize, but this does not happen often.\n\nIn these models, two mechanisms are at work. For example, the rule in English for forming a past-tense form is to add \"-ed\". In cases where the recall from memory instantly retrieves the form, the brain does not need to execute the rule, and skips execution. In cases where retrieval doesn't happen fast enough, the rule is executed. The more practice the speaker gets with the language, the more reliable is the retrieval.\n\nThese models can explain why the same person may sometimes overregularize and sometimes say the correct form. A child that already knows the word \"bought\" may occasionally say \"buyed\" when retrieval fails to work well. The next time, retrieval works well, and she says \"bought\" correctly.\n\nThese models also explain why native-speaker adults rarely overregularize. They are so thoroughly practiced in the language that retrieval rarely fails.\n\nPhonetic overcompensation, one form of hypercorrection, can be compared and contrasted with overregularization.\n\nIn both cases, a learner must master the automatic overriding of a rule to the point that it happens unconsciously and instantly—one case being phonetic, the other being morphologic. (The neurologic mechanisms of how that happens are still being investigated. Perhaps the brain needs practice in sidestepping the rule entirely as the needed objects [e.g., phonetic strings or past-tense inflected verb forms] are called directly instead of being derived on-the-fly via the rule.)\n\nNative-speaker children do not make phonetic overcompensation errors in the same manner or degree that foreign-speaker adults do, because they do not carry the baggage of an earlier language's differences. But it does not seem correct to say that overcompensation cannot happen at all to a monolingual speaker, because some minor tongue-twisting and some minor Freudian slips could possibly involve neurologic processes that are analogous to phonetic overcompensation.\n\n"}

These include single-family housing, multi-family residential, or mobile homes. Zoning for residential use may permit some services or work opportunities or may totally exclude business and industry. It may permit high density land use or only permit low density uses. Residential zoning usually includes a smaller FAR (floor area ratio) than business, commercial or industrial/manufacturing zoning. The area may be large or small.\n\nIn certain residential areas, largely rural, large tracts of land may have no services whatever, thus residents seeking services must use a motor vehicle or other transport, so the need for transport has resulted in land development following existing or planned transport infrastructure such as rail and road. Development patterns may be regulated by restrictive covenants contained in the deeds to the properties in the development, and may also result from or be reinforced by zoning. Restrictive covenants are not easily changed when the agreement of all property owners (many of whom may not live in the area) is required. The area so restricted may be large or small.\n\nResidential areas may be subcategorized in the concentric zone model and other schemes of urban geography.\n\nResidential development is real estate development for residential purposes. Some such developments are called a subdivision, when the land is divided into lots with houses constructed on each lot. Such developments became common during the late nineteenth century, particularly in the form of streetcar suburbs.\n\nIn previous centuries, residential development was mainly of two kinds. Rich people bought a townlot, hired an architect and/or contractor, and built a bespoke / customized house or mansion for their family. Poor urban people lived in shantytowns or in tenements built for rental. Single-family houses were seldom built on speculation, that is for future sale to residents not yet identified. When cities and the middle class expanded greatly and mortgage loans became commonplace, a method that had been rare became commonplace to serve the expanding demand for home ownership.\n\nPost–World War II economic expansion in major cities of the United States, especially New York City and Los Angeles produced a demand for thousands of new homes, which was largely met by speculative building. Its large-scale practitioners disliked the term \"property speculator\" and coined the new name \"residential development\" for their activity. Entire farms and ranches were subdivided and developed, often with one individual or company controlling all aspects of entitlement (permits), land development (streets and grading), infrastructure (utilities and sewage disposal), and housing. Communities like Levittown, Long Island or Lakewood south of Los Angeles saw new homes sold at unprecedented rates—more than one a day. Many techniques which had made the automobile affordable made housing affordable: standardization of design and small, repetitive assembly tasks, advertising, and a smooth flow of capital. Mass production resulted in a similar uniformity of product, and a more comfortable lifestyle than cramped apartments in the cities. With the advent of government-backed mortgages, it could actually be cheaper to own a house in a new residential development than to rent.\nAs with other products, continual refinements appeared. Curving streets, greenbelt parks, neighborhood pools, and community entry monumentation appeared. Diverse floor plans with differing room counts, and multiple elevations (different exterior \"looks\" for the same plan) appeared. Developers remained competitive with each other on everything, including location, community amenities, kitchen appliance packages, and price.\n\nToday, a typical residential development in the United States might include traffic calming features, such as a slowly winding street, dead-end road, or looped road lined with homes.\n\nSuburban developments help form the stereotypical image of a \"suburban America,\" and are generally associated with the American middle-class. Most offer homes in a narrow range of age, price, size and features, thus potential residents having different needs, wishes or resources must look elsewhere. Some residential developments are gated communities.\n\nCriticisms of residential developments may include:\n\n\n"}

He is part of the generation of Indian authors who mark the transition of India into an independent nation, scarred by the tragedies of partition.\n\nSekhon was born in Lyallpur, Punjab (present-day Pakistan), and grew up in his father's village in Dakha,near Ludhiana.\nHis father was an idealist but introverted while his mother was more practical and religious, practicing Sikh \"Singh Sabha\". There was considerable marital discord in the family which colours many of his stories. Sekhon eventually graduated with master's degrees in Economics and also in English. In the 1930s, he started writing in English, and after some initial publications including some in shared publications with W.H. Auden and Stephen Spender.\nBut given the greater audience in Punjabi, he shifted to Punjabi, and initially made a mark as a playwright.\nAlong with many South-Asian littérateurs of his generation (Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Buddhadev Bose), he taught English but wrote in an Indian language.\n\nHis first collection of one-act plays, \"Chhe Ghar\" (Six homes, 1941) was a critical success, particularly the play \"Bhavi\", which unfolds a tragic cross-relationship between a king and his son with a daughter-mother.\n\nLike his contemporary Mulk Raj Anand, Sekhon was influenced by the Progressive Writers' Movement. He was a strong believer in Marxism, and also joined the Communist party of India, though he let his membership lapse. He contested elections four times, thrice for the Punjab legislature and once for Parliament, but never won.\n\nMuch of his writing has a strong social activism message, but the questions and dilemmas facing the characters are subtly philosophical, and his plays did not see much success on stage. Subsequently, he also wrote a good bit of poetry, and also several full-length plays, mostly featuring modern themes, particularly man-woman relationships. The historical play \"Waris\" is both a love-story with the poet Waris Shah, set against the rise of Sikh power. The more contemporary \"Mittarpiara\" (beloved friend), develops on the notion of a group of Sikhs and other Indians developing a friendship with Lenin to liberate India from the British.

Many who had previously supported Volapük switched to the Esperanto camp, while others tried their best to improve or reform Volapük itself. Partially due to the inflexible attitude of Johann Martin Schleyer, the creator of Volapük, himself, this led to several schisms in the Volapük movement.

The spoken varieties in Sri Lanka although different from those of Tamil Nadu share some common features between the southern dialects of Tamil Nadu and the northern Sri Lankan Tamil dialect, the language of Jaffna. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are less influenced by Sanskrit and the western languages, although there are western and Sanskrit loan words in day to day usage. In general Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are considered to be more conservative than the continental Tamil dialects.\n\nThe Negombo Tamil dialect used in Negombo area by bilingual fishers who otherwise identify them as Sinhalese has undergone considerable morphosyntactic convergence with spoken or colloquial Sinhala, as a consequence of contact with it. It has also developed a number of other grammatical traits under the probable influence of Sinhala, including a postposed indefinite article, an indefinitizing postclitic –sari (apparently modeled on Sinhala –hari), and case assignments for defective verbs that follow the Sinhala, rather than Tamil, patterns of agreement.\n\nBatticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Moors, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the eastern province. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee district has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect. According to Kamil Zvelebil a linguist, the Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary like of all spoken dialects of Tamil, and it has preserved several very antique features, and has remained more true to the literary norm than any other form of Tamil while developing a few striking innovations. Although Batticaloa Tamil has some very specific features of vocabulary, it is classified with other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects as it is related to them by characteristic traits of its phonology. It also maintains some words that are unique to present day .\n\nThe dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and most archaic of Tamil dialects in Sri Lanka and India. It is also very refined and considered to preserve many antique features of Old Tamil that predate Tolkāppiyam, the grammatical treatise of Tamil. The Jaffna Tamil dialect retained many forms of words which were used in Sangam literature such as Tirukkuṛaḷ and Kuṟuntokai. Also a large portion of settlers in Jaffna who came from South India in the past centuries were Vellalar (Mudaliar and Pillai) and this would have helped retain pure Tamil words and linguistics since Vellalars speak a classic dialect of Tamil. Jaffna Tamil dialect is not mutually intelligible with Indian Tamil dialects, though both share a diglossic `H' variety in literary Tamil. It is frequently mistaken for Malayalam by native Indian Tamil speakers. There are a number of Prakrit loans words that are unique to the Jaffna Tamil. A subdialect retained by the Paraiyar people of Kayts still retains a number of archaic words and Prakrit loans not found in any other dialects of Tamil. These drummers had historically played an important role as ritual players of drums at funerals and folk temples and as heralds and traditional weavers. They also maintained the family records of their feudal lords and even practiced medicine and astrology in folk traditions \n\n\n\n"}

The Idea draws inspiration and shares similarities with views of 19th century intellectualists and psychic researchers, such as Charles Babbage, Eleonor Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney. Contemporarily, the concept was popularized by 1972 Christmas ghost story called \"The Stone Tape\", produced by the BBC. Following the movie's popularity, the idea and the term \"stone tape\" were retrospectively and inaccurately attributed to the British archaeologist turned parapsychologist T. C. Lethbridge, who believed that ghosts were not spirits of the deceased, but were simply non-interactive recordings similar to a movie.\n\nThe idea that environmental elements are capable of storing traces of human thoughts or emotions was introduced by multiple 19th century scholars and philosophers as an attempt to provide natural explanations for supernatural phenomena. In 1837 the polymath Charles Babbage published a work on natural theology called the \"Ninth Bridgewater Treatise\". Babbage speculated that spoken words leave permanent impressions in the air, even though they become inaudible after time. He suggested that it is possible due to transfer of motion between particles.\n\nThe \"Stone tape theory\" could also be derived from the concept of \"place memory\". In the early days of the Society for Psychical Research place memory was considered an explanation for ghostly apparitions, seemingly connected with certain places. In the late 19th century, two of the SPR involved investigators, Edmund Gurney and Eleonor Sidgwick, presented views about certain buildings or materials being capable of storing records of past events, which can be later played back by gifted individuals.\n\nAnother 19th century idea associated with the \"Stone Tape Theory\" is psychometry - a belief, that it is possible to obtain knowledge about history associated with an object through physical contact with it.\n\nIn the 20th century, the idea that objects are able to store and play back past events was re-introduced in 1939 and 1940 by then-SPR president H. H. Price. Price speculated about \"psychic ether\" as an intermediate medium between spiritual and physical reality, which can enable objects to carry memory traces of emotions or experiences from the past. In his works, he stated that the existence of such traces should be proveable by means of scientific methods and that they yet remain unproved hypotheses.\n\nFollowing Price' ideas, an archeologist turned paranormal researcher, T. C. Lethbridge, claimed that past events can be stored in objects thanks to fields of energy, that he believed to surround streams, forests or mountains. His 1961 book \"Ghost and Ghoul\" popularized these ideas which allegedly could have inspired the creators of the 1972 BBC movie \"The Stone Tape\".\n\nIn their book \"How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age\", authors Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn dismissed the idea as an irrational claim, stating, \"The problem is that we know of no mechanism that could record such information in a stone or play it back. Chunks of stone just do not have the same properties as reels of tape.\"\nSharon Hill, science educator and geologist, claims that \"stone tape theory\" is a misleading term, as it suggests to encompass structure, credibility and explanatory power or scientific theory, while in reality it is speculation that lacks physical basis. According to her, it is an attempt to present a pseudoscientific claim in a seemingly scientific style.\nHill also suspects that the \"kernel of the idea of stone tape\" is psychometry , which is criticized for being a form of cold reading rather than an unexplained supernatural phenomenon.\n\n"}
{"id": "484242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=484242", "title": "Swisscom", "text": "Swisscom\n\nSwisscom AG is a major telecommunications provider in Switzerland. Its headquarters are located in Worblaufen near Bern. The Swiss Confederation owns 51.0 percent of Swisscom AG. According to its own published data, Swisscom holds a market share of 60% for mobile, 67% for broadband and 33% for TV telecommunication in Switzerland. Its Italian subsidiary Fastweb is attributed 16% of private clients and 29% of corporate clients share of Italian broadband and is also active in the mobile market.\n\nThe Swiss telegraph network was first set up in 1852, followed by telephones in 1877. The two networks were combined with the postal service in 1920 to form the PTT (Postal Telegraph and Telephone). It struggled to develop a homegrown digital network, with the first digital exchange launched in 1986, but pioneered the NATEL A mobile service in 1978 and the GSM-based NATEL D offering a digital service in 1993. The Swiss telecommunications market was deregulated in 1997. Telecom PTT was spun off and rebranded Swisscom ahead of a partial privatisation in 1997, which has left the Swiss government with a 51% stake. Besides pioneering the first mobile telephone network NATEL A, the present-day Swisscom owns the protected brand NATEL, which is used and known only in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2001, 25% of Swisscom Mobile was sold to Vodafone. Since then, Swisscom has bought a majority stake in Italy's second-biggest telecom company Fastweb and invested in areas such as hospitality support, cloud services, mobile solutions and billing.\n\nSwitzerland's entry into the telecommunications era came in 1851, with the passage of legislation giving the Swiss government control over the development of a telegraph network throughout the country. The government's initial plans called for the creation of three primary telegraph lines, as well as a number of secondary networks. In order to build equipment for the system, the government established the Atelier Fédéral de Construction des Télégraphes (Federal Workshop for the Construction of Telegraphs).\n\nIn July 1852, the first leg of the country's telegraph system—between St. Gallen and Zurich—was operational. By the end of that year, most of the country's main cities had been connected to the telegraph system. In 1855, the network was extended with the first underwater cable, connecting Winkel-Stansstad and Bauen-Flüelen. Night service was also launched that year, starting in Basel, St. Gallen and Bellinzona.\n\nTelegraph traffic took off in the late 1860s after the government had reduced the cost of 20-word messages in 1867. While telegraph traffic continued to rise in the following decade, the technology was soon to be replaced by the telephone.\n\nSwitzerland's entry into the telephone age came in 1877, when the first experimental phone lines appeared, starting with a line linking the post office building with the Federal Palace and then with a link, using the existing telegraph line, between Bern and Thun. The following year, the government passed legislation establishing a monopoly on the country's telephone network. Nonetheless, private operators were allowed to bid for licenses in order to develop their local concessions. By 1880, Switzerland's first private network had been created in Zurich. This was a central system with the capacity for 200 lines. The first directory was also published that year and listed 140 subscribers.\n\nBasel, Bern, and Geneva all launched their own local networks between 1881 and 1882. One year later, the first intercity telephone line was established, linking Zurich's private exchange with Winterthur's public system. Yet the Zurich company ran into difficulties by the mid-1880s. With its development falling behind the telephone concessions elsewhere in the country, the federal government bought out the private operator, paying just over CHF 300,000 in 1886.\n\nThe national telephone network continued to expand. Telephone numbers were introduced in 1890, replacing the initial system whereby callers had been able to ask for their party by name. The number of Switzerland's telephone subscribers steadily grew, particularly after the inauguration of a new telephone switchboard capable of handling nearly 4,000 lines.\n\nBy 1896, Switzerland's telephone network had been extended to include all of Switzerland's cantons. By 1900, the country had also established its first international connection, between Basel and Stuttgart, Germany. Switzerland began testing its first public phone booths in 1904. Initially restricted to local calls, the public telephones allowed national calling for the first time in 1907.\n\nThe first automatic telephone exchanges were installed by private networks in 1912. By 1917, a semi-automatic exchange had been installed, in Zurich-Hottingen. The following year, in order to extend the country's phone system into rural parts of Switzerland, the government began promoting the establishment of party-line systems.\n\nIn 1920, the Swiss government created the Swiss PTT, combining the country's postal services and telegraph and telephone systems into a single, government-controlled entity. Development of the country's telephone system now came entirely under the purview of the government. In 1921, the PTT launched its own directory inquiries service. The following year, the PTT started the first fully automatic public telephone exchange in Zurich-Hottingen.\n\nThe PTT began telex services in 1934, and by 1936 had linked up the cities of Zurich, Basel, and Bern, which were then linked via Zurich to the international market. In the meantime, the PTT also became responsible for developing the company's radio broadcasting, and, later, television broadcasting services.\n\nSwitzerland's telephone system took off in the years following World War II. By 1948, the country boasted 500,000 telephone subscribers. Over the following decade, that number doubled. In 1957, the PTT added computer capacity in order to handle billing for its fast-growing network. Through this period, the state-owned organisation had continued to invest in automating its telephone network, and in 1959, Switzerland became the first country to feature a fully automated telephone exchange system.\n\nTelstar – the first telecommunications satellite – was launched into space in 1962. At Expo 1964 in Lausanne, the first exchange to permit international direct dialing was unveiled. In 1974, the Leuk satellite earth station went into operation in the canton of Wallis.\n\nAutomation enabled the PTT to introduce pulse-metering for local calls in 1963, priced at 10 centimes per pulse. In 1966, the PTT introduced automated international dialing services, initially from Montreux. International direct dialing was rolled out to the rest of the country over the following decade, achieving full coverage in 1982.\n\nAs the PTT's subscriber base topped two million at the beginning of the 1970s, the country introduced a new, seven-digit phone numbering system. By then, the PTT was also becoming interested in a number of new technologies. In 1970, the PTT led a workgroup, including a number of prominent Swiss telecommunications players, in an effort to create an integrated digital telecommunications network (IFS). Originally intended to be rolled out by the middle of that decade, the first IFS exchange did not become operational until 1986.\n\nOther technologies proved more accessible to the PTT. In 1976, the company launched facsimile transmission services from its customer service centers. Two years later, the PTT established its first mobile telephone network, called NATEL (for Nationales Autotelefonnetz). Although rudimentary—with calls limited to just three minutes, coverage restricted to five minutes, unlinked local networks, and often difficult-to-establish connections—the NATEL network marked one of the earliest and most successful attempts at making telephony mobile.\n\nIn 1980, the PTT enabled facsimile transmission for the home and office market. By then, its subscriber base had risen to nearly three million fixed-line users. In 1983, the PTT launched its next-generation mobile network, NATEL B, which, among other enhancements, reduced the size of mobile telephone equipment to a 25-pound unit that fit in its own carrying case. In 1985, the first fibre-optic cable was laid between Berne and Neuchâtel.\n\nOther new technologies appeared in the mid-1980s, including the Telepac data transmission network, rolled out in 1983, and the first videoconferencing services, launched in 1985. In 1987, the PTT upgraded the NATEL network again. The new NATEL C network provided more extensive coverage, digitally transmitted sound, and smaller telephone sizes. The new network permitted mobile telephony to take off in Switzerland, and by 1992 the country had some 200,000 subscribers on the NATEL network.\n\nIn the 1990s, the PTT faced the loss of its telecommunications monopoly. As a run-up to the coming deregulation of the telecommunications market, the PTT put into place a new corporate strategy, separating its postal and telecommunications operations into two focused units. The telecommunications business became known as Swiss Telecom PTT. New telecommunications legislation was passed in 1992 that stripped away the government's monopoly status, starting with the equipment sector and digital data communications services, although maintaining the company's de facto hold on the local telephone market for most of the remainder of the decade.\n\nAs part of its repositioning, Telecom PTT invested more heavily in the mobile telephony business, launching the new GSM-based NATEL D network in 1992. That network, which also provided customers with compatibility throughout most of Europe, marked the start of a new era for the telephone market as callers adopted the new technology. By then end of the 1990s, nearly two million customers had connected to the NATEL D network.\n\nAs one of the smallest European telecommunications companies, Telecom PTT's aspirations to achieve international growth took a cumbersome path. At the very beginning, the company formed a Unisource partnership with the Netherlands' KPN and Sweden's Telia. Although the Unisource partnership attempted to enter a number of markets around the world, including Malaysia and India, it finally collapsed after several years of losses.\n\nTelecom PTT's subsequent entry into the Internet proved to be more successful, as the company set up the service provider Blue Window (later Bluewin), which became the country's leading Internet service provider (ISP). In addition, the company had also introduced digital ISDN subscriber services, increasing its subscriber base from 250,000 in 1996 to more than two million by 2003.\n\nIn 1997, Swiss government passed new legislation fully deregulating the Swiss telecommunications market. As part of that process, Telecom PTT was transformed into a special public limited company, its name was changed to Swisscom on 1 October 1997, its shares were listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, and it conducted a public offering of its shares in 1998. However, Swiss government remained a major shareholder of the company.\n\nIn 1998, for the first time in its home market, Swisscom faced competition. Diax (which later changed its name to Sunrise) entered the Swiss mobile telephone market as a new player. Two years later, in 2000, the situation in this market segment was further intensified by the arrival of France Telecom-dominated Orange. Nonetheless, Swisscom held onto its leading position among mobile users.\n\nSimultaneously to the developments in the domestic market, Swisscom also implemented its expansion strategy regarding international markets. In 1999, the company acquired Germany's publicly listed Debitel, then the third-largest mobile services provider on the German market, which also operated in France, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Denmark. Debitel quickly became the leading network-independent provider for mobile services in Europe. At that time, Debitel's customers base exceeded ten million subscribers. Swisscom rapidly built up its holding in Debitel to 93% in 2003.\n\nIn advance of planned public offerings of both Bluewin and Swisscom Mobile, Swisscom restructured its own operations. The company formed six primary business units, and in 2001, it sold a 25% stake in Swisscom Mobile to England's Vodafone. At that time, Vodafone was a major investor in so-called 3G (third-generation) mobile telephone technology.\n\nIn 2000, Swisscom won a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) license. While others, including Vodafone, paid billions for their UMTS licenses, Swisscom paid just CHF 50 million, which softened the blow on the company when the bottom dropped out of the UMTS market soon after.\nIn the early 2000s, Swisscom also began rolling out new DSL (digital subscriber line) broadband technology. Its customer base revealed a rapid grow, increasing to 200,000 subscribers by the beginning of 2003. Compared to its European competitors whose profit forecasts were hindered by significant indebtedness, the company accumulated between CHF 5 billion and CHF 10 billion for possible acquisitions.\n\nThese funds enabled the company to target the growing wireless \"hotspot\" market—that is, areas providing wireless network access. In May 2003, its newly formed subsidiary, Swisscom Eurospot, merged with the Netherlands' Aervik, which operated some ten hotspots and had access to another 45 sites. By the end of that month, Swisscom advanced its position on the European WiFi market segment by acquiring England's Megabeam and Germany's WLAN AG. As a result, the company controlled 206 hotspots in Germany and Switzerland as well as the third-largest hotspot network in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe former state-owned PTT (Post, Telegraph, Telephone, founded 1852) was privatised in several stages from 1988 onwards and became a public limited company with special legal status in October 1998. The Swiss Confederation currently holds 51.0% of the share capital. The Telecommunications Enterprise Act limits outside participation to 49.9% of the share capital.\n\nIn its 5 April 2006 message, the Federal Council proposed to Parliament that Swisscom should be completely privatised and that the Swiss Confederation should sell its shares in stages. On 10 May 2006, the National Council declined to support the proposal. On 20 May 2006, the Advisory Committee of the Council of States advised the Council of States to endorse the proposal – but only so that it could be referred back to the Federal Council for revision.\n\nSwisscom announced its new visual identity on 14 December 2007. The previous sub-brands of Swisscom Fixnet, Swisscom Mobile and Swisscom Solutions ceased to exist on 1 January 2008. As part of the restructuring, Swisscom redesigned its logo and transformed it into a moving picture element, a real innovation for Switzerland and the industry.\n\nIn 2008, Swisscom acquired its five millionth NATEL customer, which means that the two thirds of the Swiss population used the Swisscom mobile network and in 2013 Swisscom TV counted a million customers. On 23 July 2013, the CEO of Swisscom, Carsten Schloter was found dead from an apparent suicide and Urs Schaeppi was appointed interim CEO. Since November 2013, Schaeppi has been the CEO of Swisscom. As of June 2018, Swisscom rank on Forbes \"The World's Largest Public Companies\" list, the Global 2000, was number 561.\n\nIn June 2018, Danish software firm Nordija partnered with Swisscom to develop the new TV-as-a-Service platform, TVaaS 2.0.\n\nSwisscom (Switzerland) Ltd underwent a reorganisation on 1 January 2008. The subsidiary companies Fixnet, Mobile and Solutions were dissolved and were eventually replaced by Residential Customers, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Enterprise Customers, Wholesale as well as the IT, Network & Innovation segments. The IT platforms together with the fixed-network and mobile communications infrastructures of the former Group companies were merged into the “IT, Network & Innovation” Division.\n\nCurrently, Swisscom operations are performed via three operating divisions, Swisscom Switzerland, Fastweb, and other operating segments. Swisscom Switzerland is divided into the following segments: Residential Customers, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Enterprise Customers, Wholesale and IT, Network & Innovation.\n\nSwisscom Network & IT builds, operates and maintains Swisscom's nationwide fixed-line and mobile communications infrastructure in Switzerland. The division is also responsible for the corresponding IT platforms and is in charge of migrating the networks to an integrated IT and IP-based platform (All-IP).\n\nIn the first half of 2007, Swisscom acquired a majority holding in the Italian company Fastweb. During the offer period, which ran from 10 April to 15 May 2007, Swisscom acquired 80.7% of FASTWEB's share capital, which, when added to Swisscom's existing stake, meant that Swisscom owned 82.4% of Fastweb shares by the cut-off date of 22 May. The total transaction amounted to EUR 4.2 billion or CHF 6.9 billion. FASTWEB currently operates the second largest network in Italy.\n\nThe participation portfolio covers the five business fields of \"broadcasting\" through Swisscom Broadcast, \"network construction and maintenance\" through Cablex, \"Building management and business travel (incl. vehicle fleet management)\" through Swisscom Real Estate Ltd, \"Billing and collection\" through Billag, Alphapay and Medipa Abrechnungskasse, and \"Mobile Solutions\" through Minick Holding and Sicap.\n\nOn 26 June 2009, MTN Group and Belgacom, merged their International Carrier Services MTN ICS and Belgacom ICS (BICS). BICS will function as an official international gateway for all international carrier services of Belgacom, Swisscom, and MTN Group. These companies respectively hold 57.6%, 22.4% and 20.0% of the company's shares.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company started testing a network for the Internet of Things, or Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), in the regions of Geneva and Zurich. The pilot project serves as an addition to the existing M2M mobile network solutions, and it has been estimated that by the year 2023 over 3 billion connections will be running via the IoT.\n\nHansueli Loosli, former CEO and Chairman of Coop (Chairman of the Board)\nRoland Abt, former CFO of Georg Fischer\nValérie Berset Bircher, Head of Labor Affairs for the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research\nAlain Carrupt, former Chairman of the Syndicom trade union\nFrank Esser, former CEO of SFR\nBarbara Frei, Chief of Schneider Electric Germany\nCatherine Mühlemann, Partner and Co-founder of Andmann Media\nAnna Mossberg, formerly at Deutsche Telekom and Google (Sweden) \nRenzo Simoni, board representative for the Swiss government, former CEO of Alp Transit Gotthard AG\n\nIn February 2006, Swisscom launched the Web 2.0 website coComment, which allows users to track any discussion online.\n\nSwisscom Hospitality Services (SHS) is a division of Swisscom AG specifically aimed at the hotel industry and offering specialised network and communication solutions.\n\nSHS services are used e.g. by Hyatt, Rezidor, IHG, Marriott, Hilton Worldwide, Accor, Mandarin Oriental, and other large hotel groups across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.\n\nFounded in 2002 as Swisscom Eurospot, the company originally specialised in providing High-Speed Internet Access (HSIA) services to hotel guests in European 4- and 5-star hotels. With the rising complexity of information and communication technology and increasing cost pressures affecting the hotel business, SHS expanded their range of applications including Voice over IP, Hotel TV, High-speed Internet and tablet-based room controls that are offered through a converged hotel network infrastructure.\n\nIn 2012, the company introduced a Managed Network Services offering specifically for its hotel customers.\n\nIn June 2015, Swisscom Hospitality Services became part of a new company, Hoist Group, following its acquisition by the Sweden-based HoistLocatel. Hoist Group develops and supplies systems, products and services to independent hotels and hotel chains, hospitals and public venues in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2013, Swisscom announced its plan to build a cloud service based in Switzerland. In consequence, the service has to comply to the strict privacy laws of Switzerland. Although the data are to be stored within Switzerland's borders, users would have global access. Thus, individuals and businesses are protected from intervention of foreign authorities, and less stringent foreign data privacy laws. Despite the fact that Swisscom's main focus is on Swiss-based clients, especially banking clients, it also targets foreign-based clients who are seeking protection for their data privacy.\n\nFor individuals in Switzerland, Swisscom also offers \"Docsafe\", a cloud storage solution targeting at optimum security for documents. The documents can be uploaded and accessed via web or an app and are free-of-charge with unlimited storage space. Swisscom's cloud service is comparable to the cloud service of Dropbox but without a desktop client.\n\nSwisscom offers a Platform-as-a-Service cloud based on Cloud Foundry known as Swisscom Application Cloud for developers.\n\nSwisscom considers infrastructure to form the basis for its products and services. In the current increasingly competitive global environment, the company's strategy involves adapting to these new conditions by developing business models and by further developing its Natel infinity pricing plans, in order to ensure a sustained source of revenue. Therefore, the company decided to develop its national and international offerings based on a high-speed cloud infrastructure. In addition, for the banking, healthcare and energy sectors, Swisscom opted for developing vertical solutions. Recent examples in these fields include the testing of driver-less cars, exploring the opportunities in the healthcare market, striving to make intelligent power networks, and forming a partnership with Coop in the area of e-commerce.\n\nThe Swisscom StartUp Challenge has been held for five successive years. The program provides ten selected tech startups (five early stage and five late stage) the chance to join a tailor-made week-long business acceleration program in Silicon Valley, where they can further develop their ideas and meet with industry experts, investors and potential customers. From all submissions, ten finalists are selected and invited to pitch before a jury. The jury then gives a feedback and names the five winners. The Challenge is organized in collaboration with VentureLab.\n\nIn 2016, over 200 startups participated in the challenge. The winners were Advanon, Flashwell, Nanolive, Qumram and Xsensio.\n\nComplying with the recommendations of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance 2014 issued by economiesuisse and meeting the requirements of the Ordinance Against Excessive Compensation in Listed Stock Companies, Swisscom opted for practicing effective and transparent corporate governance. At present, Swisscom's corporate responsibility strategy involves fostering long-standing partnerships in the areas of climate and environmental protection, sustainable living and working, social responsibility and media expertise. Swisscom was ranked 20th in the recent list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World.\n\nOn the market segment for mobile telecommunication services, the main competitors for Swisscom are represented by Salt and Sunrise Communications AG. For the 6th consecutive year, \"Connect\" magazine named Swisscom the winner of its yearly network test by comparing telephone and data services of the three largest providers in 2015.\n\nIn the network test, conducted in the germanophone region of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, by Connect magazine, Swisscom secured a second position in the category \"phone network\", with Sunrise being able to closely lead in this category mainly benefiting from Swisscom's slower connection time for telephone calls.\n\nIn the category \"data network\", the success rates for the connection to the internet for all three main networks are close to 100% with Swisscom providing the fastest download and upload data rate, even in less urban areas.\n\nBased on overall results of 2016, \"Connect\" magazine awarded Swisscom the prize of \"Best Network\". However, the gap between Swisscom and the two other companies has shrunk significantly as compared to e.g. 2012. The test also revealed significant improvements in services for all companies involved.\n\nIn a survey conducted by the Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger, some consumers criticized Swisscom's international roaming rates and its subscription rates for mobile phones. The main concern of the consumers in the survey was that they found the rates to be too high.\n\n"}

As of 2000, there are at least 14 translations of the Kural text available in Telugu.\n\nWith the first translation of the Kural text into Telugu made in 1877, Telugu has seen a series of translations before the turn of the 20th century. The first translation was titled \"Trivarga Dipika\" made by Venkatrama Srividyanandaswami of the Kanuparti family, who presented it with elaborate notes. The second translation appeared in 1892 under the title \"Trivargamu\" made by Sakkam Narasimhalu Naidu. It was not a complete translation but only select couplets were translated. In 1906, another translation of selections was made by C. Lakshminarayana Sastry. In 1948, Telugu poet P.

VRAD equipment manufactured by Alcatel-Lucent can be configured to support between 48 and 864 lines per box. The VRAD boxes are composed of circuit boards providing service, fed by fiber-optic cable.\n\nThere are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by AT&T: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises).\n\nFTTN, widely used where copper facilities exist in established neighborhoods, uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7330 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf, which uses the existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an internet protocol DSL access multiplexer that supports VDSL and ADSL protocols.\n\nThe FTTP system uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7340 ISAM shelf, which is mostly used in areas such as new neighborhoods or large-scale developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a Primary Flexibility Point, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. In FTTP systems, the fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the network interface device. In FTTD (fiber to the desk) systems, the fiber can continue to an equipment room or garage, then to a decoder box or residential gateway, then to the customer's TV, computer, and phone lines.\n\nThe VRAD typically connects upstream to an Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet service switch in the central office hub, then to the headend video hub office.\n\nVRADs required for U-verse are around wide, tall, and deep. Size and graffiti risk have drawn complaints from homeowners. AT&T has sued competitor Comcast for Chicago ads against AT&T's \"large and unsightly\" VRADs. Four VRADs have exploded due to faulty lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Avestor (now bankrupt), at least one explosion sending parts \"fifty feet throughout the neighborhood.\" AT&T replaced all 17,000 Avestor batteries used in its VRADs with safer Alcatel-Lucent-designed SAFT NiCad batteries, which have a 10-year life.\n\nBell Canada's Bell Fibe TV and Telus's Optik TV also use VRADs in their networks. Bell Canada uses the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 and Ikanos Communications IKNS ISAMs, and provides Internet service via either FTTN to 50 Mbit/s, or FTTH (fibre to the home) to 700 Mbit/s.\n\nClaro Puerto Rico is currently deploying VRADs to offer their IPTV and VDSL Internet service up to 50Mbit/s. There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by Claro: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises). It is unknown the equipment they are using.\n\n"}

This technology has both commercial and community applications. Voice broadcast users can contact targets (whether they be members, subscribers, constituents, employees, or customers) almost immediately. When used by government authorities, it may be known as an emergency notification system (since such notifications are intended only for use in emergencies).\n\nVoice broadcast systems manage a database of phone lists as well as digitally recorded phone messages. Using telephony components, these computers can simultaneously broadcast thousands of phone messages. Personalized information can be included in the phone messages through the integration of text-to-speech software.\n\nAdvanced systems include telephony boards with answering-machine detection, and the logic to properly play a unique message to answering machines without message truncation.\n\nInteractive voice broadcasting (also referred to as interactive voice messaging) programs allow the call recipient to listen to the recorded message and interact with the system by pressing keys on the phone keypad. The system can detect which key is pressed and be programmed to interact and play various messages accordingly. This is a form of Interactive voice response (IVR).\n\nThe actions that can be programmed may include surveys, information confirmation, contact preference confirmation, or navigation through a phone menu. An example of the use of this technology is automated phone surveys, where professional polling organizations place automatic calls to conduct surveys. Respondents are provided survey questions that are answered using DTMF-tone keypad responses.\n\nMore qualitative results can be captured by allowing call recipients to leave their own voice message instead of just button presses. This function can not only be used for \"grassroots\" lobbying, but can be used to allow loved ones to leave voice messages for each other when separated after a disaster.\n\nVoice broadcasting law is a subset of laws under telemarketing law. One of the most recent of these laws is the 2008 Telemarketing Sales Rule Amendment as issued by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Predictive dialing drop call rates and prerecorded message delivery restrictions were provided in the amendment. \"\n\nVoice broadcasting is a popular method of direct marketing. Industry groups such as insurance, real estate, telemarketing, healthcare, direct sales, etc., have used it to create leads or as a follow-up method to their existing or past customers and/or current prospects. Also, one example of the popularity is its use by nonprofit organizations (NPOs). For example, an NPO can use voice broadcasting to send a simple \"thank you\" message to its donor base. This may be very valuable especially when an organization is manpower constrained and there is a large donor list to call periodically, e.g., quarterly, to thank or to request additional donations.\n\nTwo popular methods to create marketing leads with voice broadcasting are to deliver a prerecorded interactive message and the voicemail message. The prerecorded message is commonly referred to as the \"press one\" method. The dialer or voice broadcasting system calls the consumer, plays a marketing message, and then asks the recipient to press a number on their keypad (e.g., \"1\") to receive more information or to connect with a live agent.\n\nInstead of reaching the consumer, the consumer's answering machine may have answered the call. The dialer may use an answering machine detection (AMD) algorithm and leave a message on the prospect's answering machine. The objective is for the recipient to check and listen to their messages, and then to call back the phone number in the prerecorded message for more information.\n\nBoth of these methods cost much less than making calls with live sales agents. Making a voice broadcast call in the U.S. costs one or two cents. The voice broadcast call does not have a significant labor cost (a $20/hour sales agent consumes $0.33 per minute). Live sales agents are expensive, so telemarketers using live agents will purchase marketing lists that identify good demographic targets. Voice broadcast marketing is cheap enough that marketers may not bother purchasing marketing lists. Voice broadcast marketing only needs live agents for those prospects who express interest in the product by pressing \"1\" or calling back.\n\nConsumers do not like automated cold calls, so many jurisdictions have made marketing voice broadcasts illegal unless the recipient has previously consented to such calls. The U.S. Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in 1991. Recipients of illegal voice broadcast calls under the TCPA may sue the caller for statutory damages of $500 to $1500 per violation. TCPA class actions have been settled for millions of dollars. Even before the TCPA was enacted, state laws prohibited voice broadcast solicitations. California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act prohibited many such calls and allows plaintiffs to recover attorneys' fees.\n\n"}
