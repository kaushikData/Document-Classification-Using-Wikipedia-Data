{"id": "1630179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1630179", "title": "Ancient Macedonian language", "text": "Ancient Macedonian language\n\nAncient Macedonian, the language of the ancient Macedonians, either a dialect of Ancient Greek or a separate Hellenic language, was spoken in the kingdom of Macedonia during the 1st millennium BC and belongs to the Indo-European language family. It gradually fell out of use during the 4th century BC, marginalized by the use of Attic Greek by the Macedonian aristocracy, the Ancient Greek dialect that became the basis of Koine Greek, the \"lingua franca\" of the Hellenistic period.\n\nThe surviving public and private inscriptions found in Macedonia indicate that there was no other written language in ancient Macedonia but Ancient Greek, and recent epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia, such as the Pella curse tablet, suggest that ancient Macedonian might have been a variety of North Western Ancient Greek. Other linguistic evidence suggests that although Ancient Greek was the language of literacy, the vernacular was a separate language, although closely related.\n\nDue to the fragmentary attestation of this language or dialect, various interpretations are possible.\nSuggested phylogenetic classifications of Macedonian include:\n\n\nFrom the few idiomatic words that survive, only a little can be said about special features of the language. A notable sound-law is that the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirates (/bʰ, dʰ, gʰ/) sometimes appear as voiced stops /b, d, g/, (written ), whereas they are generally unvoiced as /pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/ () elsewhere in Greek.\n\nIf ' \"gotán\" ('pig') is related to *\"gou\" ('cattle'), this would indicate that the labiovelars were either intact, or merged with the velars, unlike the usual Greek treatment (Attic ' \"boûs\"). Such deviations, however, are not unknown in Greek dialects; compare Laconian Doric (the dialect of Sparta) ' \"glep-\" for common Greek ' \"blep-\", as well as Doric ' \"gláchōn\" and Ionic ' \"glēchōn\" for common Greek \"blēchōn\".\n\nA number of examples suggest that voiced velar stops were devoiced, especially word-initially: ' \"kánadoi\", 'jaws' (< PIE \"*genu-\"); ' \"kómbous\", 'molars' (< PIE \"*gombh-\"); within words: ' \"arkón\" (Attic ' \"argós\"); the Macedonian toponym \"Akesamenai\", from the Pierian name \"Akesamenos\" (if \"Akesa-\" is cognate to Greek \"agassomai\", \"agamai\", \"to astonish\"; cf. the Thracian name \"Agassamenos\").\n\nIn Aristophanes' \"The Birds\", the form ' \"keblēpyris\" ('red head', the name of a bird, perhaps the goldfinch or redpoll) is found, showing a Macedonian-style voiced stop in place of a standard Greek unvoiced aspirate: ' \"keb(a)lē\" versus \"kephalē\" ('head').\n\nA number of the Macedonian words, particularly in Hesychius' lexicon, are disputed (i.e., some do not consider them actual Macedonian words) and some may have been corrupted in the transmission. Thus \"abroutes\", may be read as abrouwes (), with tau () replacing a digamma. If so, this word would perhaps be encompassable within a Greek dialect; however, others (e.g. A. Meillet) see the dental as authentic and think that this specific word would perhaps belong to an Indo-European language different from Greek.\n\nA. Panayotou summarizes some features generally identified through ancient texts and epigraphy:\n\n\nAncient Macedonian morphology is shared with ancient Epirus, including some of the oldest inscriptions from Dodona. The morphology of the first declension nouns with an -ας ending is also shared with Thessalian (e.g. Epitaph for Pyrrhiadas, Kierion).\n\nM. Hatzopoulos summarizes the Macedonian anthroponymy (that is names borne by people from Macedonia before the expansion beyond the Axios or people undoubtedly hailing from this area after the expansion) as follows:\n\n\nCommon in the creation of ethnics is the use of -έστης, -εστός especially when derived from sigmatic nouns (ὄρος > Ὀρέστης but also Δῖον > Διασταί).\n\nThe toponyms of Macedonia proper are generally Greek, though some of them show a particular phonology and a few others are non-Greek.\n\nThe Macedonian names of about half or more of the months of the ancient Macedonian calendar have a clear and generally accepted Greek etymology (e.g. Dios, Apellaios, Artemisios, Loos, Daisios), though some of the remaining ones have sometimes been considered to be Greek but showing a particular Macedonian phonology (e.g. Audunaios has been connected to \"Haides\" \"*A-wid\" and Gorpiaios/Garpiaios to \"karpos\" fruit).\n\nMacedonian onomastics: the earliest epigraphical documents attesting substantial numbers of Macedonian proper names are the second Athenian alliance decree with Perdiccas II (~417–413 BC), the decree of Kalindoia (~335–300 BC) and seven curse tablets of the 4th century BC bearing mostly names.\n\nAbout 99% of the roughly 6,300 Macedonian-period inscriptions discovered by archaeologists were written in the Greek language, using the Greek alphabet. The Pella curse tablet, a text written in a distinct Doric Greek dialect, found in 1986 and dated to between mid to early 4th century BC, has been forwarded as an argument that the ancient Macedonian language was a dialect of North-Western Greek, part of the Doric dialect group.\n\nA body of idiomatic words has been assembled from ancient sources, mainly from coin inscriptions, and from the 5th century lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria, amounting to about 150 words and 200 proper names, though the number of considered words sometimes differs from scholar to scholar. The majority of these words can be confidently assigned to Greek albeit some words would appear to reflect a dialectal form of Greek. There are, however, a number of words that are not easily identifiable as Greek and reveal, for example, voiced stops where Greek shows voiceless aspirates. Specific words and consonant shifts are, however, present in most dialects of most languages.\n\n\n\n\"A number of Hesychius words are listed orphan; some of them have been proposed as Macedonian\"\n\n\nAmong the references that have been discussed as possibly bearing some witness to the linguistic situation in Macedonia, there is a sentence from a fragmentary dialogue, apparently between an Athenian and a Macedonian, in an extant fragment of the 5th century BC comedy 'Macedonians' by the Athenian poet Strattis (fr. 28), where a stranger is portrayed as speaking in a rural Greek dialect. His language contains expressions such as for \"you Athenians\", being also attested in Homer, Sappho (Lesbian) and Theocritus (Doric), while appears only in \"funny country bumpkin\" contexts of Attic comedy.\n\nAnother text that has been quoted as evidence is a passage from Livy (lived 59 BC-14 AD) in his \"Ab urbe condita\" (31.29). Describing political negotiations between Macedonians and Aetolians in the late 3rd century BC, Livy has a Macedonian ambassador argue that Aetolians, Acarnanians and Macedonians were \"men of the same language\". This has been interpreted as referring to a shared North-West Greek speech (as opposed to Attic Koiné). In another passage, Livy states that an announcement was translated from Latin to Greek for Macedonians to understand.\n\nQuintus Curtius Rufus, Philotas's trial and the statement that the Greek-speaking Branchidae had common language with the Macedonians.\n\nOver time, \"Macedonian\" (μακεδονικός), when referring to language (and related expressions such as \"μακεδονίζειν\"; to speak in the Macedonian fashion) acquired the meaning of Koine Greek.\n\nAs a consequence of the Macedonians' role in the formation of the Koine, Macedonian contributed considerable elements, unsurprisingly including some military terminology (διμοιρίτης, ταξίαρχος, ὑπασπισταί, etc.). Among the many contributions were the general use of the first declension grammar for male and female nouns with an -as ending, attested in the genitive of Macedonian coinage from the early 4th C BC of Amyntas III (ΑΜΥΝΤΑ in the genitive; the Attic form that fell into disuse would be ΑΜΥΝΤΟΥ). There were changes in verb conjugation such as in the Imperative δέξα attested in Macedonian sling stones found in Asiatic battlefields, that became adopted in place of the Attic forms. Koine Greek established a spirantisation of beta, gamma and delta, which has been attributed to the Macedonian influence. Other adoptions from the ancient Macedonian include the simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /i:n/ (γίνομαι, Attic γίγνομαι) and the loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /sth/ (> /st/) (γενέσται, Attic γενέσθαι), for example as in a Koine inscription from Dura-Europos from the 2nd or 3rd century AD: \"τον Χριστὀν μνἠσκεστε\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12480446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12480446", "title": "Apex (diacritic)", "text": "Apex (diacritic)\n\nIn written Latin, the apex (plural \"apices\") is a mark with roughly the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ) which is placed over vowels to indicate that they are long.\n\nThe shape and length of the apex can vary, sometimes within a single inscription. While virtually all apices consist of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and varies in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is adorned at the top with a distinct hook, protruding to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it modifies, the apex is often considerably displaced to the right.\n\nThe apex later developed into the acute accent, which is still used to mark vowel length in some languages, namely, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Irish, and for the historically long vowels of Icelandic. In the 17th century, it was adapted to mark final nasalization in the early Vietnamese alphabet.\n\nAn apex is not used with the letter \"i\"; rather, the letter is written taller, as in (lūciī a fīliī) at left.\n\nOther expedients, like a reduplication of the vowels, are attested in archaic epigraphy; but the apex is the standard vowel-length indication that was used in classical times and throughout the most flourishing period of the Roman education system. Its use is recommended by the best grammarians, like Quintilian, who says that writing the apex is necessary when a difference of quantity in a vowel can produce a different meaning in a word, as in \"malus\" and \"málus\" or \"liber\" and \"líber\" or \"rosa\" and \"rosá\".\n\nIn modern Latin orthography, long vowels are sometimes marked by a macron, a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark metrically long \"syllables\" (more recently called \"heavy\" syllables). To confuse matters further, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, as in Spanish, when the macron is not used.\n\nThe apex is often contrasted with another ancient Latin diacritic, the sicilicus, which is said to have been used above \"consonants\" to denote that they should be pronounced double. However, in his article \"Apex and Sicilicus\", Revilo P. Oliver argues that they are one and the same sign, a \"geminationis nota\", which was used over any letter to indicate that the letter should be read twice. The distinction between a sicilicus that was used above consonants and an apex that was applied to vowels is then completely artificial: “There is \"no\" example of this mark [the sicilicus] that can be distinguished from an apex by any criterion other than its presence above a letter that is not a long vowel.” “No ancient source says \"explicitly\" that there were two different signs; ...”. The presence of this sign, whatever its name, over a consonant is very scarcely attested.\n\nIf Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign denoting vowel length would have its origin in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels ceased to be regularly written twice, the usage of the sicilicus above vowels evidently remained, even after it fell out of use above consonants, and the apex, as it was now called, was redefined as a sign denoting the phonematic feature of vowel length, rather than as a purely orthographic shorthand.\n\nHowever, Oliver's view that the two marks were identical has recently been challenged; see sicilicus.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese alphabet incorporated both acute and apex marks. The acute indicates rising tone, while the apex marked final nasalization. In his 1651 \", Alexandre de Rhodes makes it clear that the apex is a distinct diacritic:\n\nThe apex appears atop , , and less commonly . As with other accent marks, a tone mark can appear atop the apex.\n\nAccording to canon law historian Roland Jacques, the apex indicated a final labial-velar nasal , an allophone of that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. The apex apparently fell out of use during the mid–18th century, being unified with (representing ), in a major simplification of the orthography, though the Vietnamese Jesuit () continued to use the old orthography into the early 19th century. In Pierre Pigneau de Behaine and Jean-Louis Taberd's 1838 ', the words ' and ' became ' and \", respectively.\n\nThe Middle Vietnamese apex is known as ' or ' in modern Vietnamese. Though it has no official Unicode representation, one possible approximation is . The apex is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.\n\n"}

German dialects are particularly strong in Brazil's South and Southeast Regions. According to Ethnologue, ca. 3 million people in Brazil speak Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, 1.5 million Standard German and 8,000 Plautdietsch.\n\nGerman speakers from Germany, Switzerland and Austria make up the largest group of immigrants after Portuguese and Italian speakers. They tended to preserve their language longer than the speakers of Italian, which is closer to Portuguese. Consequently, German was the second most common family language in Brazil at the 1940 census. However, even in areas that are still dominated by German speakers, most are bilingual. Today, German is increasingly cultivated as a cultural heritage, and several municipalities have recently given co-official status with Brazilian Portuguese to one Brazilian variant or another of it.\n\nRiograndenser Hunsrückisch is the most significant variant, and the term is sometimes used so as to include all forms of Brazilian German. It is particularly well represented in the two southernmost states, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. But especially in Espírito Santo there are significant pockets whose dialect is based on East Low German (East Pomeranian),\n\nBrazilian Hunsrückisch, a dialect of the High German language, is also referred to as \"Riograndenser Hunsrückisch\" (or \"Hunsrik\") after the country's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul. But it is also strongly represented in Santa Catarina, where the local variant is referred to as \"Katharinensisch\", and in Paraná. Together, these three states form Brazil's South Region. The area attracted significant immigration from German-speaking countries. Overall, it is particularly well developed in comparison to the rest of Brazil.\n\nGerman immigration to Rio Grande do Sul started in 1824. The German workers and settlers came from many different regions, but especially from the poor regions Hunsrück and nearby Palatinate. The German dialects began to mix with each other, adopting elements of the languages spoken by other immigrants, to form varieties that differed from municipality to municipality, often from family to family, and which had no relation to the dialect lines in Germany. However, in most places the Hunsrück dialect proved dominant.\n\nInitially, the immigrants had to organize their own school system, but this was to change.\nDue to lack of exposure – from 1938 till 1961, German was not even taught at higher schools. – Standard German became restricted to formal contexts such as church, whereas all daily interactions happened either in dialect or in Portuguese, from which the required words for innovations were also taken.\n\nSpeakers of Hunsrückisch are typically bilingual with Portuguese, but are not necessarily familiar with Standard German. The elementary school of Santa Maria do Herval, a municipality in Rio Grande do Sul with a population of roughly 6,000, teaches Hunsrückisch and uses a new orthography for this which is closer to Portuguese than to Standard German conventions. However, linguists in Brazil criticize this detachment and demand a closer orthographic tie between Hunsrik and Standard German\n\n\nEast Pomeranian, a dialect of Low German, is spoken in many places in southeastern and southern Brazil:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20490458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20490458", "title": "Bǎ construction", "text": "Bǎ construction\n\nThe \"bǎ\" construction is a grammatical construction in the Chinese language. In a \"bǎ\" construction, the object of a verb is placed after the function word (or, in more formal writing, ), and the verb placed after the object, forming a subject–object–verb (SOV) sentence. Linguists commonly analyze \"bǎ\" as a light verb construction, or as a preposition.\n\nCharles Li and Sandra Thompson (1981) offer the following examples of the \"bǎ\" construction:\n\nThe \"bǎ\" construction may only be used in certain contexts, generally those in which the verb expresses \"settlement\" of, or action upon, the object. According to Wang Li, \"the disposal form states how a person is handled, manipulated, or dealt with; how something is disposed of; or how an affair is conducted,\" or, in other words, \"what happens to\" the object. Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in transitivity, a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object; \"bǎ\" does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as \"love\" and \"miss,\" or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as \"sing\" and \"see.\"\n\nThe direct object of a \"bǎ\" construction must meet certain requirements as well. It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of \"this\", \"that\", \"these\", or \"those\"). It may sometimes also be generic, such as \"salt\" in the sentence \"She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar.\" The object of a \"bǎ\" construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of.\n\nBecause of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in \"bǎ\" construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers. For example, sentences with \"bǎ\" construction that have syntactic violations (such as \"bǎ\" being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and semantic violations (such as \"bǎ\" being followed by a verb that doesn't express \"disposal\") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the neuroimaging technique of ERP, and to evaluate construction grammar's model of meaning-building.\n\n"}

In 2014, Brehme and co-workers systematically studied the expression dynamics of the full human chaperome comprising ~300 human chaperones and co-chaperones in human aging brains and in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Integration with chaperome-wide functional RNA interference (RNAi) perturbation experiments in worm and in human cells led to the identification of a chaperome sub-network that safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nRecently, a comprehensive literature survey reviewed the literature since the release of the human genome sequence in 2000 for systematic studies in small animal model systems and highlighted the power of model systems to unveil those key chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity out of the large number represented in the wider human chaperome that could inform targets and strategies for therapeutic regulation of chaperone functionality.\n\n"}
{"id": "68038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68038", "title": "Circular definition", "text": "Circular definition\n\nA circular definition is one that uses the term(s) being defined as a part of the definition or assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined. There are several kinds of circular definition, and several ways of characterising the term: pragmatic, lexicographic and linguistic.\n\nFrom a pragmatic point of view, circular definitions may be characterised in terms of new, useful or helpful information: A definition is deficient if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself. Such definitions lead to a need for additional information that motivated someone to look at the definition in the first place and, thus, violate the principle of providing new or useful information. Here are some examples:\n\n\nConsequently, when constructing systems of definitions, authors should use good practices that avoid producing viciously circular definitions. In many learner's dictionaries, circular definitions are greatly reduced by writing definitions using only the words in a constrained defining vocabulary.\n\nFrom a lexicographic point of view, the simplest form of circular definition in a dictionary is in terms of synonyms, and the number of steps for closing the definition chain into a circle is known as the \"depth\" of the circular definition: the circular definition \"object: a thing\" → \"thing: an object\" is a circular definition with a depth of two. The circular definition \"object: a thing\" → \"thing: an entity\" → \"entity: an object\" has a depth of three.\n\nThe classic \"genus-difference\" dictionary definition is in terms of nearest kind (\"genus proximum\") and specific differences (\"differentia specifica\"). This genus-difference description may be involved in producing circular definitions of part and kind relationships, for example: \"rake: an implement with three or more tines\" → \"tine: a part of a rake\". However, if more specific differences are added, then the effect of circularity may disappear: \"rake: a gardening implement with a long handle with three or more tines arranged on crossbar at 90° to the handle and the tines at 90° to both crossbar and handle\"; in this case, \"tine\" is most usefully defined with reference to \"rake\", but with additional differences providing points of comparison, e.g.: \"tine: a sharp spike at the end of a rake\". In practice, a pragmatic approach is often taken in considering the effects of circularity in dictionary definitions.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, some intuitively circular definitions in the derivation of words can easily be shown to be non-circular. For example, sometimes a definition like \"musicality: the quality or state of being musical\" is said to be circular. But strictly speaking, the condition \"the term(s) being defined as a part of the definition or assumes a prior understanding of the term being defined\" is false in this case. The definition chain \"musicality: the quality or state of being musical\" → \"musical: associated with music\" → \"music: an acoustic art form\" is a two-step derivation of the word \"musicality\" from the root \"music\", where the chain ends. A definition chain which ends is not circular. It may be objected that the term to be defined and one of the difference terms in the definition share the same root; the answer is that the objection requires prior analysis of the terms in order to identify identical parts, yet the terms themselves cannot be reduced to these parts: the meaning of \"musicality\" is composed of the meaning of \"musical\" and the meaning of \"ity\", the meaning of \"musical\" is composed of the meaning of \"music\" and \"al\". In each case, the terms to be defined and the terms in the definition are different.\n\nFormal approaches to characterizing circular definitions are found in logic, mathematics and in computer science. A branch of mathematics called non-well-founded set theory allows for the construction of circular sets. Circular sets are good for modelling cycles and, despite the field's name, this area of mathematics is well founded. (The sets \"themselves\", not the branch of mathematics that \"deals\" with them, are not well-founded.) Computer science allows for procedures to be defined by using recursion. Such definitions are not circular as long as they terminate.\n\nDictionary entries are often given as examples of apparent circular definitions. Dictionary production, as a project in lexicography, should not be confused with a mathematical or logical activity, where giving a definition for a word is similar to providing an explanans for an explanandum in a context where practitioners are expected to use a deductive system. While, from a linguistic prescriptivist perspective, any dictionary might be believed to dictate correct usage, the linguistic descriptivist perspective recognizes that looking up words in dictionaries is not itself a rule-following practice independent of the give-and-take of using words in context. Thus, the example of a definition of oak given above (something that has catkins and grows from acorns) is not completely useless, even if \"acorn\" and \"catkin\" are defined in terms of \"oak\", in that it supplies additional concepts (e.g., the concept of catkin) in the definition. \n\nWhile a dictionary might produce a \"circle\" among the terms, \"oak\", \"catkin\", and \"acorn\", each of these is used in different (e.g., those related to plants, trees, flowers, and seeds) that generate ever-branching networks of usages. In another case it might produce a true circle. Taken as a whole, dictionaries are circular because each and every word is defined in terms of words that are also contained within the dictionary. ()\n\nDefinitions in lexicography can be broadly or narrowly circular. Narrowly circular definitions simply define one word in terms of another. A broadly circular definition has a larger circle of words. For example, the definition of the primary word is defined using two other words, which are defined with two other words, etc., creating a definitional chain. This can continue until the primary word is used to define one of the words used in the chain, closing the wide circle of terms. If all definitions rely on the definitions of other words in a very large, but finite chain, then all text-based definitions are ultimately circular. Extension (semantics) to the actual things that referring terms like nouns stand for, provided that agreement on reference is accomplished, is one method of breaking this circularity, but this is outside the capacity of a text-based definition.\n\nThe 2007 Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a \"hill\" and a \"mountain\" this way:\n\nMerriam-Webster's online dictionary provides another example of a circular definition with the words \"condescending\" and \"patronizing:\"\n\nThis definition alone is close to suffering from circular definition, but following the definition train:\n\nLooking up the word \"patronizing\" then gives us:\n\nThe following definition of the adjective \"inspiring\" appears to be a circular definition, but in the phrase \"effect of inspiring someone\", the word \"inspiring\" is actually the inflected verb \"inspire\", which is defined without using the adjective \"inspiring\":\n\n"}

Later that year, diplomat George Kennan wrote an article in \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine that became known as the \"X Article\", which first articulated the policy of containment, arguing that the further spread of Communism to countries outside a \"buffer zone\" around the USSR, even if it happened via democratic elections, was unacceptable and a threat to U.S. national security. Kennan was also involved, along with others in the Truman administration, in creating the Marshall Plan, which also began in 1947, to give aid to the countries of Western Europe (along with Greece and Turkey), in large part with the hope of keeping them from falling under Soviet domination.\n\nIn 1949, a Communist-backed government, led by Mao Zedong, was instated in China (officially becoming the People's Republic of China). The installation of the new government was established after the People's Liberation Army defeated the Nationalist Republican Government of China in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949). Two Chinas were formed - mainland 'Communist China' (People's Republic of China) and 'Nationalist China' Taiwan (Republic of China). The takeover by Communists of the world's most populous nation was seen in the West as a great strategic loss, prompting the popular question at the time, \"Who lost China?\" The United States subsequently ended diplomatic relations with China in response to the communist takeover in 1949.\n\nKorea had also partially fallen under Soviet domination at the end of World War II, split from the south of the 38th parallel where U.S. forces subsequently moved into. By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the war never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an armistice that left Korea divided into two nations, North Korea and South Korea.\nMao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.\n\nPresident Eisenhower was the first to refer to countries in danger of Communist takeover as dominoes, in response to a journalist's question about Indochina in an April 7, 1954 news conference, though he did not use the term \"domino theory\". If Communists succeeded in taking over the rest of Indochina, Eisenhower argued, local groups would then have the encouragement, material support and momentum to take over Burma, Thailand, Malaya and Indonesia; all of these countries had large popular Communist movements and insurgencies within their borders at the time.\n\nIn May 1954, the Viet Minh, a Communist and nationalist army, defeated French troops in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and took control of what became North Vietnam. This caused the French to fully withdraw from the region then known as French Indochina, a process they had begun earlier. The regions were then divided into four independent countries (North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) after a deal was brokered at the 1954 Geneva Conference to end the First Indochina War.\n\nThis would give them a geographical and economic strategic advantage, and it would make Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand the front-line defensive states. The loss of regions traditionally within the vital regional trading area of countries like Japan would encourage the front-line countries to compromise politically with communism.\n\nEisenhower's domino theory of 1954 was a specific description of the situation and conditions within Southeast Asia at the time, and he did not suggest a generalized domino theory as others did afterward.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese \"domino\" from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led Pathet Lao in Laos would provide the Viet Cong with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.\n\nThe primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the communist takeover of Vietnam: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the Khmer Rouge). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia. Note the Malayan Emergency, the Hukbalahap Rebellion in the Philippines, and the increasing involvement with Communists by Sukarno of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967. All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.\n\nWalt Whitman Rostow and the then Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of ASEAN time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect. Meeting with President Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"\n\nMcGeorge Bundy argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed via CIA-supported death squads in the Indonesian genocide. However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e. Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the Viet Minh, the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory. The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the Guided Democracy in Indonesia, especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.\n\nLinguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in Chile, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Laos, Grenada, El Salvador, Guatemala, etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".\n\nMichael Lind has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or Marxist–Leninist regimes came to power in Benin, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Angola, Afghanistan, Grenada, and Nicaragua during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.\n\nIn this vein, Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world. Historian Max Boot wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua. American hostages were seized aboard the SS \"Mayaguez\" (off Cambodia) and in Tehran. The Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan. There is no obvious connection with the Vietnam War, but there is little doubt that the defeat of a superpower encouraged our enemies to undertake acts of aggression that they might otherwise have shied away from.\"\n\nIn addition, this theory can be further bolstered by the rise in terrorist incidents by left-wing terrorist groups in Western Europe, funded in part by Communist governments, between the 1960s and 1980s. In Italy, this includes the kidnapping and assassination of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, and the kidnapping of former US Brigadier General James L. Dozier, by the Red Brigades.\n\nIn West Germany, this includes the terrorist actions of the Red Army Faction. In the far east the Japanese Red Army carried out similar acts. All four, as well as others worked with various Arab and Palestinian terrorists, which like the red brigades were backed by the Soviet Bloc.\n\nIn the 1977 Frost/Nixon interviews, Richard Nixon defended America's destabilization of the Salvador Allende regime in Chile on domino theory grounds. Borrowing a metaphor he had heard, he stated that a Communist Chile and Cuba would create a \"red sandwich\" that could entrap Latin America between them. In the 1980s, the domino theory was used again to justify the Reagan administration's interventions in Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\nIn his memoirs, former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith described the successive rise of authoritarian left-wing governments in Sub-Saharan Africa during decolonization as \"the communists' domino tactic\". The establishment of pro-communist governments in Tanzania (1961–64) and Zambia (1964) and explicitly Marxist–Leninist governments in Angola (1975), Mozambique (1975), and eventually Rhodesia itself (in 1980) are cited by Smith as evidence of \"the insidious encroachment of Soviet imperialism down the continent\".\n\nSome foreign policy analysts in the United States have referred to the potential spread of both Islamic theocracy and liberal democracy in the Middle East as two different possibilities for a domino theory. During the Iran–Iraq War the United States and other western nations supported Ba'athist Iraq, fearing the spread of Iran's radical theocracy throughout the region. In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, some neoconservatives argued that when a democratic government is implemented, it would then help spread democracy and liberalism across the Middle East. This has been referred to as a \"reverse domino theory,\" or a \"democratic domino theory,\" so called because its effects are considered positive, not negative, by Western democratic states.\n\n\n"}

Door hangers are often seen in hotels and other places of lodging as a means for guests to communicate with maintenance and housekeeping staff.\n\nIn computer user interface design, a \"doorhanger\" notification is a sort of pop-up panel that \"hangs\" from another user interface element, typically an icon in the tool bar.\n\nOne common place where do not disturb signs are used is in places of lodging, where guests can place these signs on the door in order to inform staff, including housekeeping, to respect their privacy. Some hotels also provide \"make up room\" signs giving the opposite instructions.\n\nThey are also used in schools to let other staff members and students at the school know that testing is in progress in the particular classroom.\n\nDo not disturb signs can also be used by those who keep valuables in their rooms in order to deter possible thieves.\n\nIn multiple cases, a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door of a hotel room has been blamed for concealing a homicide, suspicious death, or other criminal activity.\n\nIn 2009, a \"do not disturb\" sign was blamed for concealing the disappearance of an elderly couple on a cruise ship.\n\nIn 2017, mass murderer Stephen Paddock kept a \"do not disturb\" sign on his hotel room door, concealing ten suitcases with a stockpile of rifles and ammunition he used to commit the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.\n\nSome hotels are using high-tech means to replace paper do not disturb signs that hang on the door. One example is a privacy button that one can press from within the room to light up an indicator outside the room.\n\nMore recently, hotels have used the do not disturb signs as a way to brand themselves and provide inexpensive advertising.\n\nIn 2007, Embassy Suites ran a contest allowing the public to design do not disturb signs. The winner was announced in 2008.\n\nDoor Hangers are also used in competition with direct mail as an advertising vehicle. Most recently, companies providing this type of advertising have been using the term Direct to Door Advertising. This type of advertising offers a number of advantages over traditional direct mail in that the impression is \"guaranteed\". The home owner must handle the piece and typically on a door hanger there is just one advertising message giving the advertiser great exposure.\n\nThis type of advertising is used by national brands and local companies to help drive traffic into their stores, increase trial by offering a sample, and to increase their brand awareness. This method of delivery can often be more cost effective and with today's technology, the delivery of the pieces is completely trackable by integrating GPS and photos into the Proof of Performance.\n\n"}

Executive agencies are \"machinery of government\" devices distinct both from non-ministerial government departments and non-departmental public bodies (or \"quangos\"), each of which enjoy a real legal and constitutional separation from ministerial control. The model was also applied in several other countries.\n\nAgencies range from Her Majesty's Prison Service to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The annual budget for each agency, allocated by Her Majesty's Treasury ranges from a few million pounds for the smallest agencies to £700m for the Court Service. Virtually all government departments have at least one agency.\n\nThe initial success or otherwise of executive agencies was examined in the Sir Angus Fraser's Fraser Report of 1991. Its main goal was to identify what good practices had emerged from the new model and spread them to other agencies and departments. The report also recommended further powers be devolved from ministers to chief executives.\n\nA series of reports and white papers examining governmental delivery were published throughout the 1990s, under both Conservative and Labour governments. During these the agency model became the standard model for delivering public services in the United Kingdom. By 1997 76% of civil servants were employed by an agency. The new Labour government in its first such report – the \"1998 Next Steps Report\" endorsed the model introduced by its predecessor.

The phrase became popular after the Watergate scandal.\n\nCompelled by a subpoena to provide the contents of the White House taping system to the House Judiciary Committee in April 1974, President Richard Nixon ordered transcripts of the tapes to be prepared. After a cursory inspection of the transcripts, Nixon, shocked at viewing several profanity-laced discussions amongst the White House's inner-circle, ordered that every use of profanity be replaced by \"[EXPLETIVE DELETED].\"\n\nThe transcripts were published in \"The New York Times\" and elicited shock in much of the country, given Nixon's generally staid public image and the fact that contemporary media coverage of politicians did not usually report candidates' profanity use. As Nixon biographer Jonathan Aitken noted, Nixon had a rather broad view on what constituted profanity, and had ordered comparatively minor outbursts like \"Christ\" and \"hell\" to be replaced as expletives. Seeing the jarring phrase repeatedly within the transcripts seemed to give the public the impression that the words used were far harsher than what actually appeared on the tapes.\n\nThe phrase entered the public imagination to the point where protesters outside the White House held up picket signs reading, \"IMPEACH THE (EXPLETIVE DELETED)!\"\n\nIn later years, the phrase became commonplace as an ironic expression which indicates that a profanity has been omitted and passed into general usage as a convenient linguistic figleaf.\n\nThe term \"expletive\" is commonly used outside linguistics to refer to any bad language (or profanity), used with or without meaning. \"Expletives\" in this wide sense may be adjectives, adverbs, nouns or, most commonly, interjections, or (rarely) verbs.

{"id": "12569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12569", "title": "Grammar", "text": "Grammar\n\nIn linguistics, grammar (from Greek: ) is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given natural language. The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics.\n\nSpeakers of a language have a set of internalized rules for using that language and these rules constitute that language's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is – at least in the case of one's native language – acquired not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction. Thus, grammar is the cognitive information underlying language use.\n\nThe term \"grammar\" can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behaviour of a group of speakers. The term \"English grammar\", therefore, may have several meanings. It may refer to the whole of English grammar, that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language, in which case, the term encompasses a great deal of variation. Alternatively, it may refer only to what is common to the grammars of all, or of the vast majority of English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). Or it may refer to the rules of a particular, relatively well-defined variety of English (such as standard English for a particular region).\n\nA specific description, study or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as a grammar. A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a \"reference grammar\" or simply \"a grammar\" (see History of English grammars). A fully explicit grammar that exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a language is called a descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while promoting others. For example, preposition stranding occurs widely in Germanic languages and has a long history in English. John Dryden, however, objected to it (without explanation), leading other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use.\n\nOutside linguistics, the term \"grammar\" is often used in a rather different sense. In some respects, it may be used more broadly, including rules of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, but rather as a part of orthography, the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, it may be used more narrowly, to refer to prescriptive grammar only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, \"Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to.\"\n\nThe word \"grammar\" is derived from Greek (\"grammatikē technē\"), which means \"art of letters\", from (\"gramma\"), \"letter\", itself from (\"graphein\"), \"to draw, to write\". The same Greek root also appears in graphics, grapheme, and photograph.\n\nThe Babylonians made some early attempts at language description, but the first systematic grammars, of Sanskrit, originated in Iron Age India, with Yaska (6th century BC), Pāṇini (6-5th century BC) and his commentators Pingala (c. 200 BC), Katyayana, and Patanjali (2nd century BC). Tolkāppiyam, the earliest Tamil grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD.\n\nIn the West, grammar emerged as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd century BC forward with authors like Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace. The oldest known grammar handbook is the \"Art of Grammar\" (), a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively, written by the ancient Greek scholar Dionysius Thrax ( 170– 90 BC), a student of Aristarchus of Samothrace who established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes. Dionysius Thrax's grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD. The Romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today. Latin grammar developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, and Aemilius Asper.\n\nA grammar of Irish originated in the 7th century with the Auraicept na n-Éces.\nArabic grammar emerged with Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali in the 7th century.\nThe first treatises on Hebrew grammar appeared in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Mishnah (exegesis of the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad. The \"Diqduq\" (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible. Ibn Barun in the 12th century compares the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition.\n\nBelonging to the \"trivium\" of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following the influence of authors from Late Antiquity, such as Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but became influential only in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published \"Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin\", and the first Spanish grammar, \"Gramática de la lengua castellana\", in 1492. During the 16th-century Italian Renaissance, the \"Questione della lingua\" was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante's \"de vulgari eloquentia\" (Pietro Bembo, \"Prose della volgar lingua\" Venice 1525). The first grammar of Slovene language was written in 1583 by Adam Bohorič.\n\nGrammars of non-European languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelization and Bible translation from the 16th century onward, such as \"Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Indios de los Reynos del Perú\" (1560), and a Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Tomás.\n\nFrom the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The \"Deutsche Grammatik\" of the Jacob Grimm was first published in the 1810s. The \"Comparative Grammar\" of Franz Bopp, the starting point of modern comparative linguistics, came out in 1833.\n\nFrameworks of grammar, which attempt to give a precise scientific theory of the syntax rules of grammar and their function, have been developed in theoretical linguistics. Most mainstream frameworks are based on the conception of an innate \"universal grammar\", an idea developed by Noam Chomsky. The most prominent theories are:\n\n\nParse trees are commonly (but not always) used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various additional notation schemes for some grammars:\n\nGrammars evolve through usage and also due to separations of the human population. With the advent of written representations, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. Formal grammars are codifications of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time, and by observation as well. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often creates a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being correct. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammars as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about \"standard language employment\", based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (an explanation, for example, for why some people say \"I didn't do nothing\", some say \"I didn't do anything\", and some say one or the other depending on social context).\n\nThe formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced learning, though the rules taught in schools are not a \"grammar\" in the sense most linguists use the term, particularly as they are often prescriptive rather than descriptive.\n\nConstructed languages (also called \"planned languages\" or \"conlangs\") are more common in the modern day than they used to be, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic Interlingua, schematic Esperanto, and the highly logic-compatible artificial language Lojban). Each of these languages has its own grammar.\n\nSyntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (e.g. how sentences are formed)—though without taking into account intonation, which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to structure at and below the word level (e.g. how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology. No clear line can be drawn, however, between syntax and morphology. Analytic languages use syntax to convey information that is encoded via inflection in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. Chinese and Afrikaans, for example, are highly analytic, and meaning is therefore very context-dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more \"purely\" analytic over time.) Latin, which is highly synthetic, uses affixes and inflections to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin sentence can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.\n\nPrescriptive grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term \"grammar school\" historically refers to a school (attached to a cathedral or monastery) teaching Latin grammar to future priests and monks. In its earliest form, \"grammar school\" referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, and others). These should not be confused with the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.\n\nA standard language is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and broadly speaking in the public sphere; it contrasts with vernacular dialects, which may be the objects of study in descriptive grammar but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized \"first language\" taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy, because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity.\n\nRecently, efforts have begun to update grammar instruction in primary and secondary education. The primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favour of more accurate descriptive ones and to change perceptions about relative \"correctness\" of standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects.\n\nThe pre-eminence of Parisian French has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is not based on the speech of the capital, Rome, but on the speech of Florence because of the influence Florentines had on early Italian literature. Similarly, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of Madrid, but on that of educated speakers from more northerly areas like Castile and León (e.g. see \"Gramática de la lengua castellana\"). In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Rioplatense Spanish). Portuguese has, for now, two official standards, respectively Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.\n\nThe Serbian language is divided in a similar way; Serbia and the Republika Srpska use their own separate standards. The existence of a third standard is a matter of controversy, some consider Montenegrin as a separate language, and some think it is merely another variety of Serbian.\n\nNorwegian has two standards, \"Bokmål\" and \"Nynorsk\", the choice between which is subject to controversy: Each Norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language, or it can remain \"language neutral\". Nynorsk is endorsed by a minority of 27 percent of the municipalities. The main language used in primary schools normally follows the official language of its municipality and is decided by referendum within the local school district. Standard German emerged from the standardized chancellery use of High German in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost entirely a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former German dialects are nearly extinct.\n\nStandard Chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC) and the Republic of Singapore. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of Mandarin Chinese from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern vernacular written Chinese.\nModern Standard Arabic is directly based on Classical Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. The Hindustani language has two standards, Hindi and Urdu.\n\nIn the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as National Grammar Day in 2008.\n\n"}

{"id": "16315657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16315657", "title": "High-definition television", "text": "High-definition television\n\nHigh-definition television (HDTV) is a television system providing an image resolution that is of substantially higher resolution than that of standard-definition television. This can be either analog or digital. HDTV is the current standard video format used in most broadcasts: terrestrial broadcast television, cable television, satellite television, Blu-rays, and streaming video.\n\nHDTV may be transmitted in various formats:\n\n\nThe letter \"p\" here stands for progressive scan, while \"i\" indicates interlaced.\n\nWhen transmitted at two megapixels per frame, HDTV provides about five times as many pixels as SD (standard-definition television). The increased resolution provides for a clearer, more detailed picture. In addition, progressive scan and higher frame rates result in a picture with less flicker and better rendering of fast motion. HDTV as is known today first started official broadcasting in 1989 in Japan, under the MUSE/Hi-Vision analog system. HDTV was widely adopted worldwide in the 2000s.\n\nThe term \"high definition\" once described a series of television systems originating from August 1936; however, these systems were only high definition when compared to earlier systems that were based on mechanical systems with as few as 30 lines of resolution. The ongoing competition between companies and nations to create true \"HDTV\" spanned the entire 20th century, as each new system became more HD than the last. In the 2010s, this race has continued with 4K, 5K and 8K systems.\n\nThe British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936 and a regular service on 2 November 1936 using both the (mechanical) Baird 240 line sequential scan (later to be inaccurately rechristened 'progressive') and the (electronic) Marconi-EMI 405 line interlaced systems. The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937. In 1938 France followed with their own 441-line system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries. The US NTSC 555-line system joined in 1941. In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable. All of these systems used interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term \"sequential\") and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3. The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 Hz frame rate. The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz.\n\nColor broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the US NTSC color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution. European standards did not follow until the 1960s, when the PAL and SECAM color systems were added to the monochrome 625 line broadcasts.\n\nThe Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai (NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation) began conducting research to \"unlock the fundamental mechanism of video and sound interactions with the five human senses\" in 1964, after the Tokyo Olympics. NHK set out to create an HDTV system that ended up scoring much higher in subjective tests than NTSC's previously dubbed \"HDTV\". This new system, NHK Color, created in 1972, included 1125 lines, a 5:3 aspect ratio and 60 Hz refresh rate. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), headed by Charles Ginsburg, became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater. SMPTE would test HDTV systems from different companies from every conceivable perspective, but the problem of combining the different formats plagued the technology for many years.\n\nThere were four major HDTV systems tested by SMPTE in the late 1970s, and in 1979 an SMPTE study group released \"A Study of High Definition Television Systems\":\n\n\nSince the formal adoption of digital video broadcasting's (DVB) widescreen HDTV transmission modes in the mid to late 2000s; the 525-line NTSC (and PAL-M) systems, as well as the European 625-line PAL and SECAM systems, are now regarded as \"standard definition\" television systems.\n\nEarly HDTV broadcasting used analog technology, but today it is transmitted digitally and uses video compression.\n\nIn 1949, France started its transmissions with an 819 lines system (with 737 active lines). The system was monochrome only, and was used only on VHF for the first French TV channel. It was discontinued in 1983.\n\nIn 1958, the Soviet Union developed \"Тransformator\" (, meaning \"Transformer\"), the first high-resolution (definition) television system capable of producing an image composed of 1,125 lines of resolution aimed at providing teleconferencing for military command. It was a research project and the system was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting.\n\nIn 1986, the European Community proposed HD-MAC, an analog HDTV system with 1,152 lines. A public demonstration took place for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. However HD-MAC was scrapped in 1993 and the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) project was formed, which would foresee development of a digital HDTV standard.\n\nIn 1979, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding (MUSE) for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1035i/1125 lines). In 1981, the MUSE system was demonstrated for the first time in the United States, using the same 5:3 aspect ratio as the Japanese system. Upon visiting a demonstration of MUSE in Washington, US President Ronald Reagan was impressed and officially declared it \"a matter of national interest\" to introduce HDTV to the US. NHK taped the 1984 Summer Olympics with a Hi-Vision camera, weighing 40 kg.\n\nSatellite test broadcasts started June 4, 1989, the first daily high-definition programs in the world, with regular testing starting on November 25, 1991 or \"Hi-Vision Day\" dated exactly to refer to its 1,125-lines resolution. Regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK programming.\n\nSeveral systems were proposed as the new standard for the US, including the Japanese MUSE system, but all were rejected by the FCC because of their higher bandwidth requirements. At this time, the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem. A new standard had to be more efficient, needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC.\n\nThe limited standardization of analog HDTV in the 1990s did not lead to global HDTV adoption as technical and economic constraints at the time did not permit HDTV to use bandwidths greater than normal television. Early HDTV commercial experiments, such as NHK's MUSE, required over four times the bandwidth of a standard-definition broadcast. Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV, these television formats were still distributable only by satellite. In Europe too, the HD-MAC standard was considered not technically viable.\n\nIn addition, recording and reproducing an HDTV signal was a significant technical challenge in the early years of HDTV (Sony HDVS). Japan remained the only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV, with seven broadcasters sharing a single channel.\n\nHowever the Hi-Vision/MUSE system also faced commercial issues when it launched on November 25, 1991. Only 2,000 HDTV sets were sold by that day, rather than the enthusiastic 1.32 million estimation. Hi-Vision sets were very expensive, up to US$30,000 each, which contributed to its low consumer adaption. A Hi-Vision VCR from NEC released at Christmas time retailed for US$115,000. In addition, the United States saw Hi-Vision/MUSE as an outdated system and had already made it clear that it would develop an all-digital system. Experts thought the commercial Hi-Vision system in 1992 was already eclipsed by digital technology developed in the U.S. since 1990. This was an American victory against the Japanese in terms of technological dominance. By mid-1993 prices of receivers were still as high as 1.5 million yen (US$15,000).\n\nOn February 23, 1994, a top broadcasting administrator in Japan admitted failure of its analog-based HDTV system, saying the U.S. digital format would be more likely a worldwide standard. However this announcement drew angry protests from broadcasters and electronic companies who invested heavily into the analog system. As a result, he took back his statement the next day saying that the government will continue to promote Hi-Vision/MUSE. That year NHK started development of digital television in an attempt to catch back up to America and Europe. This resulted in the ISDB format. Japan started digital satellite and HDTV broadcasting in December 2000.\n\nSince 1972, International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) had been working on creating a global recommendation for Analog HDTV. These recommendations, however, did not fit in the broadcasting bands which could reach home users. The standardization of MPEG-1 in 1993 also led to the acceptance of recommendations ITU-R BT.709. In anticipation of these standards the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) organisation was formed, an alliance of broadcasters, consumer electronics manufacturers and regulatory bodies. The DVB develops and agrees upon specifications which are formally standardised by ETSI.\n\nDVB created first the standard for DVB-S digital satellite TV, DVB-C digital cable TV and DVB-T digital terrestrial TV. These broadcasting systems can be used for both SDTV and HDTV. In the US the Grand Alliance proposed ATSC as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV. Both ATSC and DVB were based on the MPEG-2 standard, although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression standards. Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements.\n\nIn 1983, the International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) set up a working party (IWP11/6) with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard. One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50 Hz and 30/60 Hz, largely due to the differences in mains frequency. The IWP11/6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas, not least conversion between the two main frame/field rates using motion vectors, which led to further developments in other areas. While a comprehensive HDTV standard was not in the end established, agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved.\n\nInitially the existing 5:3 aspect ratio had been the main candidate but, due to the influence of widescreen cinema, the aspect ratio (1.78) eventually emerged as being a reasonable compromise between 5:3 (1.67) and the common 1.85 widescreen cinema format. An aspect ratio of 16:9 was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of the IWP11/6 working party at the BBC's Research and Development establishment in Kingswood Warren. The resulting ITU-R Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2 (\"Rec. 709\") includes the 16:9 aspect ratio, a specified colorimetry, and the scan modes 1080i (1,080 actively interlaced lines of resolution) and 1080p (1,080 progressively scanned lines). The British Freeview HD trials used MBAFF, which contains both progressive and interlaced content in the same encoding.\n\nIt also includes the alternative 1440×1152 HDMAC scan format. (According to some reports, a mooted 750-line (720p) format (720 progressively scanned lines) was viewed by some at the ITU as an enhanced television format rather than a true HDTV format, and so was not included, although 1920×1080i and 1280×720p systems for a range of frame and field rates were defined by several US SMPTE standards.)\n\nHDTV technology was introduced in the United States in the late 1980s and made official in 1993 by the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance, a group of television, electronic equipment, communications companies consisting of AT&T Bell Labs, General Instrument, Philips, Sarnoff, Thomson, Zenith and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Field testing of HDTV at 199 sites in the United States was completed August 14, 1994. The first public HDTV broadcast in the United States occurred on July 23, 1996 when the Raleigh, North Carolina television station WRAL-HD began broadcasting from the existing tower of WRAL-TV southeast of Raleigh, winning a race to be first with the HD Model Station in Washington, D.C., which began broadcasting July 31, 1996 with the callsign WHD-TV, based out of the facilities of NBC owned and operated station WRC-TV. The American Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) HDTV system had its public launch on October 29, 1998, during the live coverage of astronaut John Glenn's return mission to space on board the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\". The signal was transmitted coast-to-coast, and was seen by the public in science centers, and other public theaters specially equipped to receive and display the broadcast. The first HDTV logo was created by Washington, DC-based advertising firm Don Schaaf & Friends, Inc.\n\nThe first HDTV transmissions in Europe, albeit not direct-to-home, began in 1990, when the Italian broadcaster RAI used both HD-MAC and MUSE HDTV technologies to broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The matches were shown in 8 cinemas in Italy, where the tournament was played, and 2 in Spain. The connection with Spain was made via the Olympus satellite link from Rome to Barcelona and then with a fiber optic connection from Barcelona to Madrid. After some HDTV transmissions in Europe the standard was abandoned in 1993, to be replaced by a digital format from DVB.\n\nThe first regular broadcasts started on January 1, 2004 when the Belgian company Euro1080 launched the HD1 channel with the traditional Vienna New Year's Concert. Test transmissions had been active since the IBC exhibition in September 2003, but the New Year's Day broadcast marked the official launch of the HD1 channel, and the official start of direct-to-home HDTV in Europe.\n\nEuro1080, a division of the former and now bankrupt Belgian TV services company Alfacam, broadcast HDTV channels to break the pan-European stalemate of \"no HD broadcasts mean no HD TVs bought means no HD broadcasts ...\" and kick-start HDTV interest in Europe. The HD1 channel was initially free-to-air and mainly comprised sporting, dramatic, musical and other cultural events broadcast with a multi-lingual soundtrack on a rolling schedule of 4 or 5 hours per day.\n\nThese first European HDTV broadcasts used the 1080i format with MPEG-2 compression on a DVB-S signal from SES's Astra 1H satellite. Euro1080 transmissions later changed to MPEG-4/AVC compression on a DVB-S2 signal in line with subsequent broadcast channels in Europe.\n\nDespite delays in some countries, the number of European HD channels and viewers has risen steadily since the first HDTV broadcasts, with SES's annual \"Satellite Monitor\" market survey for 2010 reporting more than 200 commercial channels broadcasting in HD from Astra satellites, 185 million HD capable TVs sold in Europe (£60 million in 2010 alone), and 20 million households (27% of all European digital satellite TV homes) watching HD satellite broadcasts (16 million via Astra satellites).\n\nIn December 2009, the United Kingdom became the first European country to deploy high definition content using the new DVB-T2 transmission standard, as specified in the Digital TV Group (DTG) D-book, on digital terrestrial television.\n\nThe Freeview HD service currently contains 13 HD channels () and was rolled out region by region across the UK in accordance with the digital switchover process, finally being completed in October 2012. However, Freeview HD is not the first HDTV service over digital terrestrial television in Europe; Italy's Rai HD channel started broadcasting in 1080i on April 24, 2008 using the DVB-T transmission standard.\n\nIn October 2008 France deployed five high definition channels using DVB-T transmission standard on digital terrestrial distribution.\n\nHDTV broadcast systems are identified with three major parameters:\n\n\nIf all three parameters are used, they are specified in the following form: \"[frame size][scanning system][frame or field rate]\" or \"[frame size]/[frame or field rate][scanning system]\". Often, frame size or frame rate can be dropped if its value is implied from context. In this case, the remaining numeric parameter is specified first, followed by the scanning system.\n\nFor example, \"1920×1080p25\" identifies progressive scanning format with 25 frames per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high. The \"1080i25\" or \"1080i50\" notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 25 frames (50 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high. The \"1080i30\" or \"1080i60\" notation identifies interlaced scanning format with 30 frames (60 fields) per second, each frame being 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high. The \"720p60\" notation identifies progressive scanning format with 60 frames per second, each frame being 720 pixels high; 1,280 pixels horizontally are implied.\n\n50 Hz systems support three scanning rates: 50i, 25p and 50p. 60 Hz systems support a much wider set of frame rates: 59.94i, 60i, 23.976p, 24p, 29.97p, 30p, 59.94p and 60p. In the days of standard definition television, the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers, e.g. 23.976p was often called 24p, or 59.94i was often called 60i. 60 Hz high definition television supports both fractional and slightly different integer rates, therefore strict usage of notation is required to avoid ambiguity. Nevertheless, 29.97p/59.94i is almost universally called 60i, likewise 23.976p is called 24p.\n\nFor the commercial naming of a product, the frame rate is often dropped and is implied from context (e.g., a \"1080i television set\"). A frame rate can also be specified without a resolution. For example, 24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second, and 50i means 25 interlaced frames per second.\n\nThere is no single standard for HDTV color support. Colors are typically broadcast using a (10-bits per channel) YUV color space but, depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver, are then subsequently converted to a RGB color space using standardized algorithms. When transmitted directly through the Internet, the colors are typically pre-converted to 8-bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a (sRGB) computer screen. As an added benefit to the original broadcasters, the losses of the pre-conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting.\n\nMost HDTV systems support resolutions and frame rates defined either in the ATSC table 3, or in EBU specification. The most common are noted below.\n\nAt a minimum, HDTV has twice the linear resolution of standard-definition television (SDTV), thus showing greater detail than either analog television or regular DVD. The technical standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the 16:9 aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching, thus increasing the effective image resolution.\n\nA very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity. The lossy compression that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture, when compared to the uncompressed source.\n\nATSC and DVB define the following frame rates for use with the various broadcast standards:\n\n\nThe optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image's characteristics. For best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio, lines, and frame rate should match those of the source.\n\nPAL, SECAM and NTSC frame rates technically apply only to analogue standard definition television, not to digital or high definition broadcasts. However, with the roll out of digital broadcasting, and later HDTV broadcasting, countries retained their heritage systems. HDTV in former PAL and SECAM countries operates at a frame rate of 25/50 Hz, while HDTV in former NTSC countries operates at 30/60 Hz.\n\nStandard 35mm photographic film used for cinema projection has a much higher image resolution than HDTV systems, and is exposed and projected at a rate of 24 frames per second (frame/s). To be shown on standard television, in PAL-system countries, cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of 25 frame/s, causing a speedup of 4.1 percent, which is generally considered acceptable. In NTSC-system countries, the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted, and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called : Over each successive pair of film frames, one is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second) and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second), giving a total time for the two frames of 1/12 of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate. \n\nNon-cinematic HDTV video recordings intended for broadcast are typically recorded either in 720p or 1080i format as determined by the broadcaster. 720p is commonly used for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because most computer monitors operate in progressive-scan mode. 720p also imposes less strenuous storage and decoding requirements compared to both 1080i and 1080p. 1080p/24, 1080i/30, 1080i/25, and 720p/30 is most often used on Blu-ray Disc.\n\nIn the US, residents in the line of sight of television station broadcast antennas can receive free, over the air programming with a television set with an ATSC tuner (most sets sold since 2009 have this). This is achieved with a TV aerial, just as it has been since the 1940s except now the major network signals are broadcast in high definition (ABC, Fox, and Ion Television broadcast at 720p resolution; CBS, My Network TV, NBC, PBS at 1080i; and The CW at either resolution depending on the local affiliate). As their digital signals more efficiently use the broadcast channel, many broadcasters are adding multiple channels to their signals. Laws about antennas were updated before the change to digital terrestrial broadcasts. These new laws prohibit home owners' associations and city government from banning the installation of antennas.\n\nAdditionally, cable-ready TV sets can display HD content without using an external box. They have a QAM tuner built-in and/or a card slot for inserting a CableCARD.\n\nHigh-definition image sources include terrestrial broadcast, direct broadcast satellite, digital cable, IPTV (including GoogleTV, Roku boxes and AppleTV or built into \"Smart Televisions\"), Blu-ray video disc (BD), and internet downloads.\n\nSony's PlayStation 3 has extensive HD compatibility because of its built in Blu-ray disc-based player, so does Microsoft's Xbox 360 with the addition of Netflix and Windows Media Center HTPC streaming capabilities. On November 18, 2012, Nintendo released a next generation high definition gaming platform, The Wii U, which includes TV remote control features in addition to IPTV streaming features like Netflix. The HD capabilities of the consoles has influenced some developers to port games from past consoles onto the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, often with remastered or upscaled graphics.\n\nHDTV can be recorded to D-VHS (Digital-VHS or Data-VHS), W-VHS (analog only), to an HDTV-capable digital video recorder (for example DirecTV's high-definition Digital video recorder, Sky HD's set-top box, Dish Network's VIP 622 or VIP 722 high-definition Digital video recorder receivers, or TiVo's Series 3 or HD recorders), or an HDTV-ready HTPC. Some cable boxes are capable of receiving or recording two or more broadcasts at a time in HDTV format, and HDTV programming, some included in the monthly cable service subscription price, some for an additional fee, can be played back with the cable company's on-demand feature.\n\nThe massive amount of data storage required to archive uncompressed streams meant that inexpensive uncompressed storage options were not available to the consumer.

She is noted for her critically acclaimed novels \"Brr\" (2005), \"Bhinna\" (2007) and \"Kuhoo\" (2011), as well as a non-fiction work \"Graffiti Wall\" (2009). She was the winner of the 2011 translation award conferred by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.\n\nMahajan was born in the city of Nanded in Maharashtra. She was the daughter of S.D. Mahajan, the ex-secretary of Marathi Vishwakosh and the grand daughter of the painter Tryambak Vasekar.\n\nMahajan wrote on themes of social emancipation and against discrimination. Mahajan's book \"'Brr\" is a collection of stories about women sarpanch and their experience after the Panchayati Raj system was implemented whilst she wrote \"Bhinna\" to describe the lives of those affected by HIV/AIDS. Both books bring out the politics of representation at three levels – one of the institutions like the Panchayats, the corruption in the non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and the intricacies of human relationships. Mahajan's work focuses on political, social, and economic matters rather than maternal or romantic considerations.\n\nMahajan's 2011 novel, \"Kuhoo\" (कुहू) dealt with the relationship between human and nature, and was marketed as a 'multimedia novel'. It came with a DVD containing sights and sounds from nature, including a few animations. She is also renowned for her poetry, including a collection entitled \"Dhulicha Awaz\". In the same year she published \"Rajai\", a collection of 17 short stories by Ismat Chughtai which she translated from Urdu into Marathi. She was awarded that year's translation prize by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, for this work.\n\nMahajan also authored children's literature and published a collection of short stories \"Joyanache Ranga\" (Marathi: जोयानाचे रंग) in 2011. This collection won her the Shashikalatai Agashe Award for Children's Literature in 2013.\n\nSpeaking in April 2016 at a programme organised by Dr. T.M.A. Pai Chair for Indian Literature at Manipal University, she said: “I am a woman and before that I am a human being. If all are human beings, why is there discrimination? That is a question, which has haunted me from my childhood.”\n\nMahajan died on 27 September 2018 of pneumonia at the Chellaram Diabetes Hospital. She was survived by her daughter.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "35024575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35024575", "title": "Linguistic landscape", "text": "Linguistic landscape\n\nLinguistic landscape is the \"visibility and salience of languages on public and commercial signs in a given territory or region\" (Landry and Bourhis 1997:23). Linguistic landscape has been described as being \"somewhere at the junction of sociolinguistics, sociology, social psychology, geography, and media studies\".\nIt is a concept used in sociolinguistics as scholars study how languages are visually used in multilingual societies, from large metropolitan centers to Amazonia. For example, some public signs in Jerusalem are in Hebrew, English, and Arabic (Spolsky and Cooper 1991, Ben-Rafael, Shohamy, Amara, and Trumper-Hecht 2006). \n\nStudies of the linguistic landscape have been published from research done around the world. The field of study is relatively recent; \"the linguistic landscapes paradigm has evolved rapidly and while it has a number of key names associated with it, it currently has no clear orthodoxy or theoretical core\" (Sebba 2010:73). A special issue of the \"International Journal of Multilingualism\" (3.1 in 2006) was devoted to the subject. Also, the journal \"World Englishes\" published a themed issue of five papers as a \"Symposium on World Englishes and Linguistic Landscapes: Five Perspectives\" (2012, vol. 31.1). Similarly, an entire issue of the \"International Journal of the Sociology of Language\" (228 in 2014) was devoted to the subject, including looking at signs that show influences from one language on another language. In 2015 an academic journal devoted to this topic was launched, titled \"Linguistic Landscape: An International Journal\", from John Benjamins. There is also a series of academic conferences on the study of linguistic landscape. A comprehensive, searchable Linguistic Landscape Bibliography is available. A 2016 special issue of Manusya (22, 2016) begins with a history and summary of the field.\n\nBecause \"the methodologies employed in the collection and categorisation of written signs is still controversial\", basic research questions are still being discussed, such as: \"do small, hand-made signs count as much as large, commercially made signs?\". The original technical scope of \"linguistic landscape\" involved plural languages, and almost all writers use it in that sense, but Papen has applied the term to the way public writing is used in a monolingual way in a German city and Heyd has applied the term to the ways that English is written, and people's reactions to these ways.\n\nThe languages used in public signs indicate what languages are locally relevant, or give evidence of what languages are becoming locally relevant (Hult 2009; Kasanga 2012). In many multilingual countries, multilingual signs and packaging are taken for granted, especially as merchants try to attract as many customers as possible or people realize that they serve a multilingual community (Hult, 2014). In other places, it is a matter of law, as in Quebec, where signs cannot be in English only, but must include French (Bill 101, \"Charte de la langue française\"). In Texas, some signs are required to be in English and Spanish, such as warning signs about consuming alcohol while pregnant.\nIn some cases, the signs themselves are multilingual signs, reflecting an expected multilingual readership. In other cases, there are monolingual signs in different languages, written in relevant languages found within a multilingual community. Backhaus even points out that some signs are not meant to be understood so much as to appeal to readers via a more prestigious language (2007:58).\nSome signs are spelled to convey the aura of another language (sometimes genuinely spelled as in the other language, other times fictionally), but are still meant to be understood by monolinguals. For example, some signs in English are spelled in a way that conveys the aura of German or French, but are still meant to be understood by monolingual English speakers.\n\nThe study of linguistic landscape also examines such patterns as which languages are used for which types of institutions (e.g. country club, hospital, ethnic grocery store), which languages are used for more expensive/cheaper items (new cars or used cars), or which languages are used for more expensive/cheaper services (e.g. pool cleaning or washing machine repair). Also, linguistic landscape can be studied across an area, to see which neighborhoods have signs in which languages. For example, Carr (2017) examined the languages of three cities in Southeast Los Angeles in her dissertation.\n\nLinguistic landscape can also be applied to the study of competing scripts for a single language. For example, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, some signs in Mongolia were erected in the traditional Mongolian script, not just Cyrillic (Grivelet 2001). Similarly, in some Cherokee speaking communities, street signs and other public signage is written with the Cherokee syllabary (Bender 2008). Also, license plates in Greek Cyprus have been printed with Greek or Roman letters in different eras.\nThe study of the linguistic landscape can also show evidence of the presence and roles of different languages through history. Some early work on a specific form of linguistic landscape was done in cemeteries used by immigrant communities, some languages being carved \"long after the language ceased to be spoken\" in the communities.\n\nIn addition to larger public signage, some who study linguistic landscapes are now including the study of other public objects with multilingual texts, such as banknotes in India which are labeled in over a dozen languages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27126857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27126857", "title": "Norm residue isomorphism theorem", "text": "Norm residue isomorphism theorem\n\nIn mathematics, the norm residue isomorphism theorem is a long-sought result relating Milnor \"K\"-theory and Galois cohomology. The result has a relatively elementary formulation and at the same time represents the key juncture in the proofs of many seemingly unrelated theorems from abstract algebra, theory of quadratic forms, algebraic K-theory and the theory of motives. The theorem asserts that a certain statement holds true for any prime formula_1 and any natural number formula_2. John Milnor speculated that this theorem might be true for formula_3 and all formula_2, and this question became known as Milnor's conjecture. The general case was conjectured by Spencer Bloch and Kazuya Kato and became known as the Bloch–Kato conjecture or the motivic Bloch–Kato conjecture to distinguish it from the Bloch–Kato conjecture on values of \"L\"-functions. The norm residue isomorphism theorem was proved by Vladimir Voevodsky using a number of highly innovative results of Markus Rost.\n\nFor any integer ℓ invertible in a field formula_5 there is a map\nformula_6\nwhere formula_7 denotes the Galois module of ℓ-th roots of unity in some separable closure of \"k\". It induces an isomorphism formula_8. The first hint that this is related to \"K\"-theory is that formula_9 is the group \"K\"(\"k\"). Taking the tensor products and applying the multiplicativity of étale cohomology yields an extension of the map formula_10 to maps:\nThese maps have the property that, for every element \"a\" in formula_12, formula_13 vanishes. This is the defining relation of Milnor \"K\"-theory. Specifically, Milnor \"K\"-theory is defined to be the graded parts of the ring:\nwhere formula_15 is the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group formula_9 and the quotient is by the two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form formula_17. Therefore the map formula_18 factors through a map:\nThis map is called the Galois symbol or norm residue map. Because étale cohomology with mod-ℓ coefficients is an ℓ-torsion group, this map additionally factors through formula_20.\n\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem (or Bloch–Kato conjecture) states that for a field \"k\" and an integer ℓ that is invertible in \"k\", the norm residue map\nfrom Milnor K-theory mod-ℓ to étale cohomology is an isomorphism. The case is the Milnor conjecture, and the case is the Merkurjev–Suslin theorem.\n\nThe étale cohomology of a field is identical to Galois cohomology, so the conjecture equates the ℓth cotorsion (the quotient by the subgroup of ℓ-divisible elements) of the Milnor \"K\"-group of a field \"k\" with the Galois cohomology of \"k\" with coefficients in the Galois module of ℓth roots of unity. The point of the conjecture is that there are properties that are easily seen for Milnor \"K\"-groups but not for Galois cohomology, and vice versa; the norm residue isomorphism theorem makes it possible to apply techniques applicable to the object on one side of the isomorphism to the object on the other side of the isomorphism.\n\nThe case when \"n\" is 0 is trivial, and the case when follows easily from Hilbert's Theorem 90. The case and was proved by . An important advance was the case and ℓ arbitrary. This case was proved by and is known as the Merkurjev–Suslin theorem. Later, Merkurjev and Suslin, and independently, Rost, proved the case and .\n\nThe name \"norm residue\" originally referred to the Hilbert symbol formula_22, which takes values in the Brauer group of \"k\" (when the field contains all ℓ-th roots of unity). Its usage here is in analogy with standard local class field theory and is expected to be part of an (as yet undeveloped) \"higher\" class field theory.\n\nThe norm residue isomorphism theorem implies the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture. It is equivalent to a theorem whose statement was once referred to as the Beilinson–Lichtenbaum conjecture.\n\nMilnor's conjecture was proved by Vladimir Voevodsky. \nLater Voevodsky proved the general Bloch–Kato conjecture.\n\nThe starting point for the proof is a series of conjectures due to and . They conjectured the existence of \"motivic complexes\", complexes of sheaves whose cohomology was related to motivic cohomology. Among the conjectural properties of these complexes were three properties: one connecting their Zariski cohomology to Milnor's K-theory, one connecting their etale cohomology to cohomology with coefficients in the sheaves of roots of unity and one connecting their Zariski cohomology to their etale cohomology. These three properties implied, as a very special case, that the norm residue map should be an isomorphism. The essential characteristic of the proof is that it uses the induction on the \"weight\" (which equals the dimension of the cohomology group in the conjecture) where the inductive step requires knowing not only the statement of Bloch-Kato conjecture but the much more general statement that contains a large part of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures. It often occurs in proofs by induction that the statement being proved has to be strengthened in order to prove the inductive step. In this case the strengthening that was needed required the development of a very large amount of new mathematics.\n\nThe earliest proof of Milnor's conjecture is contained in a 1995 preprint of Voevodsky and is inspired by the idea that there should be algebraic analogs of Morava \"K\"-theory (these algebraic Morava K-theories were later constructed by Simone Borghesi). In a 1996 preprint, Voevodsky was able to remove Morava \"K\"-theory from the picture by introducing instead algebraic cobordisms and using some of their properties that were not proved at that time (these properties were proved later). The constructions of 1995 and 1996 preprints are now known to be correct but the first completed proof of Milnor's conjecture used a somewhat different scheme.\n\nIt is also the scheme that the proof of the full Bloch–Kato conjecture follows. It was devised by Voevodsky a few months after the 1996 preprint appeared. Implementing this scheme required making substantial advances in the field of motivic homotopy theory as well as finding a way to build algebraic varieties with a specified list of properties. From the motivic homotopy theory the proof required the following:\n\nThe first two constructions were developed by Voevodsky by 2003. Combined with the results that had been known since late 1980s, they were sufficient to reprove the Milnor conjecture.\n\nAlso in 2003, Voevodsky published on the web a preprint that nearly contained a proof of the general theorem. It followed the original scheme but was missing the proofs of three statements. Two of these statements were related to the properties of the motivic Steenrod operations and required the third fact above, while the third one required then-unknown facts about \"norm varieties\". The properties that these varieties were required to have had been formulated by Voevodsky in 1997, and the varieties themselves had been constructed by Markus Rost in 1998–2003. The proof that they have the required properties was completed by Andrei Suslin and Seva Joukhovitski in 2006.\n\nThe third fact above required the development of new techniques in motivic homotopy theory. The goal was to prove that a functor, which was not assumed to commute with limits or colimits, preserved weak equivalences between objects of a certain form. One of the main difficulties there was that the standard approach to the study of weak equivalences is based on Bousfield–Quillen factorization systems and model category structures, and these were inadequate. Other methods had to be developed, and this work was completed by Voevodsky only in 2008.\n\nIn the course of developing these techniques, it became clear that the first statement used without proof in Voevodsky's 2003 preprint is false. The proof had to be modified slightly to accommodate the corrected form of that statement. While Voevodsky continued to work out the final details of the proofs of the main theorems about motivic Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, Charles Weibel invented an approach to correct the place in the proof that had to modified. Weibel also published in 2009 a paper that contained a summary of the Voevodsky's constructions combined with the correction that he discovered.\n\nLet \"X\" be a smooth variety over a field containing formula_23. Beilinson and Lichtenbaum conjectured that the motivic cohomology group formula_24 is isomorphic to the étale cohomology group formula_25 when \"p\"≤\"q\". This conjecture has now been proven, and is equivalent to the norm residue isomorphism theorem.\n\n"}

{"id": "6744873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6744873", "title": "Revival of the Hebrew language", "text": "Revival of the Hebrew language\n\nThe revival of the Hebrew language took place in Europe and Israel toward the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, through which the language's usage changed from the sacred language of Judaism to a spoken and written language used for daily life in Israel. The process began as a diversity of Jews started arriving and establishing themselves alongside the pre-existing Jewish community of Palestine in the first half of the nineteenth century, when veteran Jews in Palestine (largely Arabic-speaking by that time) and the linguistically diverse newly arrived Jews all switched to use Hebrew as a lingua franca, the historical linguistic common denominator of all the Jewish groups. At the same time, a parallel development in Europe changed Hebrew from primarily a sacred liturgical language into a literary language which played a key role in the development of nationalist educational programs. Modern Hebrew was one of three official languages of Mandatory Palestine, and after the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, one of two official languages of Israel, along with Modern Arabic. In July 2018, a made Hebrew the sole official language of the state of Israel, with Arabic having \"special status\". More than purely a linguistic process, the revival of Hebrew was utilized by Jewish modernization and political movements, and became a tenet of the ideology associated with settlement of the land, Zionism and Israeli policy.\n\nThe process of Hebrew's return to regular usage is unique; there are no other examples of a natural language without any native speakers subsequently acquiring several million native speakers, and no other examples of a sacred language becoming a national language with millions of \"first language\" speakers.\n\nThe language's revival eventually brought linguistic additions with it. While the initial leaders of the process insisted they were only continuing \"from the place where Hebrew's vitality was ended\", what was created represented a broader basis of language acceptance; it includes characteristics derived from all periods of Hebrew language, as well as from the non-Hebrew languages used by the long-established European, North African, and Middle Eastern Jewish communities, with Yiddish (the European variant) being predominant.\n\nHistorical records testify to the existence of Hebrew from the 10th century BCE to the late Second Temple period (lasting to c. 70 CE), after which the language developed into Mishnaic Hebrew. (From about the 6th century BCE until the Middle Ages, many Jews spoke a related Semitic language, Aramaic.) From the 2nd century CE until the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language \"circa\" 1880, Hebrew served as a literary and official language and as the Judaic language of prayer. After the spoken usage of Mishnaic Hebrew ended in the 2nd century CE, Hebrew had not been spoken as a mother tongue.\n\nEven so, during the Middle Ages, Jews used the language in a wide variety of disciplines. This usage kept alive a substantial portion of the traits characteristic of Hebrew. First and foremost, Classical Hebrew was preserved in full through well-recognized sources, chiefly the Tanakh (especially those portions used liturgically like the Torah, Haftarot, Megilot, and the Book of Psalms) and the Mishnah. Apart from these, Hebrew was known through hymns, prayers, midrashim, and the like.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Hebrew continued in use as a written language in Rabbinical literature, including in judgments of Halakha, Responsa, and books of meditation. In most cases, certainly in the base of Hebrew's revival, 18th- and 19th-century Europe, the use of Hebrew was not at all natural, but heavy in flowery language and quotations, non-grammatical forms, and mixing-in of other languages, especially Aramaic.\n\nHebrew was used not only in written form but also as an articulated language, in synagogues and in batei midrash. Thus, Hebrew phonology and the pronunciation of vowels and consonants were preserved. Despite this, regional influences of other languages caused many changes, leading to the development of different forms of pronunciation:\n\nWithin each of these groups, there also existed different subsets of pronunciation. For example, differences existed between the Hebrew used by Polish Jewry and that of Lithuanian Jewry and of German Jewry.\n\nIn the fifty years preceding the start of the revival process, a version of spoken Hebrew already existed in the markets of Jerusalem. The Sephardic Jews who spoke Ladino or Arabic and the Ashkenazi Jews who spoke Yiddish needed a common language for commercial purposes. The most obvious choice was Hebrew. Although Hebrew was spoken in this case, it was not a native mother tongue, but more of a pidgin.\n\nThe linguistic situation against which background the revival process occurred was one of diglossia, when two languages—one of prestige and class and another of the masses—exist within one culture. In Europe, this phenomenon has waned, starting with English in the 16th century, but there were still differences between spoken street language and written language. Among the Jews of Europe, the situation resembled that of the general population, but with:\n\nIn the Arab Middle East, Ladino and Colloquial Arabic were the spoken languages most prevalent in Jewish communities (with Ladino more prevalent in the Mediterranean and Arabic, Aramaic, Kurdish, and Persian more widely spoken by Jews in the East), while Classical Arabic was used for secular writing, and Hebrew used for religious purposes (though some Jewish scholars from the Arab world, such as Maimonedes (1135-1204), wrote primarily in Arabic or in Judeo-Arabic languages).\n\nThe revival of the Hebrew language in practice advanced in two parallel strains: The revival of written-literary Hebrew and the revival of spoken Hebrew. In the first few decades, the two processes were not connected to one another and even occurred in different places: Literary Hebrew was renewed in Europe's cities, whereas spoken Hebrew developed mainly in Palestine. The two movements began to merge only in the beginning of the 1900s, and an important point in this process was the immigration of Haim Nahman Bialik to Palestine in 1924. But after the transfer of literary Hebrew to Palestine, a substantial difference between spoken and written Hebrew remained, and this difference persists today. The characteristics of spoken Hebrew only began to seep into literature in the 1940s, and only in the 1990s did spoken Hebrew start widely appearing in novels.\n\nA preceding process to the revival of literary Hebrew took place during the Haskalah, the Jewish movement paralleling the secular Enlightenment. Members of this movement, called \"maskilim\" (משכילים), who sought to distance themselves from Rabbinic Judaism, decided that Hebrew, specifically Biblical Hebrew, was deserving of fine literature. They considered Mishnaic Hebrew and other varieties of Hebrew to be defective and unfit for writing. The Haskalah-era literature written in Hebrew based itself upon two central principles: Purism and flowery language. Purism was a principle which dictated that all words used should be of biblical origin (even if the meaning was not biblical). The principle of flowery language was based on bringing full verses and expressions as they were from the Tanakh, and the more flowery a verse was, the more quality it was said to possess. Another linguistic trait thought to increase a text's prestige was the use of hapax legomena, words appearing only once in the text.\n\nBut while it was easy to write stories taking place in the biblical period and dealing with biblical topics, Haskalah-era writers began to find it more and more difficult to write about contemporary topics. This was due mostly to the lack of a broad and modern vocabulary, meaning translating books about science and mathematics or European literature was difficult. Although an earlier, little known attempt at scientific writing was made when Israel Wolf Sperling translated Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Journey to the Center of the Earth in 1877 and 1878, this barrier was breached with more lasting effect in the 1880s by a writer named Mendele Mocher Sfarim.\n\nAnother difficulty faced by Haskalah Hebrew writers was that the audience was exclusively male with profound study background, which meant that women and the less educated men were pushed against reading Hebrew by reading Yiddish literature, which led a number of writers to write in Yiddish to find audiences.\n\nYa'akov Abramovitch (1846-1917), is often known by the name of his main character, \"Mendele Mocher Sfarim\" (מוכר ספרים), meaning \"bookseller.\" He began writing in Hebrew as a Haskalah writer and wrote according to all the conventions of Haskalah-era literature. At a certain point, he decided to write in Yiddish and caused a linguistic revolution, which was expressed in the widespread usage of Yiddish in Hebrew literature. After a long break he returned in 1886 to writing in Hebrew, but decided to ignore the rules of biblical Hebrew, and proponents of that style, like Abraham Mapu, and added into the vocabulary a host of words from the Rabbinic Age and the Middle Ages. His new fluid and varied style of Hebrew writing reflected the Yiddish spoken around him, while still retaining all the historical strata of Hebrew.\n\nMendele's language was considered a synthetic one, as it consisted of different echelons of Hebrew development and was not a direct continuation of a particular echelon. However, today, his language is often considered a continuation of Rabbinic Hebrew, especially grammatically. He was considered as the representative figure who provided great literatures to whichever language he was associated with.\n\nDevorah Baron (also spelled Dvora Baron and Deborah Baron) (December 4, 1887 - August 20, 1956), was a Hebrew writer who fascinated the readers by her uniqueness of the language in Eastern Europe, which was dominant by Yiddish speakers. Her early writings mostly involve the feminine Yiddish traditions, and she worked on more feminist topics in her later writings. The topics were mostly divided into two sort:(1) the marginalization of female in the religious and family life;(2) the tension between men and women, and between generation to generation.\n\nSee also Robert Alter, and his book \"The Invention of Hebrew Prose\", who has done significant work on modern Hebrew literature and the context which enabled the language to revive itself via creative writing. The book has a large section on Abramovitch. Yael S. Feldman also gives a short overview of Mendele and his milieu in her book \"Modernism and Cultural Transfer\". She notes the influence of Yiddish on his Hebrew, and traces this language interaction to Gabriel Preil, the last Haskalah poet of America.\n\nEventually, writers like Yosef Haim Brenner would break from Mendele's style, and utilize more experimental techniques.\n\nMendele's style was excitedly adopted by contemporary writers and spread quickly. It was also expanded into additional fields: Ahad Ha'am wrote an article in 1889 using the style entitled \"This is not the Way,\" and Haim Nahman Bialik expanded it into poetry with his poem \"To the Bird\" of the same year. Additionally, great efforts were taken to write scientific books in Hebrew, for which the vocabulary of scientific and technical terms was greatly increased. At the same time, Europe saw the rise of Hebrew language newspapers and magazines, while even sessions and discussions of Zionist groups were conducted and transcribed in Hebrew. In addition, poets and writers such as David Frischmann and Sha'ul Tschernichovsky began avidly translating European works into Hebrew, from the Finnish epic the Kalevala to works by Molière, Goethe, Shakespeare, Homer, Byron, Lermontov, and Aeschylus. At the same time, writers like Micah Yosef Berdichevsky and Uri-Nissan Gnessin began to write complex works of short fiction and novels in Hebrew, using the language to express psychological realism and interiority for the first time. As Hebrew poets and writers began arriving in Palestine armed with the new literary language, they exerted a certain amount of influence on the development of spoken Hebrew as well.\n\nJewish communities with different colloquial languages had used Hebrew to communicate with each other across Europe and the Near East since the Middle Ages. As Jews in Palestine spoke a variety of languages such as Arabic, Ladino, Yiddish, and French, inter-communal affairs that required verbal communication were handled in a modified form of Medieval Hebrew. Hebrew was used by Jews from different linguistic backgrounds in marketplaces in Jerusalem since at least the early 19th century.\n\nEliezer Ben-Yehuda (1858–1922) (אליעזר בן יהודה), is often regarded as the \"reviver of the Hebrew language\" (\"מחיה השפה העברית\"), yet his major contributions were ideological and symbolic; he was the first to raise the concept of reviving Hebrew, to publish articles in newspapers on the topic, and he took part in the project known as the Ben-Yehuda Dictionary. However, what finally brought about the revitalization of Hebrew were not Ben-Yehuda's activities in Jerusalem (at least for the most part), but developments in the settlements of the First Aliyah and the Second Aliyah. The first Hebrew schools were established in these settlements, Hebrew increasingly became a spoken language of daily affairs, and finally became a systematic and national language. Yet Ben-Yehuda's fame and notoriety stems from his initiation and symbolic leadership of the Hebrew revival.\n\nBen-Yehuda's main innovation in the revival of the Hebrew language lies in his having \"invented\" many new words to denote objects unknown in Jewish antiquity, or which had long been forgotten in their original Hebrew usage and context. He invented words such as \"ḥatzil\" (חציל) for an eggplant (aubergine) and \"ḥashmal\" (חשמל) for electricity. As no Hebrew equivalent could be found for the names of certain produce endemic to the New World, they devised new Hebrew words for maize and tomato, calling them \"tiras\" (תירס) and \"ʿagbaniyyah\" (עגבניה), respectively. The latter word is derived from the shape of the vegetable, which resembled a buttocks (ʿagaḇīm). Sometimes, old Hebrew words took on different meanings altogether. For example, the Hebrew word \"kǝvīš\" (כביש), which now denotes a \"street\" or a \"road,\" is actually an Aramaic adjective meaning \"trodden down; blazoned\", rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe \"a \"blazoned\" trail.\" In what most rabbis view as an error, Ben-Yehuda is accredited with introducing the new Hebrew word \"ribah\" (ריבה) for \"confiture; marmalade\", believing it to be derived from the lexical root \"reḇaḇ\", and related to the Arabic word \"murabba\" (jam; fruit conserves; marmalade). He also invented the word \"tapuz\" (תפוז) for the citrus fruit orange, which is a combination of \"tapuaḥ\" (apple) + \"zahav\" (golden), or \"golden apple.\"\n\nThe revival of spoken Hebrew can be separated into three stages, which are concurrent with (1) the First Aliyah, (2) the Second Aliyah, and (3) the British Mandate period. In the first period, the activity centered on Hebrew schools in the Settlements and in the Pure Language Society; in the second period, Hebrew was used in assembly meetings and public activities; and in the third period, it became the language used by the Yishuv, the Jewish population during the Mandate Period, for general purposes. At this stage, Hebrew possessed both spoken and written forms, and its importance was reflected in the official status of Hebrew during the British Mandate. All of the stages were characterized by the establishment of many organizations that took an active and ideological part in Hebrew activities. This resulted in the establishment of Hebrew high schools (גימנסיות), the Hebrew University, the Jewish Legion, the Histadrut labor organization, and in Tel Aviv – the first Hebrew city.\n\nThroughout all periods, Hebrew signified for both its proponents and detractors the antithesis of Yiddish. Against the exilic Yiddish language stood revived Hebrew, the language of Zionism, of grassroots pioneers, and above all, of the transformation of the Jews into a Hebrew nation with its own land. Yiddish was degradingly referred to as a jargon, and its speakers encountered harsh opposition, which finally led to a Language War between Yiddish and Hebrew.\n\nNonetheless, Ghil'ad Zuckermann believes that \"Yiddish is a primary contributor to Israeli Hebrew because it was the mother tongue of the vast majority of language revivalists and first pioneers in Eretz Yisrael at the crucial period of the beginning of Israeli Hebrew\". According to Zuckermann, although the revivalists wished to speak Hebrew with Semitic grammar and pronunciation, they could not avoid the Ashkenazi mindset arising from their European background. He argues that their attempt to deny their European roots, negate diasporism and avoid hybridity (as reflected in Yiddish) failed. \"Had the language revivalists been Arabic-speaking Jews (e.g. from Morocco), Israeli Hebrew would have been a totally different language – both genetically and typologically, much more Semitic. The impact of the founder population on Israeli Hebrew is incomparable with that of later immigrants.\"\n\nWith the rise of Jewish nationalism in 19th-century Europe, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda was captivated by the innovative ideas of Zionism. At that time, it was believed that one of the criteria needed to define a nation worthy of national rights was its use of a common language spoken by both the society and the individual. On 13 October 1881, while in Paris, Ben-Yehuda began speaking Hebrew with friends in what is believed to be the first modern conversation using the language. Later that year, he made aliyah and came to live in Jerusalem.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Ben-Yehuda tried to garner support for the idea of speaking Hebrew. He determined that his family would only speak Hebrew, and raised his children to be native Hebrew speakers. His first child, a son named Itamar Ben-Avi, who was born in Jerusalem on 31 July 1882, became the first native speaker of Modern Hebrew. Ben-Yehuda attempted to convince other families to do so as well, founded associations for speaking Hebrew, began publishing the Hebrew newspaper \"HaZvi\", and for a short while taught at Hebrew schools, for the first time making use of the method of \"Hebrew in Hebrew.\" In 1889, there were plays in Hebrew and schools teaching children to speak Hebrew. Ben-Yehuda's efforts to persuade Jewish families to use only Hebrew in daily life at home met very limited success. According to Ben-Yehuda, ten years after his immigration to Palestine, there were only four families in Jerusalem that used Hebrew exclusively. According to the \"Hashkafa\" newspaper, there were ten such families in 1900.\n\nOn the other hand, during the Ottoman era, widespread activity began in the \"moshavot\", or agricultural settlements, of the First Aliyah, which was concentrated in the Hebrew schools. A Hebrew boarding school was established by Aryeh Leib Frumkin in 1884, where religious studies were conducted in Hebrew and students spoke Hebrew with their teachers and among themselves. In 1886, a Hebrew school was established in the Jewish settlement of Rishon LeZion, where a part of the classes were taught in Hebrew. From the 1880s onward, schools in the agricultural settlements gradually began teaching general subjects in Hebrew. In 1889, Israel Belkind opened a school in Jaffa which taught Hebrew and used it as the primary language of instruction. It survived for three years. The Literature Council, which was based on the Pure Language Society, in 1890, to experiment in the municipal and rural schools, showed the possibility to make Hebrew the only language in the settlement. At this point, progress was slow, and it encountered many difficulties: parents were opposed to their children learning in an impractical language, useless in higher education; the four-year schools for farmers' children were not of a high caliber; and a great lack of linguistic means for teaching Hebrew plus the lack of words to describe day-to-day activities, not to mention the absence of Hebrew schoolbooks. Added to these, there was no agreement on which accent to use, as some teachers taught Ashkenazi Hebrew while others taught Sephardi Hebrew.\n\nIn 1889, Ben-Yehuda, together with rabbis Yaakov Meir and Chaim Hirschensohn and educator Chaim Kalmi, founded the Clear Language Society, with the goal of teaching Hebrew. The company taught Hebrew and encouraged Hebrew education in schools, heders, and yeshivas. Initially, it hired Hebrew-speaking women to teach Jewish women and girls spoken and written Hebrew. In 1890, the company established the Hebrew Language Committee, which coined new Hebrew words for everyday use and for a wide variety of modern uses and encouraged the use of grammatically correct Hebrew. Although the organization collapsed in 1891, the Hebrew Language Committee continued to function. It published books, dictionaries, bulletins, and periodicals, inventing thousands of new words. The Hebrew Language Committee continued to function until 1953, when it was succeeded by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.\n\nA Hebrew boys' school opened in Jaffa in 1893, followed by a Hebrew girls' school. Although some subjects were taught in French, Hebrew was the primary language of instruction. Over the next decade, the girls' school became a major center of Hebrew education and activism. In 1898, the first Hebrew kindergarten opened in Rishon LeZion. It was followed by a second one in Jerusalem in 1903.\n\nIn 1903, the Union of Hebrew Teachers was founded, and sixty educators participated in its inaugural assembly. Though not extremely impressive from a quantitative viewpoint, the Hebrew school program did create a nucleus of a few hundred fluent Hebrew speakers and proved that Hebrew could be used in the day-to-day context.\n\nAs the Second Aliyah began, Hebrew usage began to break out of the family and school framework into the public venue. Motivated by an ideology of rejecting the Diaspora and its Yiddish culture, the members of the Second Aliyah, established relatively closed-off social cells of young people with a common world view. In these social cells – mostly in the moshavot – Hebrew was used in all public assemblages. Though not spoken in all homes and private settings yet, Hebrew had secured its place as the exclusive language of assemblies, conferences, and discussions. Educated Second Aliyah members already were familiar with the literary Hebrew that had developed in Europe, and they identified with the notion that Hebrew could serve as an impetus for the national existence for the Jewish people in Israel. This group was joined by the aforementioned graduates of Hebrew schools, who had already begun to raise native-born speakers of Hebrew in their families. During this period, the World Zionist Congress also adopted Hebrew as its official language.\n\nHebrew education continued to expand, as more and more Hebrew educational institutions came about. The number of Hebrew kindergartens continued to grow. In 1905, Yehuda Leib and Fania Matman-Cohen, a couple of educators, began teaching the first high school classes in Hebrew in their apartment in Jaffa. Hebrew teachers recreated the Hebrew Language Committee, which began to determine uniform linguistic rules, as opposed to the disjointed ones which had arisen previously. The Council declared as its mission \"to prepare the Hebrew language for use as a spoken language in all affairs of life,\" formulated rules of pronunciation and grammar, and offered new words for use in schools and by the general public. The widespread production of Hebrew schoolbooks also began, and Mother Goose-style rhymes were written for children. During the first decade of 20th century, Epstein's and Wilkomitz's Hebrew education, which restricted the children from speaking Yiddish not only in school, but also at home and on the street, made progress toward wider use of Hebrew. The first native speakers of Hebrew, who had mainly learned it in the Hebrew schools of the First Aliyah period and came to speak it as their primary language, reached adulthood during this time. Aside from rare exceptions who had been born prior such as Itamar Ben-Avi, the first generation of children who acquired Modern Hebrew as native speakers at home from their parents rather than mainly learning it at school were born during this decade, to parents who had attended the Hebrew schools of the First Aliyah period. In addition, many of the Jewish immigrants during this period had reasonable Hebrew reading proficiency acquired from their education prior to arriving in the country. Most still learned it as a second language. Due to the growth of the number of native speakers and proficiency among second language speakers, the Hebrew press was able to grow. During this period, it greatly increased in popularity and circulation. In 1912, it was observed that there was hardly a young Jew in the country who could not read a Hebrew newspaper.\n\nIn 1909, the first Hebrew city, Tel Aviv, was established. In its streets and in cafes, Hebrew was already widely spoken. The entire administration of the city was carried out in Hebrew, and new \"olim\" or those not yet speaking Hebrew were forced to speak in Hebrew. Street signs and public announcements were written in Hebrew. A new building for the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, a continuation of the first Hebrew high school established by the Matman-Cohen's, was built in the city that same year. \n\nThe pinnacle of Hebrew's development during this period came in 1913, in the so-called \"War of the Languages:\" The Company for Aiding German Jews, then planning the establishment of a school for engineers (first known as the Technikum and for which construction had begun in 1912), insisted that German should be its language of instruction, arguing among other things that German possessed an extensive scientific and technical vocabulary while a parallel vocabulary drawn from Hebrew would need to be created from scratch, often using calques or translations of terms anyway. Substantial unanimity of opinion in the Yishuv ran against this proposal, which was defeated, leading to the founding of Israel's foremost institute of technology, the Technion, with a curriculum taught in Hebrew. This incident is seen as a watershed marking the transformation of Hebrew into the official language of the Yishuv.\n\nResearchers studying the Google Books database noted a fivefold increase in the rate of appearance of new words in printed Hebrew between books published in 1915 and 1920, which they credit to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and the Second Aliyah.\n\nAs a greater number of children passed through Hebrew language schools, the number of people who spoke Hebrew as their first language grew. As the number of people whose primary language was Hebrew increased, so did demand for Hebrew reading materials and entertainment such as books, newspapers, and plays. By 1916-1918, about 34,000 Jews in Palestine recorded Hebrew as their native language.\n\nAfter World War I, it was legislated by the Mandate over Palestine that English, Hebrew, and Arabic would be the official spoken language of Palestine. As the Jewish community in Palestine, or Yishuv grew, the immigrants arriving from the diaspora did not speak Hebrew as a mother tongue, and learned it as a second language either prior to their immigration or in Palestine, while their children picked up Hebrew as their native language. At this time, the use of Hebrew as the \"lingua franca\" of the Yishuv was already a\" fait accompli\", and the revival process was no longer a process of creation, but a process of expansion. In Tel Aviv, the Legion of the Defenders of the Language was established, which worked to enforce Hebrew use. Jews who were overheard speaking other languages on the street were admonished: \"Jew, speak Hebrew\" (Yehudi, daber ivrit/יהודי, דבר עברית), or, more alliteratively, \"Hebrew [man], speak Hebrew\" (Ivri, daber ivrit/עברי, דבר עברית) was a campaign initiated by Ben-Yehuda's son, Itamar Ben-Avi.\n\nThe Academy of Hebrew Language focused on the structure and the spelling of Hebrew, and prompted the issues about the further expansion of the use of Hebrew in Mandatory Palestine. The Academy worked with the Language College to publish the Ben-Sira in a scientific form.\n\nBy the time Israel gained independence in 1948, 80.9% of Jews who had been born in Palestine spoke Hebrew as their only language in daily life, and another 14.2% of Palestine-born Jews used it as a first among two or more languages. The small minority Jews who had been born in Palestine but did not use Hebrew as their first language had mainly grown up before the development of the Hebrew school system.\nFollowing Israeli independence, large waves of Jewish refugees came from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. The Israeli population increased significantly, doubling within a short period of time. These immigrants spoke a variety of languages, and had to be taught Hebrew. While immigrant children were expected to learn Hebrew through school, much effort was put into ensuring adults would learn the language. The institution of the ulpan, or intensive Hebrew-language school, was established to teach immigrants basic Hebrew language skills, and an ulpan course became a major feature of the experience of immigrating to Israel. Young adult immigrants picked up much of their Hebrew through mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces, which aimed to teach soldiers Hebrew so they could function in the military and post-military civilian life. During the 1950s, Hebrew was taught in most military bases by recruited teachers and female soldiers. A 1952 order demanded that soldiers be taught Hebrew until they could converse freely on everyday matters, write a letter to their commander, understand a basic lecture, and read a vowelized newspaper. Soldiers also absorbed Hebrew through their regular service. Soldiers who were about to finish their service without a grasp of Hebrew deemed sufficient were sent to a special Hebrew school founded by the army for the last three months of their service. Immigrants from Arab countries tended to pick up Hebrew faster than European immigrants.\n\nIn daily life, immigrants largely limited their use of Hebrew to when they needed to, most often in their working lives, and to a somewhat lesser extent to satisfy cultural needs. They tended to use their native languages more when socializing and interacting with family. In 1954, about 60% of the population reported the use of more than one language. The children of these immigrants tended to pick up Hebrew as their first language, while their parents' native languages were either used as second languages or lost to them altogether. The Israeli Arab minority also began learning Hebrew, as Hebrew lessons were introduced into Arab schools.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31210777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31210777", "title": "Seligman Baer", "text": "Seligman Baer\n\nSeligman (Isaac) Baer was a masoretic scholar, and an editor of the Hebrew Bible and of the Jewish liturgy. He was born in Mosbach, the northern district of Biebrich, Sept. 18, 1825 and died at Biebrich-on-the-Rhine, March, 1897.\n\nBaer commenced his Masoretic studies as early as 1844. He belonged to the school of Wolf Heidenheim, and had in his possession some of Heidenheim's original manuscripts and personal copies of his published works with handwritten marginal notes. Few scholars in the nineteenth century had so intimate an acquaintance with all the details of the Masorah as had Baer, and it was largely due to him that the study of this branch of Hebrew philology was brought to the notice of Biblical critics. His friendship with Franz Delitzsch, who stood sponsor for much of his work, aided him in making known to the world the results of his studies.\n\nBaer's monumental edition of the Jewish prayerbook according to the Ashkenazic rite, \"Seder Avodat Yisrael\" (Rödelheim, 1868), accompanied by a critical commentary, became the authoritative model for numerous editions published subsequently in the 20th century. His editions of the Jewish liturgy also include Kinnot for the fast of the ninth of Av.\n\nHe never occupied an academic position, but was content with the office of Hebrew teacher to the Jewish community of Biebrich. In recognition of his services to the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him by the University of Leipsic. His edition of the Masoretic Bible was published in cooperation with Delitzsch.\n\nBaer's collaboration with Delitzsch began with an edition of the Psalms in 1861 (Leipsic, Doerfling und Franke). A second edition was published a few years later (Leipsic, Brockhaus).\n\nIn the meantime, Baer had conceived the plan of editing anew the books of the entire Hebrew Bible, strictly following the Masoretic tradition. The volumes, with a Latin preface by Delitzsch, appeared (Leipsic, Tauchnitz) in the following order: Genesis, 1869; Isaiah, 1872; Job, 1875; Minor Prophets, 1878; Psalms (together with a treatise \"Elementa Accentuationis Metricæ\"), 1880; Proverbs (together with \"De Primorum Vocabulorum Dagessatione\"), 1880; Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah (together with \"Chaldaismi Biblici Adumbratio\" and a treatise by Friedrich Delitzsch on the Babylonian proper names in these books), were published in 1882; Ezekiel (with \"Specimen Glossarii Ezechielico-Babylonici\" by Friedrich Delitzsch), appeared in 1884; followed by the five Megillot, 1886; the book of Chronicles, 1888; Jeremiah, 1890; Joshua and Judges, 1891; and finally Kings, 1895. The last two were edited by Baer alone, Delitzsch having died in 1890.\n\nDeath prevented Baer from finishing the series. Attached to each volume were a number of Masoretic notes taken from the best editions and manuscripts, variant readings between the Occidentals and Orientals, between Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, and various other Masoretic lists and enumerations.\n\nIn general, Baer's text has been accepted as representing the Masoretic tradition; even though exception may be taken to his view on individual points or to his too extensive generalization from insufficient manuscript evidence. Christian David Ginsburg, in his introduction to his Masoretic Bible (London, 1897), has criticized a number of these faults with some severity. He points out, among other things, that Baer has indicated the open and closed sections in the Prophets and the Hagiographa, a thing not usually done in Masoretic manuscripts (pp. 10 et seq.); that he has introduced a number of anti-Masoretic pauses (p. 29); that his division of the Sedarim is faulty (p. 41); that he has introduced the dagesh into the first letter of words when the preceding word ends with the same letter (p. 117), as well as the dagesh which follows upon a guttural with silent shewa and a ḥatef-pataḥ under the first of two similar letters (pp. 466, 662), all of which are not warranted by the best manuscripts. The Masoretic notes at the end of Baer's edition are also criticized (p. 92), especially the lists of various readings. Further, the Aramaic paradigms attached to the edition of Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah have also been the subject of criticism on the part of Kautzsch (\"Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen,\" p. 23). Many of these faults were due to Baer's inability to consult manuscripts in the large European collections.\n\nOf Baer's separate treatises dealing with the \"mesorah\" may be mentioned:\n\nFor his edition of Aaron ben Moses ben Asher's \"Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim\", Baer made a complete handwritten copy of the masoretic treatises and lists in the Aleppo codex in their entirety, as found in the pages that preceded and followed the biblical text. Some of the material from his copy was adapted and published within \"Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim\", and the entire copy survived in Baer's personal archive (now found in the Ginsburg collection at the Russian National Library, Moscow). Since the masoretic treatises of the Aleppo codex are now missing, Baer's personal copy allows for a nearly complete reconstruction of the lost material.\n\nWhat Baer did for the Hebrew Bible, he also tried to do for the Jewish prayerbook. His \"Seder Avodat Yisrael\" (\"Ritual of Israel's Service\"; Rödelheim, 1868), is accompanied by a literary and philological commentary called \"Yakhin Lashon\" (\"Preparatory Study of Language\"), which has made the work a standard authority and a model for subsequent Ashkenazic prayerbooks throughout the 20th century and to the present day. Attached to it is the text of the Psalms, accurately vocalized and accented.\n\nAmong Baer's other works may be mentioned:\n\nDuring the latter part of his life, Baer ventured into the field of history, and translated for the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany the Hebrew accounts of the persecutions at the time of the Crusades (\"Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland,\" ii., Berlin, 1892). The venture was not successful, as Brann has shown in \"Monatsschrift,\" xxxvii. 196 et seq., 286 et seq.\n\n\n"}

Terminology may differ from place to place. Most words are common to other Slavic languages, though some derive from Turkish. The standardized languages may recognize slightly different pronunciations or dialectical forms; all terms are considered standard in all four languages, unless otherwise marked: (Bosnian), (Croatian), (Montenegrin) and (Serbian) below.\n\nThere are four main types of kinship in the family: biological blood kinship, kinship by law (in-laws), spiritual kinship (such as godparents), and legal kinship through adoption and remarriage.\n\nAs is common in many rural family structures, three generations of a family will live together in a home in what anthropologists call a joint family structure, where parents, their son(s), and grandchildren would cohabit in a family home.\n\nWords for relations up to five generations removed—great-great-grandparents and great-great-grandchildren—are in common use. The fourth-generation terms are also used as generics for ancestors and descendants. There is no distinction between the maternal and paternal line. In addition there are terms found in Serbian for ancestors past the 5th generation, but those are not in common use.\n\nDiminutive forms of siblings are used for cousins.\n\nThere are separate terms for maternal and paternal uncles, but not for aunts.

{"id": "17630922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17630922", "title": "Singaporean Hokkien", "text": "Singaporean Hokkien\n\nSingaporean Hokkien (; Tâi-lô: \"Sin-ka-pho Hok-kiàn-uē\") is a local variant of the Hokkien language spoken in Singapore. In Chinese academic circles, this dialect is known as Singaporean Ban-lam Gu (新加坡閩南語, \"Sin-ka-pho Bân-lâm-gu\"). It is closely related to the Southern Malaysian Hokkien (南马福建话) spoken in Southern Malaysia, as well as to Riau Hokkien (廖内福建话) spoken in the Indonesian province of Riau. It also closely resembles Amoy (厦门话) spoken in Amoy, China, and Taiwanese Hokkien (台灣閩南語/台語/台灣話) which is spoken in Taiwan.\n\nHokkien, is the Min Nan pronunciation for Fujian province, China, and is generally the term used by the Chinese in South-East Asia to refer to the Banlam dialect (闽南语). Singaporean Hokkien generally uses Amoy as its standard, and its accent is predominantly based on a mixture of Quanzhou (泉州话) and Zhangzhou (漳州话) speech, with a greater inclination towards the former.\n\nLike many spoken languages in Singapore, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced by other languages or dialects spoken in Singapore. For instance, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced to a certain degree by Teochew, and is sometimes regarded as a combined Hokkien-Teochew speech (福潮话). In addition, it has many loanwords from Malay and English.\n\nNevertheless, the grammar and tones of Singaporean Hokkien are still largely based on Minnan. When compared to Taiwanese's prestige accent (台语优势腔) spoken in Tainan (台南) and Kaohsiung (高雄), Singaporean Hokkien pronunciation inclines toward the Quanzhou accent (泉州腔), is also close to the pronunciation of Taipei and Amoy, and is less close to that of Tainan which has a greater inclination towards the Zhangzhou accent (漳州腔).\n\nA Singaporean would likely not have trouble conversing with Taiwanese speakers in Singaporean Hokkien, with the exception of some Japanese loanwords. Similarly, Singaporean Hokkien is understood by Taiwanese speakers, with the exception of some Malay and English loanwords.\n\nFrom the 19th until the early half of the 20th century, there was a large influx of Chinese migrants from southern China into Singapore. This led to Chinese constituting almost 75% of Singapore's population. Of these Chinese, many originated from the regions of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in Fujian province. They brought Min Nan to Singapore, which was then propagated throughout Singapore and Malaysia. As there was no formal Chinese name for Min Nan in the early 20th century, these migrants began to use their place of origin as the name of their speech, and thus called the dialect \"Hokkien\" (福建) (which means \"Fujian\" province).\n\nDuring the 19th century, many traditional private Chinese schools in Singapore (known as \"su-sio̍k-á\", 私塾仔) generally used Hokkien to teach Chinese classics and Classical Chinese. But by the early 20th century, Mandarin began to replace Hokkien as the medium of instructions in Chinese schools after the founding of many Mandarin-medium schools.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, many political speeches in Singapore were in Hokkien, in order to reach out to the Chinese community in Singapore. There was also a thriving Hokkien cultural scene that included Hokkien story-telling, opera, and media in Singapore. \n\nAfter 1979, the Singapore government began to push for the use of Mandarin in Singapore, spearheaded by the Speak Mandarin Campaign. Following this, the Singapore government also began to employ a more stringent censorship, or ban, of Hokkien media in the Singaporean Chinese media. Consequently, all Hokkien-language media in Singapore had to be dubbed in Mandarin before being allowed to stream on national TV. In addition, the 1980s saw Chinese-medium education replaced by that in English, causing English to emerge as the most widely used language in Singapore. The emergence of the English language, coupled with heavy promotion of Mandarin, generally led Hokkien to decline in Singapore after 1979.\n\nToday, the lingua franca of the Chinese Community in Singapore is Mandarin. Although Hokkien is still spoken in Singapore today, particularly by the elderly Chinese population, it is not as widespread as before. The most common places to hear or speak Hokkien in Singapore are the Hawker centre or Kopi tiam.\n\nSpeaking ability varies amongst the different age groups of the Hokkien Singaporeans. The elderly are generally able to communicate effectively in Hokkien. On the other hand, the middle and younger generations have generally lost the ability to communicate as fluently. With the \"Mandarin campaign\" from the government, the Hokkien speaking population has declined greatly.\n\nThere is, however, a minority group of Hokkien Singaporeans and Taiwanese living in Singapore working to help preserve, spread and revive the use of Hokkien Chinese in Singapore.\n\nThe ease of access to online Hokkien entertainment media and pop music from Taiwan helps to connect to the language and culture. Many Singaporeans are increasingly using online and social media platforms, such as Facebook and Meetup groups, to learn, discuss, meet, and interact with each other in Hokkien.\n\nSome of the groups include:\n\nFacebook Singapore Hokkien Language and Culture Society: Discussion forum on all aspects of Hokkien Chinese, with a primary focus on the Singaporean Hokkien dialect and its variations from other forms of Hokkien.\n\nFacebook Singapore Hokkien Meetup: Group that organizes regular meetups for language practice. It also organizes free language courses and sharing sessions for those who are interested.\n\nSingapore Hokkien Language Meetup Group: Same as the Facebook group, but organized over Meetup.\n\nWhen Singaporeans are speaking Hokkien, they do so with various accents and tones largely from Tong'an, Anxi, Nan'an, Kinmen as well as Yongchun, Jinjiang, Longhai City and Southern Zhangzhou accents. In practice, it is common for Singaporeans to mix English conjunctions such as \"and\" into a Hokkien sentence. Some would include \"hngo2\" (an exclamatory remark in Jin'jiang /Nan'an), in addition to the widely used \"lah\" and \"lor\" Hokkien exclamations.\n\nIn saying years or numbers, Singaporean Hokkien normally does not differentiate between literary (文讀音）or vernacular (白讀音) pronunciations. In Taiwan or Amoy, differentiation is usually made. For instance, the Year \"1980\" should be said with a literary pronunciation（一九八空年, \"it kiú pat khòng nî\"); but in Singapore, no differentiation is made (literary and vernacular are mixed together) and it's pronounced as \"it káu pueh khòng nî\".\n\nTaiwanese would speak telephone numbers using literary pronunciations, while Singaporeans would use vernacular pronunciations instead. For example, the telephone number \"98444678\" will be pronounced in Taiwan using a literary pronunciation, as \"kiú pat sù sù sù lio̍k tshit pat\", whereas in Singaporean Hokkien it would be pronounced using vernacular pronunciation, as \"káu pueh sì-sì sì la̍k tshit pueh\".\n\nIn Singaporean Hokkien—as compared to Quanzhou (whose accent Hokkien usually inclines toward), Zhangzhou, Amoy or Taiwanese (all being standard Hokkien), which pronounce the vowel \"ing\"—there is a vowel change from \"ing\" (/iəŋ/) to \"eng\" (/eŋ/ or /ɛŋ/). This change is similar to pronunciation in regions south of Zhangzhou—Dongshan, Yunxiao, Zhangpu, and Pinghe counties (southern Zhangzhou accent, 漳南腔)—and in Teochew and Cantonese.\n\nBelow is a table illustrating the difference:\n\nIn standard Hokkien pronunciation, 我 (\"I\" or \"me\") is pronounced as /gʊa/; but in Singaporean Hokkien, it is pronounced as /wa/, which is alleged by some to have been influenced by the Teochew pronunciation /ʊa/ although dialects like Putianese and some regional Hokkien dialects have a nearly identical pronunciation.\n\nThere are some differences between the sentence structure used by Singaporean Hokkien and by Standard Hokkien (Amoy/Taiwanese).\n\nFor instance, when asking a question for \"do you want to...?\", Singaporean Hokkien typically uses the sentence structure \"愛 (\"ai\")...莫 (\"mài\")?\", whereas Taiwanese Hokkien uses \"欲 (\"beh\")...無 (\"bô\")\". Singaporean Hokkien typically uses the word \"愛 (\"ai\")\" to mean \"want to\", but in Taiwanese, the word \"欲/卜 (\"beh\")\" (which means \"want\" in Hokkien) is used instead. \"愛 (\"ai\")\" in Taiwanese typically means \"love to\" or \"need to\".\n\nAlso, unlike Taiwanese Hokkien—which typically uses the word \"敢 (\"kám\")\" (meaning \"whether or not\", 是否 /是不是) when asking a question, which is more formal or polite—Singaporean Hokkien does not use the word \"敢 (\"kám\")\". Instead, it simply adds the word \"無 (\"bô\")\" at the end of the sentence to indicate that it's a question (similar to Mandarin's \"嗎 (\"ma\")\" or adds a Cantonese intonation \"咩 (\"meh\")\" at the end. Adding the word \"無 (\"bô\")\" at the end of a sentence is also used in Taiwanese Hokkien, when one is asking a question in an informal way.\n\nThe following list shows the colloquial readings of the numerals used to count objects.\n\nMost ordinal numbers are formed by adding 第 [tē] in front of a cardinal number. In some cases, the literary reading of the number must then be used. For example, 第一 = tē-it, 第二 = tē-jī. See: Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters.\n\nThere are minor differences between Singaporean Hokkien and Amoy or Taiwanese in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. Amoy and Taiwanese bear close resemblance, and are usually considered the standard in Hokkien, differing only in terms of vocabulary.\n\nAlthough Singaporean Hokkien is similar to Amoy or Taiwanese, there exist certain uniquely Singaporean Hokkien words, which are different from the Amoy or Taiwanese.\n\nThere are some words used in Singaporean Hokkien that are the same in Taiwanese Hokkien, but are pronounced differently.\n\nBecause Singapore is a multilingual country, Singaporean Hokkien has been influenced by many other languages spoken in Singapore. As a result, there are many non-Hokkien words that have been imported into Singaporean Hokkien, such as those from Malay, Teochew, Cantonese, and English.\n\nThere are words in Singaporean Hokkien that originated from other Chinese variants spoken in Singapore.\n\nThe following are the common Malay loanwords used in Singaporean Hokkien. Most of them are also used in Amoy.\n\nThere are also many English loanwords used in Singaporean Hokkien. They are usually used when the speaker does not know the Hokkien equivalent. Some of these English terms are related to working and living in Singapore\n\nCertain colloquial pronunciations of Singaporean Hokkien words are directly inherited from the consonant system of Old Chinese. Hokkien did not experience a great phonological change throughout the transition period from Old Chinese to Middle Chinese.\n\nSingaporean Hokkien preserved a unique feature of Old Chinese: it does not have the consonant \"f\". For instance, the word \"分\" is not pronounced as \"fen\", but rather as \"pun\". This marks a major difference between Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. Singaporean Hokkien also preserved the nasal vowel and the \"sai\" vowel of Old Chinese.\n\nSome of the Buddhist temples in Singapore continue to have Buddhist sutra being recited in Hokkien. The sutra contain Singapore-style Hokkien romanization to help in the recitation. Some of the Chinese Christian churches in Singapore also have services conducted in Singaporean Hokkien. Many of the Taoist services continue to be in Hokkien.\n\nThere exist Singaporean Hokkien writings, folk adages, and ballads written by early Chinese immigrants to Singapore.\n\nAmongst the folk ballads, a few outstanding writings tell of the history and hardship of early Chinese immigrants to Singapore.\n\nThere are 18 sections in the poetry ballad \"行船歌\" (\"Hâng-chûn-koa\") (\"Songs of traveling on a boat\"), which talks about how early immigrants migrated to Singapore.\n\nThere is another ballad called \"砰嘭水中流\" (\"Pin-pong-chúi-tiong-lâu\") (\"Flow in the midst of water\"):\n\nAn example of a folk love ballad is \"雪梅思君\" (\"Soat-m̂-su-kun\") (\"Snow and plum thinking of a gentlemen\"), on the loyalty and chastity of love.\n\nAn example of love poetry is \"針線情\" (\"Chiam-sòaⁿ-chiâⁿ\"） (\"The emotions of needle and thread\"):\n\nSingapore also held Getai during traditional Chinese festivals, for instance the Hungry Ghost Festival. During the Getai event, it is common to speak a number of Chinese dialects, including Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese. During the 1960s, Hokkien song was particularly popular. The Singapore Hokkien star Chen Jin Lang (陳金浪) was once the compere and main singer during the Hungry Ghost Festival. His famous song \"10 levels of Hades\" (\"十殿閻君\") was especially popular.\n\nEarly Singaporean Hokkien opera had its origins in Gaojia opera, which was brought from Quanzhou to Singapore during the late 19th century. In 1927, the Taiwanese Gezai opera spread to Singapore. Because its lyrics and singing style were easier to understand, it made a great impact on Singapore. Consequently, by the mid 20th century, it had replaced Gaojia opera to become the mainstream Hokkien opera in Singapore.\n\nCurrently, Singapore Hokkien opera is performed by two older troupes—Sin Sai Hong Hokkien Opera Troupe (新賽風閩劇團) and Xiao Kee Lin Hokkien Opera Troupe (筱麒麟閩劇團)—and three newer troupes—Sio Gek Leng Hokkien Opera Troupe (筱玉隆閩劇團), Ai Xin Hokkien Opera Troupe (愛心歌仔戲團), and Do Opera [Hokkien] (延戏[福建歌仔戏]), which is the newest.\n\nA Singapore Chinese opera school nurtures talents in opera, including Hokkien opera.\n\nSingapore Hokkien movies began to appear in the late 1990s, notably by dubbing in Hokkien mainstream Chinese movies made in Singapore. Amongst these, movies directed by Jack Neo, such as \"I not stupid\" and \"Money No Enough\" were popular. They reflected the social environment of local Singaporeans.\n\nAlthough Singapore radios started to ban Hokkien in the 1980s, Rediffusion Singapore continued to broadcast in Hokkien and greatly contributed to the culture of Singapore. For instance, the Hokkien story-telling program \"Amoy folks story\" (\"廈語民間故事\"), by Xu Shumei (許淑梅), was very popular.\n\nNanyin (Southern Music) first spread to Singapore in 1901. Many immigrants from Quanzhou began to establish various Nanyin organizations.\n\nThose which survive include the Siong Leng Musical Association, which was established in 1941. It was responsible for promoting Nanyin, as well as Liyuan opera. In 1977, the then chairman of the association, Ting Ma Cheng (丁馬成), advocated for the ASEAN Nanyin Performance (亞細安南樂大會奏), which helped to revive Nanyin. In addition, in order to educate young people about this performance art, he also published two books on Nanyin and Liyuan opera.\n\nCurrently, the Siong Leng Musical Association is led by Ding Honghai (丁宏海), and it continues to promote Nanyin in Singapore.\n\nThere are some letters written in Peh-oe-ji from early Hokkien migrants in Singapore.\n\nAn example was provided by the descendant of Tan Book Hak, a cousin of Tan Kah Kee.\n\nSingapore's Chinese name \"新加坡\" (\"sin-ka-pho\") originated from Hokkien's transliteration of \"Singapore\". In addition, there are many other place names in Singapore that originated from Hokkien: Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh, for instance.\n\n\n"}

The impetus for the project came from a line from the motion picture \"\" in which the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon stated, \"You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.\" According to a disclaimer, the project is written in a satirical style implied by Chancellor Gorkon's quote — that Shakespeare was actually a Klingon (named \"Wil'yam Sheq'spir\") writing about an attempted coup in the Klingon Empire.\n\nIn a scene from the film \"Star Trek VI\" a dinner is held for the Klingon chancellor, Gorkon. He makes a toast to \"the undiscovered country...the future\". Spock, recognising the quotation, responds, \"Hamlet, Act 3 Scene 1\", to which Gorkon replies with his statement about the \"original\" Klingon text of Shakespeare. Though Gorkon does not quote from the \"original\" Klingon text, another character, Chang, quotes the Klingon words \"taH pagh taHbe'\" (To be, or not to be). The film is filled with other quotations and references to Shakespeare.\n\nThe phrase \"the undiscovered country\" is part of Hamlet's famous \"To be, or not to be\" soliloquy.\n\nThe film's director Nicholas Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim William Shakespeare as German before World War II. A similar scene appears in the wartime British film \"\"Pimpernel\" Smith\" (1941) in which a German general quotes Shakespeare, saying “'To be or not to be', as our great German poet said.\" The idea had also already been used by Vladimir Nabokov in his novel \"Pnin\", the eponymous hero of which taught his American college class that Shakespeare was much more moving \"in the original Russian.\"\n\nThe English version of the play appears alongside its \"original Klingon\" text. The \"original Klingon\" version differs from the English version in ways that reflect the play's history as supposedly originating from Klingon culture. Reference sections in the book show how literal translations of the Klingon body text have had to be \"adapted\" to make it intelligible for human readers in the supposedly \"translated\" English version.\n\nThe introduction adopts a faux-academic style, explaining that Klingon origin of the play is evident from the fact that the plot is based on predominantly Klingon themes and motifs as opposed to human themes and motifs. Human culture was too primitive to have produced such a work during the time period in which it is set. A comparison of the \"spontaneous, direct and vibrant verse\" of the Klingon version with the \"flaccid, ponderous convoluted meanderings\" of the English version, make it obvious that the latter is a derivative work. The introduction also claims that the notion that Shakespeare was a human poet living in the late 16th century was invented after the United Federation of Planets instigated a large propaganda campaign in order to rally the human population against Klingons, \"hoping by this falsification of history to discredit the achievements of Klingon culture\".\n\nThe Klingon Language Institute (KLI) printed and published a hardback version, limited to 1000 numbered copies, in 1996, entitled \"Hamlet Prince of Denmark: The Restored Klingon Version\" () This was a product of the Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project, and was several years in the making. The entire play is presented in facing pages of English and Klingon, along with an appendix of end-notes detailing particulars of the translation.\n\n\"Star Trek\" publisher Pocket Books published the work as a trade paperback () in 2000.\n\n"}
{"id": "36059220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36059220", "title": "The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man", "text": "The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man\n\n\"The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man\" is a phrase of uncertain origin and without a primary source that has been cited by scholars and in publications as a message delivered by a Jewish fact-finding mission to Palestine, usually in the 1890s, or less frequently, the 1920s. Stories using the phrase generally convey an ignored warning that a Jewish homeland would not be reestablished in Palestine without interfering with the existing population.\n\n\"The Guardian\"'s foreign correspondent and expert on Israel and the Middle East, Eric Silver,\nreported a version of the story in 1977: \"An ageing pioneer was interviewed once on Israeli television. He explained how the elders of his Russian Jewish village had sent an emissary to Palestine to spy out the land. The man reported back: 'The bride is beautiful, but she is already married.'\"\n\nProfessor Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi of the University of Haifa recounted a different version of the story in his \"Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel\" (1992). Beit-Hallahmi wrote: \"There is a famous story, told during a meeting between Prime Minister Golda Meir and a group of Israeli writers in 1970. A Jew from Poland visited Palestine in the 1920s. On his return to Europe, he summarized his impressions by saying: 'The bride is beautiful, but she has got a bridegroom already.' Golda Meir responded by saying: 'And I thank God every night that the bridegroom was so weak, and the bride could be taken away from him.'\" \n\nUCLA professor of political science and history Anthony Pagden told another version of the story in his \"Worlds at War: The 2,500-Year Struggle Between East and West\" (2008): \"When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact-finding mission to Palestine, they famously reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.' But the implication of this wry remark — that the Zionists should attempt to marry someone else — was disregarded.\"\n\nThe phrase has also been cited as an 1890s fact-finding message in the 2008 BBC Two documentary \"The Birth of Israel\", produced by Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen, and by P. J. O'Rourke, Adam LeBor, and Mustapha Marrouchi. The titles of the books \"Married to Another Man\" (2007) by Ghada Karmi and (in Swedish) \"Bruden är vacker men har redan en man\" by Ingmar Karlsson (2012) are based on the story.\n\nIn 2012 an article by Shai Afsai was published in the academic journal \"Shofar\" asserting that the stories in which the phrase appears are unsubstantiated. Afsai contacted several scholars who repeated the stories but none were able to provide a primary source for them. Afsai argued that \"those who tell the story never provide a primary source for it and often provide no source at all\" and that \"there has been no basis for recounting the story as a historical event that occurred during the early years of the Zionist movement. In short, the story is unsubstantiated and writers should not treat it as historical fact.\" \n\nAfsai discussed Avi Shlaim, Anthony Pagden, Ghada Karmi, Mustapha Marrouchi, Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, Scott Hunt, Peter Rodgers, Karl Sabbagh and others as examples of those who treat the stories as verified historical events, and concluded: \"The 'married to another man' story, in all of its various permutations, should not be considered authentic until a primary — or at least early — source is found that shows it to be so.\" He also noted that some of the same points made \"by telling the 'married to another man' story can be made by referring to actual historical documents and occurrences\" instead, and mentioned the writings and observations of Zionist travelers such as Leo Motzkin, Israel Zangwill and Ahad Ha'am, and the Zionist settler Yitzhak Epstein.\n\nAccording to Alan Dowty, American author and Professor of Political Science Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame: “Zionists of the First Aliyah (wave of immigration to Palestine, from 1882 to 1905), did—contrary to some claims—‘see’ the Arabs there, but they did not see an Arab problem. They also paid remarkably little attention to the Arab population, simply noting their presence as one facet of the new environment with which they contended. For their own sanity, the new settlers needed to minimize the difficulties they faced and, in the case of the Arabs, it was also ideologically crucial to avoid any suggestion that they were simply replicating the Diaspora pattern of a Jewish minority existing at the sufferance of a majority non-Jewish host population.” \n\n"}
{"id": "24997576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24997576", "title": "Tie (typography)", "text": "Tie (typography)\n\nThe tie is a symbol in the shape of an arc similar to a large breve, used in Greek, phonetic alphabets, and Z notation. It can be used between two characters with spacing as punctuation, or non-spacing as a diacritic. It can be above or below, and reversed. Its forms are called tie, double breve, enotikon or papyrological hyphen, ligature tie, and undertie.\n\nThe enotikon (, \"enōtikón\",  \"uniter\"), papyrological hyphen, or Greek hyphen was a low tie mark found in late Classical and Byzantine papyri. In an era when Greek texts were typically written \"scripta continua\", the enotikon served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word rather than misunderstood as two separate words. (Its companion mark was the hypodiastole, which showed that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words.) Although modern Greek now uses the Latin hyphen, the Hellenic Organization for Standardization included mention of the enotikon in its romanization standard and Unicode is able to reproduce the symbol with its characters and .\n\nThe enotikon was also used in Greek musical notation, as a slur under two notes. When a syllable was sung with three notes, this slur was used in combination with a double point and a diseme overline.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet uses two type of ties: the ligature tie (IPA #433), above or below two symbols and the undertie (IPA #509) between two symbols.\n\nThe ligature tie, also called double inverted breve, is used to represent double articulation (e.g. ), affricates (e.g. ) or prenasalized consonant (e.g. ) in the IPA. It is mostly found above but can also be found below when more suitable (e.g. ).\n\nOn computers, it is encoded with characters and, as an alternative when raisers might be interfering with the bow, .\n\nThe undertie is used to represent linking (absence of a break) in the IPA. For example it is used to indicate liaison (e.g. ) but can also be used for other types of sandhi.\n\nOn computers, the character used is . This is a spacing character, not to be confused with the alternative (below-letter) form of the ligature tie (a͜b ), which is a combining character.\n\nThe Uralic Phonetic Alphabet uses several forms of the tie or double breve:\n\nThe double breve is used in the phonetic notation of the American Heritage Dictionary in combination with a double o, o͝o, to represent the near-close near-back rounded vowel ( in IPA).\n\nThe triple breve below is used in the phonetic writing Rheinische Dokumenta for three letter combinations.\n\nThe character tie is used for sequence concatenation in Z notation. It is encoded with in Unicode. For example \"s⁀t\" represents the concatenation sequence of sequences called \"s\" and \"t\"; and the notation \"⁀/q\" is the distributed concatenation of the sequence of sequences called \"q\".\n\nThe ligature tie is used in the logotypes of mobilkom Austria and its A1 brand.\n\nThe diacritic signs triple inverted breve, triple breve, and double inverted breve have not yet been encoded for computers.\n\nUnicode has characters similar to the tie:\n\n"}

It provides a set of tools for working with localization file formats and files that might need localization. The toolkit also provides an API on which to develop other localization tools.\n\nThe toolkit is written in the Python programming language. It is free software originally developed and released by Translate.org.za in 2002 and is now maintained by Translate.org.za and community developers.\n\nTranslate Toolkit uses Enchant as spellchecker.\n\nThe toolkit was originally developed as the mozpotools by David Fraser for Translate.org.za. Translate.org.za had focused on translating KDE which used Gettext PO files for localization. With an internal change to focus on end-user, cross-platform, OSS software, the organisation decided to localize the Mozilla Suite. This required using new tools and new formats that were not as rich as Gettext PO. Thus mozpotools was created to convert the Mozilla DTD and .properties files to Gettext PO.\n\nVarious tools were developed as needed, including pocount, a tool to count source text words to allow correct estimations for work, pogrep, to search through translations, and pofilter, to check for various quality issues.\n\nWhen Translate.org.za began translating OpenOffice.org it was only natural that the Translate Toolkit would be adapted to handle the OpenOffice.org internal file format. Translating OpenOffice.org using PO files is now the default translation method.\n\nAs part of the WordForge project the work received a major boost and the toolkit was further extended to manage XLIFF files alongside PO files. Further funded development has added other features including the ability to convert Open Document Format to XLIFF and the management of placeholders (Variables, acronyms, terminology, etc.).\n\nThe main aim of the toolkit is to increase the quality of localisation and translation. This is achieved by firstly, focusing on good localisation formats thus the toolkit makes use of the PO and XLIFF localisation formats. This has the benefit that it stops the proliferation of localization formats and allows localizers to work with one good localization tool. For the toolkit this means building converters that can transform files to be translated into these two basic formats.\n\nSecondly, to build tools that allow localizers to increase the general quality of their localization. These tools allow for the extraction of terminology and for checking for the consistent use of terminology. The tools allow for checking for various technical errors such as the correct use of variables.\n\nLastly, the toolkit provides a powerful localisation API that acts as a base on which to build other localization related tools.\n\nMany translators use the toolkit directly, to do quality checks and to transform files for translation. Further there are and have been several indirect users of the Translate Toolkit API:\n\n\n\nWork was started in June 2008 to incorporate OpenDocument Format support. This work is funded by the NLnet Foundation and is a collaboration between Translate.org.za and Itaapy\n\n\n"}

Although a Kannadiga by birth, Tamil was his medium of instruction since he did his schooling in Tamil Nadu. A man of varied talents, he took to writing in his early twenties, but he became a recognizable face in the local literary circles when his short stories started appearing in popular Tamil weekly magazines such as Ananda Vikatan in 1967. In his literary career spanning over four decades, Vittal Rao has written 9 novels, 5 collections of 140 short stories and 7 essays ranging from world cinema to fine art, history and literature.\n\nVittal Rao was born in Hosur, a small town in the old Salem district of Tamil Nadu, India. He was the sixth of eight siblings born to Saraswathi and Krishna Rāo. He spent most of his childhood and adolescent days in Salem before moving to Chennai in 1960 to work as a radiographer at Stanley Medical College and Hospital there. It was during this time that he developed an interest in fine arts and literature which encouraged him to enroll at the prestigious Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai (formerly known as the \"Madras School of Art\") in Chennai. He joined Madras Telephones later, in 1963, where he continued to work until his retirement in May, 2002. Working at Madras Telephones, allowed him to pursue his interest in fine arts and literature. One of his favorite pastimes included browsing the Moor Market, near the Madras Central Railway Station, which used to be a popular hangout of literary and art aficionados where used books from around the world could be bought at a bargain.\n\nHis first short story appeared in the popular weekly, Ananda Vikatan in 1967, and from there on his writings have appeared in all the popular as well as little literary magazines.\n\nHis novel, \"Pokkidam\" (Refuge, 1976), which won the best novel award instituted by \"Ilakkiya Chintanai\", brought him to serious literary attention. He has so far written 9 novels, long and short, and over a hundred short stories, of which only 4 collections have come out.\n\nTo talk about a few of his significant works, \"Nadhimoolam\" (Source of the river, 1981), unfolds the lives of three generations of a Madhava Brahmin family, dovetailing the narrative with the happenings and movements outside in society. It is a large and intricate tapestry of varied designs and colors, of interacting social forces in individual human lives. The happenings in society that he has woven into the story are authentic historical developments. It is a unique work in Tamil in that, while reading the lives of individuals one also reads the history of social changes, both bound up inextricably.\n\nIn \"Kaalaveli\" (Temporal expanse, 1988) the author presents a segment in lives of some students of an arts school with all their aspirations, frustrations, mutual jealousies and compromises in life. It is almost a documentary record of the milieu of artists and writers in Madras city in the seventies. In fact, all his works have a documentary dimension with authentic history as a background, intricately woven in to the narrative he chooses to unfold.\n\nHis novels have the dimension of being the chronicles of social history with a keen sense of observation and with an eye for detail. These qualities mark him out as one of the few significant novelists the twentieth century has given to contemporary Tamil literature.\n\n\n"}

A world cup is generally considered the premier competition in its sport, with the victor attaining the highest honour in that sport and able to lay claim to the title of their sport's best. However, in some sports the Olympic title carries at least as much prestige.\n\nThere are a number of notable world cups in popular sports like ICC Cricket World Cup, but it is the FIFA World Cup (an association football tournament, first held in 1930) that is widely known as simply \"the World Cup\".\n\nSome sports governing bodies prefer the title world championship or a related term; some even organize both a world cup and a world championship with different rules. Usually, such competitions take one of two forms, a short periodic competition or a year-long series of meetings, but more frequently many sports have both World Cup (usually competed with more races of a season), and world championship (usually a single event). Some examples in the following table.\n\nA periodic world cup or world championship usually takes the form of a knockout tournament (possibly with an initial group stage). This is held over a number of days or weeks, with the entrants eventually being whittled down to two, and the tournament culminating in a world cup final. The winner(s) take the title of World Champion(s) and hold it until the next time the event is held (usually one, two, or four years later). This format is most common in team sports, as with the FIFA World Cup or the ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nA contrasting concept, popular in individual sports, is a year-long competition with several meetings over its course. In this format, victory at an individual meeting earns a number of points, and, usually, a number of positions below also score points inversely related to their position. Contestants accumulate a number of points over the course of the year (often \"season\") and their cumulative total after all meetings have been concluded determines the World Champion or, simply, World Cup winner. The winner is then considered the champion until the next World Cup.\n\n"}
