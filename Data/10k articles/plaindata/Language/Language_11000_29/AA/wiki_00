{"id": "6614914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6614914", "title": "Archi language", "text": "Archi language\n\nArchi is a Northeast Caucasian language spoken by the Archis in the village of Archib, southern Dagestan, Russia, and the six surrounding smaller villages.\n\nIt is unusual for its many phonemes and for its contrast between several voiceless velar lateral fricatives, , voiceless and ejective velar lateral affricates, , and a voiced velar lateral fricative, . It is an ergative–absolutive language with four noun classes and has a remarkable morphological system with huge paradigms and irregularities on all levels. Mathematically, there are 1,502,839 possible forms that can be derived from a single verb root.\n\nThe classification of the Archi language has not been definitively established. Peter von Uslar felt it should be considered a variant of Avar, but Roderich von Erckert saw it as closer to Lak. The language has also been considered as a separate entity that could be placed somewhere between Avar and Lak. The Italian linguist Alfredo Trombetti placed Archi within an Avar–Ando–Dido group, but today the most widely recognized opinion follows that of the Soviet scholar Bokarev, who regards Archi as one of the Lezgian–Samur group of the Dagestan languages. Schulze places it in the Lezgian branch with all other Lezgian languages belonging to the Samur group.\n\nArchi has, like its Northeast Caucasian relatives, a very complicated phonological system, with Archi being an extreme example. It has 26 vowel phonemes and, depending on analysis, between 74 and 82 consonant phonemes.\n\nArchi has a symmetric six-vowel system (). All except can occur in five varieties: short, pharyngealized, high tone, long (with high tone), and pharyngealized with high tone (e.g. , , , , and ). Of all these, only and do not occur word-initially. Examples of non-initial are ('to be fat') and ('brain').\n\nOf the languages without click consonants, Archi has one of the largest consonant inventories, with the recently extinct Ubykh of the Northwest Caucasian languages having a few more. The table below shows all consonants that can be found in the Archi Language Tutorial and the Archi Dictionary.\n\nOf the consonants listed above, the ones in orange have no word-initial dictionary entries (even though , , and are relatively common), the one in green does not appear in the Tutorial but does have a word-internal dictionary entry (in , 'alpine pasture used in summer'), and the ones in blue appear in the Tutorial but have no dictionary entries.\n\nSome of these sounds are very rare. For example, has only one dictionary entry word-internally (in , 'heavy') and two entries word-initially. Likewise, has only two dictionary entries: ('blue; unripe') and ('crooked, curved').\n\nThe fortis consonants are not simply two instances of the same consonant, though they do appear largely complementary, with the double instances , , and being the most common and less so. That said, can still be found in ('three'). This is also noted by , who describes the fortis consonants as follows: \n\"Strong phonemes are characterized by the intensiveness (tension) of the articulation. The intensity of the pronunciation leads to a natural lengthening of the duration of the sound, and that is why strong [consonants] differ from weak ones by greater length. [However,] the adjoining of two single weak sounds does not produce a strong one […] Thus, the gemination of a sound does not by itself create its tension.\"\n\nThe voiceless velar lateral fricative , the voiced velar lateral fricative , and the corresponding voiceless and ejective affricates , are extremely unusual speech sounds among the languages of the world, because velar fricatives are usually central rather than lateral. The velar laterals are further forward than velars in most languages and could better be called prevelar, like the Tutorial does.\n\nUntil recently Archi did not have a written form, except in studies by specialists who used the Latin script. In 2006, the Surrey Morphology Group developed a Cyrillic alphabet for Archi based on the Avar alphabet, which is used in the Archi–Russian–English Dictionary alongside an IPA transcription.\n\nArchi nouns inflect for number (singular or plural) and for one of 10 regular cases and 5 locative cases that can all take one of 6 directional suffixes. There are four noun classes, which are only evident from verbal agreement.\n\nDepending on the specifics of the analysis, neither the ergative nor absolutive cases are necessarily marked by a specific suffix. Rather, they are marked by the use of the basic (for the absolutive) and oblique (for the ergative) stems in the absence of other markers. There is also a locative-case series, where 6 directional-case suffixes are combined with 5 spatial cases to produce a total of 30 case-localization combinations. However, these do not constitute 30 distinct case forms, because they are easily derivable from a pair of morphemes.\n\nThe four noun classes of Archi are only evident from verbal inflection. The table below summarizes these noun classes and their associated verbal morphology. \nThe following phrases were phonetically transcribed from Archi:\nThe inclusions of \"little\" and \"young\" in the phrases above refer to a diminutive form of the verb, which in Archi language commonly refers either to a smaller or younger version of the subject. While nouns pertaining to smaller objects such as items stay the same regardless of whether it is a diminutive or not (e.g. \"x́it\" for both \"ladle\" and \"spoon\", \"k̂ut̄ali\" for both \"bag\" and \"little bag\" etc.), nouns pertaining to younger animals change into entirely different words (e.g. \"dogi\" \"donkey\" but \"ḳêrt\" \"young donkey\", \"nôiš\" \"horse\" but \"uri\" \"young horse\" etc.). The verb changes to fit the diminutive regardless of whether the noun changes or not. In the past tense this is done by removing the -b- in front of the -x̄u/-č̣u/-ku inflection. In the present tense this is done by removing the b- as the first letter of the verb.\n\n\n\n"}

Lalitha Naik (born 4 April 1945) is an Indian politician, writer, and social activist. A former minister for Kannada, Culture, and Department of Women & Child Welfare in the Government of Karnataka Naik has also served as an MLC (1986-1992) and MLA (1994-1999). She won the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award in 1991. She is also known for leading important literary, social and language-rights movements such as Bandaya movement and Gokak agitation.\n\nLalitha Naik was born in a Lambani family on 4 April 1945, in Tangali Tanda(now V.L.Nagara), a small village in Kadur, Chikmagalur, to the agriculturalists, (late) Balaji Naik and Ganga Bai.\n\nNaik married Champla Naik in the late 60s and was married to him until his death in 1996. She has three sons from the marriage.\n\nLalitha Naik is the grand-niece of the renowned Bharatanatyam danseuse K. Venkatalakshamma.\n\nAfter her marriage, Naik, started writing radio plays about the trials and tribulations of middle class life for the local Akashavani station. Encouraged by the popularity she started writing and contributing poems, short stories and articles for prominent Kannada periodicals such as Sudha, Prajavani and Taranga. When her novella, \"Nele Bele\", won an award in the annual novella competition conducted by Sudha magazine, she was invited by the writer P. Lankesh to contribute to his newly started tabloid \"Lankesh Patrike\". Naik started writing regularly for the tabloid and was soon recognized for her sensitivity, social commitment and progressive views. Her popularity as a writer and journalist led her to being nominated as Member of the Karnataka Legislative Council (MLC) by the then Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde. Naik continued to write and produce memorable books like the short story collection \"Habba mattu Bali\" (\"Festival and the Sacrifice\"), the novel \"Gati\" (\"Fate\") and the poetry collections, \"Ide Koogu Matte Matte\" (\"The Same Cry Again and Again\") and \"Bidiru Mele Kantiyali\" (\"In the Bamboo Thicket\"). Author of sixteen books, she is also known for her plays, children's fiction and essays. She won the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award in 1991. Her novel \"Gati\" has been translated into English, and her stories and poems have been translated into English, Hindi, Marathi and Telugu languages. Her works are part of the syllabus in several universities in Karnataka.\n\nWhile serving as MLC (1986–1992) Naik joined the Janata Dal, inspired by the socialist ideals of Shantaveri Gopala Gowda and Jayaprakash Narayan. In 1994 she was elected MLA from Devadurga constituency, Raichur on a Janata Dal ticket, and was made Minister for Kannada, Culture, and Department of Women & Child Welfare in the J. H. Patel government. Barely two years into her tenure as minister, her son Vishwajit was accused of defiling the statue of B.R. Ambedkar at B.R. Ambedkar Medical College, Bangalore. Though subsequent investigations revealed the allegations to be baseless, she was forced to step down at that time. She also served as the President of Women's Janata Dal. After the split of Janata Dal in 1999 into Janata Dal (Secular) and Janata Dal (United), she joined Janata Dal (Secular) headed by H.D. Deve Gowda. She was a member of its National Executive. Later she quit Janata Dal (Secular) over Gowda's decision to form alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party. She later joined Janata Party, but left it in 2004. Subsequently, she joined the Welfare Party of India and served as its National Vice President. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections she contested from the Gulbarga constituency on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket and lost to Mallikarjun Kharge.\n\nIn 2016, Naik was one of 7 JD(S) MLAs suspended for cross voting for candidates of different parties in the 2016 Rajya Sabha election. Naik eventually joined the Indian National Congress on 29 January 2017.\n\nLalitha Naik participated in several social-literary movements of the 1980s including Bandaya movement, a protest movement for social equality and justice, and Gokak agitation. An avowed feminist Lalitha Naik has strongly appealed for the passing of Women's Reservation Bill in both central and state legislatures and urged women to learn martial arts to protect themselves in the prevailing rape culture. She has also lodged her strong protest against the victimization of innocent Muslim youth and social activists fighting for justice like Binayak Sen. She has protested against teaching Bhagavad Gita in schools. She has also demanded for the setting up of a National Men's Commission along the lines of Mahila Ayog to prevent the rising atrocities against men and the unscrupulous use of IPC 498(A), the anti-dowry harassment law which she alleges is often used as a means to blackmail and extort men. She is of the view that reservations should not be permanent.\n\nNaik acted in and wrote dialogues for the Banjara language film, \"Zadero Pankheru\" (\"Forest Bird\") in 1996. She has also acted in films \"Priya-O-Priya\" and \"Ashanti\", a tele-serial \"Mukta Mukta\" and one telefilm \"Ondu Hennina Kathe\". Naik was president of Karnataka State Bala Bhavana Society and has held other positions in some other community associations and societies.

Farber (born May 5, 1930) is an American conservative radio talk show host, author, commentator and language-learning enthusiast. In 2002, industry publication \"Talkers magazine\" ranked him the 9th greatest radio talk show host of all time. He has also written articles appearing in \"The New York Times\", \"Reader's Digest\", \"The Washington Post\", and the \"Saturday Review\". He is the father of journalist Celia Farber and singer-songwriter Bibi Farber.\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, Farber is Jewish and grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nAfter nearly failing Latin in the ninth grade, that summer Farber started reading a Mandarin Chinese language-learning book. A trip to Miami Beach, Florida, to see his grandparents, coincidentally put him in the midst of a large number of Chinese navy sailors in training there. His Chinese rapidly improved.\n\nBack in Greensboro, he took up Italian, Spanish, and French on his own before summer vacation was over. He started taking French and Spanish classes in his sophomore year and also learned Norwegian on his own while in high school. He graduated in 1948 from Greensboro Senior High School (see Grimsley High School).\n\nHe then attended the University of North Carolina, where he learned Russian. As a delegate from the National Student Association to what he later called a \"Tito propaganda fiesta called the Zagreb Peace Conference\", he found other Slavic languages were closely related to Russian. A 16-day boat trip back to the United States with Yugoslavs allowed him to practice his Serbo-Croatian. \nAfter covering the Olympic Games in Helsinki one year in the 1950s, he learned Indonesian on another boat trip back to the U.S.\n\nAs a newspaper reporter in 1956, Farber was invited by the United States Air Force to cover the airlift of Hungarian refugees from the uprising in Hungary that year. In an Austrian border village, Farber later wrote, he so impressed a Norwegian man, Thorvald Stoltenberg, with knowledge of the man's native tongue that he was allowed to go on one of the covert missions smuggling Hungarians into Austria.\n\nFarber has knowledge of more than 25 languages, including the ones mentioned above. He has published a book titled \"How to Learn Any Language\" that details his method for self-study. It is based around a multi-track study of the language, the use of memory aids for vocabulary, and the utilization of \"hidden moments\" throughout the day.\n\nFarber prefers to say that he is a student of a certain number of languages, rather than saying that he speaks them. Of the languages he has studied, half he \"dates\" and the other half he \"marries\". According to Farber: \"By languages I date, I mean no grammar and no script, languages like Bengali.\"\n\nAside from Bengali, the 25 foreign languages he has studied include these 19 (\"marriage\" or \"dating\" specified, when known): Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French (marriage), German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, Norwegian (marriage), Portuguese, Russian (marriage), Serbo-Croatian, Spanish (marriage), Swedish and Yiddish, as well as Bulgarian and Korean.\n\nFarber's book, \"How to Learn any Language\" never specifies all of the 25 languages that his publicity materials say he has studied. He says in the book that when he was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1952, he was \"tested and qualified for work in fourteen different languages\" and has since learned more in some of those languages as well as the others. He mentioned in the 2005 interview that he still constantly learns bits and pieces of new language—some Albanian phrases or a new phrase each time he went into a grocery store where a Tibetan woman works.\n\nHis radio career began in New York City, working as the producer for the Tex and Jinx interview program from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, a live remote broadcast over WNBC-AM in the mid-1950s at 10:30 PM to midnight, Monday through Friday.\n\nWilliam Safire hired Farber as a producer. Farber eventually hosted his own show on WINS.\n\nBegun in 1960, his first talk show was called \"Barry Farber’s WINS Open Mike\". It was the only talk show on what was then a rock n’ roll station and was on weeknights at 11pm. He left that job for an evening talk show on WOR-AM in 1962, and then became an all-night host in 1967.\n\nIn 1970, he ran for Congress in New York City's 19th district on the Republican ticket, but was defeated by Bella Abzug. Farber left his talk-radio career for a time in 1977 to delve into politics, running for mayor of New York City, but was defeated.\n\nIn November 1977, Kaiser Broadcasting debuted a weekly talk show hosted by Farber as a replacement to its program hosted by Lou Gordon, who died earlier that year, but it was short-lived.\n\nFarber then joined WMCA for an afternoon drive time talk show, which lasted until 1989 when WMCA changed its format to Christian radio.\n\nIn 1990, he became a national talk-show host on the ABC Radio Network, which was trying to build a group of nationwide talk shows at the time. Lynn Samuels was forced to share her local WABC show with Farber which led to on-air confrontations, and resulted in her departure from the station. ABC's project later was abandoned, and Farber, Michael Castello, and Alan Colmes got together and quickly formed their own independent network called Daynet.\n\nFarber is now on CRN Digital Talk Radio, weekdays, and on the Talk Radio Network, hosting a one-hour weekend show and filling in for TRN's weekday hosts, most commonly on \"The Laura Ingraham Show\".\n\nEarly in the 1970s, Farber was an adjunct professor of journalism at St. John's University in New York. Often, his former students are heard calling his radio program with admiring words and memories.\n\nOn the radio, Farber became easily identifiable by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved his ability to deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always sounded like he truly believed in the product.\n\nIn 1991 he was named \"Talk Show Host of The Year\" by the National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts.\n\nIn 2008 Farber married Sara Pentz, a television news reporter and journalist.\n\nFarber was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\n\n"}

It is the only Agaw (Central Cushitic) language spoken in Eritrea. It is spoken by about 120,000 people.\n\n\"Blin\" is the English spelling preferred by native speakers, but Bilin and Bilen are also commonly used. \"Bilin\" is the reference name arbitrarily used in the current initial English editions of ISO 639-3, but \"Blin\" is also listed as an equivalent name without preference. In the English list of ISO 639-2, \"Blin\" is listed in first position in both English and French lists, when \"Bilin\" is listed as an alternate name in the English list, and Bilen is the alternate name in the French list. The \"Ethnologue\" report lists Bilen as the preferred name, but also \"Bogo, Bogos, Bilayn, Bilin, Balen, Beleni, Belen, Bilein, Bileno, North Agaw\" as alternative names.\n\nIt is not clear if Bilen has tone.

For example,\n\n\"See also:\" Ge'ez alphabet#Modifications for other languages\n\nA writing system for Bilen was first developed by missionaries who used the Ge'ez abugida and the first text was published in 1882. Although the Ge'ez script is usually used for Semitic languages, the phonemes of Bilen are very similar (7 vowels, labiovelar and ejective consonants). The script therefore requires only a slight modification (the addition of consonants for and ) to make it suitable for Bilen. Some of the additional symbols required to write Bilen with this script are in the \"Ethiopic Extended\" Unicode range rather than the \"Ethiopic\" range.\n\nAgaw/Bilen syllables are among the Ethiopic glyphs computerized by Dr. Aberra Molla in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1985 the Eritrean People's Liberation Front decided to use the Latin script for Bilen and all other non-Semitic languages in Eritrea. This was largely a political decision: the Ge'ez script is associated with Christianity because of its liturgical use. The Latin alphabet is seen as being more neutral and secular. In 1993 the government set up a committee to standardize the Bilen language and the Latin-based orthography. \"This overturned a 110-year tradition of writing Blin in Ethiopic script.\" (Fallon, \"Bilen Orthography\" )\n\nAs of 1997, the alphabetic order was:\n\nAlso \"khw\".\n\nTheir values are similar to the IPA apart from the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It includes digital voice recorders and tape recorders.\n\nThe name \"Dictaphone\" is a trademark of the company of the same name, but has also become a common term for all dictation machines, as a genericized trademark.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell and his two associates took Edison's tinfoil phonograph and modified it considerably to make it reproduce sound from wax instead of tinfoil. They began their work at Bell's Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C., in 1879, and continued until they were granted basic patents in 1886 for recording in wax.\nThomas A. Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877, but the fame bestowed on him for this invention — sometimes called his most original — was not due to its efficiency. Recording with his tinfoil phonograph was too difficult to be practical, as the tinfoil tore easily, and even when the stylus was properly adjusted, its reproduction of sound was distorted and squeaky, and good for only a few playbacks. Although Edison had hit upon the secret of sound recording, immediately after his discovery he did not improve it, allegedly because of an agreement to spend the next five years developing the New York City electric light and power system.\n\nBy 1881 the Volta associates had succeeded in improving an Edison tinfoil machine to some extent. Wax was put in the grooves of the heavy iron cylinder, and no tinfoil was used. The basic distinction between the Edison's first phonograph patent, and the Bell and [Charles Sumner] Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves on a piece of tin-foil, while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting, or \"engraving\", the sound waves into a wax record with a sharp recording stylus. \n\nAmong the later improvements by the Volta Associates, the Graphophone used a cutting stylus to create lateral zig-zag grooves of uniform depth into the wax-coated cardboard cylinders, rather than the up-and-down vertically-cut grooves of Edison's contemporary phonograph machine designs. \nNotably, Bell and Tainter developed wax-coated cardboard cylinders for their record cylinders, instead of Edison's cast iron cylinder, covered with a removable film of tinfoil (the actual recording medium, which was prone to damage during installation or removal. Tainter received a separate patent for a tube assembly machine to automatically produce the coiled cardboard tubes, which served as the foundation for the wax cylinder records.\n\nBesides being far easier to handle, the wax recording medium also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. Additionally the Graphophones initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings, then wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms, and finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.\nShortly after Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, the first device for recording sound, in 1877, he thought that the main use for the new device would be for recording speech in business settings. (Given the low audio fidelity of earliest versions of the phonograph, recording music may not have seemed to be a major application.) Some early phonographs were indeed used this way, but this did not become common until the mass production of reusable wax cylinders in the late 1880s. The differentiation of office dictation devices from other early phonographs, which commonly had attachments for making one's own recordings, was gradual. The machine marketed by the Edison Records company was trademarked as the \"Ediphone\". \n\nFollowing the invention of the audion tube in 1906, electric microphones gradually replaced the purely acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the SoundScriber and Gray Audograph, which cut grooves into a plastic disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. While reel-to-reel tape was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading tape spools led to development of more convenient formats, notably the Compact Cassette, Mini-Cassette, and Microcassette.\nDigital dictation became possible in the 1990s, as falling computer memory prices made possible pocket-sized digital voice recorders that stored sound on computer memory chips without moving parts. Many early 21st-century digital cameras and smartphones have this capability built in. In the 1990s, improvements in voice recognition technology began to allow computers to transcribe recorded audio dictation into text form, a task that previously required human secretaries or transcribers. the technology is not robust enough to replace human transcription in most cases.\n\nDespite the advances in technology, analog media are still widely used in dictation recording for their flexibility, permanence, and robustness.\n\n\n"}

Scotus has had considerable influence on both Catholic and secular thought.

Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the Immaculate Conception of Mary.\n\nDuns Scotus was given the scholastic accolade \"Doctor Subtilis\" (\"Subtle Doctor\") for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993.\n\nLittle is known of Duns Scotus apart from his work. His date of birth is thought to have been between 23 December 1265 and 17 March 1266, born into a leading family of the region. The site of his birth, in front of the Pavilion Lodge, near the North Lodge of Duns Castle, is now marked by a cairn which was erected in 1966 by the Franciscan friars of the United Kingdom to mark the 700th anniversary of his birth. Duns Scotus received the religious habit of the Friars Minor at Dumfries, where his uncle, Elias Duns, was guardian.\n\nDuns Scotus's age is based on the first certain date for his life, that of his ordination to the priesthood at St Andrew's, Northampton, England on 17 March 1291. The minimum canonical age for receiving holy orders is 25 and it is generally assumed that he would have been ordained as soon as it was permitted. That his contemporaries called him Johannes Duns, after the medieval practice of calling people by their Christian name followed by their place of origin, suggests that he came from Duns, in Berwickshire, Scotland.\n\nAccording to tradition, Duns Scotus was educated at a Franciscan \"studium generale\" (a medieval university), a house behind St Ebbe's Church, Oxford, in a triangular area enclosed by Pennyfarthing Street and running from St Aldate's to the Castle, the Baley and the old wall, where the Friars Minor had moved when the University of Paris was dispersed in 1229–30. At that time there would have been about 270 persons living there, of whom about 80 would have been friars.\n\nDuns Scotus appears to have been in Oxford by 1300, as he is listed among a group of friars for whom the provincial superior of the English ecclesiastical province (which included Scotland) requested faculties from the Bishop of Lincoln for the hearing of confessions. He took part in a disputation under the regent master, Philip of Bridlington in 1300–01. He began lecturing on Peter Lombard's \"Sentences\" at the prestigious University of Paris towards the end of 1302. Later in that academic year, however, he was expelled from the University of Paris for siding with Pope Boniface VIII in his feud with King Philip IV of France over the taxation of church property.\n\nDuns Scotus was back in Paris before the end of 1304, probably returning in May. He continued lecturing there until, for reasons that are still mysterious, he was dispatched to the Franciscan \"studium\" at Cologne, probably in October 1307. According to the 15th-century writer William Vorilong, his departure was sudden and unexpected. He was relaxing or talking with students in the \"Prato clericorum\" or \"Pre-aux-Clercs\" – an open area of the Rive Gauche used by scholars for recreation – when orders arrived from the Franciscan Minister General; Scotus left immediately, taking few or no personal belongings.\n\nDuns Scotus died unexpectedly in Cologne in November 1308; the date of his death is traditionally given as 8 November. He is buried in the Church of the Friars Minor there. His sarcophagus bears the Latin inscription:\n\nThe story about Duns Scotus being buried alive, in the absence of his servant who alone knew of his susceptibility to coma, is probably a myth. It was reported by Francis Bacon in his \"Historia vitae et mortis\".\n\nThe colophon of Codex 66 of Merton College, Oxford says that Scotus was also at Cambridge, but we do not know for certain if this is true, or, if it was, when he was there.\n\nScotus's great work is his commentary on the \"Sentences\" of Peter Lombard, which contains nearly all the philosophical views and arguments for which he is well known, including the univocity of being, the formal distinction, less than numerical unity, individual nature or \"thisness\" (haecceity), his critique of illuminationism and his renowned argument for the existence of God. His commentary exists in several versions. The standard version is the \"Ordinatio\" (also known as the \"Opus oxoniense\"), a revised version of lectures he gave as a bachelor at Oxford. The initial revision was probably begun in the summer of 1300 – see the remarks in the Prologue, question 2, alluding to the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299, news of which probably reached Oxford in the summer of 1300. It was still incomplete when Scotus left for Paris in 1302. The original lectures were also transcribed and recently published as the \"Lectura\".\n\nThe two other versions of the work are Scotus's notes for the Oxford lectures, recently published as the \"Lectura\", the first book of which was probably written in Oxford in the late 1290s, and the \"Reportatio parisiensis\" (or \"Opus parisiense\"), consisting of transcriptions of the lectures on the \"Sentences\" given by Scotus when he was in Paris. A \"reportatio\" is a student report or transcription of the original lecture of a master. A version that has been checked by the master himself is known as a \"reportatio examinata\".\n\nBy the time of Scotus, these 'commentaries' on the \"Sentences\" were no longer literal commentaries. Instead, Peter Lombard's original text was used as a starting point for highly original discussions on topics of theological or philosophical interest. For example, Book II Distinction 2, about the location of angels, is a starting point for a complex discussion about continuous motion, and whether the same thing can be in two different places at the same time (bilocation). In the same book, Distinction 3, he uses the question of how angels can be different from one another, given that they have no material bodies, to investigate the difficult question of individuation in general.\n\nScotus wrote purely philosophical and logical works at an early stage of his career, consisting of commentaries on Aristotle's \"Organon\". These are the \"Questions\" on Porphyry's \"Isagoge\" and Aristotle's \"Categories\", \"Peri hermeneias\", and \"De sophisticis elenchis\", probably dating to around 1295. His commentary on Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" was probably written in stages, the first version having started around 1297, with significant additions and amendments possibly after the completion of the main body of the \"Ordinatio\". His \"Expositio\" on the \"Metaphysics\" was lost for centuries but was recently rediscovered and edited by Giorgio Pini.\n\nIn addition, there are 46 short disputations called \"Collationes\", probably dating from 1300–1305; a work in natural theology (\"De primo principio\"); and his \"Quaestiones Quodlibetales\", probably dating to Advent 1306 or Lent 1307.\n\nA number of works once believed to have been written by Scotus are now known to have been misattributed. There were already concerns about this within two centuries of his death, when the 16th-century logician Jacobus Naveros noted inconsistencies between these texts and his commentary on the \"Sentences\", leading him to doubt whether he had written any logical works at all. \"The Questions on the Prior Analytics\" (\"In Librum Priorum Analyticorum Aristotelis Quaestiones\") were also discovered to be mistakenly attributed. In 1922, Grabmann showed that the logical work \"De modis significandi\" was actually by Thomas of Erfurt, a 14th-century logician of the modist school. Thus the claim that Martin Heidegger wrote his \"Habilitationsschrift\" on Scotus is only half true, as the second part is actually based on the work by Erfurt.\n\nScotus is generally considered to be a realist (as opposed to a nominalist) in that he treated universals as real. He attacks a position close to that later defended by Ockham, arguing that things have a common nature – for example the humanity common to Socrates, Plato, and Plutarch.\n\nHe followed Aristotle in asserting that the subject matter of metaphysics is \"being qua being\" (\"ens inquantum ens\"). Being in general (\"ens in communi\"), as a univocal notion, was for him the first object of the intellect.\n\nThe doctrine of the univocity of being implies the denial of any real distinction between essence and existence. Aquinas had argued that in all finite being (i.e. all except God) the essence of a thing is distinct from its existence. Scotus rejected the distinction. Scotus argued that we cannot conceive of what it is to be something, without conceiving it as existing. We should not make any distinction between whether a thing exists (\"si est\") and what it is (\"quid est\"), for we never know whether something exists, unless we have some concept of what we know to exist.\n\nScotus elaborates a distinct view on hylomorphism, with three important strong theses that differentiate him. He held: 1) that there exists matter that has no form whatsoever, or prime matter, as the stuff underlying all change, against Aquinas (cf. his \"Quaestiones in Metaphysicam\" 7, q. 5; \"Lectura\" 2, d. 12, q. un.), 2) that not all created substances are composites of form and matter (cf. \"Lectura\" 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55), that is, that purely spiritual substances do exist, and 3) that one and the same substance can have more than one substantial form – for instance, humans have at least two substantial forms, the soul and the form of the body (\"forma corporeitas\") (cf. \"Ordinatio\" 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). He argued for an original principle of individuation (cf. \"Ordinatio\" 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1–6), the \"haecceity\" as the ultimate unity of a unique individual (\"haecceitas\", an entity's 'thisness'), as opposed to the common nature (\"natura communis\"), feature existing in any number of individuals. For Scotus, the axiom stating that only the individual exists is a dominating principle of the understanding of reality. For the apprehension of individuals, an intuitive cognition is required, which gives us the present existence or the non-existence of an individual, as opposed to abstract cognition. Thus the human soul, in its separated state from the body, will be capable of knowing the spiritual intuitively.\n\nLike other realist philosophers of the period (such as Aquinas and Henry of Ghent) Scotus recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual but not fully real or mind-dependent either. Scotus argued for a formal distinction (\"distinctio formalis a parte rei\"), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the Trinity are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or \"haecceity\" of a thing is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction. There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.\n\nScotus was an Augustinian theologian. He is usually associated with theological voluntarism, the tendency to emphasize God's will and human freedom in all philosophical issues. The main difference between Aquinas's rational theology and that of Scotus is that Scotus believed certain predicates may be applied univocally – with exactly the same meaning – to God and creatures, whereas Aquinas insisted that this is impossible and that only analogical predication can be employed, in which a word as applied to God has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of that same word as applied to creatures. Duns struggled throughout his works in demonstrating his univocity theory against Aquinas's analogy doctrine.\n\nScotus gave the lecture, \"Lectura\" I 39, during 1297–1299 to refute the view that everything is necessary and immutable. He claims that the aim of this lecture has two points (\"Lectura\" I 39, §31): first, to consider the contingency in what is (\"de contingentia in entibus\"); second, to consider how God's certain knowledge is compatible with the contingency of things.\nScotus tries to defend the validity of Christian theology against the attack of ancient philosophers. The main argument is unpacked in \"Lectura\" I 39, §§49–53. Scotus argues that a necessary being (God) is able to have contingent knowledge, and that although this knowledge is contingent, it is not necessarily mutable and temporal by that very fact. \nIn \"Lectura\" I 39 §1, Scotus asks, \"whether God has determinate knowledge of things according to every aspect of their existence, as according to being in the future.\" He presents a counterview which claims that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. To support this counterview, Aristotle's \"De Interpretatione\" IX.\nIn the following arguments, Scotus does not attempt to contradict Aristotle. He does not affirm or reject the ideas of Aristotle. The only issue he argues against is the proposition that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. Scotus appears to try to fully demonstrate that Aristotle's text is not contradictory to the Christian doctrine of God.\nScotus argues that God wills with one single volition (\"unica volitione\") whatever he wills. God has one volition \"ad intra\", but this one volition can be related to many opposite things \"ad extra\". God can simultaneously will one thing at time 1 and the opposite thing at time 2.\nThere are various possible interpretations of Aristotle's \"De Interpretatione\" IX. For example, John Buridan (ca. 1300–1362) thought the Scotistic contingency theory was an Aristotelian view. Buridan's judgment is all the more possible because of at least four reasons: (1) Aristotle's \"De Interpretatione\" IX, 19a23-25 can be interpreted like the Scotistic contingency theory; (2) Scotus himself does not refute Aristotle's \"De Interpretatione\" IX in \"Lectura\" I 39 §§49–53; (3) Scotus, rather, tries to formulate his contingency theory with the help of other works of Aristotle in \"Lectura\" I 39 §§51, 54; (4) Scotus introduces the diachronic feature of God's volition to his contingency theory as well as the synchronic feature.\n\nDuns Scotus argued that it is better to construct a metaphysical argument for the existence of God, rather than the more common physical argument from motion favoured by Aquinas, following Aristotle. Though the version in \"De Primo Principio\" is the most complete and final version, the \"Ordinatio\" proof is usually offered. However, the \"De Primo\" version is fascinating and worth looking into for a wider understanding of the argument as well as Scotus's metaphysical underpinnings for his argument for God's existence, but we shall base this section of the article on the \"Ordinatio\" version. Let us briefly outline Scotus's argument. He begins his proof by explaining that there are two angles we must take in arguing for the existence of an actually infinite being. First we must approach from the view of the Relative Properties of God; second, from the Absolute Properties of God. Relative properties are those which are predicable of God in relation to creation; absolute properties are those which belong to God whether or not He chose to create. Under the first heading of Relative Properties, Scotus argues for a triple primacy of efficiency, finality and pre-eminence. From there he shows that one primacy implies the others, and finally there can only be one nature that is the First Efficient Cause, Ultimate End, and the Most Perfect Nature. From there the Subtle Doctor discusses the Absolute Properties of God. The First Being is intellectual and volitional, and the intellect and will are identical with the essence of this supreme nature. The First Being is also infinite being. While discussing the infinity of God, Scotus resurrects Anselm's argument and responds to the criticism that Anselm makes an illicit leap from concept to reality. Finally, he gives a definite answer of \"yes\" to the question of whether there exists an actually infinite being. The very next question of the \"Ordinatio\" deals with the unicity of the nature thus proved to exist. However, the \"De Primo Principio\" version concludes with this argument.\n\nSince the argument is very long and has many parts, we shall content ourselves in this article with stating the premises for the existence of the first efficient cause, assuming that the reader will follow the citations to read the rest of the argument.\nThe proof for the conclusion that \"some efficient cause is simply first such that neither can it be an effect nor can it, by virtue of something other than itself, cause an effect\" \"Ordinatio\" I.2.43 runs something like this:1) Something can be produced.2) It is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.3) Not by nothing, for nothing causes nothing.4) Not by itself, for an effect never causes itself.5) Therefore, by another; call it \"A\".6) If \"A\" is first, then we have reached the conclusion.7) If \"A\" is not first, but also an effect, we return to 2). \"A\" is produced either by itself, nothing, or another. 8) From 3) and 4), we say another, \"B\". The ascending series will either continue infinitely or we finally reach something which has nothing prior to it.9) An infinite ascending series is impossible.10) Therefore, etc.Scotus acknowledges two objections and deals with them accordingly. First is that he begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally ordered series of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially ordered series. Scotus explains the differences between the two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially ordered causes in a series is impossible. Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. \"It is possible that something can be produced\" is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He assures us that the last claim will be proved later in the argument. In the \"Lectura\" proof, Scotus argues the following way:\nMore can and should be said about this fascinating argument, but we leave it to the reader to search out more of the argument. See especially http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B.\n\nScotus argued against the version of illuminationism that had been defended earlier in the century by Henry of Ghent. In his \"Ordinatio\" (I.3.1.4) he argued against the sceptical consequences that Henry claimed would follow from abandoning divine illumination. Scotus argued that if our thinking were fallible in the way Henry had believed, such illumination could not, even in principle, ensure \"certain and pure knowledge.\"\n\nPerhaps the most influential point of Duns Scotus's theology was his defense of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (i.e., that Mary herself was conceived without sin). At the time, there was a great deal of argument about the subject. The general opinion was that it was appropriately deferential to the Mother of God, but it could not be seen how to resolve the problem that only with Christ's death would the stain of original sin be removed. The great philosophers and theologians of the West were divided on the subject (indeed, it appears that even Thomas Aquinas sided with those who denied the doctrine, though some Thomists dispute this). The feast day had existed in the East (though in the East, the feast is just of the Conception of Mary) since the seventh century and had been introduced in several dioceses in the West as well, even though the philosophical basis was lacking. Citing Anselm of Canterbury's principle, \"potuit, decuit, ergo fecit\" (He [i.e., God] could do it, it was appropriate, therefore He did it), Duns Scotus devised the following argument: Mary was in need of redemption like all other human beings, but through the merits of Jesus' crucifixion, given in advance, she was conceived without the stain of original sin. God could have brought it about (1) that she was never in original sin, (2) she was in sin only for an instant, (3) she was in sin for a period of time, being purged at the last instant. Whichever of these options was most excellent should probably be attributed to Mary. This apparently careful statement provoked a storm of opposition at Paris, and suggested the line 'fired France for Mary without spot' in the famous poem \"Duns Scotus's Oxford,\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\nScotus's argument appears in Pope Pius IX's 1854 declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, \"at the first moment of Her conception, Mary was preserved free from the stain of original sin, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ.\" Scotus's position was hailed as \"a correct expression of the faith of the Apostles.\"\n\nAnother of Scotus's positions also gained official approval of the Roman Catholic Church: his doctrine on the universal primacy of Christ became the underlying rationale for the feast of Christ the King instituted in 1925.\n\nDuring his pontificate, Pope John XXIII recommended the reading of Duns Scotus's theology to modern theology students.\n\nLong honored as a Blessed by the Order of Friars Minor, as well as in the Archdioceses of Edinburgh and Cologne, in the 19th-century the process was started seeking his recognition as such by the Holy See, on the basis of a \"cultus immemorabilis\", i.e., one of ancient standing. He was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II in 1991, who officially recognized his liturgical cult, effectively beatifying him on 20 March 1993.\n\nOwing to Scotus's early and unexpected death, he left behind a large body of work in an unfinished or unedited condition. His students and disciples extensively edited his papers, often confusing them with works by other writers, in many cases leading to misattribution and confused transmission. Most 13th-century Franciscans followed Bonaventura, but the influence of Scotus (as well as that of his arch-rival William of Ockham) spread in the fourteenth century. Franciscan theologians in the late Middle Ages were thus divided between so-called Scotists and Ockhamists. Fourteenth century followers included Francis of Mayrone (died 1325), Antonius Andreas (died 1320), William of Alnwick (died 1333), and John of Bassolis (died 1347), supposedly Scotus's favourite student.\n\nHis reputation suffered during the English reformation, probably due to its association with the Franciscans. In a letter to Thomas Cromwell about his visit to Oxford in 1535, Richard Layton described how he saw the court of New College full of pages from Scotus's work, \"the wind blowing them into every corner.\" John Leland described the Oxford Greyfriar's library in 1538 (just prior to its dissolution) as an accumulation of 'cobwebs, moths and bookworms.'\n\nWhen in the sixteenth century the Scotists argued against Renaissance humanism, the term \"duns\" or \"dunce\" became, in the mouths of the Protestants, a term of abuse and a synonym for one incapable of scholarship.\n\nDespite this, Scotism grew in Catholic Europe. Scotus's works were collected into many editions, particularly in the late fifteenth century with the advent of printing. His school was probably at the height of its popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries there were even special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcalá, Padua, and Pavia. New ideas were included pseudographically in later editions of his work, such as the principle of explosion, now attributed to Pseudo-Scotus. Scotism flourished well into the seventeenth century, and its influence can be seen in such writers as Descartes and Bramhall. Interest dwindled in the eighteenth century, and the revival of scholastic philosophy, known as neo-Scholasticism, was essentially a revival of Thomistic thinking.\n\nThe twentieth century saw a resurgence of interest in Scotus, with a range of assessments of his thought.\n\nFor one thing, Scotus has received interest from secular philosophers such as Peter King, Gyula Klima, Paul Vincent Spade, and others.\n\nFor some today, Scotus is one of the most important Franciscan theologians and the founder of Scotism, a special form of Scholasticism. He came out of the Old Franciscan School, to which Haymo of Faversham (died 1244), Alexander of Hales (died 1245), John of Rupella (died 1245), William of Melitona (died 1260), St. Bonaventure (died 1274), Cardinal Matthew of Aquasparta (died 1289), John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury (died 1292), Richard of Middletown (died c. 1300), etc., belonged. He was known as \"Doctor Subtilis\" because of the subtle distinctions and nuances of his thinking. Later philosophers in the sixteenth century were less complimentary about his work and accused him of sophistry. This led to the word \"dunce,\" which developed from the name \"Dunse\" given to his followers in the 1500s, becoming used for \"somebody who is incapable of scholarship.\"\n\nAn important question since the 1960s has revolved over whether Scotus's thought heralded a change in thinking on the nature of 'being,' a change which marked a shift from Aquinas and other previous thinkers; this question has been particularly significant in recent years because it has come to be seen as a debate over the origins of 'modernity.' This line of argument first emerged in the 1960s among popular French philosophers who, in passing, singled out Duns Scotus as the figure whose theory of univocal being changed an earlier approach which Aquinas had shared with his predecessors. Then, in 1990, the historian of philosophy Jean-Francois Courtine argued that, between the time of Aquinas in the mid-thirteenth century and Francisco Suárez at the turn of the seventeenth, a fundamentally new approach to being was developed, with Scotus taking a major part in its development. During the 1990s, various scholars extended this argument to locate Scotus as the first thinker who succumbed to what Heidegger termed 'onto-theology'. \n\nIn recent years, this criticism of Scotus has become disseminated in particular through the writings of the 'Radical Orthodox' group of theologians, centred around John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock. The Radical Orthodox model has been questioned by Daniel Horan and Thomas Williams, both of whom claim that Scotus' doctrine of the univocity of being is a semantic, rather than an ontological theory. Both thinkers cite Ord. 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 3, n. 163, in which Scotus claims that \"This [univocally] is how all the authoritative passages one might find on this topic in the Metaphysics or Physics should be inter- preted: in terms of the ontological diversity of those things to which the concept is attributed, which is compatible with there being one concept that can be abstracted from them\". Such a quotation seems to refer to epistemology, with abstracted concepts, rather than with ontology, which Scotus admits can be diverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of his education was from his father, R. Michel, who was a Chassid, a close student of Rabbi Zadok HaCohen of Lublin, and had a great influence in forming his personality.\n\nAt the age of 17, he left Opole Lubelskie and moved back to Warsaw. There he studied in a \"beis midrash\", worked at backbreaking jobs, while also doing public work for Agudath Israel of Poland. In his capacity as an educator, he gave lectures in Talmud, Tanakh and Jewish thought. At that time, he also worked on a volunteer basis in secular Jewish schools for abandoned children, until his \"Aliyah\" to Israel in 1936. He married a sister of Rabbi Alexander Zusia Friedman, top activist for the Agudath Israel of Poland.\n\nUpon his immigration to Israel, he worked in construction. As a Chareidi Jew, he was extremely dissatisfied with the terrible conditions the Chareidi workers experienced, and helped establish the Union of Agudath Israel workers (\"Poalei Agudat Yisrael\"). In addition to its concern for finding steady work for its members, this group eventually established cooperative factories of its own, in the fields of construction and industry. Rav Kitov engaged in this endeavor on a volunteer basis, alongside his own work in construction.\n\nIn 1941, he established a school for \"Chareidi\" children, where he served as principal for about eight years. At the same time, he became very involved with public affairs, editing the \"Poalei Agudat Yisrael\" newspaper, \"HaKol\" [\"The Voice\"]. In this journal, he published hundreds of articles, under various names, on a wide variety of subjects. In these writings, one can discern the budding of his writing capabilities that were to follow in his many books later on.\n\nIn 1954, eighteen years after he immigrated to Israel, he left politics and public works and began to write full-time. Despite a lack of funds, he established a small publishing house called \"Aleph Institute Publications\" (now \"Yad Eliyahu Kitov\"), through which he published his various books.\n\nFrom then until the end of his life, some twenty years, his main activity was writing and editing. However, at times he would get involved in education: giving guidance to teachers, lectures and publishing articles, mostly in the United States.\n\n\nRabbi Kitov had four sons, Oded, Shalom Zvi z\"l, Yehoshua and Zurishadai, whose families live in Jerusalem; and three daughters, Rachel (Kitzes) and Ruth (Ben Arza), who also live in Jerusalem; and Na'ama (Nothman) z\"l, who lives in South Africa. Many of them and/or their spouses continue to inspire the next generation with his teachings.\n\nThere is much misinformation about the family history of Eliyahu Kitov. Literature states he was born Abraham Eliyahu Mokotovski in Warsaw. In fact, he was born Abraham Eliyahu Mokotow and used the surname Mokotow as late as 1953 when he made a trip to the United States. His Polish passport, which he surrendered upon immigrating to Palestine, shows his name as Mokotow. When running for the Knesset in 1947, he used the name Abraham Eliyahu Mokotovski.\n\nHe was born on March 22, 1912, most likely in Opole Lubelskie, Poland, one of at least ten children, the majority born in Józefów nad Wisłą, Poland. The sibling who was just older than he was, was born in Zaklików, Poland, and the sibling just younger than he was, was born in Opole Lubelskie. All these towns are near each other and some distance from Warsaw. If he was born in Warsaw, his parents most likely were visiting there at the time.\n\nHe was the son of Michel Mokotow and Rachel Samburski. His father was born on November 22, 1871 in Połaniec, Poland. This town is in the vicinity of the three previously named towns. Michel’s parents were Chaim Tuvia Mokotow (born about 1842) and Malka Wajnberger (born about 1845). Chaim Tuvia's parents were Icek Mokotow (born June 10, 1809 in Warka, Poland) and Esther Holszkiner (born about 1807). Icek's parents were Tuvia David Mokotow (born about 1774, died 18 Jan 1842 in Warsaw) and Tauba Moskowicz (born about 1770). Tuvia's father’s name was Moszek Aronowicz (Moshe ben Aron) who died on July 25, 1810 in Warka, Poland, at the age of 83.\n\n"}
{"id": "639511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=639511", "title": "Episteme", "text": "Episteme\n\n\"Episteme\" is a philosophical term derived from the Ancient Greek word ἐπιστήμη \"epistēmē\", which can refer to knowledge, science or understanding, and which comes from the verb , meaning \"to know, to understand, or to be acquainted with\". \n\nPlato contrasts episteme with \"doxa\": common belief or opinion. Episteme is also distinguished from \"techne\": a craft or applied practice. The word \"epistemology\" is derived from episteme.\n\nThe French philosopher Michel Foucault used the term \"épistémè\" in a specialized sense in his work \"The Order of Things\" to mean the historical, but non-temporal, \"a priori\" which grounds knowledge and its discourses and thus represents the condition of their possibility within a particular epoch. \n\nIn subsequent writings, he made it clear that several \"épistémè\" may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. But he did not discard the concept:\nYet in Foucault's \"The Order of Things\" he describes \"épistémè\" as:\n\nHowever, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. (Foucault, 168)\n\nFoucault's use of \"épistémè\" has been asserted as being similar to Thomas Kuhn's notion of a \"paradigm\", as for example by Jean Piaget. However, there are decisive differences. \n\nWhereas Kuhn's \"paradigm\" is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's \"episteme\" is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the \"episteme\" of the epoch). \n\nKuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions. Foucault's \"episteme\" is something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the resultant configuration of knowledge of a particular \"episteme\" is, to Foucault, based on a set of primordial, fundamental assumptions that are so basic to the \"episteme\" that they're experientially \"invisible\" to the constituents (such as people, organizations, or systems) operating within the \"episteme.\"\n\nMoreover, Kuhn's concept corresponds to what Foucault calls \"theme\" or theory of a science, but Foucault analyzed how \"opposing\" theories and themes could \"co-exist\" within a science. Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that \"one\" paradigm always \"is\" pervading, except under paradigmatic transition). \n\nFoucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though ideology may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how ideology actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of ideology. \"Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its \"general politics” of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true.\" Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are possibly influenced by the French philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard's notion of an \"epistemological rupture\", as indeed was Althusser.\n\nIn 1997, Judith Butler used the concept of episteme in her book \"\", examining the use of speech-act theory for political purposes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1056084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1056084", "title": "Experimental film", "text": "Experimental film\n\nExperimental film, experimental cinema or avant-garde cinema is a mode of filmmaking that rigorously re-evaluates cinematic conventions and explores non-narrative forms and alternatives to traditional narratives or methods of working. Many experimental films, particularly early ones, relate to arts in other disciplines: painting, dance, literature and poetry, or arise from research and development of new technical resources.\n\nWhile some experimental films have been distributed through mainstream channels or even made within commercial studios, the vast majority have been produced on very low budgets with a minimal crew or a single person and are either self-financed or supported through small grants.\n\nExperimental filmmakers generally begin as amateurs, and some used experimental films as a springboard into commercial film making or transitioned into academic positions. The aim of experimental filmmaking is usually to render the personal vision of an artist, or to promote interest in new technology rather than to entertain or to generate revenue, as is the case with commercial films. \n\nThe term describes a range of filmmaking styles that are generally quite different from, and often opposed to, the practices of mainstream commercial and documentary filmmaking. \"Avant-garde\" is also used, for the films shot in the twenties in the field of history's avant-gardes currents in France, Germany or Russia, to describe this work, and \"underground\" was used in the sixties, though it has also had other connotations. Today the term \"experimental cinema\" prevails, because it's possible to make experimental films without the presence of any avant-garde movement in the cultural field.\n\nWhile \"experimental\" covers a wide range of practice, an experimental film is often characterized by the absence of linear narrative, the use of various abstracting techniques—out-of-focus, painting or scratching on film, rapid editing—the use of asynchronous (non-diegetic) sound or even the absence of any sound track. The goal is often to place the viewer in a more active and more thoughtful relationship to the film. At least through the 1960s, and to some extent after, many experimental films took an oppositional stance toward mainstream culture.\n\nMost such films are made on very low budgets, self-financed or financed through small grants, with a minimal crew or, often a crew of only one person, the filmmaker. Some critics have argued that much experimental film is no longer in fact \"experimental\" but has in fact become a mainstream film genre. Many of its more typical features—such as a non-narrative, impressionistic, or poetic approaches to the film's construction—define what is generally understood to be \"experimental\".\n\nTwo conditions made Europe in the 1920s ready for the emergence of experimental film. First, the cinema matured as a medium, and highbrow resistance to the mass entertainment began to wane. Second, avant-garde movements in the visual arts flourished. The Dadaists and Surrealists in particular took to cinema. René Clair's \"Entr'acte\" (1924) featuring Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Man Ray, and with music by Erik Satie, took madcap comedy into nonsequitur.\n\nArtists Hans Richter, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, Germaine Dulac, and Viking Eggeling all contributed Dadaist/Surrealist shorts. Fernand Léger, Dudley Murphy, and Man Ray created the film \"Ballet Mécanique\" (1924), sometimes described as Dadaist, Cubist, or Futurist. Duchamp created the abstract film \"Anémic Cinéma\" (1926).\n\nAlberto Cavalcanti directed \"Rien que les heures\" (1926), Walter Ruttmann directed \"\" (1927), and Dziga Vertov filmed \"Man With a Movie Camera\" (1929), experimental \"city symphonies\" of Paris, Berlin, and Kiev, respectively.\n\nThe most famous experimental film is generally considered to be Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí's \"Un chien andalou\" (1929). Hans Richter's animated shorts, Oskar Fischinger's abstract films, and Len Lye's GPO films would be excellent examples of more abstract European avant-garde films. \n\nWorking in France, another group of filmmakers also financed films through patronage and distributed them through cine-clubs, yet they were narrative films not tied to an avant-garde school. Film scholar David Bordwell has dubbed these French Impressionists, and included Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Marcel L'Herbier, and Dimitri Kirsanoff. These films combine narrative experimentation, rhythmic editing and camerawork, and an emphasis on character subjectivity. \nIn 1952, the Lettrists avant-garde movement in France, caused riots at the Cannes Film Festival, when Isidore Isou's \"Traité de bave et d'éternité\" (also known as \"Venom and Eternity\") was screened. After their criticism of Charlie Chaplin at the 1952 press conference in Paris for Chaplin's \"Limelight\", there was a split within the movement. The Ultra-Lettrists continued to cause disruptions when they announced the death of cinema and showed their new hypergraphical techniques; the most notorious example is Guy Debord's \"Howlings in favor of de Sade\" (\"Hurlements en Faveur de Sade\") from 1952.\n\nThe Soviet filmmakers, too, found a counterpart to modernist painting and photography in their theories of montage. The films of Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Lev Kuleshov, Alexander Dovzhenko, and Vsevolod Pudovkin were instrumental in providing an alternative model from that offered by classical Hollywood. While not experimental films per se, they contributed to the film language of the avant-garde. \n\nThe U.S. had some avant-garde films before World War II, such as \"Manhatta\" (1921) by Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand, and \"\" (1928) by Slavko Vorkapich and Robert Florey. However, much pre-war experimental film culture consisted of artists working, often in isolation, on film projects. Painter Emlen Etting (1905–1993) directed dance films in the early 1930s that are considered experimental. Commercial artist (\"Saturday Evening Post\") and illustrator Douglass Crockwell (1904–1968) made animations with blobs of paint pressed between sheets of glass in his studio at Glens Falls, New York.\n\nIn Rochester, New York, medical doctor and philanthropist James Sibley Watson and Melville Webber directed \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" (1928) and \"Lot in Sodom\" (1933). Harry Smith, Mary Ellen Bute, artist Joseph Cornell, and Christopher Young made several European-influenced experimental films. Smith and Bute were both influenced by Oskar Fischinger, as were many avant garde animators and filmmakers. In 1930 appears the magazine \"Experimental Cinema\" with, for the first time, the two words directly connected without any space between them. The editors were Lewis Jacobs and David Platt. In October 2005, a large collection of films of that time were restored and re-released on DVD, titled \"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941\".\n\nWith Slavko Vorkapich, John Hoffman made two visual tone poems, \"Moods of the Sea\" (aka \"Fingal's Cave\", 1941) and \"Forest Murmurs\" (1947). The former film is set to Felix Mendelssohn's \"Hebrides Overture\" and was restored in 2004 by film preservation expert David Shepard.\n\n\"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (1943) by Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid is considered by some to be one of the first important American experimental films. It provided a model for self-financed 16 mm production and distribution, one that was soon picked up by Cinema 16 and other film societies. Just as importantly, it established an aesthetic model of what experimental cinema could do. \"Meshes\" had a dream-like feel that hearkened to Jean Cocteau and the Surrealists, but equally seemed personal, new and American. Early works by Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Shirley Clarke, Gregory Markopoulos, Jonas Mekas, Willard Maas, Marie Menken, Curtis Harrington, Sidney Peterson, Lionel Rogosin, and Earle M. Pilgrim followed in a similar vein. Significantly, many of these filmmakers were the first students from the pioneering university film programs established in Los Angeles and New York. In 1946, Frank Stauffacher started the \"Art in Cinema\" series of experimental films at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where Oskar Fischinger's films were featured in several special programs, influencing artists such as Jordan Belson and Harry Smith to make experimental animation.\n\nThey set up \"alternative film programs\" at Black Mountain College (now defunct) and the San Francisco Art Institute. Arthur Penn taught at Black Mountain College, which points out the popular misconception in both the art world and Hollywood that the avant-garde and the commercial never meet. Another challenge to that misconception is the fact that late in life, after each's Hollywood careers had ended, both Nicholas Ray and King Vidor made avant-garde films.\n\nThe film society and self-financing model continued over the next two decades, but by the early 1960s, a different outlook became perceptible in the work of American avant-garde filmmakers. Artist Bruce Conner created early examples such as \"A Movie\" (1958) and \"Cosmic Ray\" (1962). As P. Adams Sitney has pointed out, in the work of Stan Brakhage and other American experimentalists of early period, film is used to express the individual consciousness of the maker, a cinematic equivalent of the first person in literature. Brakhage's \"Dog Star Man\" (1961–64) exemplified a shift from personal confessional to abstraction, and also evidenced a rejection of American mass culture of the time. On the other hand, Kenneth Anger added a rock sound track to his \"Scorpio Rising\" (1963) in what is sometimes said to be an anticipation of music videos, and included some camp commentary on Hollywood mythology. Jack Smith and Andy Warhol incorporated camp elements into their work, and Sitney posited Warhol's connection to structural film.\n\nSome avant-garde filmmakers moved further away from narrative. Whereas the New American Cinema was marked by an oblique take on narrative, one based on abstraction, camp and minimalism, Structural-Materialist filmmakers like Hollis Frampton and Michael Snow created a highly formalist cinema that foregrounded the medium itself: the frame, projection, and most importantly, time. It has been argued that by breaking film down into bare components, they sought to create an anti-illusionist cinema, although Frampton's late works owe a huge debt to the photography of Edward Weston, Paul Strand, and others, and in fact celebrate illusion. Further, while many filmmakers began making rather academic \"structural films\" following \"Film Culture\"'s publication of an article by P. Adams Sitney in the late 1960s, many of the filmmakers named in the article objected to the term.\n\nA critical review of the structuralists appeared in a 2000 edition of the art journal \"Art In America\". It examined structural-formalism as a conservative philosophy of filmmaking.\n\nConceptual art in the 1970s pushed even further. Robert Smithson, a California-based artist, made several films about his earthworks and attached projects. Yoko Ono made conceptual films, the most notorious of which is \"Rape,\" which finds a woman and invades her life with cameras following her back to her apartment as she flees from the invasion. Around this time a new generation was entering the field, many of whom were students of the early avant-gardists. Leslie Thornton, Peggy Ahwesh, and Su Friedrich expanded upon the work of the structuralists, incorporating a broader range of content while maintaining a self-reflexive form.\n\nAndy Warhol, the man behind Pop Art and a variety of other oral and art forms, made over 60 films throughout the 1960s, most of them experimental. In more recent years, filmmakers such as Craig Baldwin and James O'Brien (\"Hyperfutura\") have made use of stock footage married to live action narratives in a form of mash-up cinema that has strong socio-political undertones.\n\nLaura Mulvey's writing and filmmaking launched a flourishing of feminist filmmaking based on the idea that conventional Hollywood narrative reinforced gender norms and a patriarchal gaze. Their response was to resist narrative in a way to show its fissures and inconsistencies. Chantal Akerman and Sally Potter are just two of the leading feminist filmmakers working in this mode in the 1970s. Video art emerged as a medium in this period, and feminists like Martha Rosler and Cecelia Condit took full advantage of it.\n\nIn the 1980s feminist, gay and other political experimental work continued, with filmmakers like Barbara Hammer, Su Friedrich, Tracey Moffatt, Sadie Benning and Isaac Julien among others finding experimental format conducive to their questions about identity politics.\n\nThe queercore movement gave rise to a number experimental queer filmmakers such as G.B. Jones (a founder of the movement) in the 1990s and later Scott Treleaven, among others.\n\nWith very few exceptions, Curtis Harrington among them, the artists involved in these early movements remained outside the mainstream commercial cinema and entertainment industry. A few taught occasionally, and then, starting in 1966, many became professors at universities such as the State Universities of New York, Bard College, California Institute of the Arts, the Massachusetts College of Art, University of Colorado at Boulder, and the San Francisco Art Institute.\n\nMany of the practitioners of experimental film do not in fact possess college degrees themselves, although their showings are prestigious. Some have questioned the status of the films made in the academy, but longtime film professors such as Stan Brakhage, Ken Jacobs, Ernie Gehr, and many others, continued to refine and expand their practice while teaching. The inclusion of experimental film in film courses and standard film histories, however, has made the work more widely known and more accessible.\n\nBeginning in 1946, Frank Stauffacher ran the \"Art in Cinema\" program of experimental and avant-garde films at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1975, the —located in Knokke-Heist, Belgium—was the most prominent festival of experimental cinema in the World. It permits the discovery of American avant-garde in 1958 with Brakhage's films and many others European and American filmmakers.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1963, the New York-based Cinema 16 functioned as the primary exhibitor and distributor of experimental film in the United States. Under the leadership of Amos Vogel and Marcia Vogel, Cinema 16 flourished as a nonprofit membership society committed to the exhibition of documentary, avant-garde, scientific, educational, and performance films to ever-increasing audiences.\n\nIn 1962, Jonas Mekas and about 20 other film makers founded The Film-Makers' Cooperative in New York City. Soon similar artists cooperatives were formed in other places: Canyon Cinema in San Francisco, the London Film-Makers' Co-op, and Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Center.\n\nFollowing the model of Cinema 16, experimental films have been exhibited mainly outside of commercial theaters in small film societies, microcinemas, museums, art galleries, archives and film festivals. \n\nSeveral other organizations in both Europe and North America helped develop experimental film. These included Anthology Film Archives in New York City, The Millennium Film Workshop, the British Film Institute in London, the National Film Board of Canada and the Collective for Living Cinema.\n\nSome of the more popular film festivals, such as Ann Arbor Film Festival, the New York Film Festival's \"Views from the Avant-Garde\" Side Bar and the International Film Festival Rotterdam prominently feature experimental works.\n\nThe New York Underground Film Festival, Chicago Underground Film Festival, the LA Freewaves Experimental Media Arts Festival, MIX NYC the New York Experimental Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and Toronto's Images Festival also support this work and provide venues for films which would not otherwise be seen. There is some dispute about whether \"underground\" and \"avant-garde\" truly mean the same thing and if challenging non-traditional cinema and fine arts cinema are actually fundamentally related. \n\nVenues such as Anthology Film Archives, San Francisco Cinematheque, Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California, Tate Modern, London and the Centre Pompidou in Paris often include historically significant experimental films and contemporary works. Screening series no longer in New York that featured experimental work include the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema, Ocularis and the Collective for Living Cinema.\n\nSome distributors of experimental film today include Le Collectif Jeune Cinema, Cinédoc, and Light Cone in Paris, Canyon Cinema in San Francisco, Canadian Filmmaker's Distribution Centre, The Film-Makers' Cooperative in New York, and Lux in London. Sixteen mm prints are still available through these organisations, and some archives. Center for Visual Music distributes curated film programs of experimental animation, including that of Oskar Fischinger, Jordan Belson, Mary Ellen Bute and others.\n\nAll these associations and movements have permitted the birth and development of national experimental films and schools like “body cinema” (\"Écoles du corps\" or \"Cinéma corporel\") and “post-structural” movements in France, and “structural/materialism\" in England for example.\n\nThough experimental film is known to a relatively small number of practitioners, academics and connoisseurs, it has influenced and continues to influence cinematography, visual effects and editing. \n\nThe genre of music video can be seen as a commercialization of many techniques of experimental film. Title design and television advertising have also been influenced by experimental film. \n\nMany experimental filmmakers have also made feature films, and vice versa. Notable examples include Lars von Trier, Jørgen Leth, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Nikos Nikolaidis, Jean-Luc Godard, Steven Soderbergh, Kathryn Bigelow , Stanley Kubrick, Woody Allen , Curtis Harrington, Oscar-winning animator Richard Williams , Andy Warhol, Peter Greenaway, Derek Jarman, Harmony Korine, Jean Cocteau, Isaac Julien, British Oscar winner Steve McQueen, Sally Potter, David Lynch, Federico Fellini, James O'Brien, Vassilis Mazomenos, Thierry Zéno, Patrick Bokanowski, Gus Van Sant, Shaun Wilson, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Simone Rapisarda Casanova and Luis Buñuel, although the degree to which their feature filmmaking takes on mainstream commercial aesthetics differs widely.\n\n\n"}

The speakers of Fala live in the towns of Valverde del Fresno (Valverdi du Fresnu), Eljas (As Ellas) and San Martín de Trevejo (Sa Martín de Trebellu).\n\nOther names sometimes used for the language are \"Fala de Jálama\" or \"Fala de Xálima\", but neither of them is used by the speakers themselves, who call their linguistic varieties \"lagarteiru\" (in Eljas), \"manhegu\" / \"mañegu\" (in San Martín de Trevejo) and \"valverdeiru\" (in Valverde del Fresno).\n\nEven though it has no official status, and has little presence in schools and church, use of the language is vigorous, and the literacy rate in Fala is nearly 100%. As a linguistic community, speakers have a strong, independent identity; they have rejected implementing a standard orthography similar to or based on the Galician one. A translation of the New Testament has been published in Fala (2015).\n\nIn the Middle Ages we can find mixed varieties of Portuguese and Leonese throughout the border between Leon and Portugal, represented in texts as in the \"Foro de Castelo Rodrigo\" (13th century); and although there is no documentation about the colonization and repopulation in this place in the 13th century, there are several hypothesis of Galician citizens moved to protect the frontiers against Muslims as a punishment imposed by the Leonese king, or the delivery of the territories to various military orders by Alfonso IX and Fernando II.\n\nGenerally speaking, philologists in favor of the Galician theory are based in the hypothesis that the valley is an isolated region and, therefore, the Galician colonists maintain their way of speaking in a \"pure\" form because of the lack of external influences. This thesis is refuted if we contrast it with other historic data:\n\n\nOn August 3, 1992, the association \"Fala i Cultura\" was founded, among its goals being the compilation of a common grammar (based on the Galician one) and the commemoration of \"u día da nosa fala\" (the day of our language) celebrated once a year from 1992 in Eljas, 1993 in Valverde and 1994 in San Martín.\n\nIt was not until 1998 that the first literary work in Fala was published: \"Seis sainetes valverdeiros\", written by Isabel López Lajas and published in 1998 by Edicións Positivas (Santiago de Compostela). It was on this date that the Gabinete de Iniciativas Transfronterizas (Office of Cross-Border Initiatives) started to take interest in Fala and to promote its study, publishing in 1999 scientific works and celebrating in May a \"Congress on \"A Fala\"\".\n\nOn June 14, 2000, Fala was recognized by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Extremadura as Bien de Interés Cultural. Nowadays, although the inhabitants of Jalama Valley can speak Spanish, most of them are bilingual because at home and in other activities outside school, they continue using the local language.\n\nIn 1992, a survey conducted by José Enrique Gargallo Gil (a professor at the University of Barcelona) collected the following data regarding the use of Spanish in family conversation:\n\nIn September/December 1993 a survey was published in issue No. 30 of \"Alcántara\" Magazine by José Luis Martín Galindo, which showed the following percentages of self-identification in San Martín de Trevejo:\n\nThe survey involved only twenty people (over 960 neighbours) and that there was no alternative to answer that the respondent believed that Fala is a dialect of Galician. It is argued that the absence of this option was logical since theories about the possible relation of Fala with Galician were hardly known.\n\nIn 1994, a new study showed that 80% of respondents learned to speak Spanish in school, the percentage of speech used in the family environment being as follows:\n\n"}
{"id": "656112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=656112", "title": "Francisco Balagtas", "text": "Francisco Balagtas\n\nFrancisco Balagtas (born Francisco Baltazar y de la Cruz; April 2, 1788 – February 20, 1862), also known as Francisco Baltazar, was a prominent Filipino poet, and is widely considered one of the greatest Filipino literary laureates for his impact on Filipino literature. The famous epic, \"Florante at Laura\", is regarded as his defining work.\n\nThe surname \"Baltazar\", sometimes misconstrued as a pen name, was a legal surname Balagtas adopted after the 1849 edict of Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua, which mandated that the native population adopt standard Spanish surnames instead of native ones.\nHis mentor was José de la Cruz, otherwise known as \"Joseng Sisiw\".\n\nFrancisco Balagtas Baltazar was born on April 2, 1788, in Barrio Panginay, Balagtas Bulacan; formerly Bigaa; He was the youngest of the four children of Juan Baltazar, a blacksmith, and Juana de la Cruz. He was baptized on April 30 that same year. He studied Canon Law, Philosophy, Latin, and the Classics in Colegio San Juan de Letran\nand Colegio de San Jose. He finished school in 1812.\n\nBalagtas learned to write poetry from José de la Cruz (\"Joseng Sisiw\"), one of the most famous poets of Tondo, in return for chicks. It was De la Cruz himself who personally challenged Balagtas to improve his writing. Balagtas swore he would overcome Huseng Sisiw as he would not ask for anything in return as a poet.\n\nIn 1835, Balagtas moved to Pandacan, Manila, where he met María Asunción Rivera, who would effectively serve as the muse for his future works. She is referenced in \"Florante at Laura\" as 'Selya' and 'MAR'.\n\nBalagtas' affections for MAR were challenged by the influential Mariano Capule. The latter won the battle for MAR when he used his wealth to get Balagtas imprisoned. It was here that he wrote \"Florante at Laura\"—in fact, the events of this poem were meant to parallel his own situation.\n\nHe wrote his poems in the Tagalog language, during an age when Filipino writing was predominantly written in Spanish.\n\nBalagtas published \"Florante at Laura\" upon his release in 1838. He moved to Balanga, Bataan, in 1840 where he served as the assistant to the Justice of the Peace. He was also appointed as the translator of the court. He married Juana Tiambeng on July 22, 1842 in a ceremony officiated by Fr. Cayetano Arellano, uncle of future Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the Philippines -- Chief Justice Arellano. They had eleven children but only four survived to adulthood. On November 21, 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua issued a decree that every Filipino native must adopt a Spanish surname. In 1856, he was appointed as the Major Lieutenant, but soon after was convicted and sent to prison again in Bataan under the accusation that he ordered Alferez Lucas' housemaid's head to be shaved.\n\nHe sold his land and all of his riches, in order for him to be imprisoned in 1861, and continued writing poetry, along with translating Spanish documents, but he died a year later -- on February 20, 1862, at the age of 73. Upon his deathbed, he asked the favor that none of his children become poets like him, who had suffered under his gift as well as under others. He even went as far as to tell them it would be better to cut their hands off than let them be writers.\n\nBalagtas is greatly idolized in the Philippines that the term for Filipino debate in extemporaneous verse is named after him: \"Balagtasan\".\n\nAn elementary school was erected in honor of Balagtas, the Francisco Balagtas Elementary School (FBES), located along Alvarez Street in Santa Cruz, Manila. There is also a plaza and park (Plaza Balagtas) erected in Pandacan, Manila while most of the streets were named after various Florante at Laura characters in honor of Francisco Balagtas. His birthplace, Bigaa, Bulacan, was renamed to Balagtas, Bulacan in his memory. A museum, historical marker, monument and elementary school has been placed in his birthplace at Panginay, Balagtas, Bulacan. The former Folk Arts Theater in Manila was renamed to Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas to honor Balagtas. Mercurian crater was also named after him. The barangay of Udyong in Orion, Bataan was also renamed Balagtas.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, Google celebrated Balagtas' 230th birthday celebration with a Google Doodle.\n\nNo original manuscript in Balagtas' handwriting of any of his works has survived to the present day. This is due mainly to two great fires that razed Udyong (Now Balagtas in Orion, Bataan) and destroyed much of the poet's works. The most notable of his works, \"Florante at Laura\" or \"Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at Laura sa Kaharian ng Albanya\" has been published in numerous editions from its original publication in 1838. The oldest extant edition of the Florante is believed to be the 1861 edition published in Manila, while a handwritten manuscript written down by Apolinario Mabini exists and is in the possession of the Philippine National Library. \n\n<br>The major source of the poet's life and works is from a 20th-century work entitled \"Kun Sino ang Kumatha ng Florante\" (He who wrote the Florante) by Hermenigildo Cruz. The poet lists down Balagtas' works and recreates some of his plays based on scenes and lines memorized by the poet's children. The book also has an edition of the Florante. Balagtas wrote ten (10) comedias and one (1) metrical romance according to Cruz as well as numerous other poems and short plays that are recorded in his book. These include two (2) \"laos\" or short celebratory scenes usually involving a patron saint and performed during fiestas.\n\nOnly 3 of Balagtas' works survived complete and intact to this day. Out of the 3, \"Florante at Laura\" is considered Balagtas' defining work and is a cultural touchstone for the Philippines.\n\nMajority of the source material for Balagtas' work come from Hermenigildo Cruz' book which itself is based on the surviving testimonies and memories of Balagtas' children at the turn of the century. In his book, he reconstructs five (5) plays.\n\nAs a folk poet and employee of the courts, Balagtas' prowess in writing was mainly seen in the yearly fiestas held in nearby towns, a great majority of his plays may have been staged in outdoor theaters set up in town squares and as a poet, a number of his works and writings have been recorded in collections of poetry such as the \"Coleccion de refranes, frases y modismos tagalos\" (Guadalupe, 1890) as well as in the accounts of Spanish officials such as Martinez de Zuniga who recorded traditional plays and religious events in Philippine fiestas. \n\nBalagtas also wrote in the Ladino style of poems that were popular among his contemporaries. He is said to have written two (2) loas recorded in Cruz's book as well as numerous Ladinos and didactic works.\n\n\nA number of Minor poems are recorded in Cruz's book.\n\nFive (5) of the ten (10) plays Balagtas wrote as recorded by Cruz are considered lost. Another work, \"Claus\" a translation work from Latin is considered lost for Cruz does not mention any fragments or elaborates on it in his book, Eufronio Alip's 1930 Tagalog literary history mentions the same book. Among his other lost works, one should consider plays and short poems written by Balagtas in his lifetime for fiestas and celebrations as well as to earn his living. Eufronio Alip, in his 1930 historical study on Tagalog literature, also provides an additional two (2) titles of plays by Balagtas.\n\n\n"}

Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”\n\n[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.<br>— \"Structure, Sign and Play\" in \"Writing and Difference\", p. 278\n\n"}

Bouveresse has been called \"an \"avis rara\" among the better known French philosophers in his championing of critical standards of thought.\"\n\nHe is now Professor Emeritus at the Collège de France where until 2010 he held the chair of philosophy of language and epistemology. His disciple Claudine Tiercelin was appointed to a chair of metaphysics and philosophy of knowledge upon his retirement.\n\nBorn on 20 August 1940 in Épenoy in the Doubs département of France into a farming family, Jacques Bouveresse completed his secondary education at the seminary of Besançon. He spent two years of preparation for the baccalauréat in philosophy and scholastic theology at Faverney in Haute-Saône. He followed his preparatory literary classes at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, and in 1961 entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.\n\nHe presented his doctoral thesis in philosophy on Wittgenstein, entitled \"Le mythe de l'intériorité. Expérience, signification et langage privé chez Wittgenstein\" .\n\nBeginning with his earliest works, he has consistently constructed his own philosophical and intellectual path, without following the normal routes and modes of academia. In 1976, Wittgenstein was practically unknown in France, as were Musil and the logic and analytical philosophy which he had begun to study in the 1960s. These two last domains notably propelled him towards the lectures of Jules Vuillemin and Gilles Gaston Granger, who at the time were practically alone in occupying themselves with these problems, and with whom he has maintained a lasting friendship.\nAcademic career : \n\nBouveresse's philosophy is a continuation of the intellectual and philosophical tradition of central Europe (Brentano, Boltzmann, Helmholtz, Frege, the Vienna Circle, Kurt Gödel). His philosophical programme is in nearly all respects similar to the one conducted by many present day Analytic philosophers.\n\nJacques Bouveresse is interested in the thought of the early 20th-century Austrian novelist Robert Musil (who wrote a thesis on philosophy), famous for his novel \"The Man Without Qualities\", as well as the aversion/fascination with which Paul Valéry regarded philosophy.\n\nApart from his work on Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Bouveresse is interested in the incompleteness theorems of Kurt Gödel and their philosophical consequences. It is on this account that he has attacked, in a popular work \"Prodiges et vertiges de l'analogie\", the use made of these theorems by Régis Debray. Bouveresse denounces the literary distortion of a scientific concept for the purpose of a thesis. This distortion, according to him, has no other purpose than to overwhelm a readership which lacks the training necessary to comprehend such complex theorems. Bouveresse's reproach to Debray is not that he uses a scientific concept for the purpose of an analogy, but that he uses such a difficult to understand theorem in the attempt to provide an absolute justification in the form of the classic sophism of the argument from authority.\n\nAccording to Bouveresse, the incompleteness of a formal system which applies to \"certain\" mathematical systems in no way implies the incompleteness of sociology, which is not a formal system.\n\n\n"}

Carroll was best known for his 1978 autobiographical work \"The Basketball Diaries\"; the book inspired a 1995 film of the same title that starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Carroll.\n\nCarroll was born to a working-class family of Irish descent, and grew up in New York City's Lower East Side. When he was about 11 (in the sixth grade) his family moved north to Inwood in Upper Manhattan. He was taught by the LaSalle Christian Brothers, and his brother in the sixth grade noted that he could write and encouraged him to do so. In fall 1963, he entered public school, but was soon awarded a scholarship to the elite Trinity School. He attended Trinity from 1964 to 1968. Carroll was a basketball star in high school, but also developed an addiction to heroin. Carroll became sober in the 1970s.\n\nHe briefly attended Wagner College and Columbia University.\n\nCarroll identified Rainer Maria Rilke, Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, James Schuyler, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs as influences on his artistic career.\n\nCarroll's marriage to Rosemary Carroll ended in divorce, but the two remained friends. He also dated Patti Smith.\n\nWhile still in high school, Carroll published his first collection of poems, \"Organic Trains.\" Already attracting the attention of the local literati, his work began appearing in the Poetry Project's magazine \"The World\" in 1967. Soon his work was being published in elite literary magazines like \"Paris Review\" in 1968, and \"Poetry\" the following year. In 1970, his second collection of poems, \"4 Ups and 1 Down\" was published, and he started working for Andy Warhol. At first, he was writing film dialogue and inventing character names; later on, Carroll worked as the co-manager of Warhol's Theater. Carroll's first publication by a mainstream publisher (Grossman Publishers), the poetry collection \"Living at the Movies\", was published in 1973.\n\nIn 1978, Carroll published \"The Basketball Diaries,\" an autobiographical book concerning his life as a teenager in New York City's hard drug culture. \"Diaries\" is an edited collection of the diaries he kept between the ages of 12 and 16, detailing his sexual experiences, high school basketball career, and his addiction to heroin, which began when he was 13.\n\nIn 1987, Carroll wrote a second memoir, \"Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries 1971–1973,\" continuing his autobiography into his early adulthood in the New York City music and art scene as well as his struggle to kick his drug habit.\n\nAfter working as a musician, Carroll returned to writing full-time in the mid-1980s and began to appear regularly on the spoken-word circuit. Starting in 1991, Carroll performed readings from his then-in-progress first novel, \"The Petting Zoo\".\n\nIn 1995, Canadian filmmaker John L'Ecuyer adapted \"Curtis's Charm\", a short story from Carroll's 1993 book \"Fear of Dreaming\", into the film \"Curtis's Charm\".\n\nIn 1978, after he moved to California to get a fresh start since overcoming his heroin addiction, Carroll formed The Jim Carroll Band, a new wave/punk rock group, with encouragement from Patti Smith, with whom he once shared an apartment in New York City, along with Robert Mapplethorpe. He performed a spoken word piece with the Patti Smith Group in San Diego when the support band dropped out at the last moment. The band was originally called Amsterdam, where they originally formed and were based in Bolinas, California. The musicians were Steve Linsley (bass), Wayne Woods (drums), Brian Linsley and Terrell Winn (guitars). They released a single \"People Who Died\", from their 1980 debut album, \"Catholic Boy\". The album featured contributions from Allen Lanier and Bobby Keys.\n\nThe song also appeared in the 1985 Kim Richards vehicle \"Tuff Turf\" starring James Spader and Robert Downey Jr., which also featured a cameo appearance by the band, as well as 2004's \"Dawn of the Dead\", and in the 2015 \"Mr. Robot\" S1 E10. It was featured in the 1995 film \"The Basketball Diaries\" (based on Jim Carroll's autobiography), and was covered by John Cale on his \"Antártida\" soundtrack. The song's title was based on a poem by Ted Berrigan. Later albums were \"Dry Dreams\" (1982) and \"I Write Your Name\" (1983), both with contributions from Lenny Kaye and Paul Sanchez (guitar). Carroll also collaborated with musicians Lou Reed, Blue Öyster Cult, Boz Scaggs, Ray Manzarek of The Doors, Pearl Jam, Electric Light Orchestra and Rancid.\n\nCarroll, 60, died of a heart attack at his Manhattan home on September 11, 2009. At the time of his death, he was in ill health due to pneumonia and hepatitis C. He was reportedly working at his desk when he died.\n\nHis funeral Mass was held at Our Lady of Pompeii Roman Catholic Church on Carmine St. in Greenwich Village.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53436174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53436174", "title": "Justus Hiddes Halbertsma", "text": "Justus Hiddes Halbertsma\n\nJustus Hiddes Halbertsma, West Frisian form: Joast Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [jo.ǝst ˈhɪdəs ˈhɔlbǝtsma] (the r is silent); Dutch form: Joost Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [joːst ˈhɪdəs ˈhalbǝrtsma] (October 23, 1789 in Grou – February 27, 1869 in Deventer), was a Dutch Frisian writer, poet, minister, lexicographer and linguist. Today, he is primarily known for the poetry and short story collection \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\", which he wrote with his brother Eeltsje, publishing the first edition in 1822. Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, Tsjalling, until all the Halbertsma Brothers' prose and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work \"Rimen en Teltsjes\". Although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critcs, it is undeniable that \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.\n\nJustus Hiddes Halbertsma was born on October 23, 1789, in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland, in the house of his parents on Kowemerk (\"Cow Market\") street. He was the eldest son of the baker and small-time merchant Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809) and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809). He had three younger brothers: Tsjalling (1792–1852), Binnert (1795–1847), and Eeltsje (1797–1858). Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The four brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age and the others were even younger. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life, were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.\n\nRuerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title \"Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland\" (\"Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.\n\nIn 1858, Justus Halbertsma explained the difference between his parents' families when he wrote: \"One cannot deny the Halbertsmas a greater skillfulness, speed of thought, a greater adroitness, quickness, and talent than the family of Ruerdtsje Tsjallings; but wat help was that to them against the poverty which overcame most of them, while Ruerdtsje Tsjallings' family for the most part maintain prosperity to this day as part of the dignified middle class?\" Against the superior power of those who calmly and calculatedly grew rich, he wrote somewhere else, the Halbertsmas could only \"avenge themselves through satire.\"\n\nHalbertsma's mother Ruerdtsje was the main force behind the thorough education her sons received. Justus she sent to the French school in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden for a year, and after that, she enrolled him in the Latin school in Leeuwarden from 1801 to 1806. At the advice of his mother and the Mennonite minister Jan Brouwer, from Leeuwarden, Justus Halbertsma chose a clerical career, for which he studied theology at the Mennonite Seminary in Amsterdam from 1807 to 1813. In that period he also immersed himself in the study of the North Germanic languages. In 1814, Halbertsma became minister in Bolsward, where he remained until 1821. Afterwards, he served the Mennonite congregation in the city of Deventer, in the province of Overijssel, from 1822 to his retirement in 1856.\nHalbertsma married Johanna Iskjen Hoekema (1794–1847), a Mennonite minister's daughter from Workum, who came from a well-to-do middle-class family, on May 10, 1816. Through his wife Halbertsma attained possession of the farmstead Westerein, near Workum, where he and his family often spent a couple of weeks in summer. Apart from those holidays, he lived out his entire life in Deventer. Halbertsma and his wife had five sons from a good marriage, which was however not without its share of problems. Of these sons Petrus, Hidde, and Tsjalling studied linguistics or medicine, while Watse en Binnert became mariners. As a father, Halbertsma experienced a large amount of grief, as his son Petrus died in 1851 in a psychiatric hospital, while Binnert passed away in 1861, and Hidde took his own life in 1865.\n\nHalbertsma had been greatly influenced in his student years by his acquaintance with the well-to-do and influential Amsterdam merchant Jeronimo de Vries, who championed a national art, inspired by the Dutch Golden Age. These ideas flew in the face of more modern notions advocated by writers such as Hiëronymus van Alphen and Johannes Klinker. For Halbertsma, who was first and foremost a Frisian, and only secondly a Dutchman, this meant an orientation towards national Frisian ideals, from which emanated two goals he set himself in life. Firstly, he wanted to preserve the Western Frisian language by using it for writing again after it had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. From that it followed that he had to get the Frisians to read in their own language (otherwise, writing it would not be of much use), and that he should record the Frisian vocabulary in a dictionary, which would be the first dictionary ever of the Frisian language. And secondly, Halbertsma wanted to put renowned Frisian people from the past in the spotlight, to serve as an example for his contemporaries.\n\nTo attain his first goal, Halbertsma had to use his writings to penetrate the daily life of the Frisian people. This he achieved by authoring folk literature with his brother Eeltsje. The state and social status of the Western Frisian language at that time becomes clear if one observes the fact that Halbertsma and his brothers, though they laboured tirelessly for the use of Frisian as a written language for poetry and prose, lapsed into Dutch for their correspondence with each other, and apparently did not feel that was in any way strange. As Halbertsma remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and short fiction were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning. For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would describe Halbertsma later as the 'literary agent' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling. In 1822, their early works were collected under the title \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\" (\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\"; original, archaic spelling: \"De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor\"), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time.\n\nThe first edition of \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\", published in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only. Those were not sold, however, but at the expense of Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland. In that way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.\n\nA second, expanded edition of \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\", consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (\"De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar\"), 1840 (\"Twigen út in Alde Stamme\"), 1854 (\"Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen\"), and 1858 (\"De Jonkerboer\" and \"Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd\"). By the end of his life, Halbertsma assisted in the editing of a portion of \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" (\"Rhymes and Tales\"), the comprehensive publication in which all the Halbertsma Brothers' literary works were collected. He even wrote some new pieces for it, such as the short story \"It Grouwe Pak\" (\"The Thick Suit\").\n\nAs a writer, Halbertsma strongly sensed what the public needed, but at the same time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry, especially compared to the poems of his brother Eeltsje, who was a much more emotional writer. Nevertheless, at least some of Halbertsma's poems, for instance \"Sibbel fan De Ryp\" (\"Sibbel from De Ryp\") and \"Nacht\" (\"Night\") have made a lasting impression. That said, Halbertsma's short stories were much more acute thanks to his limber use of language, his lively style of writing, and the fact that he refused to mince his words, leading to a rough, scoffing, and sometimes darkly grim atmosphere. His subject-matter Halbertsma collected from various sources, including German and French oral literature, which he matchlessly revised and placed in Friesland. He was a non-conformist, whose sharp judgments of the works of others made him far from universally loved. Before everything else, Halbertsma as a writer was an essayist and a satirist, who liked to include topical political and social questions in his literary works. From the anecdotes of people who knew or met him, he emerges as a sharp-witted and extremely diligent man of capacious erudition who was a droll story-teller.\n\"It Boalserter Nut\" (\"The Bolsward Utility\" – the name of a gentlemen's club), which was published in \"De Lapekoer\", was Halbertsma's first short story of a more extended length. As is often the case with Halbertsma's stories, it consists of a frame-story in which several other more or less stand-alone components are absorbed, such as the essay \"It Jild\" (\"The Money\"). \"Miswier\" (\"Continuously Bad Weather\") and \"De Twadde Jûn\" (\"The Second Evening\") are also extensive frame-stories, and \"De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas\" (\"Boss Joute's Barbershop\") is a dialogue, which includes the intriguing and completely stand-alone story \"Heksershol\" (\"Hole of Witchcraft\" – an old nickname for the village of Molkwerum). The only time Halbertsma wrote a literary work entirely without the participation of Eeltsje, was in 1837, when he published \"Oan Eölus\" (\"To Aeolus\"), a story inspired by a great storm in 1830, in which a tornado has blown thoughts and motifs together like whirling leaves. \"Oan Eölus\" could perhaps be seen as a clue that Halbertsma harboured greater literary aspirations than would fit in the \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\".\n\nAnd yet, for all that, Halbertsma's literary works did not take centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non-fiction books. More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled \"Lexicon Frisicum\", for which he chose Latin as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised it along the lines of the German dictionary by the Brothers Grimm, but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long semantic etymologies, a part of the work for which he especially had a predilection. In the end, he never got past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a manuscript, which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872. In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his \"Lexicon Frisicum\" was used by de Frisian Academy to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part \"Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal\" (\"Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language\"; published 1984–2011).\n\nFurthermore, Halbertsma was the driving force behind the commemoration of the life of the famous 17th century Frisian poet Gysbert Japiks in 1823, which is seen by some as the starting point of the Frisian Movement. Afterwards he published an extensive literary history work under the title \"Hulde aan Gysbert Japiks\" (\"Hail to Gysbert Japiks\") in two parts in 1824 and 1827. In 1829 Halbertsma wrote \"Het Geslacht der Van Harens\" (\"The Lineage of the Van Harens\"), in which he primarily described the lives and literary works of the brothers and 18th century Dutch-language writers from Friesland Onno Zwier van Haren and Willem van Haren, whose work he admired greatly.\n\nHalbertsma was also the author of an 1836 biography of the Frisian poet Jan Cornelis Pieters Salverda (1783–1836), which almost has a naturalistic feel to it. In 1843 he published a historical work about the Mennonites, called \"De Doopsgezinden en Hunne Herkomst\" (\"The Mennonites and Their Origins\"), and in 1851 he followed this up with \"Aanteekeningen op het Vierde Deel van den Spiegel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant\" (\"Notes on Part Four of the Spiegel Historiael by Jacob van Maerlant). Furthermore, in 1858, at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, whom he had met in London, Halbertsma published \"It Ewangeelje fen Matthewes\", which was the first Frisian translation of the Biblical Gospel of Matthew (or of any gospel for that matter). This translation evoked a great deal of criticism from Halbertsma's contemporaries, who thought it was much too realistic; today, it still has an almost modern feel to it, showing that Halbertsma was far ahead of his time.\n\nHalbertsma had a reputation of being an erudite man, which he won at a young age. He was especially known as a scholar of the Germanic languages, and to the present day he is widely acknowledged to have been a larger-than-life figure in the field of linguistics. Shortly after returning to Friesland from his study in Amsterdam, friends from his student years who by then were occupying important posts within the civil service, introduced him to the social circles around the Frisian-minded provincial governor jonker Idsert Aebinga van Humalda. Later in life Halbertsma was acquainted with prominent Dutch literary figures, such as Willem Bilderdijk, and what's more, he maintained a lively correspondence with European greats, like the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask, the English poet Robert Southey, and the German linguist and fairytale-collector Jacob Grimm. Moreover, he was invited to join learned historical and linguistic societies in Leiden, Copenhagen, Berlin, Athens en Halle-Wittenberg.\n\nHence Halbertsma expected to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably played a role in this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced on the edge of a burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.\n\nIn part because of his linguistic erudition, Halbertsma has been named as the author of the infamous \"Oera Linda Book\", a falsified work which emerged in 1867 and was written in imitated Old Frisian. It pretended to be an early history of Friesland and the Frisian people, and for a while it was considered authentic, until it was exposed as a hoax. However, it is considered much more likely that the true author of the \"Oera Linda Book\" was the librarian Eelco Verwijs, who lead the Provincial Library of Friesland and who had befriended Halbertsma, or possibly the writer François Haverschmidt or the ship carpenter and self-taught freethinker Cornelis over de Linden. If Verwijs was the culprit, it is not thought to be impossible that Halbertsma tacitly or even openly provided him with advice. \nAfter his retirement, on October 26, 1856, which Halbertsma applied for himself because his heart was not in his duties as a minister anymore, he withdrew into his upstairs apartment, where from that point on he became increasingly more lonely as his family members and friends died away, although his foreign contacts through correspondence remained intact. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma died in Deventer on February 27, 1869, when he was 79 years of age. By that time he had been a widower for 22 years. He was survived by his sons Watse and Tsjalling. In 1947, the Dr. Joast Halbertsma Award, the highest provincial decoration in the field of historical (and later more general scientific) research concerning the province of Friesland was named in his honour.\n\nAfter the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" (\"Rhymes and Tales\"). This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critcs, it is undeniable that \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" and its predecessor \"De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar\" played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma's influence on subsequent Western Frisian literature was enormous and of incalculable value. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\" As of today \"Rimen en Teltsjes\" still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.\n\nOn his travels to England, Scotland, and Ireland, in 1852 and 1853, Halbertsma was impressed by the number of museums and cabinets of antiquities there were. This provided him with the idea to transfer his own collection of antiquities (originating for a major part in Hindeloopen, while the remainder came mostly from excavations of Frisian \"terps\") to the Province of Friesland. In 1853, the Cabinet of Antiquities of Friesland was formed out of his collection, which in 1881 became the Frisian Museum.\n\nHalbertsma also gave to the Province of Friesland, in part when he was still alive, his extensive library of scientific books, which was added to the Provincial Library of Friesland, en is to this day available for scientific research purposes at Tresoar. A large collection of letters written by and to Halbertsma, including hundreds to his brothers Eeltsje en Tsjalling, long remained in the custody of the Halbertsma family, until they were given, in the course of the 20th century, on permanent loan to the Frisian Literary Museum and Documention Centre (FLMD), which became part of Tresoar in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though many speakers do not live in villages, there are a number of population centers, notably Kamarang, Jawalla, Waramadong, and Kako. There are two dialects, Akawaio and Patamona.\n\nKapóng also goes by its Macushi name, \"Ingarikó\".\n\nThe Carib tribes practice an indigenous system of beliefs, one that dates back to the 16th century. It was not until the 19th century that attempts were made to understand the beliefs and practices of this tribe. Much of the Kapóng language refers back to sun worship and sun spirits, which is reflective of the beliefs system of these Carib-speaking tribes. Literature has also found belief in a higher being in the sky among the Carib tribes in Guyana.\n\nThe Kapóng language is found to be spoken in lowland tropical South America, particularly in the countries of Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela. In Guyana, Kapóng is spoken in forests by the Mazaruni River Basin. Speakers in Brazil are found in the Roraima Indigenous Terra Raposa. The number of speakers in Brazil is about 10,000, and the transmission of language in Brazil is deemed to be of good standing. In Venezuela, Kapóng is spoken in the states of Bolivar and Monagas.\n\nKapóng has three dialects as follows:\n\nThe allophones of /k s n/ are /ʔ tʃ ŋ/, as well as the allophones of /z/ being /ʃ ʒ dʒ/.\n\nMuch of the Kapóng language has emphasis on a higher spirit/god up in the sky, and this is reflected in the vocabulary in this language.\n\n\n\"yamok\" (aemvk) is an ending used to make words plural. (i.e.) Adding \"yamok\" to \"Kapong\" makes \"Kapong\" plural; \"Kapong yamok\".\n\n-\"da\" is a marker used to mark possession. (i.e.) \"kaata\" = book; \"da kaata\" = my book.\n\nThe word order of Kapóng is SOV (subject-object-verb), however, it is not rigid. There are cases where the object precedes the subject in sentences. An example of this is:\n\n\"Walawok yamàk uya molok yachi\"\n\nboys (plural) fish catch = the boys catch fish\n\nThere are no gender distinctions found in Kap\"ó\"ng, as there are no differences in personal pronoun systems and affixes to indicate genders of nouns.\n\nSimiles are often used in writing, as many words in this language allow this to occur. Through the use of suffixes, many words can be converted into similes. Examples are as follows:\n\n"}

It is likely that it influenced Volapük, Esperanto, and other language projects of the 19th century.\n\nThe phonology is undescribed, except that an \"n\" may be placed between vowels to avoid hiatus. \n\nThe sound inventory can only be deduced from the examples given. Vowels are \"a e i o ou u\"; \"donu\" 'will give' and \"donou\" 'gift' attest to a distinction between \"ou\" and \"u\" . The vowel of the past tense is sometimes written and sometimes , suggesting that the accent is merely a reminder that the letter is not silent, rather than marking a distinct vowel. From \"sinta\" 'hundred', cognate with \"cent\", it would seem that there may be nasalized vowels, for the French letters indicate a nasalized \"e\". That is, \"sinta\" is presumably to be pronounced or , not *.\n\nAttested consonants are:\n\nIt is possible that \"k, q, c\" all represent . The only illustrative words are \"ki, qui\" 'who, which' and \"co\" 'three', which show that \"k\" and \"qu\" are equivalent before \"i\". However, the lack of a numeral beginning with \"k\", to contrast with \"co\" 'three', suggests that \"k\" and \"c\" are also equivalent, and that \"co\" is to be pronounced . The lack of \"ch\" , as well as the few other consonants found in French, may merely be an accidental omission due to the small sample of vocabulary.\n\nVerbs inflect only for tense and aspect: Indicative present in \"-a\", future \"-u\", past (\"imparfait\") \"-e (-é),\" present perfect (\"parfait\") \"-i,\" past perfect \"-o.\" The subjunctive is formed by adding \"-r\" to the indicative: \"-ar, -ur, -er, -ir, -or\"; the infinitive by adding \"-s\": \"-as, -us, -es, -is, -os\". The present participle is in \"-ont\". \n\nThe present doubles as the imperative and, with the help of the verb \"sa\" 'to be', as the passive. The present subjunctive \"-ar\" may be used for the imperative as well. Questions are formed by inverting the pronoun and the verb, as in French. \n\nPerson is indicated by pronouns: \"jo\" (I), \"to\" (you singular, thou), \"lo\" (he, she, it), \"no\" (we), \"vo\" (you plural), \"zo\" (they), and the reflexive \"so\" (oneself). Possessive forms are \"me, te, se, noti, voti, se\". Demonstratives, \"soli\" (this) and \"sola\" (that), take plural \"-s\" (these, those). Who, what, which is \"ki\".\n\n\"Sofras\" 'to treat oneself' is given as an example of a reflexive verb; it's not clear if the initial \"s\" is a reflexive prefix, as in French \"s'offrir\", or part of the root. It is however invariable: \"jo sofra\" (I treat myself), \"to sofra\" (you treat yourself), etc.\n\nFor nouns, there are no cases, genders, or articles. The plural ends in \"-s,\" which unlike in French is pronounced. Augmentatives take \"-le (-lé)\", diminutives \"-li\":\n\nDeverbals end in \"-ou\": \n\nPrepositions are used:\n\nIt would seem there is no distinction between adjective and adverb, and adjectives do not agree in number with the noun.\n\nEach numeral starts with a different consonant, and are in alphabet order: \n\nOrdinals add \"-mu\": \"bamu\" first, \"comu\" second. \n\nNumbers are formed by juxtaposing numerals: Twenty-five is \"covuji\" (two-ten-five). \n\nThe consonants of the numerals one through nine are used as digits (in place of Arabic numerals), with o for zero, so \"25\" is written and \"100\" is written .\n\n"}

{"id": "19031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19031", "title": "Maltese language", "text": "Maltese language\n\nMaltese () is the national language of Malta and a co-official language of the country alongside English, while also serving as an official language of the European Union, the only Semitic language so distinguished. Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, the extinct variety of Arabic that developed in Sicily and was later introduced to Malta, between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century AD. \n\nMaltese has evolved independently of Literary Arabic and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation. Maltese is therefore considered an exceptional descendant of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic, and is classified separately from the Arabic macrolanguage. Maltese is also unique among Semitic languages since its morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian. \n\nThe original Semitic base (Siculo-Arabic) comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary, especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words, but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary. A recent study shows that, in terms of basic everyday language, speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic, which is related to Siculo-Arabic, whereas speakers of Tunisian are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese. This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between Arabic dialects. \n\nMaltese has always been written in the Latin script, the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages. It remains the only standardized Semitic language written in the Latin script.\n\nThe origins of the Maltese language are attributed to the arrival, early in the eleventh century, of settlers from neighbouring Sicily, where Siculo-Arabic was spoken, following the Fatimid Caliphate's conquest of the island at the end of the ninth century. This claim has been corroborated by genetic studies, which show that contemporary Maltese people share common ancestry with Sicilians and Calabrians, with little genetic input from North Africa and the Levant.\n\nThe Norman conquest in 1090, followed by the expulsion of the Muslims (complete by 1249) permanently isolated the vernacular from its Arabic source, creating the conditions for its evolution into a distinct language. In contrast to Sicily (where Siculo-Arabic became extinct, replaced by Sicilian), the vernacular in Malta continued to develop alongside Italian, eventually replacing it as official language in 1934 (alongside English).\n\nThe first written reference to the Maltese language is in a will of 1436, where it is called \"lingua maltensi\". The oldest known document in Maltese is \"Il Cantilena\" (\"Xidew il-Qada\") by Pietru Caxaro. It dates from the 15th century.\n\nThe earliest known Maltese dictionary was a sixteenth-century manuscript entitled \"Maltese-Italiano\"; it was included in the \"Biblioteca Maltese\" of Mifsud in 1764, but is now lost. A list of Maltese words was included in both the \"Thesaurus Polyglottus\" (1603) and \"Propugnaculum Europae\" (1606) of Hieronymus Megiser, who had visited Malta in 1588–89; Domenico Magri gave the etymologies of some Maltese words in his \"Hierolexicon, sive sacrum dictionarium\" (1677). An early manuscript dictionary, \"Dizionario Italiano e Maltese\", was discovered in the Biblioteca Vallicelliana in Rome in the 1980s, together with a grammar, the \"Regole per la Lingua Maltese\", attributed to a French Knight named Thezan. The first systematic lexicon is that of Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis, who also wrote the first systematic grammar of the language and proposed a standard orthography.\n\n\"SIL Ethnologue\" (2015) reports a total of 522,000 Maltese speakers, with 371,000 residing in Malta (close to 90% of Maltese population) according to the European Commission (2012). This implies a number of some 150,000 speakers in the Maltese diaspora. \nMost speakers are bilingual, the majority of speakers (345,000) regularly use English, and a reported 66,800 regularly use French. \n\nThe largest diaspora community of Maltese speakers is in Australia, with 36,000 speakers reported in 2006 (down from 45,000 in 1996, and expected to decline furtner).\n\nThe Maltese linguistic community in Tunisia originates in the 18th century. Numbering at several thousand in the 19th century, it was reported at only 100 to 200 people as of 2017.\n\nMaltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, a Semitic language within the Afroasiatic family, that in the course of its history has been influenced by Sicilian and Italian, to a lesser extent French, and more recently English. Today, the core vocabulary (including both the most commonly used vocabulary and function words) is Semitic, with large numbers of loanwords. Because of the Sicilian influence on Siculo-Arabic, Maltese has many language contact features and is most commonly described as a language with a large number of loanwords.\n\nThe Maltese language has historically been classified in various ways, with some claiming that the ancient Punic language (another Semitic language) was its origin instead of Siculo-Arabic, while others believed the language to be one of the Berber languages (another family within Afroasiatic), and under the Fascist Kingdom of Italy, it was classified as regional Italian.\n\nSIL reports six varieties, besides Standard Maltese:\nGozo, Port Maltese, Rural Central Maltese, Rural East Maltese, Rural West Maltese, and Zurrieq.\n\nUrban varieties of Maltese are closer to Standard Maltese than rural varieties, which have some characteristics that distinguish them from Standard Maltese. \nThey tend to show some archaic features such as the realization of kh and gh and the imāla of Arabic ā into ē (or ī especially in Gozo)-considered archaic because they are reminiscent of 15th century transcriptions of this sound. Another archaic feature is the realization of Standard Maltese ā as ō in rural dialects. \nThere is also a tendency to diphthongize simple vowels, e.g., ū becomes eo or eu. \nRural dialects also tend to employ more Semitic roots and broken plurals than Standard Maltese. In general, rural Maltese is less distant from its Siculo-Arabic ancestor than Standard Maltese.\n\nVoiceless stops are only lightly aspirated and voiced stops are fully voiced. Voicing is carried over from the last segment in obstruent clusters; thus, two- and three-obstruent clusters are either voiceless or voiced throughout, e.g. is realised \"we write\". Maltese has final-obstruent devoicing of voiced obstruents and voiceless stops have no audible release, making voiceless–voiced pairs phonetically indistinguishable.\n\nGemination is distinctive word-medially and word-finally in Maltese. The distinction is most rigid intervocalically after a stressed vowel. Stressed, word-final closed syllables with short vowels end in a long consonant, and those with a long vowel in a single consonant; the only exception is where historic and meant the compensatory lengthening of the succeeding vowel. Some speakers have lost length distinction in clusters.\n\nThe two nasals and assimilate for place of articulation in clusters. and are usually dental, whereas are all alveolar. are found mostly in words of Italian origin, retaining length (if not word-initial). and are only found in loanwords, e.g. \"newspaper\" and \"television\". The pharyngeal fricative is velar () or glottal () for some speakers.\n\nMaltese has five short vowels, , written \"a e i o u\"; six long vowels, , written \"a e ie i o u\"; and seven diphthongs: both written \"għi\", both written \"għu\", and written \"ew iw oj\".\n\nStress is generally on the penultimate syllable, unless some other syllable is heavy (has a long vowel or final consonant), or unless a stress-shifting suffix is added. (Suffixes marking gender, possession, and verbal plurals do not cause the stress to shift.)\n\nWhen two syllables are equally heavy, the penultimate takes the stress, but otherwise the heavier syllable does, e.g. \"bajjad\" 'he painted' vs \"bajjad\" 'a painter'.\n\nMany Classical Arabic consonants underwent mergers and modifications in Maltese:\n\nThe modern system of Maltese orthography was introduced in 1924.\nBelow is the Maltese alphabet, with symbols and approximate English pronunciation:\n\nFinal vowels with grave accents (à, è, ì, ò, ù) are also found in some Maltese words of Italian origin, such as \"libertà\" (\"freedom\"), \"sigurtà\" (old Italian: \"sicurtà\", \"security\"), or \"soċjetà\" (Italian: \"società\", \"society\").\n\nThe official rules governing the structure of the Maltese language are found in the official guidebook issued by the \"Akkademja tal-Malti\", the Academy of the Maltese language, which is named \"Tagħrif fuq il-Kitba Maltija\", that is, \"Knowledge on Writing in Maltese\". The first edition of this book was printed in 1924 by the Maltese government's printing press. The rules were further expanded in the 1984 book, \"iż-Żieda mat-Tagħrif\", which focused mainly on the increasing influence of Romance and English words. In 1992 the Academy issued the \"Aġġornament tat-Tagħrif fuq il-Kitba Maltija\", which updated the previous works. All these works were included in a revised and expanded guidebook published in 1996.\n\nThe National Council for the Maltese Language (KNM) is the main regulator of the Maltese language (see Maltese Language Act, below) and not the \"Akkademja tal-Malti\". However, these orthography rules are still valid and official.\n\nSince Maltese evolved after the Italo-Normans ended the Arab rule of the islands, a written form of the language was not developed for a long time after the Arabs' expulsion in the middle of the thirteenth century. Under the rule of the Knights Hospitaller, both French and Italian were used for official documents and correspondence. During the British colonial period, the use of English was encouraged through education, with Italian regarded as the next-most important language.\n\nIn 1934, Maltese was recognised as an official language. In the late eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century, philologists and academics such as Mikiel Anton Vassalli made a concerted effort to standardize written Maltese. Many examples of written Maltese exist from before this period, always in the Latin alphabet, \"Il Cantilena\" being the earliest example of written Maltese.\n\nFrom the \"Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe\":\n\nAlthough the original vocabulary of the language was Siculo-Arabic, it has incorporated a large number of borrowings from Romance sources of influence (Sicilian, Italian, and French), and more recently Germanic ones (from English).\n\nThe historical source of modern Maltese vocabulary is 52% Italian/Sicilian, 32% Siculo-Arabic, and 6% English, with some of the remainder being French. Today, most function words are Semitic. In this way, it is similar to English, which is a Germanic language that had large influence from Norman French. As a result of this, Romance language-speakers may easily be able to comprehend more complex ideas expressed in Maltese, such as \"Ġeografikament, l-Ewropa hi parti tas-superkontinent ta' l-Ewrasja\" (\"Geographically, Europe is part of the Supercontinent of Eurasia\"), while not understanding a single word of a simple sentence such as \"Ir-raġel qiegħed fid-dar\" (\"The man is in the house\"), which would be easily understood by any Arabic speaker.\n\nAn analysis of the etymology of the 41,000 words in Aquilina's \"Maltese-English Dictionary\" shows that words of Romance origin make up 52% of the Maltese vocabulary, although other sources claim from as low as 40%, to as high as 55%. These vocabularies tend to deal with more complicated concepts. They are mostly derived from Sicilian and thus exhibit Sicilian phonetic characteristics, such as in place of , and in place of (e.g. \"tiatru\" not \"teatro\" and \"fidi\" not \"fede\"). Also, as with Old Sicilian, (English 'sh') is written 'x' and this produces spellings such as: \"ambaxxata\" ('embassy'), \"xena\" ('scene' cf. Italian \"ambasciata, scena\").\n\nA tendency in modern Maltese is to adopt further influences from English and Italian.\nComplex Latinate English words adopted into Maltese are often given Italianate or Sicilianate forms, even if the resulting words do not appear in either of those languages. For instance, the words \"\"evaluation\", \"industrial action\", and \"chemical armaments\" become \"evalwazzjoni\", \"azzjoni industrjali\", and \"armamenti kimiċi\"\" in Maltese, while the Italian terms are \"valutazione\", \"vertenza sindacale\", and \"armi chimiche\" respectively. English words of Germanic origin are generally preserved relatively unchanged.\n\nSiculo-Arabic is the ancestor of the Maltese language, and supplies between 32% and 40% of the language's vocabulary.\n\nThe Maltese language has merged many of the original Arabic consonants, in particular the emphatic consonants, with others that are common in European languages. Thus, original Arabic , , and all merged into Maltese . The vowels, however, separated from the three in Arabic () to five, as is more typical of other European languages (). Some unstressed short vowels have been elided. The common Arabic greeting is cognate with in Maltese (lit. \"the peace for you\", peace be with you), as are similar greetings in other Semitic languages (e.g. in Hebrew).\n\nSince the attested vocabulary of Siculo-Arabic is limited, the following table compares cognates in Maltese and some other varieties of Arabic (all forms are written phonetically, as in the source):\n\nIt is estimated that English loanwords, which are becoming more commonplace, make up 20% of the Maltese vocabulary, although other sources claim amounts as low as 6%. This percentage discrepancy is due to the fact that a number of new English loanwords are sometimes not officially considered part of the Maltese vocabulary; hence, they are not included in certain dictionaries. Also, English loanwards of Latinate origin are very often Italianised, as discussed above. English loanwords are generally transliterated, although standard English pronunciation is virtually always retained. Below are a few examples:\nNote \"fridge\", which is a slang term derived from \"refrigerator\", a Latinate word which might be expected to be rendered as \"rifriġeratori\" (Italian uses a different word: \"frigorifero\").\n\nMaltese grammar is fundamentally derived from Siculo-Arabic, although Romance and English noun pluralization patterns are also used on borrowed words.\n\nAdjectives follow nouns. There are no separately formed native adverbs, and word order is fairly flexible. Both nouns and adjectives of Semitic origin take the definite article (for example, \"It-tifel il-kbir\", lit. \"The boy the elder\"=\"The elder boy\"). This rule does not apply to adjectives of Romance origin.\n\nNouns are pluralized and also have a dual marker. Semitic plurals are complex; if they are regular, they are marked by \"-iet\"/\"-ijiet\", e.g., \"art\", \"artijiet\" \"lands (territorial possessions or property)\" (cf. Arabic \"-at\" and Hebrew \"-ot\"/\"-oth\") or \"-in\" (cf. Arabic \"-īn\" and Hebrew \"-im\"). If irregular, they fall in the \"pluralis fractus\" category, in which a word is pluralized by internal vowel changes: \"ktieb\", \"kotba\" \" book\", \"books\"; \"raġel\", \"irġiel\" \"man\", \"men\".\n\nWords of Romance origin are usually pluralized in two manners: addition of \"-i\" or \"-jiet\". For example, \"lingwa\", \"lingwi\" \"languages\", from Sicilian \"lingua\", \"lingui\".\n\nWords of English origin are pluralized by adding either an \"-s\" or \"-jiet\", for example, \"friġġ\", \"friġis\" from the word \"fridge\". Some words can be pluralized with either of the suffixes to denote the plural. A few words borrowed from English can amalgamate both suffixes, like \"brikksa\" from the English \"brick\", which can adopt either collective form \"brikks\" or the plural form \"brikksiet\".\n\nThe proclitic \"il-\" is the definite article, equivalent to \"the\" in English and \"al-\" in Arabic.\n\nThe Maltese article becomes \"l-\" before or after a vowel.\n\nThe Maltese article assimilates to a following coronal consonant (called \"konsonanti xemxin\" \"sun consonants\"), namely:\n\nMaltese \"il-\" is coincidentally identical in pronunciation to the one of the Italian masculine articles, \"il,\" which is also \"l’\" before, but not after, a vowel. Consequently, many nouns borrowed from Standard Italian did not change their original article when used in Maltese. Romance vocabulary taken from Sicilian did change where the Sicilian articles \"u\" and \"a\", before a consonant, are used.\nIn spite of its Romance appearance, \"il-\" is related to the Arabic article \"al-\".\n\nVerbs show a triliteral Semitic pattern, in which a verb is conjugated with prefixes, suffixes, and infixes (for example \"ktibna\", Arabic \"katabna\", Hebrew \"kathabhnu\" (Modern Hebrew: katavnu) \"we wrote\"). There are two tenses: present and perfect. The Maltese verb system incorporates Romance verbs and adds Maltese suffixes and prefixes to them (for example, \"iddeċidejna\" \"we decided\" ← \"(i)ddeċieda\" \"decide\", a Romance verb + \"-ejna\", a Maltese first person plural perfect marker).\n\nWith Malta being a multilingual country, the usage of Maltese in the mass media is shared with other European languages, namely English and Italian. The majority of television stations broadcast from Malta in English or Maltese, although broadcasts from Italy in Italian are also received on the islands. Similarly, there are more Maltese-language radio programs than English ones broadcast from Malta, but again, as with television, Italian broadcasts are also picked up. Maltese generally receives equal usage in newspaper periodicals to English.\n\nBy early 2000s, the use of the Maltese language on the Internet is uncommon, and the number of websites written in Maltese are few. In a survey of Maltese cultural websites conducted in 2004 on behalf of the Maltese Government, 12 of 13 were in English only, while the remaining one was multilingual but did not include Maltese.\n\nThe Maltese population, being fluent in both Maltese and English, displays code-switching (referred to as Maltenglish) in certain localities and between certain social groups.\n\n"}

Her novels include \"Furu Hausu\" (フルハウス, \"Full House\", 1996), which won the Noma literary prize for best work by a new author; \"Kazoku Shinema\" (家族シネマ, \"Family Cinema,\" 1997), which won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize; \"Gōrudo Rasshu\" (ゴールドラッシュ, \"Gold Rush\" 1998), which was translated into English as \"Gold Rush\" (2002); and \"Hachi-gatsu no Hate\" (8月の果て, \"The End of August,\" 2004). She has published a dozen books of essays and memoirs, and she was an editor of and contributor to the literary quarterly \"en-taxi \". Her best-selling memoir \"Inochi\" (命, \"Life\") was made into a movie, also titled \"Inochi\".\n\nYu's first novel, a semiautobiographical work titled \"Ishi ni Oyogu Sakana\" (石に泳ぐ魚, \"The Fish Swimming in the Stone\") published in the September 1994 issue of the literary journal Shinchō, became the focus of a legal and ethical controversy. The model for one of the novel's main characters—and the person referred to indirectly by the title—objected to her depiction in the story. The publication of the novel in book form was blocked by court order, and some libraries restricted access to the magazine version. After a prolonged legal fight and widespread debate over the rights of authors, readers, and publishers versus individuals' rights to privacy, a revised version of the novel was published in 2002.\n\nYu has experienced racist backlash to her work because of her ethnic background, with some events at bookstores being canceled due to bomb threats.\n\nAfter the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami Yu began to travel to the affected areas often, and from March 16, 2012, she hosted a weekly radio show called \"Yu Miri no Futari to Hitori\" (柳美里の二人と一人, \"Yu Miri's Two People and One Person\") on a temporary emergency broadcasting station called Minamisōma Hibari FM, based in Minamisōma, Fukushima.\n\nSince April 2015, Yu has lived in Minamisōma, Fukushima. In 2018, she opened a bookstore called Full House and a theatre space called LaMaMa ODAKA at her home in Odaka District.\n\nShe has one son.\n\n"}

The term alludes to the stereotypical (and somewhat inaccurate) view of mushroom cultivation: \"Kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure\".\n\nMushroom management is a style of management in which the personnel are not familiar with the ideas or the general state of the company, and are given work without knowing the purpose of this work, in contrast with open-book management. Mushroom management means that workers' curiosity and self-expression are not supported. The employees often have no idea what the company's overall situation is, because the leaders tend to make all the decisions on their own, without asking anyone else to give their opinion. This problem can occur when the manager does not understand the employees' work (in a programming company, for example) and therefore cannot communicate effectively with the employees. \nMushroom management can also be found in environments that are unrelated to business. It can sometimes be found within schools, when students working in a group decide not to share information with the other students in the group. This means that they will appear more intelligent and hardworking during assessments.\n\nThe main reasons for the development of mushroom management within a company can be found at the managerial level. Mushroom management often develops when managers see themselves as the sole decision-makers within the company, rather than the people who lead all the employees towards a shared success. This can often take place unintentionally: managers fear that their employees will discover important new ideas instead of them, which drives the managers to make bad decisions and prevent employees from taking an active role in their work. As a result, the employees end up doing this work in a mechanical, repeated fashion, without contributing in a more productive or active way.\n\nThe key feature of mushroom management is that the employees have limited responsibility over the company. The importance of the decisions they have to make is minimal, which can often reduce workplace-related stress.\n\nThe consequences of mushroom management can be extremely detrimental for everyone involved in the company. If the flow of information within a company is insufficient, the people involved often have a limited understanding of how to react in situations that require quick assessment and prompt decision making.\nFor example, a company that makes and sells shoes might research their customers' preferences and discover that these preferences have changed. However, if this piece of information is not passed on to the sales manager of an individual shop, then the shop will still display the \"old\" shoes and will not attract the customers' attention effectively. At the end of this process, the blame is sometimes even attributed to the shop assistants, because they are the employees in a direct contact with the customers.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, considerable information about the bank's management was revealed, including the way Richard S. Fuld, Jr., the former CEO, organised the bank. The bank had started to concentrate more and more on excessively risky mortgages; however, neither the employees nor the public were aware of the bank's financial situation. Fuld, together with other managers, had kept a significant amount of essential information secret, as well as lying to the investors and to all other involved parties. Everybody else had thought that Lehman Brothers were involved with a variety of investments, including both safe and risky investments; in reality, though, they had been working with a much more risky portfolio than was appropriate. After the bank became bankrupt, Fuld refused to take the blame for any of these events, even though he was responsible for the concealment of the information. \n\nMushroom management can also occur during the handling of one-off, individual situations. When the ship \"Titanic\" hit an iceberg, only a few members of the crew were aware that the ship was going to sink. Most of the crewmen were not informed about the seriousness of the situation by the captain, which resulted in chaos and disorganisation. The captain attempted to act on his own, without incorporating the officers into his decisions.\n\nSharing information with co-workers and employees is often unavoidable; however, one of the most important tasks for a manager is to differentiate between information that can be shared with others and information that cannot be shared. A company should not share all its information with its employees, because that could be even more damaging. Managers should learn how to distribute information and how to communicate with the people they are responsible for. The best way to avoid mushroom management is transparency.\n\nSometimes, mushroom management can be very helpful if it is handled carefully. This method involves the company's employees being divided into various groups, each of which has all the information which it specifically needs but nothing more, similar to a need to know approach taken in the military to control access to sensitive material. Meanwhile, the manager is in charge of giving each group the required information. This kind of management is extremely difficult, though, and requires considerable skill.\n\nThe term refers to the stereotypical view of mushroom cultivation, where mushrooms are \"kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure\". In fact, the most commonly cultivated mushroom, \"Agaricus bisporus\" is grown on a pasteurized compost substrate, not raw manure (common raw ingredients in mushroom compost are horse manure and straw). The chemical and microbiological nature of finished compost is, however, quite different from raw manure.\n\nMushrooms are fungi rather than plants and therefore do not use photosynthesis. They can grow without light, but do not actually require darkness in order to grow. Most mushroom cultivation is in fact done in dark locations (such as caves) for reasons of utility and to save on the expense of lighting, or, as with the case of the aforementioned \"Agaricus bisporus\", for appearance reasons. Light tends to give the mushrooms a brownish tint. Marketing research has shown the overwhelming customer preference for lighter specimens, so most of the producers try to limit light exposure. Some cultivated mushroom species, however, may need periodic exposure to light in order to induce fruition.\n\n"}

{"id": "13810222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13810222", "title": "Northeastern Iberian script", "text": "Northeastern Iberian script\n\nThe northeastern Iberian script, also known as Levantine Iberian or Iberian because the Iberian script was the most frequently used, was the main means of written expression of the Iberian language. The language is also expressed by the southeastern Iberian script and the Greco-Iberian alphabet. To understand the relationship between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, one should point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs. However, it is clear they have a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script was derived from the southeastern Iberian script. Some researchers have concluded that it is linked to the Phoenician alphabet alone, but others believe the Greek alphabet also had a role.\n\nAll the paleohispanic scripts, with the exception of the Greco-Iberian alphabet, share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the occlusives, and monophonemic value for the rest of the consonants and vowels. In a writing system they are neither alphabets nor syllabaries, but are rather mixed scripts that are normally identified as semi-syllabaries. The basic signary contains 28 signs: 5 vowels, 15 syllabic and 8 consonantic (one lateral, two sibilants, two rhotic and three nasals). The northeastern script was very nearly deciphered in 1922 by Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez, who systematically linked the syllabic signs with the occlusive values. The decipherment was based on the existence of a large number of coin legends (some of them bearing Latin inscriptions) that could easily be linked to ancient place names known from Roman and Greek sources. There are two variants of the northeastern Iberian script: the dual variant is almost exclusive to the ancient inscriptions from the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE and its distinctive characteristic is the use of the dual system. This system was discovered by Joan Maluquer de Motes in 1968 and allows differentiation of the occlusive signs (dentals and velars) between voiced and unvoiced by the use of an additional stroke. The simple sign represents the voiced value whilst the complex sign represents the unvoiced value. The non-dual variant is almost exclusive of the modern inscriptions from the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. \n\nThe inscriptions that use the northeastern Iberian script have been found mainly in the northeastern quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula: largely along the coast from Roussillon to Alicante, but also with a deep penetration in the Ebro Valley. The northeastern Iberian inscriptions have been found on different object types (silver and bronze coins, silver and ceramic recipients, lead plaques, mosaics, amphores, stones (steles), spindle-whorls etc.), representing 95% of the total finds (over 2000 items), and nearly all the scripts were written from left to right. The oldest northeastern Iberian script date to the 4th or maybe the 5th century BCE. The modern ones date from the end of the 1st century BCE or maybe the beginning of the 1st century CE.\n\nIn recent years four northeastern Iberian abecedaries or signaries have been published: the Castellet de Bernabé signary, the Tos Pelat signary, the Ger signary and the Bolvir signary, all of them belonging to the dual variant of the script.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20003459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20003459", "title": "Pluractionality", "text": "Pluractionality\n\nPluractionality, or verbal number, if not used in its aspectual sense, is a grammatical device that indicates that the action or participants of a verb is/are plural. This differs from frequentative or iterative aspects in that the latter have no implication for the number of participants of the verb.\n\nOften a pluractional transitive verb indicates that the object is plural, whereas in a pluractional intransitive verb the subject is plural. This is sometimes taken as an element of ergativity in the language. However, the essence of pluractionality is that the action of the verb is plural, whether because several people perform the action, it is performed on several objects, or it is performed several times. The exact interpretation may depend on the semantics of the verb as well as the context in which it is used. The lack of verbal number does not generally mean that the action and participants are singular, but rather that there is no particularly notable plurality; thus it may be better described as paucal vs. multiple rather than singular vs. plural.\n\nAlthough English does not have verbal number as a grammatical device, many English verbs such as \"stampede\" and \"massacre\" are used when one of the participants involves a large number. English also has a number of verbs (often ending in -le, such as \"nibble\") which indicate repetitive actions, and this is similar to some types of grammatically-marked pluractionality in other languages.\n\nThe Ainu language of Japan has a closed class of 'count verbs'. The majority of these end in \"-pa,\" an iterative suffix that has become lexicalized on some verbs. For example, \"kor\" means 'to have something or a few things', and \"kor-pa\" 'to have many things'; there are also causative forms of the latter, \"kor-pa-re\" 'to give (one person) many things', \"kor-pa-yar\" 'to give (several people) many things'. The \"-pa\" may occur more than once; this may be a case of the pluractional verb in its iterative aspect:\n\nThere are also suppletive forms:\n\nIn addition to literal number, pluractionality can be used for politeness, much as plural pronouns are in many languages. (See T-V distinction.)\n\nGeorgian shows an illuminating distinction between verbal and nominal number. Georgian verbs may be suppletive for tense and animacy as well as number. When a noun occurs with a numeral in Georgian, it takes the singular form regardless of its semantic number. Verbal agreement is syntactic, and therefore is also singular. However, the pluractionality of the verbal root remains plural. Thus,\n\nSingular participant, singular verb:\n\nPlural participant, plural verb:\n\nGrammatically singular but semantically plural participant, mixed verb:\n\nMuskogean languages such as Koasati have a three-way distinction, with singular, dual, and plural verbs. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply suppletive verbal agreement for number. See Koasati language for details.\n\nIn Hopi, dual nouns as subjects take the suffix \"-vit\" and singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns, but the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs with a dual meaning. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply number agreement on the verb. See Hopi language for details.\n\nThe Central Pomo language of California distinguishes ' 'sit, stay' and pluractional ' for more than one person. The perfective suffix \"-w\" on these verbs may be replaced with \"-t\" for a plural object:\n\nAs in Ainu, pluractionality may be used for politeness.\n\nChadic languages such as Hausa use reduplicated verbs with \"a general meaning of a repeated action, an action simultaneously performed by several agents, and action performed on more than one object, or various combinations of these 'plural' meanings\" (Eulenberg 1971). There are also derived forms:\n\nThe first implies that I sent them all together, whereas the second means that I sent them at different times or to different places.\n\nPluractionality is not uncommon in New Guinea. The Koiarian language Barai has suppletive forms: \n\nIn American Sign Language, verbal number is expressed through reduplication. There are several verbal aspects using modified reduplication that indicate frequent or iterative action; these are unusual cross-linguistically in that transitive verbs lose their transitivity. In addition, transitive verbs may be reduplicated to show plurality of their object; the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover the spatial locations of multiple objects or recipients. These are true duals and plurals, and so may be best thought of as object incorporation rather than pluractionality. For example, is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing, which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and an individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs.\n\n"}

They were also used after the end of the war while the economies of the belligerents gradually returned to normal.

This was so that one person would not have more food than the other.\n\nRationing has been present in India since World War II.

{"id": "4986910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4986910", "title": "Reforms of Portuguese orthography", "text": "Reforms of Portuguese orthography\n\nThis article is about the spelling reforms of the Portuguese language.\n\nPortuguese began to be used regularly in documents and poetry around the 12th century. In 1290, King Diniz created the first Portuguese University in Lisbon (later moved to Coimbra) and decreed that Portuguese, then called simply the \"common language\", would henceforth be used instead of Latin, and named the \"Portuguese language\". In 1296, it was adopted by the Royal Chancellary and began to be used for writing laws and in notaries.\n\nThe medieval spelling of Portuguese was not uniform, since it had no official standard, but most authors used an essentially phonemic orthography, with minor concessions to etymology common in other Romance languages, such as the use of \"c\" for before \"e\" or \"i\", but \"ç\" otherwise, or the use of \"ss\" for between vowels, but \"s\" otherwise. King Diniz, who was an admirer of the poetry of the troubadours and a poet himself, popularized the Occitan digraphs \"nh\" and \"lh\" for the palatal consonants and , which until then had been spelled with several digraphs, including \"nn\" and \"ll\", as in Spanish.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, appreciation for classical culture led many authors to imitate Latin and (Romanized) Ancient Greek, filling words with a profusion of silent letters and other etymological graphemes, such as \"ch\" (pronounced as \"c/qu\"), \"ph\" (pronounced as \"f\"), \"rh\", \"th\", \"y\" (pronounced as \"i\"), \"cc\", \"pp\", \"tt\", \"mn\" (pronounced as \"n\"), \"sce\", \"sci\" (pronounced as \"ce\", \"ci\"), \"bt\", \"pt\", \"mpt\" (pronounced as \"t\"), and so on, still found today in the orthographies of French and English.\n\nContrary to neighboring languages such as Spanish or French, whose orthographies were set by language academies in the 17th century, Portuguese had no official spelling until the early 20th century; authors wrote as they pleased.\n\nIn 1911, the newly formed Portuguese Republic, concerned with improving the literacy of its citizens, charged a commission of philologists with defining a standard orthography for Portuguese. The result was what has come to be known in Portugal as the orthographic reform of Gonçalves Viana. The new standard became official in Portugal and its overseas territories at the time, which are today the independent nations of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and East Timor, as well as the Chinese S.A.R. of Macau and the Indian state of Goa and territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In 1938, Brazil set up an orthography of its own, with the same general principles as the Portuguese orthography, but not entirely identical to it.\n\nThe authors of the first spelling reform of Portuguese, imbued with the modern ideas of phonology, rejected the etymological spellings current in the previous centuries, preferring a more phonetic orthography, like those of Spanish and Italian. On the other hand, considering that the period of Galician-Portuguese troubadorian poetry had been a golden age of Portuguese literature, they aimed to keep the new orthography as close to the medieval spelling as possible, in spite of some phonetic changes which the language had undergone. The resulting orthographic standard was essentially a compromise between these intents, on one hand, and common traditions, on the other: in a few cases, spelling conventions which went against etymology but had long become customary were made official.\n\nThus, the reform kept some graphemic distinctions for phonological traits which were not present in every dialect, but still present in at least some areas: between \"z\" and intervocalic \"s\" ( and in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to in most dialects), between \"c/ç\" and \"s(s)\" ( and in medieval Portuguese, but now reduced to in most dialects), and between \"ch\" and \"x\" (originally and , now just in most dialects, although the distinction is still retained in some). The unstressed vowels \"e\" and \"o\" were also retained for word-family homogeneity and etymology when they were pronounced as \"i\" or \"u\", respectively, and the digraph \"ou\" was differentiated from \"o\", even though many speakers now pronounced both as . These distinctions have close parallels in the orthographies of other West European languages.\n\nSince word stress can be distinctive in Portuguese, the acute accent was used to mark the stressed vowel whenever it was not in the usual position, more or less as in the orthographies of Spanish and Catalan. For example, the verb \"critica\" \"he criticizes\" bears no accent mark, because it is stressed on the syllable before the last one, like most words that end in \"-a\", but the noun \"crítica\" \"criticism\" requires an accent mark, since it is a proparoxytone.\n\nSince the height of the vowels \"a\", \"e\" and \"o\" is also distinctive in stressed syllables (see \"Portuguese phonology\"), high stressed vowels were marked with a circumflex accent, \"â\", \"ê\", \"ô\", to be differentiated from the low stressed vowels written \"á\", \"é\", \"ó\". The choice of the acute for low vowels and the circumflex for high vowels went against the conventions of other Romance languages such as French or Italian, but it was already commonplace in Portuguese before the 20th century. (In many words, Portuguese \"ê\" and \"ô\" correspond to the Latin long vowels \"ē\", \"ō\".)\n\nNasal vowels and nasal diphthongs usually appear before the orthographic nasal consonants \"n\", \"m\", in which case they do not need to be identified with diacritics, but the tilde was placed on nasal \"a\" and nasal \"o\" when they occurred before another letter, or at the end of a word. Although the vowel \"u\" can also be nasal before other vowels, this happens in so few words (\"mui\", \"muito\", \"muita\", \"muitos\", \"muitas\") that marking its nasality was not considered necessary.\n\nThe acute accent was used also to mark the second vowel of a hiatus in a stressed syllable, where a diphthong would normally be expected, distinguishing for example \"conclui\" \"he concludes\" from \"concluí\" \"I concluded\", \"saia\" \"that he leave\" from \"saía\" \"he used to leave\", or \"fluido\" \"fluid\" from \"fluído\" \"flowed\".\n\nInitially, the orthographic system, both in Brazil and Portugal, determined the usage of diacritics in cases where two words would otherwise be homographic but not homophonous, such as \"acôrdo\", \"agreement\", distinguishing it from \"acórdo\", \"I wake up\". This principle was abandoned in all but a dozen cases in 1945 in Portugal and in 1973 in Brazil. (In most cases the homographs were different parts of speech, meaning that context was enough to distinguish them.)\n\nThe orthography set by the 1911 reform is essentially the one still in use today on both sides of the Atlantic with only minor adjustments having been made to the vowels, consonants, and digraphs. Since then, the only remaining significant differences between the two standards, and only substantial changes addressed in the 1990 spelling reform, were in the use of diacritics and silent consonants.\n\nBrazil was never consulted about the orthographic reform of 1911, and so it did not adopt it. In the decades that followed, negotiations were held between representatives of Brazil and Portugal, with the intent of agreeing on a uniform orthography for Portuguese, but progress was slow. In 1931, Portugal and Brazil finally signed an orthographic agreement, on the basis of which Brazil established its own official orthography, in 1938.\n\nSoon after, however, it became apparent that there were differences between the spellings being used in the two countries. Even though both were based on the same general principles, phonetic differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese had led to divergent spellings in some cases. Various attempts were made in the remainder of the 20th century to bring the two orthographies closer to each other, sometimes with modest success, other times without success. To this day, they do not coincide completely.\n\nNotwithstanding its traces of etymology, the 1911 orthography aimed to be phonetic in the sense that, given the spelling of a word, there would be no ambiguity about its pronunciation. For that reason, it had certain characteristics which later produced inconsistencies between the European and the Brazilian orthographies.\n\nIn unstressed syllables, hiatuses were originally distinguished from diphthongs with a trema. For instance, writing \"saüdade\", \"traïdor\", \"constituïção\", so that they would be pronounced \"sa-udade\", \"tra-idor\", \"constitu-ição\". But the pronunciation of these words is not uniform. Many speakers say \"sau-dade\" and \"trai-dor\", especially in fast speech. Furthermore, there are no minimal pairs that distinguish a hiatus from a falling diphthong in unstressed syllables. For this reason, marking unstressed hiatuses came to be seen as unnecessary, and these tremas were eventually abolished.\n\nThe trema was also used in the words where the letter \"u\" is, exceptionally, pronounced in the digraphs \"gue\", \"gui\", \"que\", \"qui\", rather than silent as usual; e.g. \"agüentar\", \"sagüim\", \"freqüente\", \"eqüidade\". However, there is regional variation, with for example the \"u\" being pronounced in a few Brazilian Portuguese accents \"qüestão\", but not in European Portuguese \"questão\". Although the number of words with such divergent pronunciations is small, they have been seen as an obstacle to the orthographic unification of the language.\n\nUnstressed vowels are usually high, but there are exceptions, including a few pairs of homographs in European Portuguese which vary only in having either a low or a high vowel in an unstressed syllable. To distinguish these, the grave accent was at first placed on unstressed low vowels: cf. \"pregar\" \"to nail\", where the \"e\" is pronounced in European Portuguese, with \"prègar\" \"to preach\", where \"è\" is pronounced , or \"molhada\" \"wet\" with \"mòlhada\" \"bundle\". But in Brazilian Portuguese both words in each example are pronounced the same way, so the grave accent is not used: \"pregar\" \"to nail/to preach\", \"molhada\" \"wet/bundle\"; the intended meaning is inferred from context. The grave accent was eventually abolished, except in a small number of contractions.\n\nIn other cases, where an unstressed low vowel was the result of the elision of the consonants \"c\" or \"p\" before \"c\", \"ç\", \"t\", the consonant was kept in the spelling, to denote the quality of the preceding vowel. For example, in the word \"intercepção\", which is stressed on its last syllable, the letter \"p\" is not pronounced, but indicates that the second \"e\" is pronounced , as opposed to the second \"e\" in \"intercessão\", which is pronounced . Other examples of words where a silent consonant was left to lower the previous vowel are \"objecção\" and \"factor\". In Brazilian Portuguese, the vowels in question are pronounced just like any other unstressed vowels, and, since there is no phonetic ambiguity to undo, the words are simply spelled \"objeção\", \"fator\", and so on.\n\nThe orthography distinguished between stressed \"éi\" and stressed \"ei\". In Brazilian Portuguese, these diphthongs are indeed different, but in most dialects of European Portuguese both are pronounced the same way, and \"éi\" appears only by convention in some oxytone plural nouns and adjectives. This led to divergent spellings such as \"idéia\" (Brazil) and \"ideia\" (Portugal).\n\nThe Brazilian spelling has \"a\", \"ê\" or \"ô\" in several words where the European orthography has \"á\", \"é\" or \"ó\", due to different pronunciation. For example, cf. \"pensamos\", \"gênero\", \"tônico\" (Brazil) with \"pensámos\", \"género\", \"tónico\" (Portugal). This happens when the vowels are stressed before the nasal consonants \"m\" or \"n\", followed by another vowel, in which case both types of vowel may occur in European Portuguese, but Brazilian Portuguese allows only high vowels.\n\n\nIn 1990, an orthographic agreement was reached between the Portuguese-language countries with the intent of creating a single common orthography for Portuguese.\n\nThis spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on January 1, 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2008, allowing for a six-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies co-existed. \n\nThe legality of this decision is questioned, as the main bases of the International Treaty that governs the application of the new spelling reform are yet to be established, chiefly the common vocabulary drawn by all participating countries, that still does not exist. Also, the application of International Treaties, as per the Vienna Convention, states that the text of a treaty cannot be changed, and this one has suffered at least two revisions.\n\n\n\n"}

As the English language has many words with silent letters, it is possible to create numerous variations on this alphabet with the help of loan words and names from other languages. It is also sometimes referred to as a silent letter alphabet.\n\nOne possible origin for this alphabet goes back to a 1969 meeting of the Association of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, when discussion arose as to how the association's acronym, TESOL, should be pronounced. The association subsequently adopted the following tongue-in-cheek pronunciation guide, composed entirely of words with silent letters: T as in castle, E as in give, S as in island, O as in people, and L as in calm.The American linguist John Higgins subsequently spent some time constructing a complete such alphabet. By 1983, his alphabet lacked only words for the letters J, M, Q, V and X.\n\nFor some words in the list below, more than one letter counts as silent; in 'daughter', for example, both the 'g' and the 'h' are silent. These words are listed under only one of the two possible letters to avoid redundant entries. Words with a doubled letter in which the second of the two letters is counted as silent, like 'ebb', are not included in the list since they are among the least interesting examples. Note that for a few words in the list, the silent letter is pronounced when the word changes form, e.g., from 'hymn' to 'hymnal' or 'bourgeois' to 'bourgeoisie'.\n\nPurists may consider the 'marijuana' entry for the letter 'j' doubtful, since the 'j' actually is pronounced—though with the sound of 'h' rather than 'j'—whereas in examples for the other letters, the silent letter is not pronounced in any way at all. The Dutch coin rijksdaalder has a true silent 'j' per Merriam-Webster.\n\nBecause some words have two versions of the given letter, one pronounced and one silent, in every case the silent letter is indicated in boldface type.\n\nA: aesthetic, bread\n\nB: bdellium, debt, plumber\n\nC: indictment, muscle, science, cnidarian\n\nD: djinn, handkerchief, Wednesday\n\nE: give, like, name (the 'e' here is also known as the 'magic e')\n\nF: halfpenny\n\nG: gnat, gnaw, gneiss, gnu, high, phlegm, sign, though\n\nH: daughter, echo, heir, honest, hour, orchid\n\nI: friend, business\n\nJ: marijuana, rijksdaalder\n\nK: knee, knife, knight, knot, know\n\nL: calf, could, talk, yolk\n\nM: mnemonic\n\nN: autumn, column, damn, hymn, solemn\n\nO: colonel, leopard, people\n\nP: corps, coup, pneumonia, psalm, psyche, receipt\n\nQ: Colquhoun (Scottish name), lacquer \n\nR: forecastle, sarsaparilla \n\nS: aisle, bourgeois, debris, island, isle\n\nT: ballet, castle, rapport, listen\n\nU: colleague, guard, guess, tongue\n\nV: Milngavie (Scottish town), fivepence\n\nW: answer, gunwale, sword, two, wrist, wrong\n\nX: billet-doux, faux, Sioux\n\nY: Islay (Scottish island), Pepys, gray\n\nZ: chez, laissez-faire, rendezvous\n\n"}

This is known as \"giant/giantess fetishism\" or macrophilia. It is not the same as trampling.\n\nThe most common form of trampling is done by a female (mistress) walking on a male submissive and is usually done barefooted, in socks, nylons, or shoes.

{"id": "21378264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21378264", "title": "Triad (sociology)", "text": "Triad (sociology)\n\nTriad refers to a group of three people in sociology. It is one of the simplest human groups that can be studied and is mostly looked at by microsociology. The study of triads and dyads was pioneered by German sociologist Georg Simmel at the end of the nineteenth century. \n\nA triad can be viewed as a group of three people that can create different group interactions. This specific grouping is common yet overlooked in society for many reasons. Those being that it is compared to the lives of others, how they shape society, and how communication plays a role in different relationships scenarios. \n\nIt was derived in the late 1800s to early 1900s and evolved throughout time to shape group interactions in the present. Simmel also hypothesized between dyads and triads and how they may differ. A dyad is a group of two people that interact while a triad is another person added on to create more communicational interactions. For example: adding an extra person, therefore creating a triad, this can result in different language barriers, personal connection, and an overall impression of the third person. \n\nSimmel wanted to convey to his audience that a triad is not a basic group with positive interactions, but how these interactions can differ depending on person to person.\n\nBoth tests and studies have been conducted as to how siblings interact and how age, gender, and the amount of siblings can create a triad. A majority of the population has doubled over the last decade and recently has been proven that the more parents conceive, the better outcome a child will have when relating to other siblings. It can all depend on the relationships that different families have acquired as children get older. Creating and distinguishing between how a family can interact is a perfect everyday example of a triad in sociology. Applying the attachment theory created by John Bowlby can help decipher the differences between communication and interactions across the world.\n\nIn triadic closure, a group of three people can form relationships between each individual in that group. Therefore, creating both personal and emotional connections amongst all three individuals. This can be extremely important for others to understand that each person in this triad performs different roles and has different characteristics.\n\nEven though a triad consists of three people, an open form of a relationship can alter because two out of three members in this group can clash. This can be due to both \"structural construction\" and \"informational construction\". They both provide a means of stability and assurance to sustain an open form relationship into a closed form relationship. Structural construction can impose stress and clustering as a sense of bad communication between individuals and their different interactions. Informational construction conveys the need for privacy and how various individuals can clash when knowing something the other does not.\n\nGeorg Simmel goes into depth on the idea and how he creates the basis of a triad and what led him to his findings. It goes into discussing how places have taken triads shape. For example, in World War two he categorized the war into three various sections—European nationalism, materialism and imperialism. These three fall under \"mammonism\" this is the support of americanism in world war two and its effects that resulted from the war.\n\nSimmel conveys how cohesion has played a role in distinguishing between a dyad a triad. Three main factors that have led to these diverse groups is justified by 1) Dyads result in less behavioral changes when compared to triads, 2) Bonds that coincide more with triads than dyads, and 3) Emotion plays a bigger role when communicating between two people (dyad) versus a group with three people (triad). The last factor is mainly because communication and trust can be altered when mixing emotions between relationships. While in a group of three people it is less likely because the majority constantly communicate and come to an agreement as to what is best.\n\nGeorg Simmel had studied the means of how interaction including sports can alter or contribute to how a group can communicate. Going through a list of those that the player is either friends or enemies with, will then result if there is a positive or negative correlation between the two. This theory is known as triadic closure and was introduced by George Simmel. Network closure has provided a basis of social structure and independent actions amongst other individuals. Social structure and structural action was formed on the foundation of his or her own opinions as one together.\n"}

Swaminatha Iyer\n\nUttamadhanapuram Venkatasubbaiyer Swaminatha Iyer (19-Feb-1855 – 28-Apr-1942) was a Tamil scholar and researcher who was instrumental in bringing many long-forgotten works of classical Tamil literature to light. His singular effort over five decades brought to light major literary works in Tamil and contributed vastly to the enrichment of its literary heritage. Iyer published over 91 books in his lifetime, on a variety of matters connected to classical Tamil literature, and collected 3,067 paper manuscripts, palm-leaf manuscripts and notes of various kinds. He is affectionately called \"Tamil Thatha\" (Grandfather of Tamil).\n\nUtthamadhanapuram Venkatasubramanian Swaminathan was born on 19 February 1855 in the village of Suriaymoolai near Kumbakonam in present-day Tamil Nadu.\n\nSwaminatha Iyer learned Tamil literature and grammar for five years as a devoted student to Mahavidvan Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, a great poet and scholar. He was also a beneficiary of the reputed Saiva Mutt at Thiruvavaduthurai. Tyagaraja Chettiar was the head of the Tamil Department at the Government Arts College, Kumbakonam. A student of Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, he was a man of great erudition and was held in high esteem alike by his pupils and by the public. When Chettiar retired, he recommended that Swaminatha Iyer be invited to take his place. Swaminatha Iyer was duly appointed to that post on 16 February 1880. During his tenure at the College, Swaminatha Iyer met Salem Ramaswami Mudaliar, a civil munsif who had been recently transferred to Kumbakonam. The friendship between them proved to be a turning point in Swaminatha Iyer's life. Mudaliar was responsible for persuading Iyer to edit and publish the ancient Tamil classics. Swaminatha Iyer had till then confined his enjoyment of Tamil literature to medieval works. Mudaliar also gave him a handwritten copy of \"Seevaga Sindhamani\" for publication.\n\nAs the \"Civaka Cintamani\" was a Jain classic, Swaminatha Iyer went to the homes of learned member of the Jain community in Kumbakonam to get some doubts cleared. He also read the Jain epics and collated several manuscript versions and arrived at a correct conclusion. It was due to his efforts that the \"Cevaka Cintamani\" was published in 1887. From that time onwards, he began to search for Sangam classics with a view to editing and publishing them. After the \"Cevaka Cintamani\", the Pattupattu was published.\nThus began Swaminatha Iyer's long search for the original texts of ancient literary works during which he regularly worked with C. W. Damodaram Pillai. It was a search that lasted until his death. Many people voluntarily parted with the manuscripts in their possession. Swaminatha Iyer visited almost every hamlet and knocked at every door. He employed all the resources at his command to get at the works. As a result, a large number of literary works which were gathering dust as palm-leaf manuscripts in lofts, storerooms, boxes and cupboards saw the light of day. Of them, the Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai and Purananuru were received by Tamil lovers with a lot of enthusiasm. Purananuru, which mirrored the lives of Tamils during the Sangam period, prompted scholarly research on the subject. In a span of about five decades, Swaminatha Iyer published about 100 books, including minor poems, lyrics, puranas and bhakti (devotional) works.\n\nSwaminatha Iyer retired from active teaching in 1919. His research work increased several times after retirement. He travelled from place to place in search of palm leaf manuscripts so as to edit and publish them. From 1924 to 1927, Iyer was the Principal of the Meenakshi Tamil College in Annamalai University, Chidambaram. On health grounds, he resigned the post, came to Madras and continued his research.\n\nAnother significant contribution made by Swaminatha Iyer is in the realm of Tamil music. Until Swaminatha Iyer published the Cilappatikaram, Pattupattu and Ettuthokai, music was a grey area in Tamil research. During the previous four centuries, Telugu and Sanskrit dominated the music scene in Tamil Nadu in the absence of any valuable information on Tamil music. Swaminatha Iyer's publications threw light on the presence of Tamil music in the earlier centuries and paved the way for serious research on the subject. As the son of a famous musician of his time, Swaminatha Iyer learnt music from Gopalakrishna Bharathi, a musical exponent and the author of \"Nandan Sarithiram\".\n\nSwaminatha Iyer published his autobiography, \"En Saritham\", serialised in the Tamil weekly Ananda Vikatan, from January 1940 to May 1942. It was later published as a book in 1950. Running into 762 pages, the book is an excellent account of the life and times of villages, especially in the Thanjavur district in the late 19th century. The Tamil is simple and peppered with many observations on people as well as descriptions of school life, life in monasteries (Maths). The book also reveals the enormous perseverance of U V Swaminatha Iyer in his quest to master Tamil and save manuscripts.\n\nIt was due to his efforts that the world came to know the literary output of the ancient Tamils and their past. Tamil poet and nationalist Subramania Bharati, who inspired the freedom movement with his songs, admired Swaminatha Iyer. Paying tribute to Swaminatha Iyer in one of his poems, Bharati equated Iyer with the sage, Agastya when he called him \"Kumbamuni\". (Agastya, who was among the first exponents of Tamil, was supposed to have been born in a \"Kumbha\"—a kind of vessel—hence the name \"Kumbamuni\") and said: \"So long as Tamil lives, poets will venerate you and pay obeisance to you. You will ever shine as an immortal.\"\n\nThe meeting of Rabindranath Tagore and the grand old man of Tamil literature in 1926 in Chennai was a historic moment. Not only did Tagore call on Swaminatha Iyer, but also penned a poem in praise of his efforts to salvage ancient classical Tamil literary works from palm leaf manuscripts.\n\nThe honorary doctoral degree (D.Litt.) was conferred on Iyer by the University of Madras in 1906. In recognition of his outstanding literary accomplishments and contributions, he was also honoured with the title, \"Mahamahopathiyaya\", literally: \"Greatest of great teachers\". In the same year, when the Prince and Princess of Wales visited Madras, a function was arranged where Swaminatha Iyer was honoured. Iyer was awarded the title of \"Dakshinathya Kalanidhi\" in 1925. In 1932, the Madras University awarded an honorary PhD to him in recognition of his services in the cause of Tamil. Indian Postal department issued a commemorative postage stamp on 18 February 2006. His house in Uthamadhanapuram has been converted as a Memorial.\n\n"}
