The dictionary entry also includes two early textual uses, which both refer to the term's rhetorical (rather than philosophical) usage.\n\nIn George Puttenham's \"The Arte of English Poesie\" (1589), aporia is \"the Doubtful, [so] called...because often we will seem to caste perils, and make doubts of things when by a plaine manner of speech we might affirm or deny [them]\". In a reference from 1657, J. Smith's \"Mystical Rhetoric,\" the term becomes \"a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multitude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing\" (OED). Herbert Weir Smyth's \"Greek Grammar\" (1956) also focuses on the rhetorical usage by defining aporia as \"an artifice by which a speaker feigns doubts as to where he shall begin or end or what he shall do or say\" (674).\n\nMore modern sources, perhaps because they come after the advent of post-structuralism, have chosen to omit the rhetorical usage of the term. In William Harmon's \"A Handbook to Literature,\" for example, aporia is identified as \"a difficulty, impasse, or point of doubt and indecision\", while also noting that critics such as Jacques Derrida have employed the term to \"indicate a point of undecidability, which locates the site at which the text most obviously undermines its own rhetorical structure, dismantles, or deconstructs itself\" (39). Julian Wolfreys, in his essay \"Trauma, Testimony, and Criticism\", characterizes trauma as aporia, a wound with unending trail. Valiur Rahaman, in his book \"Interpretations: Essays in Literary Theory \" (2011), explained aporia as a creative force in both the artist and their art; it is, for the artist, an edgeless edge of the text or a work of art.\n\nThe separation of aporia into its two morphemes \"a\"- and \"poros\" ('without' and 'passage') reveals the word's rich etymological background as well as its connection to Platonic mythology. Sarah Kofman asserts that these two components are crucial to a fuller understanding of the word, which has been historically translated and understood somewhat reductively: \"translators, who usually escape their perplexity by translating \"poros\" as 'expediency' and \"aporia\" as 'difficulty'...leave the reader in the dark as to all the semantic richness of \"poros\" and \"aporia\" and give no hint as to their links with other words belonging to the same 'family (9). Such links inevitably demonstrate that the terms are part of a \"tradition\" that Plato borrows from, a tradition which \"breaks with a philosophical conception of translation, and with the logic of identity that it implies\" (10). To demonstrate such a break, Kofman reviews multiple instances of the term throughout Plato's work. Her discussion of the myth of Poros, Penia, and Eros in Plato's \"Symposium\" especially reveals the concept's untranslatability. Penia, the \"child of poverty\", decides to forcefully impregnate herself with the inebriated Poros, the personification of plenty, who is always in opposition with aporia and thus defining aporia. The result of this union is Eros, who inherits the disparate characteristics of his parents (25). The perplexing aspect of the myth is revealed as one realizes that Penia is acting out of resourcefulness, a quality normally attributed to Poros, and Poros' inaction reveals his own passivity, a poverty of agency or porous. Such a relationship intensely affects not only the context of aporia but its meaning as well: \n\nUltimately, aporia cannot be separated from this etymological and cultural history. Such history provides insight into aporia's perplexing semantic qualities as well as into the historical context in which the word functions as an indicator of the limits of language in constructing knowledge.\n\nIn philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a paradox). It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse. The notion of an aporia is principally found in Greek philosophy, but it also plays a role in post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray, and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in analytic philosophy.\n\nPlato's early dialogues are often called his 'aporetic' (Greek: ἀπορητικός) dialogues because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, Socrates questions his interlocutor about the nature or definition of a concept, for example virtue or courage. Socrates then, through elenctic testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato's \"Meno\" (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.\n\nIn Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a rationalist inquiry that begins from \"a priori\" principles, or an empiricist inquiry that begins from a \"tabula rasa\", he begins the \"Metaphysics\" by surveying the various \"aporiai\" that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: \"with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., metaphysics], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled\" (995a24). Book Beta of the \"Metaphysics\" is a list of the \"aporiai\" that preoccupy the rest of the work.\n\nIn Pyrrhonism aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing ataraxia.\n\nContemporary academic studies of the term further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In \"Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency\" (2009), Nicholas Rescher is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or \"apory\", is intellectually processed and resolved. In the Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to \"synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of 'cognitive dissonance', as it is sometimes called)\" (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: \"any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us\" (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as \"a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses\", a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or \"cluster of contentions\":\n\nThe aporia, or \"apory\" of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a paradox). Rescher's study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.\n\nAporia is also a rhetorical device whereby the speaker expresses a doubt—often feigned—about his position or asks the audience rhetorically how he or she should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to discredit the speaker's opponent. Aporia is also called \"dubitatio\". For example:\n\n\n"}

These languages are a branch of the Zapotecan family within the Oto-Manguean language family. They are natively spoken by 45,000 Chatino people, \nwhose communities are located in the southern portion of the Mexican state of Oaxaca.\n\nThe Chatinos have close cultural and linguistic ties with the Zapotec people, whose languages form the other branch of the Zapotecan language family. Chatinos call their language C\"haqF TnyaJ\", which means \"difficult word.\" It is recognized as a national language in Mexico.\n\nThe Chatino languages are a group of three languages. Zenzontepec Chatino spoken in about 10 communities in the district of Sola de Vega, Tataltepec Chatino, spoken in Tataltepec the Valdez and a group of language called the Eastern Chatino language spoken in about 15-17 communities. Egland & Bartholomew (1983) conducted mutual intelligibility tests in which they concluded that four varieties of Chatino could be considered separate languages in regards to mutual intelligibility, with 80% intelligibility being needed for varieties to be considered part of the same language. (The same count resulted from a looser 70% criterion.) These were Tataltepec, Zacatepec, Panixtlahuaca, and the Highlands dialects, with Zenzontepec not tested but based on other studies believed to be completely unintelligible with the rest of Chatino. The Highlands dialects fall into three groups, largely foreshadowing the divisions in \"Ethnologue\".\n\nCampbell (2013), in a study based on shared innovations rather than mutual intelligibility, first divides Chatino into two groups—Zenzontepec and Coastal Chatino. He then divides Coastal Chatino into Tataltepec and Eastern Chatino. His Eastern Chatino contains all other varieties and he finds no evidence for subgrouping or further division based on shared innovations. This division mirrors the divisions reported by Boas (1913), based on speaker comments, that Chatino comprised three \"dialects\" with limited mutual intelligibility. Sullivant (2015) finds that Teojomulco is the most divergent variety.\n\n\nYaitepec Chatino has the following phonemic consonants (Pride 1965):\n\nThere are five oral vowels, , and four nasal vowels, .\n\nRasch (2002) reports ten distinct tones for Yaitepec Chatino. The level tones are high /1/, mid /2/, low-mid /3/, and low /4/. There are also two rising tones (/21/ and /32/) and three falling tones (/12/, /23/, /34/) as well as a more limited falling tone /24/, found in a few lexical items and in a few Completive forms of verbs.\n\nThere are a variety of practical orthographies for Chatino, most influenced by Spanish orthography. In the examples below, represents , = , and is spelled before back vowels and before front vowels.\n\nChatino languages have some regular alternations between transitive and intransitive verbs. In general this change is shown by altering the first consonant of the root, as in the following examples from Tataltepec Chatino:\n\nThere is also a morphological causative in Chatino, expressed by the causative prefix /x-/, /xa-/, /y/, or by the palatalization of the first consonant. The choice of prefix appears to be partially determined by the first consonant of the verb, though there are some irregular cases.\nThe prefix /xa/ is put before certain roots that begin with /t/, e.g.\nPalatalization occurs in some roots that begin with /t/, e.g.\n\ntaa 'will give' tyaa 'will pay'\n\nThe alternations seen here are similar to the causative alternation seen in the related Zapotec languages.\n\nAspect:\n\nPride (1965) reports eight aspects in Yaitepec Chatino.\n\npotential 'The majority of the verbs have no potential prefix, and its absence indicates this aspect.'\n\nhabitual This is indicated by the prefixes /n-, nd-, l-/ and /n-/ with palatalization of the first consonant of the root, e.g.:\n\n\"nsta\" 'puts it in' \n\"nsta chcubi loo mesa\" 'puts the box on the table'\n\n\"ndu'ni cu'na\" 'graze'\n\"Ndu'ni ngu' cu'na quichi re\" 'The people of this town graze'\n\"ntya\" 'sow'\n\"Ntya ngu' quichi re quiña\"' 'The people of this town sow chile.'\n\ncontinuative Roots that take /n-/ or /nd-/ in the habitual have the same in the continuative plus palatalization; roots that have /n-/ plus palatalization in the habitual have /ndya-/, e.g.\n\"Nxtya chcubi loo mesa\" 'is putting the box on the table'\n\n\"Ndyu'ni ngu' cu'na quichi re\" 'The people of this town are grazing.'\n\n\"Ndyata ngu' quichi re quiña\"' 'The people of this town are sowing chile.'\n\ncompletive This is indicated with the prefix /ngu-/, and verbs that start with /cu-, cui-, qui-/ change to /ngu-/ and /ngüi-/ in the completive:\n\n\"sta\" 'will put it'\n\"Ngu-sta chcubi loo mesa\" 'Someone put the box on the table'\n\n\"culu'u\" 'will teach it'\n\"Ngulu'u mstru ji'i\" 'The teacher taught it.'\n\nimperative This aspect is indicated by palatalization in the first consonant of the potential form of the verb. If the potential is already a palatalized consonant, the imperative is the same, e.g.:\n\n\"sati\"' 'will slacken' \"xati' ji'i\" 'let it loose!'\n\"xi'yu\" 'will cut' \"xi'yu ji'i\" 'cut it!'\n\nperfective This aspect is indicated by the particle /cua/, which is written as a separate word in Pride (1965).\n\n\"tyee\" 'will end' \"cua tyee ti\" 'is ended'\n\"cua ndya ngu\"' 'is gone'\n\npassive potential /tya-/\n\n\"Tyaala ton'ni'i\" 'The door will be opened.'\n\npassive completive /ndya-/\n\n\"Ndyaala ton'ni'i\" 'The door is open.'\n\nChatino languages usually have VSO as their predominant order, as in the following example:\n'The lazy dog gave a sweetbread to the coyote.'\n\nChatino-language programming is carried by the CDI's radio station XEJAM, based in Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca.\n\nIn 2012, the Natividad Medical Center of Salinas, California had trained medical interpreters bilingual in Chatino as well as in Spanish; in March 2014, Natividad Medical Foundation launched Indigenous Interpreting+, \"a community and medical interpreting business specializing in indigenous languages from Mexico and Central and South America,\" including Chatino, Mixtec, Trique, and Zapotec.\n\n\n\n"}

Communication strategies are strategies that learners use to overcome these problems in order to convey their intended meaning. Strategies used may include paraphrasing, substitution, coining new words, switching to the first language, and asking for clarification. These strategies, with the exception of switching languages, are also used by native speakers.\n\nThe term \"communication strategy\" was introduced by Selinker in 1972, and the first systematic analysis of communication strategies was made by Varadi in 1973. There were various other studies in the 1970s, but the real boom in communication strategy scholarship came in the 1980s. This decade saw a flurry of papers describing and analyzing communication strategies, and saw Ellen Bialystok link communication strategies to her general theory of second-language acquisition. There was more activity in the 1990s with a collection of papers by Kasper and Kellerman and a review article by Dörnyei and Scott, but there has been relatively little research on the subject since then.\n\nNo comprehensive list of strategies has been agreed on by researchers in second-language acquisition, but some commonly used strategies have been observed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch in communication strategies reached its peak in the 1980s, and has since fallen out of favor as a research topic in second-language acquisition. Some researchers who have studied communication strategies and their effect on language acquisition include Elaine Tarone, Claus Faerch, Gabriele Kasper, and Ellen Bialystok.\n\nKasper and Faerch proposed a model of speech production that involved a planning phase and a production phase. Communication strategies were seen as belonging to the planning phase; their use became necessary if the learner experienced a problem with the initial plan that they made. In addition to the strategies outlined above Kasper and Faerch also pointed to the possibility of using a reductive strategy such as switching to a completely different topic.\n\nResearchers have identified three components of communication strategies: problematicity, meaning that the person recognizes a communication problem; consciousness, meaning that the person is conscious of the problem and is consciously employing a strategy to resolve it; and intentionality, which implies that the person is able to choose between options for overcoming a communication problem. However, Bialystok and other researchers have pointed out that communication strategies may be employed by language learners when there has been no breakdown in communications (no problematicity) and that language learners typically use the same small set of strategies routinely, rather than intentionally and consciously choosing to employ a communications strategy.\n\nSome learners' interlanguages are characterized by communication strategies, and Larry Selinker has noted that they are one of the processes that leads to learner errors. Based on this observation, Rod Ellis suggests that the communication strategies that learners use may be characteristic of the stage of development which they have reached.\n\n"}

However, due to discontent in Croatian intellectual circles, beginning in the late 1960s Croatian cultural workers started to refer to the language exclusively as 'the Croatian literary language', or sometimes 'the Croatian or Serbian language' (these two names were also prescribed in the Croatian constitution of 1974), as was common before Yugoslavia. The language was regarded as one common language with different variants and dialects. The unity of the language was emphasized, making the differences not an indicator of linguistic divisions, but rather factors enriching the 'common language' diversity. In addition, Yugoslavia had two other official languages on the federal level, Slovenian and Macedonian, reflecting Yugoslavia's acceptance of diversity with regards to language use. No attempts were made to assimilate those languages into the Serbo-Croatian language.\n\nWith the breakup of the Federation, in search of additional indicators of independent and separate national identities, language became a political instrument in virtually all of the new republics. With a boom of neologisms in Croatia, an additional emphasis on Turkisms in the Muslim parts of Bosnia and a privileged position of the Cyrillic script in Serb-inhabited parts of the new states, every state and entity showed a 'nationalization' of the language. The language in Bosnia started developing independently after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in 1992. The independent development of the language in Montenegro became a topic among some Montenegrin academics in the 1990s.\n\nSerbian and Bosnian language standards tend to be inclusive, i.e. to accept a wider range of idioms and to use loanwords (German and Turkish), whereas the Croatian language policy is more purist and prefers neologisms to loan-words, as well as the re-use of neglected older words. Yet there is criticism of the puristic language policy even in Croatia, as exemplified by linguist Snježana Kordić. These approaches are, again, due to the different cultural, historical and political development of the three variants and the societies they are found in.\n\nThough all of the language variants could theoretically use either, the scripts differ:\n\nAll standard languages have the same set of 30 regular phonemes, so the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian Latin and Serbian Cyrillic alphabets map one to one with one another and with the phoneme inventory.\n\nSome linguists analyze the yat reflexes and , commonly realized as in Croatian and Bosnian dialects, as a separate phoneme – \"jat diphthong\" – or even two phonemes, one short and one long. There are even several proposals by Croatian linguists for an orthography reform concerning these two diphthongs, but they have not been seriously considered for implementation.\n\nThe ongoing standardization of Montenegrin has introduced two new letters, and , for the sounds and respectively. These are optional spellings of the digraphs and . Critics note that and are merely allophones of and in Herzegovinian dialects such as Montenegrin, so the new letters are not required for an adequate orthography.\n\nMost dialects of Serbia originally lack the phoneme , instead having , , or nothing (silence). was introduced with language unification, and the Serbian standard allows for some doublets such as \"snaja\"–\"snaha\" and \"hajde\"–\"ajde\". However, in other words, especially those of foreign origin, is mandatory.\n\nIn some regions of Croatia and Bosnia, sounds for letters (realized as in most other dialects) and merged or nearly merged, usually into . The same happened with their voiced counterparts, i.e. and merged into . As result, speakers of those dialects often have difficulties distinguishing these sounds.\n\nThe Serbian variety usually phonetically transcribes foreign names and words (although both transcription and transliteration are allowed), whereas the Croatian standard usually transliterates. Bosnian also usually follows the Serbian model.\n\nAlso, when the subject of the future tense is omitted, producing a reversal of the infinitive and auxiliary \"ću\", only the final \"i\" of the infinitive is orthographically elided in Croatian and Bosnian, whereas in Serbian the two have merged into a single word:\n\n\nIn general, the Shtokavian dialects that represent the foundation of the four standard languages have four pitch accents on stressed syllables: falling tone on a short vowel, written e.g. in dictionaries; rising tone on a short vowel, written e.g. ; falling tone on a long vowel, written e.g. ; and rising tone on a long vowel, written e.g. . In addition, the following unstressed vowel may be either short, , or long, . In declension and verb conjugation, accent shifts, both by type and position, are very frequent.\n\nThe distinction between four accents and preservation of post accent lengths is common in vernaculars of western Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in parts of Serbia, as well as in parts of Croatia with strong Serb immigration. In addition, a distinct characteristics of some vernaculars is stress shift to proclitics, e.g. phrase \"u Bosni\" (\"in Bosnia\") will be pronounced instead of as in northern parts of Serbia.\n\nThe northern vernaculars in Serbia also preserve the four-accent system, but the unstressed lengths have been shortened or disappeared in some positions. However, the shortening of post-accent lengths is in progress in all Shtokavian vernaculars, even in those most conservative in Montenegro. Stress shift to enclitics is, however, in northern Serbia rare and mostly limited to negative verb constructs (\"ne znam\" = \"I don't know\" > ).\n\nThe situation in Croatia, is however, different. A large proportion of speakers of Croatian, especially those coming from Zagreb, do not distinguish between rising and falling accents. This is considered to be a feature of the Zagreb dialect, which has strong Kajkavian influence, rather than Standard Croatian.\n\nRegardless of vernacular differences, all three standard languages exclusively promote the Neo-Shtokavian four-accentual system. Both dialects that are considered to be the basis of Standard Serbian (Eastern Herzegovinian and Šumadija-Vojvodina dialects) have four accents.\n\nThere are three principal \"pronunciations\" (\"izgovori\"/изговори) of the Štokavian dialect that differ in their reflexes of the proto-Slavic vowel jat vowel. Illustrated by the Common Slavic word for \"child\", \"dětę\", they are:\n\n\nThe Serbian language recognizes Ekavian and Ijekavian as equally valid pronunciations, whereas Croatian and Bosnian accept only the Ijekavian pronunciation. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (regardless of the official language) and in Montenegro, the Ijekavian pronunciation is used almost exclusively.\n\nIkavian pronunciation is nonstandard, and is limited to dialectal use in Dalmatia, Lika, Istria, central Bosnia (area between Vrbas and Bosna), Western Herzegovina, Bosanska Krajina, Slavonia and northern Bačka (Vojvodina). So, for example:\n\nA few Croatian linguists have tried to explain the following differences in morphological structure for some words, with the introduction of a new vowel, \"jat diphthong\". This is not the opinion of most linguists.\n\nSometimes this leads to confusion: Serbian poticati (to stem from) is in Croatian and Bosnian \"to encourage\". Croatian and Bosnian \"to stem from\" is potjecati, whereas Serbian for \"encourage\" is podsticati.\n\nStandard Bosnian allows both variants, and ambiguities are resolved by preferring the Croatian variant; this is a general practice for Serbian–Croatian ambiguities.\n\nThe phoneme /x/ (written as \"h\") has been volatile in eastern South Slavic dialects. In Serbian and some Croatian dialects (including some of those in Slavonia), it has been replaced with /j/, /v/, or elided, and subsequent standardization sanctioned those forms:\n\nHowever, /x/ and /ɛf/ have been kept in many words as a distinct feature of Bosnian speech and language tradition, particularly under influence of Turkish and Arabic, and even introduced in some places where it etymologically did not exist. Those forms are now also accepted in standard Bosnian:\n\nBecause the Ijekavian pronunciation is common to all official standards, it will be used for examples on this page. Other than this, examples of different morphology are:\n\nAlso many internationalisms and transliterations are different:\n\nHistorically, modern-age internationalisms entered Bosnian and Croatian mostly through German and Italian, whereas they entered Serbian through French and Russian, so different localization patterns were established based on those languages. Also, Greek borrowings came to Serbian directly, but through Latin into Croatian:\n\nMost of terms for chemical elements are different: for international names, Bosnian and Croatian use \"-ij\" where Serbian has \"-ijum\" (\"uranij\"–\"uranijum\"). In some native names, Croatian have \"-ik\" where Serbian has -(o)nik (\"kisik\"–\"kiseonik\" 'oxygen', \"vodik\"–\"vodonik\" 'hydrogen') and Bosnian accepts all variants. Yet others are totally different (\"dušik\"–\"azot\" 'nitrogen', \"kositar\"–\"kalaj\" 'tin'). Some element names are the same: \"srebro\" (silver), \"zlato\" (gold), \"bakar\" (copper).\n\nSome other imported words differ by grammatical gender, feminine words having an \"-a\" suffix and masculine words having a zero-suffix:\n\nIn Serbian and Bosnian, the pronoun \"what\" is \"što\" when used as a relative, but \"šta\" when used as an interrogative; the latter applies also to relative sentences with interrogative meaning. Croatian uses \"što\" in all contexts (but in colloquial speech, \"šta\" is often used).\n\nThis is applicable only to the nominative and the accusative – in all other cases, the standards have the same forms: \"čega\", \"čemu\" etc. for \"što\".\n\nIn Croatian, the pronoun \"who\" has the form \"tko\", whereas in Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin it has \"ko\", but again, in colloquial speech, the initial \"t\" is usually omitted. The declension is the same: \"kome\", \"koga\", etc. In addition, Croatian uses \"komu\" as an alternative form in the dative case.\n\nUsage of locative pronouns \"gd(j)e\", \"kuda\", and \"kamo\" differs between Serbian and Croatian (the latter not being used in Serbian):\n\nWith modal verbs such as \"ht(j)eti\" (want) or \"moći\" (can), the infinitive is prescribed in Croatian, whereas the construction \"da\" (that/to) + present tense is preferred in Serbian. This subjunctive of sorts is possibly an influence of the Balkan sprachbund. Again, both alternatives are present and allowed in Bosnian (the first one is preferred in orthography, the latter is more common in colloquial language).\nThe sentence \"I want to do that\" could be translated with any of\n\nThis difference partly extends to the future tense, which in Serbo-Croatian is formed in a similar manner to English, using (elided) present of verb \"ht(j)eti\" → \"hoću\"/\"hoćeš\"/ ... > \"ću\"/\"ćeš\"/ ... as auxiliary verb. Here, the infinitive is formally required in both variants:\n\n\nHowever, when \"da\"+present is used instead, it can additionally express the subject's will or intention to perform the action:\n\n\nThis form is more frequently used in Serbia and Bosnia. The nuances in meaning between the two constructs can be slight or even lost (especially in Serbian dialects), in similar manner as the \"shall/will\" distinction varies across English dialects. Overuse of \"da\"+present is regarded as Germanism in Serbian linguistic circles, and it can occasionally lead to awkward sentences.\n\nHowever, Croatians seldom naturally use \"da\"+present form. Instead, a different form can be used to express will:\n\n(The sentence would sound more Croatian, but keep the same meaning, if it stated: \"Želim to učiniti.\", as \"uraditi\" is uncommon in Croatian).\n\nIn interrogative and relative constructs, standard Croatian prescribes using the interrogative participle \"li\" after the verb, whereas standard Serbian also allows forms with \"da li\". (A similar situation exists in French, where a question can be formed either by inversion or using \"est-ce que\", and can be stretched in English with modal verbs):\n\n\nIn addition, non-standard \"je li\" (\"Is it?\"), usually elided to \"je l' \", is vernacular for forming all kinds of questions, e.g. \"Je l' možeš?\". In standard language, it is used only in questions involving auxiliary verb \"je\" (=\"is\"):\n\n\nIn summary, the English sentence \"I want to know whether I'll start working\" would \"typically\" read:\n\n\nalthough many in-between combinations could be met in vernacular speech, depending on speaker's dialect, idiolect, or even mood.\n\nThe Croatian avoidance of \"da li\" is largely an expression of prescriptivism. In everyday speech in Croatia, \"da li\" is used, in fact, extensively, but avoided in written language.\n\nIn formal Croatian, verb \"trebati\" (\"need\" or \"should\") is transitive, as in English. In Serbian and Bosnian, it is impersonal, like the French \"il faut\", or the English construct \"is necessary (to)\"; the grammatical subject is either omitted (\"it\"), or presents the object of needing; the person that needs something is an indirect grammatical object, in the dative case. The latter usage is, however, also encountered in Croatian, especially in spoken form.):\n\nThe greatest differences between the standards is in vocabulary. However, most words are well understood, and even occasionally used, in the other standards. In most cases, common usage favors one variant and the other(s) are regarded as \"imported\", archaic, dialectal, or simply more rarely used. The preference for certain words depends on the speaker's geographic origin rather than ethnicity; for example, Serbs from Bosnia use \"mrkva\" and \"hlače\" rather than \"šargarepa\" and \"pantalone\".\n\nNote that there are only a few differences that can cause confusion, for example the verb \"ličiti\" means \"to look like\" in Serbian and Bosnian, but in Croatian it is \"sličiti\"; \"ličiti\" means \"to paint (a house)\". However, \"ličiti\" is often used Croatian in the meaning of \"to look like\".\n\nThe word \"bilo\" means \"white\" in the Ikavian accent, \"pulse\" in official Croatian, and \"was\" in all official languages, although it is not so confusing when pronounced because of different accentuation (\"bîlo\" or \"bílo\" = white, \"bı̏lo\" = pulse, \"bílo\" = was).\n\nIn Serbian and Bosnian, the word \"izvanredan\" (extraordinary) has only the positive meaning (excellent), \"vanredan\" being used for \"unusual\" or \"out of order\"; however, only \"izvanredan\" is used in Croatian in both contexts.\n\nAlso note that in most cases Bosnian officially allows almost all of the listed variants in the name of \"language richness\", and ambiguities are resolved by preferring the Croatian variant. Bosnian vocabulary writers based their decisions on usage of certain words in literary works by Bosnian authors.\n\nThe months have Slavic-derived names in Croatian, wheres Serbian and Bosnian have almost the same set of international Latin-derived names as English. The Slavic-derived names may also be used in Bosnian, but the international names are preferred.\nThe international names of the months are well understood in Croatia and are used in several fixed expressions such as \"Prvi Maj\" (May 1), \"Prvi April\" (April Fools' Day) or \"Oktobarska revolucija\" (October Revolution).\n\nIn spoken Croatian and in western Bosnia it is common to refer to a month by its number. Therefore, many speakers refer to the month of May as \"peti mjesec\" (\"the fifth month\"). Saying \"sedmi peti\" (\"seventh of fifth\") would be the equivalent of May 7.\n\n\nThe following samples, taken from article 1 to 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are \"synonymous texts, translated as literally as possible\" in the sense of Ammon designed to demonstrate the differences between the standard varieties treated in this article in a continuous text.\n\n\n"}

It describes the attempts of competent speakers of a language to guide the grammatical use of novice speakers, such as children.\n\nNegative evidence in language acquisition consists of evidence that demonstrates which grammatical constructions in a language are ungrammatical. Furthermore, Saxton (1997) asserts that negative evidence supplies the \" correct adult model\" for novice speakers to avoid future grammatical mishaps. Negative evidence corrections, in whatever form they appear, necessarily follow immediately after an incorrect, often ungrammatical, utterance. Note that although parent often \"understand\" their children, and these production mistakes aren't usually egregious enough for the parent to not be able to correct it, negative evidence deals with the conventional standards of grammar in a language and the correct model of grammar structures, not communicative ones.\n\nDirect negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence in that it is explicitly presented to a language learner (for example, a child might be corrected by a parent) whereas indirect negative evidence is inferred from the absence of ungrammatical utterances in a given language. Though it is generally agreed that there is positive evidence (i.e. evidence that demonstrates grammatical linguistic constructions) in the language input, there is a dearth of direct negative evidence in the general language learner input since most native or veteran speakers produce grammatical as opposed to ungrammatical speech.\n\nOne of the difficulties surrounding language acquisition is that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a correct grammar, otherwise referred to as the argument of the poverty of the stimulus. This is a commonly held position by nativists, who believe that there are innate mechanisms which facilitate language learning. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by direct negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument then assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.\n\nThe view that there is \"no negative evidence\" in the input is held by a number of researchers in the field of language acquisition who assert that if children are to learn language, then they must be able to learn language by solely examining the positive evidence that they do receive from the input since there is not enough negative evidence to be useful for language learning. Some propose that direct negative evidence would be necessary for children to develop a fully formed grammar, so it has also often been argued that children cannot learn a language by only receiving positive evidence, and that therefore there must be innate constraints on their biology which would allow them to learn language.\n\nImplicit negative evidence is a type of corrective feedback in which parental responses to a child's incorrect statements is indicative of the utterance's ungrammaticality. It is argued that there is a shortage of \"explicit\" direct negative evidence in the general input of learners. However, others have conducted studies that demonstrate that there is suitable \"implicit\" direct negative evidence present in parental responses to their children. There have been a number of studies regarding this type of evidence in which researchers have demonstrated that parents do respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances.\n\nThere are a number of applications of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to ungrammatical - not necessarily incorrect or unintelligible - utterances. Parents intend to correct their children with these corrective techniques. Recasts are one such kind of evidence, in which a parent \"expands, deletes, permutes, or otherwise changes [a child's utterance] while maintaining significant overlap in meaning.\" Sometimes parents recast children's sentences after children produce ungrammatical utterances, and some believe that children use this evidence to correct mistakes in their grammar, even though recasts can also occur after children construct grammatical utterances. One theory for why the children even react to the negative feed back is that they trust the grammar judgements of adults - given adults are older and more experienced with language, their word choice must be credible and that intended meaning children want to convey has to follow the language constraints imposed by those adults. Experiments have been conducted which have demonstrated that children improve in grammatical forms when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts, which supports some scholars' claims that direct negative evidence does have an assocaible presence in learner's grammar. Similar studies have been conducted demonstrating that when parents recast children's morphological errors, children sometimes attempt to correct their initial errors. Such conclusions have received some as many such studies do not specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts and why children only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others.\n\nChouinard conducted a follow up study in which she examined how children respond to parental reformulation (a type of negative evidence in which parents correct an ungrammatical utterance of a child), and she found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to this kind of implicit correction in predictable ways. It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances, usually in an effort to clarify the child's meaning, though not all of the reformulations are intended to \"correct\" children's speech errors, such as cases where parents expand a child's utterance to seek additional information . Reformulations are in direct contrast to the child-utterance, which contained an error. The correction takes place in the same location as the error, thus providing the child with evidence for \"where\" they made an error. It is the presence of the reformulations as well as the high percentage of correct parental speech that allows children to learn. Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning. As Levine's study demonstrates that children attend to even parental responses which are non-corrective, other researchers have also conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not need feedback which corrects grammatical errors in order to learn.\n\nThough there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use the implicit negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis. Some linguists, such as Gary Marcus, argue that the implicit negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language. Marcus and others, such as Hendriks and Baker, believe negative evidence is a weak form of evidence because children gradually learn from a limited corpus of correct or incorrect utterances that is grammatical or ungrammatical, which undermines the import of direct negative evidence to begin with. Children do not receive negative reactions for each of their negative utterances. There isn't enough of a correlation between negative evidence from parents to the occurrence of ungrammatical utterances from their children for infant learners to be able to base grammatically on negative evidence, as has been concluded in previous corpus studies. According to Morgan, Bonamo & Travis (1995), there is no evidence that recasts would dissuade a child from his or her ungrammatical utterances. They argue that children may interpret a recast simply as an alternative way to say something and what they had just said is equally valid.\n\nPositive evidence from a parent can immediately be assumed to be grammatical, yet not every parents will correct every child error and some children may even benefit from fewer constraints, which diminishes the necessity of direct negative evidence. In spite of the inconsistencies of the negative evidence in the input, all children eventually arrive at a correct grammar which supports the fact that the negative evidence cannot account for a child's ability to learn a grammar since not all children receive the same negative evidence. To the contrary, Marcus states that the more positive evidence for irregular forms a child is exposed to the less likely they are to overgeneralize grammatical concepts. He explains this as a function of an inherent mechanism and the child can suppress the grammatical rule in cases where it does not apply. Finally, Marcus argues that a child can easily acquire grammatical rules, but cannot receive direct feedback from a parent in every case to determine where irregularities occur, thus making implicit negative evidence practically useless for a language learner.\n"}

The term is used by Arab Christians and Arab Muslims. Internationally Muslims use it as a greeting for use on the festivals of Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. \"Eid\" means \"celebration\", and \"Mubarak\" means \"blessings\". In the social sense, people usually celebrate Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid-al-Adha in the month of Dhul Haj (12th and Final Islamic month). Some state this exchange of greetings is a cultural tradition and not part of any religious obligation. \n\nThroughout the Muslim world there are numerous other greetings for Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr. The companions of the Prophet Mohammad used to say to each other in Arabic when they met on Eid ul-Fitr: \"Taqabbalallâhu minnâ wa minkum\" (which means \"[May] God accept from us and you [our fasts and deeds]\"). Throughout the Muslim world, variations in Eid greetings exist.\n\nArab Christians and Arab Muslims use the term Eid Mubarak, and have a number of other ways to say happy holiday. Some Arabs also add \"kul 'am wantum bikhair\" (كل عام و أنتم بخير), which means \"May you be well with every passing year.\"\n\nBosnian Muslims also commonly say \"Bajram Šerif mubarek olsun\", the response is \"Allah razi olsun\". Another common Eid greeting by Bosnian Muslims is \"Bajram barećula\".\n\nIn Serbia muslims usually celebrate by saying \"Bajram Šerif Mumbarek Olsun\" to which the other replay's with \"Allah Razi Olsun\"\n\nIn the Philippines, it is recognized as a legal holiday, though the greeting of Eid Mubarak has gained traction only recently.\n\nIn Turkey, Turks wish each other happy holidays with Turkish phrases including: \"Bayramınız kutlu olsun\" (\"May your holiday be happy\"), \"İyi Bayramlar\" (\"Good Holidays\"), and \"Bayramınız mübarek olsun\" (\"May your holiday be blessed\").\n\nIn India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Eid Mubarak wishes are very common and often accompanied by hugging three times after the Salat al Eid.\n\nPashto speakers (mainly Pashtun people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Afghanistan) also use the Eid greeting \"\"May your festival be blessed\" ( ; \"akhtar de nekmregha sha\"). Balochi speakers (mainly Baloch people from Balochistan province and Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province) also use the Eid greeting \"May your Eid be blessed\" ( ; \"aied tara mubarak ba\"). Brahui speakers may also use the Eid greeting \"Have a blessed Eid\" ( ; \"aied ne mubarak mare\").\n\nMany Bangladeshis may also use the Eid greeting, \"Eid's Greetings\"\" (ঈদের শুভেচ্ছা; \"Eider Shubheccha\").\n\nHausa language originally from Northern Nigeria is widely spoken among Muslims in West Africa. Their equivalent Eid greetings in Hausa is \"Barka da Sallah\" which translates to \"blessed Eid prayers\".\n\n\"Ni ti yuun' palli\" is the Eid greetings among Dagbanli speakers in Ghana. It means \"Happy new Eid season\". The Hausa greeting \"Barka da Sallah\" is also a common exchange during the period.\n\nMuslims in other countries, such as Indonesia and Malay language-speaking population (Malaysia, Brunei, & Singapore) use the expression \"Selamat Hari Raya\" or \"Selamat Idul Fitri\" (Indonesian) or \"Salam Aidilfitri\" (Malay). This expression is usually accompanied by the popular expression \"Minal Aidin wal Faizin\", an Arab sentence meaning \"May we be sacred one more time and succeed in our fasting\". The expression is not recognized by people in the Arab world, although it's in the Arabic language. It is a quotation from a poem written by Shafiyuddin Al-Huli during the time Muslims ruled in Al-Andalus.\nPersian speaking Muslims use the term \"eid shoma mubarak\"(عید شما مبارک)(happy eid).\n\n"}

After receiving a master's degree in economics from the University of Mumbai, he worked as a professor of economics at Sydenham College and also a few other colleges in Mumbai.He was the first principal of well known Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics from 1964-71. Gadgil served as Vice-president and member of the General Council of the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, from 1988-93. He served as the President of the Mumbai Marathi Sahitya Sangh from 1983-1999. Gadgil was a prolific and multi-faceted writer, with published work in Economics, Literature, Biography, Literary Criticism and Travel Writing. The Library of Congress, South Asian Literary Recordings Project has recordings of his reading from six of his books. They have also acquired sixty-five of his books for their collection.\n\nGadgil's keen intellect, his restlessness and his willingness to experiment led him to write in many different genres, both literary and discursive. Gadgil wrote novels, travelogues, plays, literary criticism, children's stories, and a large number of short stories. His work has been translated into several languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Malay and Turkish.\n\nWhile he wrote in many genre, he is best known for revolutionizing the Marathi short story in the post-independence years, and creating, along with notables such as Mardhekar, a new tradition of literary realism in the Navkatha or new Marathi short story. His short stories depict the lives of ordinary middle-class Maharashtrian people with subtlety, sensitivity and psychological depth. His first short story, \"Priya ani Manjar\" was published in 1941. By the end of his life he had published more than 300 short stories in multiple volumes.\n\nHis first novella, \"Liliche Phool\" (1955) is an exploration of the themes of love, in all its forms, physical and emotional, in the life of a young actress. It is a novel that is haunting as it traces the choices she makes and the dilemmas she faces.\n\n\"Durdamya\", another major work by Gadgil, is a biographical novel about Lokmanya Bal Ganagdhar Tilak, a political leader in the struggle for Indian Independence. It is a depiction of Tilak as a man, along with the qualities that made him a visionary leader, rooting him in the political and social upheavals of that period. \"Durdamya\" also draws convincing portraits of other leaders in the freedom struggle such as Justice M. G. Ranade, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nGadgil had a deep and intense relationship with Mumbai, the city of his birth. He loved Mumbai, studied its history, and wrote biographical profiles of many notable historical figures such a Dadabhai Naoroji, Walchand Hirachand and Vishwanath Narayan Mandalik, which have been published as monographs. In \"Prarambh\", a major and ambitious later historicalnovel, he approached the history of Mumbai through the figure of Jagannath Shankarshet, a towering public figure from the early 1800s. The biographical novel interweaves his life and works with the social, commercial and cultural evolution of the city in the 19th centrury, and incorporates as characters Indian and British figures such as Jamshedtjee Jeejeebhoy, Bhau Daji Lad, Governor Mountstuart Elphinstone, who helped shaped Mumbai into a modern metropolis.\n\nGadgil was also a well loved humorist who wrote short stories, humorous plays and humorous essay. His particular brand of humor and satire was \"nirvish vinod\" or non-poisonous humor. He approaches his subjects, whether in his essays about Mumbaikars or in his humorous plays and short stories, with a wry yet warm humor poking gentle fun at all too human foibles, and sometimes venturing into the fantastical. His humorous series of books about Bandu Abjabuddhe, his wife Snehalata, and his friend Nanu are beloved and continue to be performed as one act plays in colleges and community events in Maharashtra. \"Crazy Bombay\" is a collection of essays, many written as a column for the Illustrated Weekly of India and is a humorous tribute to the city he loves and to its denizens.\n\nChildren's stories and plays were another genre Gadgil explored. From the early one-act plays such as \"Mule\" \"Chor Pakadtat\" to his later series of modern fairy tales Ashrunche Jhale Hire, his books for children are a reflection of his playfulness as a writer.\n\nGadgil was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1996 for his autobiography \"Eka Mungiche Mahabharata\". In it he traces his growth and evolution as a writer as much, if not more than, the events of his life. Gadgil's autobiography contains vivid portraits of writers and poets who were his contemporaries and friends.\n\nGadgil was a champion of consumer rights. He was associated with \"Grahak Panchayat, Mumbai\" for a long time, and served for 15 years as the organization's president.\n\nHe wrote text books on Economics for college students. For some time, he served as an economic and financial advisor to Walchand Hirachand Group.\n\n\nThe following is a partial list of Gadgil's books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is a University Professor at the Columbia University and a founding member of the establishment's Institute for Comparative Literature and Society.\n\nConsidered one of the most influential postcolonial intellectuals, Spivak is best known for her essay \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" and for her translation of and introduction to Jacques Derrida's \"De la grammatologie\". She also translated such works of Mahasweta Devi as \"Imaginary Maps\" and \"Breast Stories\" into English and with separate critical appreciation on the texts and Devi's life and writing style in general.\n\nSpivak was awarded the 2012 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for being \"a critical theorist and educator speaking for the humanities against intellectual colonialism in relation to the globalized world.\" In 2013, she received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award given by the Republic of India.\n\nSpivak was born Gayatri Chakravorty in Calcutta, India, to Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty. Spivak's great grandfather Pratap Chandra Majumdar had been Sri Ramakrishna's doctor. Her father Paresh Chandra Chakrabarti was \"initiated (given diksha)\" by Sri Sarada Devi, and her mother Sivani Chakrabarti, by Swami Shivananda. After completing her secondary education at St. John's Diocesan Girls' Higher Secondary School, Spivak attended Presidency College, Kolkata under the University of Calcutta, from which she graduated in 1959.\n\nIn 1961, Spivak joined the graduate program in English at Cornell University, travelling on money borrowed on a so-called \"life mortgage.\" In 1962, unable to secure financial aid from the department of English, she transferred to Comparative Literature, a new program at Cornell, under the guidance of its first Director, Paul de Man, with insufficient preparation in French and German. Her dissertation, advised by Paul de Man, was on W.B. Yeats and titled \"Myself Must I Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats\". In 1959, upon graduation, she secured employment as an English tutor for forty hours a week. Her MA thesis was on the representation of innocence in Wordsworth with M.H. Abrams. In 1963-64, she attended Girton College, Cambridge, as a research student under the supervision of Professor T.R. Henn, writing on the representation of the stages of development of the lyric subject in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. She presented a course in the summer of 1963 on \"Yeats and the Theme of Death\" at the Yeats Summer School in Sligo, Ireland. (She returned there in 1987 to present Yeats' position within post-coloniality.)\n\nIn the Fall of 1965, Spivak became an assistant professor in the department of English, University of Iowa. She received tenure in 1970. She did not publish her doctoral dissertation, but decided to write a critical book on Yeats that would be accessible to her undergraduate students without compromising her intellectual positions. The result is her first book, written for young adults, \"Myself I Must Remake: The Life and Poetry of W.B. Yeats\".\n\nIn 1967, on her regular attempts at self-improvement, Spivak purchased a book, by an author unknown to her, entitled \"De la grammatologie\". She decided to translate the book by an unknown author, and wrote a long translator's preface. This publication was immediately a success, and the Translator's Preface became popular across the world as an introduction to the philosophy of deconstruction launched by the author, Jacques Derrida; whom Spivak met in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, at the University of Iowa, Spivak founded the MFA in Translation in the department of Comparative Literature . The following year, she became the Director of the Program in Comparative Literature and was promoted to full professorship. In 1978, she was National Humanities Professor at the University of Chicago. She received many subsequent residential visiting professorships and fellowships.\n\nIn 1978, she moved to the University of Texas at Austin as professor of English and Comparative Literature. In 1982, she was appointed as the Longstreet Professor in English and Comparative Literature at Emory University. In 1986, she went to the University of Pittsburgh as the first Mellon Professor of English. Here she established the Cultural Studies program. In 1991, she joined Columbia University as Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, where, in 2007, she was made University Professor in the Humanities.\n\nSpivak has received 11 honorary doctorates: University of Toronto, University of London, Oberlin College, Universitat Rovira Virgili, Rabindra Bharati University, Universidad Nacional de San Martín, University of St Andrews, Université de Vincennes à Saint-Denis, Presidency University, Yale University, University of Ghana-Legon. In 2012, she became the only Indian recipient of the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy in the category of Arts and Philosophy.\n\nSpivak has served on the advisory board of numerous academic journals, including \"differences\", \"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society\", and \"Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies\".\n\nApart from Derrida, Spivak has also translated the fiction of the Bengali author, Mahasweta Devi; the poetry of the 18-century Bengali poet Ram Prashad Sen; and most recently \"A Season in the Congo\" by Aimé Césaire, poet, essayist and statesman from Martinique. In 1997 she received a prize for translation into English from the Sahitya Akadami—the National Academy of Literature in India.\n\nHer essay, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\", (1983) established Spivak among the ranks of feminists who consider history, geography, and class when thinking about women. In all her work, Spivak's main effort has been to try to find ways of accessing the subjectivity of those who are being investigated. She is hailed as a critic who has feminized and globalized the philosophy of deconstruction, considering the position of the subaltern, a word used by Antonio Gramsci as describing ungeneralizable fringe groups of society who lack access to citizenship. In the early 80s, she was also hailed as a co-founder of postcolonial theory, which she refused to accept fully, as has been demonstrated in her book \"Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present\" (1999), which suggests that so-called postcolonial theory should be considered from the point of view of who uses it in what interest. Spivak's other works are: \"In Other Worlds\" (1987), \"Outside in the Teaching Machine\" (1993), \"Death of a Discipline\" (2003), \"Other Asias\" (2008), and \"An Aesthetic Education in the Age of Globalization\" (2012).\n\nSince 1986, Spivak has been engaged in teaching and training adults and children among the landless illiterates on the border of West Bengal and Bihar/Jharkhand. This sustained attempt to access the epistemologies damaged by the millennial oppression of the caste system has allowed her to understand the situation of globality as well as the limits of high theory more clearly. In 1997, her friend Lore Metzger, a survivor of the Third Reich, left her $10,000 in her will, to help with the work of rural education. With this, Spivak established the Pares Chandra and Sivani Chakravorty Memorial Foundation for Rural Education; to which she contributed the majority of her Kyoto Prize.\n\nIn \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" Spivak discusses the lack of an account of the Sati practice, leading her to reflect on whether the subaltern can even speak. Spivak writes about the process, the focus on the Eurocentric Subject as they disavow the problem of representation; and by invoking the Subject of Europe, these intellectuals constitute the subaltern Other of Europe as anonymous and mute.\n\nSpivak rose to prominence with her translation of Derrida's \"De la grammatologie\", which included a translator's introduction that has been described as \"setting a new standard for self-reflexivity in prefaces.\" After this, as a member of the \"Subaltern Studies Collective,\" she carried out a series of historical studies and literary critiques of imperialism and international feminism. She has often referred to herself as a \"practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist.\" Her predominant ethico-political concern has been for the space occupied by the subaltern, especially subaltern women, both in discursive practices and in institutions of Western cultures. Edward Said wrote of Spivak's work, \"She pioneered the study in literary theory of non-Western women and produced one of the earliest and most coherent accounts of that role available to us.\"\n\nHer \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason,\" published in 1999, explores how major works of European metaphysics (e.g., Kant, Hegel) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects.\n\nSpivak coined the term \"strategic essentialism,\" which refers to a sort of temporary solidarity for the purpose of social action. For example, women's groups have many different agendas that potentially make it difficult for feminists to work together for common causes; \"Strategic essentialism\" allows for disparate groups to accept temporarily an \"essentialist\" position that enables them able to act cohesively.\n\nHowever, while others have built upon this idea of \"strategic essentialism,\" Spivak has been unhappy with the ways the concept has been taken up and used. In interviews, she has disavowed the term, although she has not completely deserted the concept itself.\n\nShe has been a Guggenheim fellow, has received numerous academic honours including an honorary doctorate from Oberlin College, and has been on the editorial board of academic journals such as boundary 2. In March 2007, Columbia University President Lee Bollinger appointed Spivak University Professor, the institution's highest faculty rank. In a letter to the faculty, he wrote,\n\nSpivak's writing has received some criticism, including the suggestion that her work puts style ahead of substance. It has been argued in her defense, however, that this sort of criticism reveals an unwillingness to substantively engage with her texts. Judith Butler has noted that Spivak's supposedly complex language has, in fact, resonated with and profoundly changed the thinking of \"tens of thousands of activists and scholars.\" On the other hand, Terry Eagleton has lamented that \"If colonial societies endure what Spivak calls 'a series of interruptions, a repeated tearing of time that cannot be sutured', much the same is true of her own overstuffed, excessively elliptical prose. She herself, unsurprisingly, reads the book's broken-backed structure in just this way, as an iconoclastic departure from 'accepted scholarly or critical practice'. But the ellipses, the heavy-handed jargon, the cavalier assumption that you know what she means, or that if you don't she doesn't much care, are as much the overcodings of an academic coterie as a smack in the face for conventional scholarship.\"\n\nIn speeches given and published since 2002, Spivak has addressed the issue of terrorism and suicide bombings. With the aim of bringing an end to suicide bombings, she has explored and \"tried to imagine what message [such acts] might contain,\" ruminating that \"suicidal resistance is a message inscribed in the body when no other means will get through.\" One critic has suggested that this sort of stylised language may serve to blur important moral issues relating to terrorism. However, Spivak stated in the same speech that \"single coerced yet willed suicidal 'terror' is in excess of the destruction of dynastic temples and the violation of women, tenacious and powerfully residual. It has not the banality of evil. It is informed by the stupidity of belief taken to extreme.\"\n\nSpivak has advised many significant postcolonial scholars. Professors Jenny Sharpe and Mark Sanders are among her former students.\n\nIn May 2018, she signed on to a collective letter that was sent to New York University following a sexual harassment suit filed by former NYU graduate student Nimrod Reitman against his advisor Avital Ronell. Spivak and the other signatories called the case a \"legal nightmare\" for Ronell and charged Reitman with conducting a \"malicious campaign\" against her. Judith Butler, the chief signatory, subsequently apologized for certain aspects of the letter. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because Hebrew uses an abjad, it can render English words in multiple ways. There are many uses for hebraization, which serve as a useful tool for Israeli learners of English by indicating the pronunciation of unfamiliar letters. An example would be the English name spelled \"Timothy\", which can be Hebraized as \"טימותי\" in the Hebrew alphabet.\n\nFor full spelling, when a reader is likely to err in the reading of a word, the use of niqqud or partial niqqud is recommended. This is especially true when writing foreign words, unfamiliar words, ambiguous words, or words that take a dagesh.\nFive letters in Hebrew, Nun, Mem, Tsadi, Pe/Fe, and Kaf, all have final or sofit (Hebrew: סוֹפִית \"sofit\") forms. That means, that the letters' appearances change when they are at the end of words from כ, פ, צ, מ, נ to ך, ף, ץ, ם, ן respectively. Final forms are used in transliteration when appropriate, with the exception of foreign words ending in a [p] sound, which retain the non-final form of פ, such as \"קטשופ\" (\"ketchup\").\n\nSince vowels are not consistent in English, they are more difficult to transliterate into other languages. Sometimes they are just transcribed by the actual English letter, and other times by its actual pronunciation (which also varies). For the most accurate transliteration, below is a table describing the different vowel sounds and their corresponding letters.\n\nHebrew has only 5 vowel sounds, with lack of discrimination in Hebrew between long and short vowels. In comparison, English which has around 12 vowel sounds (5 long, 7 short) depending on dialect. As a result, words such as sit/seat ( and ), hat/hut ( and ), and cop/cope ( and ) are transliterated as the Hebrew vowels , and . The English pronunciation can be known through prior context.\n\nVowels will sometimes be put into Hebrew by their letters, and not by their sounds, even though it is less accurate phonetically. For example, any sort of \"a\" sound written with the letter \"o\", (ex. mom, monitor, soft), will often be transliterated as an \"o\" vowel, that is, with a vav (ו). The same is the case for an -or ending (pronounced -er), it will also often be transliterated with a vav as well. If the word with the \"a\" sound (such as \"a\" or \"ah\"), as in \"ta ta\", or \"spa\", it will be treated as an \"a\".\n\nFor full spelling, the \"niqqudot\" (the \"dots\") is simply omitted, if partial vowelling is desired, especially for letters like Vav, then the niqqudot is retained.\n\nThe picture of the \"O\" represents whatever Hebrew letter is used.\n\nThe following are special cases for vowels at the beginning or end of a word. \"O\", \"U\", or \"I\" sound different at the beginning of a word, because they have no consonants before them. Therefore, Vav and Yud, by themselves, would be assumed to be their consonant versions (\"V\" and \"Y\" respectively) and not their vowel versions.\n\nIf the sounds (that is, vowels with no consonants before it) are made in the middle of a word, the same thing is done as shown below (or looking up, replace the \"ס\" with the aleph).\n\nFor full spelling, the \"niqqudot\" (the \"dots\") are simply omitted.\n\n\n\n"}

The language is one of Italian dialects. Some words have Italian prefixes and suffixes added to Hebrew words as well as Aramaic roots.\n\nThe glossonym type \"giudeo-italiano\" is of academic and relatively late coinage. In English, \"Judeo-Italian\" was first used by Lazaro Belleli in 1904 for his article \" Judæo-Greek and Judæo-Italian\" in the Jewish Encyclopedia (vol. 7, 310-313), describing the languages of the Jews of Corfu. In Italian, Giuseppe Cammeo referred to a \"Gergo giudaico-italiano\" in his 1909 article \"Studj dialettali\" (Vessillo Israelitico 57 (1909); the term first appears on p. 169). That same year, Umberto Cassuto used the term \"giudeo-italiano\", in the following:\n\nOne of the most accessible ways to view the Judeo-Italian language is by looking at translations in biblical texts such as the Torah and Hagiographia. Today, there are two locations, the Oxford Bodleian Library and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, in which these translated texts can be found.\n\n\nAccording to some scholars, there are some Judeo-Italian loan words that have found their way into Yiddish. For example, the word in Judeo-Italian for \"synagogue\" is \"scola\", as opposed to \"school,\" which is \"scuola\". The use of words for \"school\" to mean \"synagogue\" dates back to the Roman Empire. The Judeo-Italian distinction between \"scola\" and \"scuola\" parallels the Standard Yiddish distinction between \"shul/shil\" for 'synagogue' and \"shule\" for 'school'. Another example is \"iente\", from the Judeo-Italian yientile, as differentiated from the standard Italian \"gentile\", meaning 'noble'.\n\nJudeo-Italian regional dialects (\"ghettaioli\" \"giudeeschi\"), including:\n\nAt least two Judeo-Italian varieties, based on Salentino and Venetian varieties were also used in Corfu (see relevant section in Corfiot Italians).\n\nAll of the spoken Judeo-Italian varieties used a unique (among Jewish languages, although there are arguably parallels in Jewish English usage) combination of Hebrew verb stems with Italian conjugations (\"e.g.\", \"אכלר \"akhlare\"\", to eat; \"גנביר \"gannaviare\"\", to steal; \"דברר \"dabberare\"\", to speak; \"לכטיר \"lekhtire\"\", to go). Similarly there are abstract nouns such as \"טובזה \"tovezza\"\", goodness.\n\nAlso common are lexical incorporations from Hebrew, particularly those applicable to daily life. Terms from other Jewish languages such as Yiddish and Judaeo-Spanish were also incorporated.\n\nBagitto, the dialect of Livorno, is particularly rich in loanwords from Judaeo-Spanish and Judaeo-Portuguese.\n\nIt was claimed by Cassuto that most Judeo-Italian dialects reflect the Italian dialect of places further to the south, due to the fact that since the expulsion of the Jews from the Kingdom of Naples the general direction of Jewish migration in Italy has been northward.\n\nThe Judeo-Italian language can be found in a Haggadah, a Jewish prayer book typically used during a seder. Judeo-Italian is represented in this 1716 Venice Haggadah. \n\n\"Italkian\" is not used by the Library of Congress as a subject heading, neither does it figure as a reference to Judeo-Italian. The authorized subject heading is \"Judeo-Italian language\". Subheadings are:\n\nThe subject reference is: Judæo-Italian dialect. LC-MARC uses the following language codes :\nJudeo-Italian Assigned collective code [ita] (Italian).\n\nThis is in compliance with the International Organization for Standardization language code ISO 639-2 code (roa).\n\n\n"}

It was the official language of the Liao dynasty (907–1125) and the Qara Khitai (1124–1218).\n\nKhitan appears to have been related to the Mongolic languages; Juha Janhunen states, \"[T]he conception is gaining support that Khitan was a language in some respects radically different from the historically known Mongolic languages. If this view proves to be correct, Khitan is, indeed, best classified as a Para-Mongolic language.\"\n\nAlexander Vovin (2017) notes that Khitan has many Koreanic loanwords, pointing to intensive contact between Korean and Khitans. Both of the Korean's Goryeo dynasty and Khitan's Liao dynasty claimed themselves to be successors of Goguryeo, thus it is possible to assume the Koreanic words in Khitan are derived from the language of Goguryeo.\n\nKhitan was written using two mutually exclusive writing systems known as the Khitan large script and the Khitan small script. The small script, which was a syllabary, was used until the Jurchen-speaking Jin dynasty (1115–1234) replaced it in 1191. The large script was logographic like Chinese.\n\nThe \"History of Liao\" contains a volume of Khitan words transcribed in Chinese characters titled \"Glossary of National Language\" (國語解). It is found in Chapter 116.\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty erroneously identified the Khitan people and their language with the Solons, leading him to use the Solon language to \"correct\" Chinese character transcriptions of Khitan names in the \"History of Liao\" in his \"Imperial Liao-Jin-Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation\" (欽定遼金元三史國語解) project.\n\nThe Liao dynasty referred to the Khitan language with the term Guoyu 國語 \"National language\", which was also used by other non-Han Chinese dynasties in China to refer to their languages like Manchu of the Qing, Classical Mongolian during the Yuan dynasty, Jurchen during the Jin, and Xianbei during the Northern Wei. Even today, Mandarin is referred to in Taiwan as Guoyu.\n\nThere are several closed systems of Khitan lexical items for which systematic information is available. The following is a list of words in these closed systems that are similar to Mongolic. Mongolian equivalents are given after the English translation:\n\nCompared with Khitan, The Tungusic numerals of the Jurchen language differ significantly: three=ilan, five=shunja, seven=nadan, nine=uyun, hundred=tangu.\n\nThe Liaoshi records in Chapter 53:\n\n'Tao Saiyier' corresponds to Mongolian 'tavan sar' (fifth moon/month).

It combines elements of a traditional rental agreement with an exclusive right of first refusal option for later purchase on the home. It is a shortened name for Lease with Option to Purchase Contract.\n\n\"Monthly Payment\" - How much the tenant will be paying monthly.\n\"Rent Credit\" - How much of the tenant's monthly payment will go to the eventual down-payment of the property at the end of the lease. It is strongly suggested that the tenant establish an escrow account to ensure the security of his or her rent credit.\n\"Duration\" - The timeframe of the Lease-Purchase Agreement. Usually 2–3 years or more. \n\"Property Value\" - The locked-in sale price of the property. The Tenant-Buyer and Seller usually agree to keep the property value the same despite house market changes.\n\"Terms and Rules\" - This section talks about other details of the Lease such as property taxes, home repairs, homeowner's association fee, etc.\n\nIn a standard Lease-Purchase Contract, the two parties agree to a lease period during which rent is paid, and the terms of the sale at the end of the lease period, including sale price. Often, the contract is structured in two parts, one representing the \"lease term\" and the other a \"contract of sale\". The lease agreement expounds upon what responsibilities the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller undertake during the course of the lease. This contract will also include the option fee and how much of the monthly payment will be credited to the down-payment for the purchase of the home at the end of the lease.\n\nAt the end of the lease-term, the tenant/buyer has the option to purchase the house. The lump sum accrued from the initial deposit and the rent credit are only released to the buyer as down-payment on the house should the tenant/buyer decide to proceed with the purchase. The tenant/buyer is responsible for securing the necessary mortgage loan to finalize the purchase the home.\n\nAs is usually stated in the lease purchase contract, the option fee and accrued rent credit are both non-refundable should the tenant/buyer decide to walk at the end of the lease. The tenant/buyer is released from responsibility for the sale, and the landlord/seller is responsible for finding new tenants.\n\nShould the tenant/buyer be unable to purchase the house due to a lack of financing, the tenant and landlord can agree to extend the option period, convert the lease purchase contract into a traditional rental agreement, or end the contract with the tenant moving out and the landlord seeking other renters or buyers.\n\nLease-purchase contract agreements are open source in nature and flexible to the needs of the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller. Lease-purchase contracts are popular with tenant/buyers who have poor credit scores, lower savings for down payments, or people who are moving from one city to another but are pending a sale on their previous home. They are great for sellers who are having difficulty securing tenants for their properties, which can be common when a house is for sale.\n\nIn the United States, when credits are applied to a purchase price the agreement becomes a financing contract and these contracts have been identified as predatory lending arrangements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this federal law any financing arrangement requires the purchaser of an owner occupied dwelling (one to four living units) is to qualify for any financing contract with a registered Mortgage Loan Originator. There are exemptions under this federal law for homeowners financing their primary residence, those in the business of real estate such as landlords are considered dealers. In all states, rent to own arrangements are no longer compliant with federal financing requirements.\n\nCommercial loan arrangements are exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act, as a landlord might rent to own a property for the purpose of sub-letting to a tenant. This arrangement is not a popular arrangement but may be accomplished legally.\n\nLease-purchase contracts are not for everyone. As successful completion of the agreement and sale transaction requires financing through a traditional route, people whose circumstances will not allow them to receive a mortgage should abstain from rent-to-own real estate agreements.\n\nAmid concerns about how long saving for a deposit takes young professionals, a £400 million program was recently announced subsidizing rent at 20% for first-time homeowners. Subsidized rent prices lock in a period of time when the tenant-buyer saves, and the program requires sellers keep rent prices low to accommodate the process. At the end of the saving period, professionals have the option to purchase their flat. It now takes the average first-time buyer 22 years to save for a deposit without parental assistance.\n\nAuckland’s special housing area is subsidized by the Housing Foundation, providing homes for young families. Under their program, tenants pay rent on their homes for the first five years, then transition into paying mortgage payments. The Waimahia Inlet flagship development will see 282 new homes built over the next three years.\n\nThe Lagos State Home-Ownership Mortgage Scheme (LagosHOMS) is a rent-to-own housing program that targets people who currently cannot afford a mortgage, but given will be able to. Tenants are expected to pay rent for a period of time, after which they are invited to transition into mortgage payments. The program is designed with young professionals in mind, including teachers and junior public servants. The program has produced well over 200 new homeowners in the city.\n\n"}

High German is defined as those varieties of German which were affected by the Second Sound Shift; the Middle Low German and Middle Dutch languages spoken to the North and North West, which did not participate in this sound change, are not part of MHG. \n\nWhile there is no \"standard\" MHG, the prestige of the Hohenstaufen court gave rise in the late 12th century to a supra-regional literary language (\"\") based on Swabian, an Alemannic dialect. This historical interpretation is complicated by the tendency of modern editions of MHG texts to use \"normalised\" spellings based on this variety (usually called \"Classical MHG\"), which make the written language appear more consistent than is actually the case in the manuscripts. Scholars are uncertain as to whether the literary language reflected a supra-regional \"spoken\" language of the courts.\n\nAn important development in this period was the \"\", the eastward expansion of German settlement beyond the line which marked the limit of Old High German.

An older view puts the boundary with New High German around 1500. \n\nThere are several phonological criteria which separate MHG from the preceding Old High German period:\n\nCulturally, the two periods are distinguished by the transition from a predominantly clerical written culture, in which the dominant language was Latin, to one centred on the courts of the great nobles, with German gradually expanding its range of use. The rise of the Hohenstaufen dynasty in Swabia makes the South West the dominant region in both political and cultural terms.\n\nDemographically, the MHG period is characterised by a massive rise in population, terminated by the demographic catastrophe of the Black Death (1348). Along with the rise in population comes a territorial expansion eastwards (\"\"), which saw German-speaking settlers colonise land previously under Slav control. \n\nLinguistically, the transition to Early New High German is marked by four vowel changes which together produce the phonemic system of modern German, though not all dialects participated equally in these changes:\n\nThe centres of culture in the ENHG period are no longer the courts but the towns.\n\nThe dialect map of Germany by the end of the Middle High German period was much the same as that at the start of the 20th century, though the boundary with Low German was further south than it now is:\nWith the exception of Thuringian, the East Central German dialects are new dialects resulting from the \".\n\nMiddle High German texts are written in the Latin alphabet. There was no standardised spelling, but modern editions generally standardise according to a set of conventions established by Karl Lachmann in the 19th century. There are several important features in this standardised orthography which are not characteristics of the original manuscripts:\n\nA particular problem is that many manuscripts are of much later date than the works they contain; as a result, they bear the signs of later scribes having modified the spellings, with greater or lesser consistency, in accord with conventions of their time. In addition, there is considerable regional variation in the spellings that appear in the original texts, which modern editions largely conceal.\n\nThe standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following vowel spellings:\n\nGrammars (as opposed to textual editions) often distinguish between and , the former indicating the mid-open which derived from Germanic , the latter (often with a dot beneath it) indicating the mid-close which results from primary umlaut of short . No such orthographic distinction is made in MHG manuscripts.\n\nThe standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following consonant spellings:\n\nThe charts show the vowel and consonant systems of classical MHG. The spellings indicated are the standard spellings used in modern editions – there is much more variation in the manuscripts.\n\nNotes:\n\nMHG diphthongs are indicated by the spellings: , , , and , , , having the approximate values of , , , , , , and , respectively.\n\n\nMiddle High German pronouns of the first person refer to the speaker; those of the second person refer to an addressed person; and those of the third person refer to person or thing of which one speaks.\nThe pronouns of the third person may be used to replace nominal phrases. These have the same gender, number and case as the original nominal phrase.\n\nThe possessive pronouns ' are used like adjectives and hence take on adjective endings following the normal rules. This includes ' and ', despite the fact that they already end in '.\n\nThe inflected forms of the article depend on the number, the case and the gender of the corresponding noun. The definite article has the same plural forms for all three genders.\n\nDefinite article (strong)\n\nThe instrumental case, only existing in the neuter singular, is used only with prepositions: ', ', etc. In all the other genders and in the plural it is substituted with the dative: ', ', \".\n\nMiddle High German nouns were declined according to four cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative), two numbers (singular and plural) and three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), much like Modern High German, though there are several important differences.\n\nVerbs were conjugated according to three moods (indicative, subjunctive (conjunctive) and imperative), three persons, two numbers (singular and plural) and two tenses (present tense and preterite) There was a present participle, a past participle and a verbal noun that somewhat resembles the Latin gerund, but that only existed in the genitive and dative cases.\n\nAn important distinction is made between strong verbs (that exhibited ablaut) and weak verbs (that didn't).\n\nFurthermore, there were also some irregular verbs.\n\nThe present tense conjugation went as follows:\n\nThe bold vowels demonstrate umlaut; the vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.\n\nThe preterite conjugation went as follows:\n\nThe present tense conjugation went as follows:\n\nThe vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.\n\nThe preterite conjugation went as follows:\n\nThe text is the opening of Hartmann von Aue's \"Iwein\" ()\nCommentary: This text shows many typical features of Middle High German poetic language. Most Middle High German words survive into modern German in some form or other: this passage contains only one word (' 'say' 14) which has since disappeared from the language. But many words have changed their meaning substantially. ' (6) means 'state of mind', where modern German ' means courage. ' (3) can be translated with 'honour', but is quite a different concept of honour from modern German \"\"; the medieval term focusses on reputation and the respect accorded to status in society.\n\nThe text is the opening strophe of the \" ().\nMiddle High German\n<poem lang=\"gmh\">Uns ist in alten mæren    wunders vil geseit\nvon helden lobebæren,    von grôzer arebeit,\nvon freuden, hôchgezîten,    von weinen und von klagen,\nvon küener recken strîten    muget ir nu wunder hœren sagen.</poem>\n\nModern German translation\n<poem lang=\"de\">In alten Erzählungen wird uns viel Wunderbares berichtet\nvon ruhmreichen Helden, von hartem Streit,\nvon glücklichen Tagen und Festen, von Schmerz und Klage:\nvom Kampf tapferer Recken: Davon könnt auch Ihr nun Wunderbares berichten hören.</poem>\n\nEnglish translation\n<poem>In ancient tales many marvels are told us\nof renowned heroes, of great hardship\nof joys, festivities, of weepeing and lamenting\nof bold warriors' battles — now \"you\" may hear such marvels told!</poem>\nCommentary: All the MHG words are recognizable from Modern German, though ' (\"tale\") and ' (\"warrior\") are archaic and ' (\"praiseworthy\") has given way to '.

{"id": "601205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601205", "title": "Missing in action", "text": "Missing in action\n\nMissing in action (MIA) is a casualty classification assigned to combatants, military chaplains, combat medics, and prisoners of war who are reported missing during wartime or ceasefire. They may have been killed, wounded, captured, or deserted. If deceased, neither their remains nor grave has been positively identified. Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare or ceasefire.\n\nUntil around 1912, service personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with ID tags. As a result, if someone was killed in action and his body was not recovered until much later, there was little or no chance of identifying the remains. Starting around the time of the First World War, nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made ID tags. These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium. However, in the case of the British Army the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable. Although wearing ID tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed, burned or buried by the type of high explosive munitions routinely used in modern warfare. Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as jungle warfare, or submarine warfare, and air-crashes in remote mountainous terrain, or at sea. Alternatively, there could be administrative errors e.g. the actual location of a temporary battlefield grave could be misidentified or forgotten due to the \"fog of war\" Finally, since military forces had no strong incentive to keep detailed records of enemy dead, bodies were frequently buried (sometimes with their ID tags) in temporary graves, the locations of which were often lost or obliterated e.g. the forgotten mass grave at Fromelles. As a result, the remains of missing combatants might not be found for many years, if ever. When missing combatants are recovered and cannot be identified after a thorough forensic examination (including such methods as DNA testing and comparison of dental records) the remains are interred with a tombstone which indicates their unknown status.\n\nThe development of genetic fingerprinting in the late 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although it is possible to take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing ID tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier to come to terms with their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday. However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.\n\nIt is possible that some of the combatants who took part of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC went missing in action. Certainly, the numerous wars which followed over successive centuries created many MIAs. The list is long and includes most battles which have ever been fought by any nation. The usual problems of identification caused by rapid decomposition were exacerbated by the fact that it was common practice to loot the remains of the dead for any valuables e.g. personal items and clothing. This made the already difficult task of identification even harder. Thereafter the dead were routinely buried in mass graves and scant official records were retained. Notable examples include such medieval battles as Towton, the Hundred Years' War, the later English Civil Wars and Napoleonic Wars together with any battle taking place until around the middle of the 19th century. Starting around the time of the Crimean War, American Civil War and Franco-Prussian War, it became more common to make formal efforts to identify individual soldiers. However, since there was no formal system of ID tags at the time, this could be difficult during the process of battlefield clearance. Even so, there had been a notable shift in perceptions e.g. where the remains of a soldier in Confederate uniform were recovered from, say, the Gettysburg battlefield, he would be interred in a single grave with a headstone which stated that he was an unknown Confederate soldier. This change in attitudes coincided with the Geneva Conventions, the first of which was signed in 1864. Although the First Geneva Convention did not specifically address the issue of MIAs, the reasoning behind it (which specified the humane treatment of wounded enemy soldiers) was influential.\n\nThe phenomenon of MIAs became particularly notable during World War I, where the mechanized nature of modern warfare meant that a single battle could cause astounding numbers of casualties. For example, in 1916 over 300,000 Allied and German combatants were killed in the Battle of the Somme. A total of 19,240 British and Commonwealth combatants were killed in action or died of wounds on the first day of that battle alone. It is therefore not surprising that the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in France bears the names of 72,090 British and Commonwealth combatants, all of whom went missing in action during the Battle of the Somme, were never found and who have no known grave. Similarly, the Menin Gate memorial in Belgium commemorates 54,896 missing Allied combatants who are known to have been killed in the Ypres Salient. The Douaumont ossuary, meanwhile, contains 130,000 unidentifiable sets of French and German remains from the Battle of Verdun.\n\nEven in the 21st century, the remains of missing combatants are recovered from the former battlefields of the Western Front every year. These discoveries happen regularly, often during the course of agricultural work or construction projects. Typically, the remains of one or several men are found at a time. However, occasionally the numbers recovered are much larger e.g. the mass grave at Fromelles (excavated in 2009) which contained the skeletal remains of no less than 250 Allied soldiers. Another example is the excavation which took place at Carspach (Alsace region of France) in early 2012, which uncovered the remains of 21 German soldiers, lost in an underground shelter since 1918, after being buried by a large-calibre British artillery shell. Regardless, efforts are made to identify any remains found via a thorough forensic examination. If this is achieved, attempts are made to trace any living relatives. However, it is frequently impossible to identify the remains, other than to establish some basic details of the unit they served with. In the case of British and Commonwealth MIAs, the headstone is inscribed with the maximum amount of information that is known about the person. Typically, such information is deduced from metallic objects such as brass buttons and shoulder flashes bearing regimental/unit insignia found on the body. As a result, headstones are inscribed with such information as \"A Soldier of The Cameronians\" or \"An Australian Corporal\" etc. Where nothing is known other than the soldier's national allegiance, the headstone is inscribed \"A Soldier of The Great War\". The term \"Sailor\" or \"Airman\" can be substituted, as appropriate.\n\nThere are many missing combatants and other persons in service from World War II.\nIn the United States Armed Forces, 78,750 personnel missing in action had been reported by the end of the war, representing over 19 percent of the total of 405,399 killed during the conflict.\n\nAs with MIAs from the First World War, it is a routine occurrence for the remains of missing personnel killed during the Second World War to be periodically discovered. Usually they are found purely by chance (e.g. during construction or demolition work) though on some occasions they are recovered following deliberate, targeted searches. As with the First World War, in western Europe MIAs are generally found as individuals, or in twos or threes. However, sometimes the numbers in a group are considerably larger e.g. the mass grave at Villeneuve-Loubet, which contained the remains of 14 German soldiers killed in August 1944. Others are located at remote aircraft crash sites in various countries.\nBut in eastern Europe and Russia, World War II casualties include approximately two million missing Germans, and many mass graves remain to be found. Almost a half million German MIAs have been buried in new graves since the end of the Cold War. Most of them will stay unknown. The German War Graves Commission is spearheading the effort. Similarly, there are approximately 4 million missing Russian service personnel scattered across the former Eastern Front, from Leningrad down to Stalingrad, though around 300 volunteer groups make periodic searches of old battlefields to recover human remains for identification and reburial.\n\nDuring the 2000s, there was renewed attention within and without the U.S. military to finding remains of the missing, especially in the European Theatre and especially since aging witnesses and local historians were dying off. The group World War II Families for the Return of the Missing was founded in 2005 to work with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and other governmental entities towards locating and repatriating the remains of Americans lost in the conflict. The president of the group said in reference to the far more publicised efforts to find remains of U.S. dead from the Vietnam War, “Vietnam had advocates. This was an older generation, and they didn’t know who to turn to.”\n\nIn 2008, investigators began to conduct searches on Tarawa atoll in the Pacific Ocean, trying to locate the remains of 139 American Marines, missing since the Battle of Tarawa in 1943. Between 2013 and 2016 the remains of 37 USMC were recovered from Tarawa.\n\nAs of November 23, 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Accounting Office, there were still 72,772 U.S. servicemen and Civilians still unaccounted for from World War II..\n\nAccording to official US Department of Army and Department of Navy casualty records, submitted to Congress in 1946 and updated in 1953, the combined possible total of missing service personnel worldwide is closer to approximately 6600 and probably considerably fewer. Since DPAA alone designates such WWII personnel as the crew of the and most of that of as both \"missing\" and \"unaccounted-for\" it is possible that DPAA records keeping may be somewhat idiosyncratic.\n\nThe US Department of Defense DPAA gives dates for the Korean Conflict from June 27, 1950 to January 31, 1955. Between June to October 1950, an estimated 700 civilian and US military POWs had been captured by the North Koreans. By August 1953 only 262 were still alive; one of the survivors was Private First Class Wayne A. \"Johnnie\" Johnson, who secretly documented the deaths of 496 military and civilian POWs. Johnson would later be awarded the Silver Star medal for valor in 1996.<br> In August 1953, General James Van Fleet, who had led US and UN forces in Korea, estimated that \"a large percentage\" of those service members listed as missing in action were alive. (Coincidentally, General Van Fleet's own son Captain James Alward Van Fleet Jr was MIA from a United States Air Force mission over North Korea April 4, 1952.)\n\nThe total number of Korean Conflict MIAS/remains not recovered was 8,154<br> In 1954 during Operation Glory, the remains of 4,023 UN personnel were received from North Korea, of which 1,868 were Americans; of the recovered US remains, 848 could not be identified. Between 1982 and 2016, 781 unknown remains were recovered from North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, and Punchbowl Cemetery in Hawaii, of which a total of 459 have been identified 950 sets of remains were uncovered in South Korea; of 20 sets of remains 11 were identified.\n\nThe U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (now the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency) and the equivalent South Korean command are actively involved in trying to locate and identify remains of both countries' personnel. Remains of missing combatants from the Korean War are periodically recovered and identified in both North and South Korea. It is thought that 13,000 South Korean and 2,000 U.S. combatants are buried in the Korean Demilitarized Zone alone and never found. In the summer of 2018 President of South Korea hopes to recover the remains of Korean Soldiers from the DMZ South Korea MIAs are believed to number 120,000.\n\nThe 1991–1993 United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs investigated some outstanding issues and reports related to the fate of U.S. service personnel still missing from the Korean War. In 1996, the Defense Department stated that there was no clear evidence any of the U.S. prisoners were still alive.<br> , at least 500 South Korean prisoners of war were believed to be still detained by the North Korean regime. that same year the U.S. suspended talks with North Korea over the recovery of MIAs.The George W. Bush administration had broken off relations between the US and North Korea-claiming it couldn't guarantee Americans safety.\n\nIn 2007-New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson traveled to Pyongong and returned with six sets of remains.\n\nIn 2010, it was reported that the Obama administration was reversing the Bush administration's suspended talks in regard to North Korea MIAs.<br> In 2011 the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) adopted Resolution # 423 calling for renewed discussions with North Korea to recover Americans missing in action<br>\nOn July 27, 2011 Congressman Charles Rangel introduced a Congressional Resolution calling on North Korea to repatriate POW/MIAS and abductees from North Korea.\n\nIn January 2012 it was announced that members of JPAC would go to North Korea in the spring to search for an estimated 5,000 MIAs in the Unsan & the Chosin Reservoir areas.\n\nIn February 2012 talks were going ahead between the US and North Korea to resume discussions to recover US MIAs after seven years.<br> On March 8, 2012 the US announced it would search for MIAs in North Korea, however on March 21, 2012, US President Obama's administration suspended talks with North Korea over the recovery of US servicemen killed and missing in North Korea.<br>In 2013 Korea Cold War Families Inc started an online petition to Obama to resolve Cold/Korean War mysteries.\n\nIn October 2014, North Korea announced it was going to \"move\" the remains of about 5,000 U.S. combatants \"en masse\" in an apparent attempt to force the U.S. to restart MIA recovery. North Korea also gave a warning that \"... North Korea blamed the United States “hostile policy” for causing the remains recovery missions to end. The statement warned that \"remains of American soldiers would soon be lost\", as they were being \"“carried away en masse due to construction projects of hydro-power stations, land rezoning and other gigantic natureremaking projects, flood damage, etc…\"”\n\nAs of December 2015 the DPAA \"does not currently conduct\" operations in North Korea.\n\nOn June 24, 2016 despite Obama's \"refusal to reopen reparation talks\" in regard to the US MIAs, Congressmen Rangel, John Conyers, Sam Johnson introduced House Resolution No. 799 calling on the US Government to resume talks in regard to the US MIAs. On September 27, 2016 House Resolution No. 799 was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. It was \"not\" enacted.<br> As a result of the June 2018 meeting between US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim, the US has received 55 boxes of MIAS remains on July 27, 2018-the 65th anniversary of the Korean War Truce. As of November 23,2018 according to the US Department of Defense, the Total of working number of MIA US Servicemen:7,675.\n\nA number of Australian combatants and POWs have also never been recovered from Korea. Of 340 Australian servicemen killed in the Korean Conflict, 43 are listed as MIAs\n\nSince 1996, the remains of Korean People's Army combatants recovered from battlefield exhumations across South Korea have been buried in the Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers, the majority of the over 770 burials are unknowns.\n\nRemains of Korean War MIA serviceman have also been discovered at Arrowhead Hill, which is located in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, during minesweeping operations between October and November 2018. Arrowhead Hill had previously been selected for both Koreas to jointly conduct a pilot remains recovery project.\n\nFollowing the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, 591 U.S. prisoners of war were returned during Operation Homecoming. The U.S. listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered.<br> By the early 1990s, this had been reduced to a total of 2,255 unaccounted for from the war, which constituted less than 4 percent of the total 58,152 U.S. service members killed. This was by far the smallest proportion in the nation's history to that point.\n\nAbout 80 percent of those missing were airmen who were shot down over North Vietnam or Laos, usually over remote mountains, tropical rain forest, or water; the rest typically disappeared in confused fighting in dense jungles. Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived their shootdown and, if not, efforts to recover their remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.\n\nConsiderable speculation and investigation has gone to a theory that a significant number of these men were captured as prisoners of war by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war's conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence. Popular culture has reflected the \"live prisoners\" theory, most notably in the 1985 film \"\". Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of 1991–1993 led by Senators John Kerry, Bob Smith, and John McCain. Its unanimous conclusion found \"no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nThis missing in action issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War. To skeptics, \"live prisoners\" is a conspiracy theory unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who have preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, \"The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge.\" Believers reject such notions; as one wrote in 1994, \"It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam.\"\n\nThere are also a large number of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong MIAs from the Vietnam war whose remains have yet to be recovered. In 1974, General Võ Nguyên Giáp stated that they had 330,000 missing in action. As of 1999, estimates of those missing were usually around 300,000. This figure does not include those missing from former South Vietnamese armed forces, who are given little consideration under the Vietnamese regime. The Vietnamese government did not have any organized program to search for its own missing, in comparison to what it had established to search for American missing. The discrepancy angered some Vietnamese; as one said, \"It's crazy for the Americans to keep asking us to find their men. We lost several times more than the Americans did. In any war there are many people who disappear. They just disappear.\" In the 2000s, thousands of Vietnamese were hiring psychics in an effort to find the remains of missing family members. The Vietnamese Army organizes what it considers to be the best of the psychics, as part of its parapsychology force trying to find remains. Additionally, remains dating from the earlier French colonial era are sometimes discovered: in January 2009, the remains of at least 50 anti-French resistance fighters dating from circa 1946 to 1947 were discovered in graves located under a former market in central Hanoi.\n\nAs of November 23, 2018 according to the U.S. Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, US Military and Civilian personnel still unaccounted for number 1,592.\n\nAccording to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, as of November 23, 2018 there were still 126 U.S. servicemen unaccounted for from the Cold War.\n\nThe 1991–1993 United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs investigated some outstanding issues and reports related to the fate of U.S. service personnel still missing from the Cold War. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin told the committee that the Soviet Union had held survivors of spy planes shot down in the early 1950s in prisons or psychiatric facilities. Russian Colonel General Dmitri Volkogonov, co-leader of the U.S.–Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, said that to his knowledge no Americans were currently being held against their will within the borders of the former Soviet Union. The Select Committee concluded that it \"found evidence that some U.S. POWs were held in the former Soviet Union after WW II, the Korean War and Cold War incidents,\" and that it \"cannot, based on its investigation to date, rule out the possibility that one or more U.S. POWs from past wars or incidents are still being held somewhere within the borders of the former Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988 left tens of thousands of Iranian and Iraqi combatants and prisoners of war still unaccounted for. Some counts include civilians who disappeared during the conflict. One estimate is that more than 52,000 Iraqis went missing in the war. Officially, the government of Iran lists 8,000 as missing.\n\nFollowing up on these cases is often difficult because no accurate or surviving documentation exists. The situation in Iraq is additionally difficult because unknown hundreds of thousands persons are missing due to Iraq's later conflicts, both internal and external, and in Iran due to its being a largely closed society. In addition, relations between the countries remained quite poor for a long time; the last POWs from the war were not exchanged until 2003 and relations did not begin to improve until after the regime change brought on by the 2003 onset of the Iraq War. Some cases are brought forward when mass graves are discovered in Iraq, holding the bodies of Iranians once held prisoner. Websites have been started to attempt to track the fates of members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force shot down and captured over Iraq.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been active in trying to resolve MIA issues from the war; in October 2008, twenty years after the end of the war, the ICRC forged a memorandum of understanding with the two countries to share information collected in pursuit of resolving cases. Families are still desperate for knowledge about the fate of their loved ones.\n\nIn Iran, efforts at answering families' questions and identifying remains are led by the POWs and Missing Commission of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn Iraq, efforts are led by the Ministry of Human Rights.\n\nIn the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, two companies of the Indian Army's 15th Punjab (formerly First Patiala) were attacked by four brigades of the Pakistan Army on 3 December 1971 at 1835 hours. Nearly 4,000 Pakistani men attacked the Indian side with 15 tanks and heavy artillery support. The Indian commanders included Major Waraich, Major Singh's and Major Kanwaljit Sandhu, who was badly injured. Major SPS Waraich was reported captured, as were many JCOs and men as the squadrons were taken by surprise and had little time to get to their bunkers. A Pakistani radio news telecast reported (in Urdu) that \"Maj Waraich hamari hiraasat mein hain\" (Maj Waraich is in our custody). There was a subsequent report that Maj Waraich was in a North West Frontier jail. Their current status is unknown. They are listed as missing by the Indian Government along with 52 others including a Maj Ashok Suri who wrote a letter to his father in 1975 from Karachi stating that he was alive and well. Pakistan denies holding any of the soldiers Missing in Action.\n\nAccording to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, 47 Americans were listed as POW/MIAs at some point during Operation Desert Storm. At the conclusion of the Gulf War of 1991, U.S. forces resolved all but one of those cases : 21 Prisoners of War were repatriated, 23 bodies were recovered and 2 bodies were lost over the Gulf and therefore classified as Killed-In-Action, Body Not Recovered. That one MIA case, that of U.S. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Scott Speicher, became quite well known. He was reported as missing after his F/A-18 was shot down in northern Iraq on the first night of the war. Over the years his status was changed from missing to killed in action to missing-captured, a move that suggested he was alive and imprisoned in Iraq. In 2002, his possible situation became a more high-profile issue in the build-up to the Iraq War; \"The Washington Times\" ran five successive front-page articles about it in March 2002 and in September 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush mentioned Speicher in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly as part of his case for war. However, despite the 2003 invasion of Iraq and U.S. military control of the country, Speicher was not found and his status remained under debate. It was eventually resolved in August 2009 when his remains were found in the Iraq desert where, according to local civilians, he was buried following his crash in 1991.\n\nHow many Iraqi forces went missing as a result of the war is not readily known, as estimates of Iraqi casualties overall range considerably.\n\nThe two cases KIABNR:\n\nAs of November 23, 2018 according to the US Dept of Defense the Total of unaccounted for from Iraqi and other conflicts – 6 The US Defense POW/MIA website has the following remarks:\n\"...more than 82,000 Americans remain missing from WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the Gulf Wars/other conflicts. Out of the 82,000 missing, 75% of the losses are located in the Indo-Pacific, and over 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at sea (i.e. ship losses, known aircraft water losses, etc.)\n\nMilitary animals can also be officially declared Missing In Action.\n\nMIA is sometimes used in American English to describe difficulty finding something, particularly a person. \"The employee is MIA.\" It is less often used in this context in UK English, where the equivalent phrase is \"gone AWOL\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "210213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210213", "title": "Nelvana", "text": "Nelvana\n\nNelvana Ltd. (now known as Nelvana Enterprises, Inc.) is a Canadian animation studio and children's media company owned by Corus Entertainment. Founded in 1971, it was named by founders Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith after a Canadian comic book superheroine created by Adrian Dingle in the 1940s. The company's production logo is a Polar bear looking at the North Star. Most of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties, mainly children's literature, but original programming is also part of its roster. It ventured into the world of live action from its establishment and continues to do so.\n\nNelvana also distributes internationally two Nickelodeon shows: \"Taina\" and \"The Fairly OddParents\". , its library comprises more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming. The company has international offices in France, Ireland and Japan.\n\nNelvana started in 1971 when two graduates of York University, Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, teamed up with a Vitaphone animator-designer Clive A. Smith in Toronto, Ontario. Hirsh and Loubert, who had a passion for underground filmmaking, had founded a small company called Laff Arts in the late 1960s. Smith, whose interest was in rock n' roll music, had previously been among the crew for the Beatles' animated series and their 1968 film, \"Yellow Submarine\". Hirsh has commented on the background of Nelvana's founding:\n\nSoon after they saw a collection of local comic books from the 1940s and acquired the ownership rights. In turn, they made a half-hour television documentary for the CBC focusing on Canadian comics. Their two-year travelling tour of the art from the National Gallery of Canada, \"Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45\", gave locals a chance to revisit the country's past heritage in that field. Meanwhile, Hirsh and Loubert collaborated on a related primer from Peter Martin and Associates, \"The Great Canadian Comic Books\". Amid all this success, Hirsh, Loubert and Smith named their new enterprise Nelvana—after a Canadian comic book superheroine from World War II, Nelvana of the Northern Lights, who was one of the characters in the \"Canadian Whites\" canon.\n\nA derelict apartment in downtown Toronto served as the company's first building, and a homemade wooden stand mounted over a toilet was among its first camera equipment. \"To create zooms,\" Hirsh recalled of his early experience with this machine, \"we would pile up phone books under the art work.\" During their first year and a half, the trio lived off a superfluous Chargex credit card that Loubert received at university, spending up to C$7,500 on it before they reclaimed double that cost as their first ever transaction. Under those conditions, Nelvana was involved in the production of documentaries and live-action films. In the area of part-time animation work, they made ten C$1,500 fillers for the CBC.\n\nAmong the studio's first productions was a low-budget CBC short subject series, \"Small Star Cinema\", which combined live-action and animation to tell stories of ordinary life from a child's point of view. It was followed by 1974's \"Christmas Two Step\", a similarly styled special in which a girl tries to be a lead dancer at a Christmas pageant.\n\nNelvana worked on their first television specials: \"A Cosmic Christmas\" (1977), \"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\" (1978), \"Please Don't Eat the Planet\" (better known by its subtitle, \"Intergalactic Thanksgiving\") (1979), \"Romie-0 and Julie-8\" (1979), \"Easter Fever\" (1980) and \"Take Me Up to the Ball Game\" (1980). During that time, George Lucas, an aficionado of their work, commissioned the company to work on a 10-minute sequence for the CBS and CTV TV film, \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". This short scene, officially entitled \"The Faithful Wookiee\", would introduce audiences to the villainous bounty hunter Boba Fett, who would make his first theatrical appearance in 1980's \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Nelvana also started to use the polar bear as its mascot.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, Nelvana was offered the chance to work on \"Heavy Metal\", an animated anthology of science fiction stories that studios in Canada and other countries were working on. Nelvana declined this opportunity, instead going on to concentrate on the production of its first feature film, \"Rock & Rule\".\n\nBased heavily on the earlier special \"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\", and originally titled \"Drats!\", the film was produced for five years using all of the studio's resources, totalling $8 million. Upon its release by MGM/UA in 1983, it received little promotion in the United States and quickly disappeared at the box office.\n\nThe financial demise of \"Rock & Rule\" would have ended Nelvana's operations altogether, had the company not saved themselves from debt by working full-time on children's television series. On its agenda at that time were its first three live-action franchises, \"The Edison Twins\", \"20 Minute Workout\" and \"Mr. Microchip\". With DIC Entertainment, Nelvana worked on the first season of \"Inspector Gadget\", and animated the pilot episode of \"The Get Along Gang\".\n\nEarly in the decade, the company worked on four television specials based on American Greetings properties. They were \"The Magic of Herself the Elf\", based on Mattel's toy line; \"\"; \"Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name\"; and \"Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins\", the last three of which featured the eponymous doll. There were two shows from Nelvana based on the AmToy properties, \"Madballs\" and \"My Pet Monster\".\n\nDespite the successes of their earlier works, perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the Care Bears, thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners. In early 1985, the first movie based on the toy line turned the company's fortunes around, grossing $23 million in the US, and another $1.5 million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more big-screen movies, \"\" and \"Adventure in Wonderland\", as well as a television series.\n\nIn the area of science fiction, Nelvana produced \"\" and \"Ewoks\", two Saturday-morning series based on \"Star Wars\". At one point, there was talk of an animated CBS show from the studio, based on the BBC's \"Doctor Who\"; the plan never came to fruition, but concept art was created by Ted Bastien.\n\nFor Orion Pictures' 1986 live-action western comedy, \"Three Amigos\", the company made use of lip-sync animation for a musical sequence in which the main characters sing a song at a campfire, with their horses singing along. In 1987, Michael Hirsh produced Nelvana's first self-made film of this calibre, the Whoopi Goldberg comedy \"Burglar\".\n\nIn 1988, Nelvana and Scholastic Corporation produced a video series of The Video Adventures of Clifford the Big Red Dog based on the 1962 book. It was also distributed by Family Home Entertainment on the video releases.\n\nThe company's fourth live-action series, \"T. and T.\", premiered in 1988 on Canada's Global network. The show's title duo was Mr. T of \"A-Team\" fame, playing a former boxer named T.S. Turner, and Canadian actress Kristina Nicoll as an East Coast lawyer by the name of Terri Taler. Nelvana faced bankruptcy for the second time when the show's original American distributor was going out of business; in six weeks, they were saved when they found a replacement. Also that year, Nelvana established BearSpots, a facility for producing television commercials that lasted until 1993.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, the revived Nelvana had its next big success with and an HBO television show based on Jean de Brunhoff's \"Babar\" book series. This franchise, its first international co-production, won many ACE Awards in the United States and Geminis in Canada. In September 1989, ABC began to air one of the company's products: an animated series based on Tim Burton's \"Beetlejuice\".\n\nFollowing \"Babar\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success, the studio acquired the rights to animated series based on Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\", Maurice Sendak's \"Little Bear\", Joanna Cole's \"The Magic School Bus\" and the British comic strip \"Rupert Bear\". Nelvana had self-made successes of its own during the 1990s, such as \"Eek! The Cat\", \"Dog City\" (with Jim Henson Productions) and \"Ned's Newt\". Less successful was its animated series for children, Roseanne Barr's \"Little Rosey\" for the American Broadcasting Company, which was cancelled in 1991, after its first season.\n\nIn autumn 1993, Nelvana signed a multi-year project to produce five feature films for Paramount Pictures, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall producing; the first two began production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20 million each. Three of the projects were based on books by E. B. White (\"The Trumpet of the Swan\"), Clive Barker (\"The Thief of Always\") and Graeme Base (\"The Sign of the Seahorse\"); an original production called \"Mask Vision\" was also in the works.\n\nHowever, none of those films ever made it past the finishing stage. During the 1990s, another set of features from Nelvana was distributed by different companies. A 1993 live-action psychological thriller called \"Malice\" came out under the Columbia Pictures banner; 1997 saw the studio's retelling of \"Pippi Longstocking\" from Warner Bros.; and \"\" was released in Canada by Alliance Atlantis in 1999. Among them, only \"Malice\" would go on to achieve box-office success in North America. Its US$46 million gross was the highest ever attained by a Nelvana production, doubling what the first \"Care Bears Movie\" received during its original release.\n\nIn 1993, Nelvana along with Galaxy Films and De Souza Productions produced \"Cadillacs and Dinosaurs\" for the CBS Network, based on the comic book of the same name (formally known as \"Xenozoic Tales\") by Mark Schultz. It only lasted one season.\n\nIn September 1995, Nelvana produced \"Nancy Drew\" and \"The Hardy Boys\" based on the popular American book series. Tracy Ryan portrayed Nancy Drew while Colin Gray and Paul Popowich portrayed Frank and Joe Hardy, respectively. In addition, Jehene Erwin and Joy Tanner portrayed Bess Marvin and George Fayne, respectively, on Nancy Drew, while Fiona Highet played new character Kate Craigen. The series were based off The Nancy Drew Files and The Hardy Boys Casefiles. However, the series was not distributed well, mostly due to it being in first-run syndication, and both series were cancelled in December.\n\nIn September 1996, Golden Books Family Entertainment was in talks to acquire the company for US$102 million,\njust after having purchased the family video library of Broadway Video Entertainment, a subsidiary of Broadway Video.\nMany of the company's staff members, including Smith and Loubert, expressed interest in the proposition. But Hirsh went up against it, arguing with then COO Eleanor Olmsted about its possible effects on his institution. Two months later Golden Books withdrew from the deal stating that they would concentrate more on children's entertainment.\n\nIn November 1996, Virgin Interactive released \"Toonstruck\", a PC-based adventure game featuring animation and artwork produced by Nelvana and Rainbow Animation. The game was set in an animated world using traditional 2D animation, but also featured the digitized likeness of actor Christopher Lloyd as a live-action character trapped in the animated world interacting with the cartoon characters around him. A sequel to the game was planned, but was cancelled due to poor sales.\n\nIn 1997, a small computer animation company called Windlight Studios was absorbed into Nelvana's assets. Its co-founder, Scott Dyer, became Nelvana's senior vice-president in charge of production in late 2001.\n\nIn late 1997, Nelvana and Britain's Channel 4 began work on \"Bob and Margaret\", the company's first animated franchise for adults since \"Rock & Rule\". It was based on the National Film Board of Canada's \"Bob's Birthday\", an Academy Award winner for Best Short, which Channel 4 also produced.\n\nIn December 1997, Nelvana began distributing a syndicated programming block, the Nelvana Kidz Klub, through MediaVentures International, a Chicago-based distributor. The block was offered internationally on a barter program distribution model with 1–2 hours of daily sections or 3–4 hours of the weekend block.\n\nIn 1998, Nelvana entered into an agreement with U.S. network CBS to program a new Saturday morning animation block to debut in the 1998-1999 television season, ultimately known as the CBS Kidshow. The block would feature six new series based on children's book properties, and all were to comply with the U.S. government's educational programming guidelines. In April 1998, Nelvana entered into an agreement with Scottish Television to co-produce these new series, and hold distribution rights to them in the United Kingdom. In August 1998, Nelvana acquired Kids Can Press, publishers of the \"Franklin\" and \"Elliot Moose\" children's books upon which the \"Franklin\" and \"Elliot Moose\" were based. This turned them into an \"integrated company\" in which Kids Can's subsequent publications would begin with Nelvana's franchising of those works.\n\nThe company's first two computer-animated shows, \"Donkey Kong Country\" and \"Rolie Polie Olie\" (with Paris-based Sparx* and distributed by Disney) premiered on American TV in 1998.\n\nIn March 1999, Nelvana reported a 75% increase in earnings in 1998, credited to increased original production and sales of its library programming, the deal with CBS, and the addition of a publishing business with the acquisition of Kids Can Press. In August 1999, Nelvana announced a US$40 million deal to produce six new series based on popular children's books for a planned PBS Kids block. The six series—\"Timothy Goes to School\", \"Seven Little Monsters\", \"Corduroy\", \"Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse\", \"George Shrinks\" and \"Elliot Moose\"—were launched the following September as part of the \"Bookworm Bunch\" line-up. That same month, it acquired the North American rights to its first anime property, Clamp's \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" (which was renamed \"Cardcaptors\" for its English dub).\n\nIn April 2000, Nelvana announced that it had filed for two category 2 television licenses from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to launch digital cable channels. The first, titled \"The Nelvana Channel,\" would've presented the company's library of material alongside related information in a picture-in-picture format. The second, \"Booknet,\" was to be focused on adaptations of adult and children's literature, and would have been a 60/40 joint venture between Corus Entertainment and Nelvana. The channels were approved that following November. Both licenses expired as neither launched by the required date of November 24, 2004.\n\nOn April 14, 2000, Nelvana announced its purchase of the Palo Alto-based children's book publisher Klutz in a US$74 million deal—at that time, its largest buyout ever— and integrated it into its Branded Consumer Products division. The company, founded in 1977, was best known for its children's series, \"Books Plus\". Nelvana's separate subsidiary, Kids Can, started taking advantage of the acquisition by making its output available through Klutz merchandise.\n\nIn September 2000, Corus announced that it would acquire Nelvana for $540 million. The company saw the purchase as being a compliment to its children's television channels, including YTV and Treehouse.\n\nA year after Corus' purchase, co-founders and co-CEOs Loubert and Smith left the studio. Loubert voluntarily left in November after Corus eliminated 50 positions from the staff, saying \"The time has come that Corus will stop acquiring for a while and start operating. John Cassaday has made that clear, but this makes my job less rather than more\".\n\nIn 2001, Nelvana acquired the rights to the English-language version of yet another anime series, \"Medabots\". The following January, \"Beyblade\" (in association with Hasbro and Mitsubishi) became its third such property.\n\nIn October 2002, Corus announced Hirsh's resignation; the following month, Paul Robertson, former president of Corus Television and head of YTV, became leader of the studio's senior management. With Hirsh's departure, Corus announced a C$200 million writedown for the company; by next August, it planned to reduce the staff down to 200. Hirsh has also taken an advisory role in the studio.\n\nThe following September, Corus launched their home entertainment division. Texas-based FUNimation, along with British company Maverick, has distributed titles from the studio with this label, including \"Redwall\", \"Pecola\", \"Tales from the Cryptkeeper\", \"Timothy Goes to School\" and the Disney Channel TV special \"The Santa Claus Brothers\". Nelvana's newer titles have been distributed by MGM, Lionsgate and ADV Films, which have no involvement with the label. Since 2007, Shout! Factory releases Nelvana's shows on DVD.\n\nIn 2004, the studio produced an animation anthology, which included 10 recurring shorts. Titled \"Funpak\", it aired on YTV for 13 weeks starting in February 2005, with the winning short announced to be greenlit in May of that year. One of the shorts, \"Sidekick\", was the one adapted into a successful cartoon series from 2010 to 2013.\n\nIn May 2006, NBC Universal announced a joint venture with Nelvana, Ion Media Networks, Scholastic, and Classic Media, known as Qubo, which aimed to operate a multi-platform children's educational television brand in the U.S. featuring programming from its partners.\n\nIn September 2006, Nelvana was integrated into Corus' children's television division. A spin-off unit, Nelvana Enterprises, was created in the process, to focus on international distribution of the company's shows. Scott Dyer, the studio's executive vice-president of production and development, became the overseer of the division, which includes Treehouse TV, Discovery Kids Canada, and YTV. Doug Murphy, another former EVP at Nelvana, became president of the new distribution unit.\n\nIn 2007, Nelvana acquired the rights to its fourth anime series, \"Bakugan Battle Brawlers\". The series was aired on Teletoon and became a quick success. In 2008, merchandising rights were sold by Nelvana to Cartoon Network in the US, and the series began airing on CN in February 2008.\n\n\"Detentionaire\" was released in 2011, with a new season airing on Teletoon about once a year. The show has also been aired internationally, including on ABC3, and has been released on a digital platform provided by Cartoon Network.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, Nelvana re-branded their logo as part of Corus' brand change since the latter's acquisition of Shaw Media.\n\nMany of Nelvana's TV shows are based on properties from other companies, most of which started in other forms of media. A great deal of them are based on children's literature and comic books; examples include \"Blazing Dragons\", \"Stickin' Around\", \"Wayside\", \"The Adventures of Tintin\", \"Anatole\", \"Babar\", \"The Berenstain Bears\" (2003 version), \"Franklin the Turtle\", \"Jane and the Dragon\", \"Little Bear\", \"The Magic School Bus\", \"Pippi Longstocking\", \"Redwall\", \"Rupert\", \"My Dad the Rock Star\", and the shows of the \"PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch\" block, as well as \"Tales From the Cryptkeeper\", \"Beetlejuice\", \"Jacob Two-Two\", \"Sidekick\" and Nick Jr.'s \"Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends\".\n\nNelvana has also had considerable success with animated fare based on toys; American Greetings' \"Care Bears\" has been the most familiar example of this. Also, there have been series and specials based on \"Strawberry Shortcake\" (also from American Greetings), \"Madballs\" and \"My Pet Monster\" (from AmToy) and \"Rescue Heroes\" (from Fisher-Price). Nickelodeon had the company producing the sequel to \"The Fresh Beat Band\", which is called \"Fresh Beat Band of Spies\".\n\nIt has also translated big-screen franchises to televised properties, such as \"Star Wars\" (\"Droids\" and \"Ewoks\"), \"Beetlejuice\", \"An American Tail\" (\"Fievel's American Tails\"), \"Free Willy\" and \"The Neverending Story\". It has even ventured into the video game world with a show based on Nintendo's Donkey Kong in \"Donkey Kong Country\".\n\nIn the field of anime, the company holds the North American rights to Clamp/Kodansha's \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" series. Also, it holds international licensing rights to \"Beyblade\" and \"Medabots\".\n\nAs with many other animation studios, Nelvana has a wide range of established original series and characters within its roster. \"6teen\", \"Clone High\", \"Birdz\", and \"Eek! The Cat\" among others, are some of Nelvana's cartoon series that were not based on any other source material.\n\n, the studio has made close to 25 feature films for theatrical, home entertainment, and television distribution. Well-known releases include \"Rock & Rule\", the first five \"Care Bears\" movies, two \"Babar\" films and 1997's \"Pippi Longstocking\".\n\nLive-action has been a part of its mainstay from its early years. The company has had \"Burglar\" and \"Malice\" as its own feature projects in that area, and has contributed as such to \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" and \"Three Amigos\". On television, Nelvana has made live-action shows such as \"The Edison Twins\", \"Nancy Drew\", \"The Hardy Boys\", and \"Life with Boys\".\n\nOn 29 April 2015 they launched a YouTube channel promoted by YTV as Nelvana Retro, which was renamed \"YTV Direct\" in 2016 after also incorporating non-Nelvana content like Nickelodeon shows.\n\n\"The Fairly OddParents\", created by animator Butch Hartman, was distributed by Nelvana outside the United States from 2001–2004. This show has been in the top of the ratings for Nickelodeon, YTV and the BBC, and has also been successful among viewers in several European markets, Latin America and Australia, Canada.\n\nIn the United States, Nelvana's series have been broadcast on terrestrial and cable networks, and internationally on over 360 television stations in more 180 countries, in approximately 50 languages.\n\nApart from its trio of founders, there have been several key personnel from Nelvana's past and present, a great deal of whom have left the company. Among the better-known people to work in the studio are Bill Perkins, John de Klein, Wayne Gilbert, John Halfpenny, Peter Hudecki, Vincenzo Natali, Arna Selznick, Laura Shepherd, Kim Cleary, Natalie Turner, Susan Snooks, and John van Bruggen.\n\nEight former Nelvana employees, Roger Allers, Charles Bonifacio, Darlie Brewster, Anne Marie Bardwell, Tom Sito, Ralph Palmer, David Soren, Mark Koetsier, Andrew Hickson, Dick Zondag and Ralph Zondag, went on to become staff members at Walt Disney Feature Animation and DreamWorks in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Allers went on to work on \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\", and \"Hercules\". Lenora Hume, from the company's early years, is the senior vice-president of DisneyToon Studios.\n\nNelvana had a planet named after it in the \"Star Wars\" series, on Cartoon Network's expanded universe series \"\". During Chapters 23 to 25, Anakin Skywalker travels to a planet called Nelvaan. \"Clone Wars\" also pays homage to the franchise's animation predecessors in the form of the planet's dog-like inhabitants, who resemble characters from \"Rock & Rule\", the studio's first film.\n\nThe \"Nelvana Independent Short Film Grand Prize\", given out at the Ottawa International Animation Festival since 2004, is sponsored by the company. So far, the recipients of this prize have been 2004's \"Ryan\", the Chris Landreth biography about Canadian animator Ryan Larkin; 2005's \"Milch\", from director Igor Kovalyov; and, in 2006, Joanna Quinn's \"\".\n\n\nRelated Canadian companies\n\n\n"}

After being kept some weeks in the cold underground in inhumane conditions, P. Dilanchi was sent to Shuvalan prison. After 38 days in prison, having been arrested without reason, he was allowed to be transferred to house arrest. After three months, he was freed.\n\n"}
{"id": "4458634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4458634", "title": "Placemaking", "text": "Placemaking\n\nPlacemaking is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well being. It is political due to the nature of place identity. Placemaking is both a process and a philosophy that makes use of urban design principles. It can be either official and government led, or community driven grass roots tactical urbanism, such as extending sidewalks with chalk, paint, and planters, or open streets events such as Bogotá, Colombia's Ciclovía. Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale.\n\nThe concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s, when writers like Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people, not just to cars and shopping centers. Their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces. Jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of \"eyes on the street.\" Whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces.\n\nThe term came into use in the 1970s by landscape architects, architects and urban planners to describe the process of creating squares, plazas, parks, streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting. Landscape often plays an important role in the design process. The term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve.\n\nBernard Hunt, of HTA Architects noted that: \"We have theories, specialisms, regulations, exhortations, demonstration projects. We have planners. We have highway engineers. We have mixed use, mixed tenure, architecture, community architecture, urban design, neighbourhood strategy. But what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking; or, put another way, we have lost the simple art of placemaking. We are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places.\"\n\nJan Gehl has said \"First life, then spaces, then buildings – the other way around never works\"; and \"In a Society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes, cars, computers, offices and shopping centers, the public component of our lives is disappearing. It is more and more important to make the cities inviting, so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses. Public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life.\"\n\nThe writings of poet Wendell Berry have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking, particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy. He writes that, \"If what we see and experience, if our country, does not become real in imagination, then it never can become real to us, and we are forever divided from it... Imagination is a particularizing and a local force, native to the ground underfoot.\"\n\nAccording to Project for Public Spaces, successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:\n\nAn important aspect of placemaking is taking into account inputs of the people who will be using the public space most. That is, to say, the community for which the public space is intended. This is important because members of the community are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function, as well as a historical perspective of the area, and an understanding of what does and does not matter to other members of the community.\n\nPlacemaking is not just about designing a park of plaza with efficient pedestrian circulation. It involves taking into account the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space, then fine-tuning the space with landscape changes, additions of seating, etc., to make all of those elements mesh. The end result should be a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.\n\nPartners for political, financial, and intellectual backing are crucial to getting a public space improvement project off the ground. These partners can range from individuals, to private or municipal institutions, to museums, to schools.\n\nBy observing how a public space is used, it is possible to gain an understanding of what the community does and does not like about it. This understanding can be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space. Even after a public space has been built, observation is key to properly managing it, and evolving it to better suit the community's needs over time.\n\nAs with many other types of project, a placemaking project needs a vision to succeed. This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but the aggregate conception of the entire community.\n\nA placemaking project does not happen overnight. Do not be discouraged if things do not go exactly as planned at first, or if progress seems slow.\n\nTriangulation, simply put, is the strategic placement of amenities, such that they encourage social interaction, and are used more frequently. For example, \"if a children's reading room in a new library is located so that it is next to a children's playground in a park and a food kiosk is added, more activity will occur than if these facilities were located separately.\" \n\nJust because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done. What it does mean is that there are few people, in either the private or public sectors, who have the job of creating places.\n\nA public space's form factor should be formulated with its intended function(s) in mind.\n\nIf networking and team building have been executed correctly, public sentiment towards the project should be positive enough to overlook its monetary cost.\n\nPlacemaking is never \"done\". Minor tweaks can be made to improve the space's usefulness to its community over time, and regular maintenance/upkeep of facilities and amenities is a fact of life.\n\nBoth the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual, family, and community health. The World Health Organization's definition of health provides an appropriate, broad-reaching understanding of health as a \"resource for everyday life, not the object of living\" and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between \"Place\" and \"Health\". A 2016 report The Case for Healthy Places, from Project for Public Spaces and the Assembly Project, funded by the Knight Foundation and focusing on research related to Shaping Space for Civic Life both offer insight into the current evidence base showing how health and wellbeing are impacted by where you live and the opportunities available to you.\n\nWhile the arts and creative expression play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place, economic growth and production must also play an equally large role in creating a successful place. These two factors are not mutually exclusive, as the arts and cultural economic activity made up $729.6 billion (or 4.2%) of the United States GDP in 2014, and employed 4.7 million workers in 2012. This means that the arts can be deployed as a powerful tool in the creation or rehabilitation of urban spaces.\n\nJamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, has identified the following four tools used by communities while implementing creative placemaking.\n\n\nGreat places must do more than meet the basic requirements if they want to foster greater community attachment. A strong sense of attachment can result in residents who are more committed to the growth and success of their community. The Knight Foundation conducted a study measuring community attachment, and found that there \nwas very little variation in the primary drivers of attachment rates when compared between different cities across the United States.\n\n\n\nStreets are the stage for activity of everyday life within a city and they have the most potential to be designed to harness a high-quality sense of place. Effective placemaking in the streetscape lends special attention to the streets livability by representing a sense of security, sense of place, visible employment, variety of transportation options, meaningful interactions between residents, \"eyes on the street\" as well as \"social capital\". All of these interactions take place at the \"mesoscale\". Mesoscale is described as the city level of observation between \"macroscale\"—being birdseye view—and \"microscale--\"being textures and individual elements of the streetscape (streetlamp type, building textures, etc.); in other words, mesoscale is the area observable from a humans eyes, for example: between buildings, including storefronts, sidewalks, street trees, and people. Placemaking for a street takes place at both mesoscale and microscale. To be effective placemakers, it is important that planners, architects, and engineers consider designing in the mesoscale when designing for places that are intended to be livable by Whyte's standards.\n\nTools and practices of placemaking that benefit from utilizing the mesoscale context include:\n\n\nAs society changes to accommodate new technologies, urban planners and citizens alike are looking to consult those technologies to enact physical change. One thing that has had a massive impact on western society is the advent of digital technologies, like social media. Urban decision makers are increasingly looking to plan cities based on feedback from community engagement so as to ensure the development of a durable, livable place. With the invention of niche social technologies, communities have shifted their engagement away from local-government-led forums and platforms, to social media groups on websites such as Facebook and Nextdoor to voice concerns, critiques and desires. In a sense, these new platforms have become a Third Place, in reference to Ray Oldenburg’s term.Social media tools such as these show promise for the future of placemaking in that they are being used to reclaim, reinvigorate and activate spaces. These online neighborhood and event-centric groups and forums provide a convenient non-physical space for public discourse and discussion through digital networked interactions to implement change on a hyper-local level; this theory is sometimes referred to as Urban Acupuncture. This type of shift towards a more crowd-sourced planning method can lead to the creation of more relevant and useful and inclusive places with greater sense of place.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3894744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3894744", "title": "Reconcilee", "text": "Reconcilee\n\nReconcilee is a neologism for the Czech word \"\"upravenec\" (pl. \"upravenci\"\") which denotes an \"émigré\" from Communist Czechoslovakia who subsequently \"reconciled\" his or her relationship with the Communist régime.\n\nFrom 1948 until the end of the régime, unauthorized migration from Czechoslovakia was a crime. Between 1945 and 1987 172,659 people went into exile. After the Helsinki Accords, the Communist establishment wished to show some kind of mitigation of the thus far harsh attitude towards \"émigrés\". Directive No. 4/1977 Official Journal of the Czech Socialist Republic, \"On Reconciliation Legal Relationships of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic to Citizens Who Stay Abroad Without a Permit of Czechoslovak Authorities\", was adopted. Hence the term \"\"upravenec\".\n\nIn 1980 there were 115,000 \"émigrés\". Directives stipulated two categories of reconcilees:\nA prerequisite to receive a status of \"upravenec\" was an application for a pardon of conviction for illegal emigration (12,486 applied) or being amnestied. Applicants had to pay large sums (officially the cost of education) and after reconciliation were allowed to visit Communist Czechoslovakia with no obstacles.\n\nThose who wished to return to Czechoslovakia (art. 2 — first category; 452 persons applied) were called \"navrátilci\"\" (\"returnees\"). Directives also identified a further category of \"émigrés\" — enemies of the Communist régime (art. 9–12). These were deprived of Czechoslovak citizenship and prohibited from visiting Czechoslovakia. (They thus could not be ranked among returnees or reconcilees.)\n\nThe unsuspendable condition for reconciliation was \"good or neutral relationship\" towards the Communist régime. \"Upravenci\" were therefore disliked by much of the rest of the exile community and called collaborators. Most reconcilees hid their reconciliation, and speculative accusation of being a \"upravenec\" was considered a slur. The famous Czech author Josef Škvorecký wrote satiric short stories about them. Hard-line \"émigrés\" speculated that \"upravenci\" were confidants of the Communist secret police.\n\n"}
{"id": "3882910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3882910", "title": "Redshirt (college sports)", "text": "Redshirt (college sports)\n\nRedshirt, in United States college athletics, is a delay or suspension of an athlete's participation to lengthen his or her period of eligibility. Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, like the four years of academic classes typically required to earn a bachelor's degree at an American college or university. However, in a redshirt year, student athletes may attend classes at the college or university, practice with an athletic team, and “suit up” (wear a team uniform) for play – but they may compete in only a limited number of games, (see \"Use of status\" section). Using this mechanism, a student athlete has at most five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus becoming what is termed a fifth-year senior.\n\nThe origin of the term \"redshirt\" was likely from Warren Alfson of the University of Nebraska who, in 1937, asked to practice but not play and wore a Nebraska red shirt without a number. The term is used as a verb, noun, and adjective. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt, and a redshirt freshman refers to an athlete in the first year of participation, after a redshirt non-participatory year.\n\nStudent athletes become redshirts for many reasons. One example is that the student athlete may not be ready to balance the demands of both academic and athletic requirements. Redshirting provides the opportunity, with tutoring, to take some classes and become accustomed to the academic rigors demanded of them. They may also redshirt to undergo a year of practice with a team prior to participating in competition. In American college football, a student athlete may redshirt to work towards increasing size, strength, and stamina; all desirable assets for many positions, as the current and post-redshirt years coincide with the final phases of physical maturity. Players may also redshirt to learn the team playbook, as many college teams run more complex formations and executions in comparison to high school teams.\n\nAthletes may be asked to redshirt if they would have little or no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established upperclassman player in a position, or too much depth at the position the freshman in question plans to play. The coaching staff may also want to use the player as a starter later in his or her career so that they may play for the full four years instead of three.\n\nA special case involves the eligibility of a player who loses the majority of a season to injury, known as a medical redshirt. A hardship waiver may be granted to those athletes who sustain a major injury while appearing in less than 30% of team competitions, nor can they have participated after the midpoint of a season. For the purposes of eligibility, players granted such a waiver are treated as though they did not compete in that season.\n\nOn rare occasions, players may be allowed to play in their sixth year of college if they suffered a serious injury that kept them from competing for more than one season. Former Oklahoma Sooners quarterback Jason White is perhaps the best known example of this; White had redshirted his first year, then subsequently tore the ACL in both knees, forcing him to miss nearly two years of eligible play time. Another recent example is former Houston Cougars quarterback Case Keenum; Keenum redshirted his freshman year of 2006, and subsequently tore an ACL three games into the 2010 season, which would have otherwise been his final year of eligibility.\n\nThe term redshirt freshman indicates an academic sophomore who is in his or her first season of athletic participation. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true freshman: a student who is in their first year both academically and athletically. A redshirt freshman may have practiced with the team during the prior season. The term redshirt sophomore is also commonly used to indicate an academic junior who is in the second season of athletic participation. After the second athletic year, the term redshirt is rarely used; the terms fourth-year junior and fifth-year senior are used instead.\n\nIn 2016, a new status could be applied to prospective student athletes, dubbed an academic redshirt. That year, the NCAA started enforcing new, stricter admissions requirements for incoming athletic freshmen. Under these new requirements, a student athlete who meets a school’s own academic admission requirements yet does not meet the NCAA requirement of a 2.3 GPA across four years, may enter school as an academic redshirt. This student can receive an athletic scholarship and practice with the team, but may not participate in competition. An academic redshirt does not lose a year of eligibility, and may later take an injury redshirt if needed. Finally, academic redshirts must complete nine academic credit hours in their first semester and may then compete in their second year, free of restrictions.\n\nAthletes may also use a \"grayshirt\" year in which they attend school, but cannot enroll as a full-time student, and do not receive a scholarship for that year. This means that they are an unofficial member of the team and do not participate in practices, games, or receive financial assistance from their athletic department. Typically, grayshirts are players who are injured right before college and require an entire year to recuperate. Rather than waste the redshirt, the player can attend school as a part-time regular student and join the team later. This is also used by players with religious or military obligations that keep them out of school for a full academic year.\n\n\"Blueshirt\" athletes are those that the NCAA does not classify as a \"recruited student-athlete\". They have never made an official visit to the school, met with the school's athletic employees or had more than one phone call with them, or received a scholarship offer. Such athletes are walk-ons, but can receive scholarships after enrolling; although they are immediately eligible to play, their scholarships count for the school's quota in the following year. The New Mexico State Aggies football program was the first to blueshirt in the early 2000s; other football programs include Oklahoma State.\n\nWhile the redshirt status may be conferred by a coach at the beginning of the year, it is not confirmed until the end of the season, and more specifically, it does not rule a player ineligible in advance to participate in the season. If a player shows great talent, or there are injuries on the team, the coach may remove the redshirt status and allow the player to participate in competition for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe first athlete known to extend his eligibility in the modern era of redshirting was Warren Alfson of the University of Nebraska in 1937. Alfson requested that he be allowed to sit out his sophomore season due to the number of experienced players ahead of him. In addition, he had not started college until several years after graduating from high school, and thus felt he needed more preparation. The year off greatly benefited him; Alfson was All-Big Six Conference in 1939 and an All-American guard in 1940.\n\nIn January 2017, the trade association for college football coaches, the American Football Coaches Association, proposed a change to that sport's eligibility rules that maintains the current model of four years of play in five years, but significantly changes the redshirt rule. Under the proposal, medical redshirts would be eliminated, but redshirt status would not be lost unless a player participated in more than four games in a season. The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the AFCA subcommittees for all three NCAA divisions, was approved by the NCAA Division I Council in June 2018, taking effect with the 2018 college football season. The original proposal was to have been retroactive, meaning that players with athletic eligibility remaining who had played in four or fewer games in a given season would have effectively received one extra season of eligibility, but the final passed proposal was not retroactive.\n\nUnofficially, redshirting in professional sports is mostly for medical reasons, mostly done for delaying their debuts. Blake Griffin won the Rookie of the Year in his second year because his first year was written off with injuries, but had he not declared for the draft, he would have been a college junior. Larry Bird opted to declare for the draft early in 1978, but decided to stay in college for one year to finish his senior year. David Robinson was redshirted for two years due to military requirements. Jerry Lucas, however, effectively held out due to contract disputes. All four went on to win Rookie of the Year in their first years of eligibility for the award. In the NFL, quarterbacks cannot be officially redshirted because they are unused backups that never started in their rookie year. It is the same case with other positions, while players can become 'redshirt rookies' for injury reasons, they are not eligible for rookie of the year/month/week honors.\n\nAccording to \"Merriam-Webster\" and \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged\", the term \"redshirt\" comes from the red jersey commonly worn by such a player in practice scrimmages against the regulars.\n\n"}

It is spoken in parts of southern Ethiopia by the Sidama people, particularly in the densely populated Sidama state. Sidaamu Afoo is the ethnic autonym for the language, while Sidaminya is its name in Amharic. Although it is not known to have any specific dialects, it shares over 64% lexical similarity with Alaba-K'abeena, 62% with Kambaata, and 53% with Hadiyya, all of which are other languages spoken in southwestern Ethiopia. The word order is typically SOV. Sidaama has over 100,000 L2 speakers. The literacy rate for L1 speakers is 1%-5%, while for L2 speakers it is 20%. In terms of its writing, Sidaama used an Ethiopic script up until 1993, from which point forward it has used a Latin script.\n\nThe term \"Sidamo\" has also been used by some authors to refer to larger groupings of East Cushitic and even Omotic languages. The languages within this Sidamo grouping contain similar, alternating phonological features. The results from a research study conducted in 1968-1969 concerning mutual intelligibility between different Sidamo languages suggest that Sidaama is more closely related to the Gedeo language, which it shares a border with to the south, than other Sidamo languages. According to the \"Ethnologue\", the two languages share a lexical similarity of 60%. Sidaama vocabulary has been influenced by Ge'ez and Amharic, and has in turn influenced Oromo vocabulary.\n\nIn Sidaama, not all noun phrases have nouns. This can occur when it is so obvious what kind of thing the referent of the noun phrase is, that it is unnecessary for the speaker to mention it. Sidaama has two types of noun phrases without nouns. One type is made up only of an adjective or a numeral, where the adjective or the numeral agrees in case, number, and gender with the referent of a noun phrase. This is shown in the examples below:\n\nThe other type of noun phrase without a noun is formed with a noun-phrase clitic, or . This starts with \"t\" () or \"h\" (). This is thought to originate from the Afro-Asiatic demonstrative containing \"t\" () or \"k\" (). The Sidaama appears in various forms. Which form is used then depends on the gender of the referent of the noun phrase, and the syntactic role or case of the noun phrase. When a noun phrase without a noun is formed with an , both the speaker and the listener know its referent.

{"id": "357777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357777", "title": "Sight-reading", "text": "Sight-reading\n\nSight-reading, also called a prima vista (Italian meaning \"at first sight\"), is the reading and performing of a piece of music or song in music notation that the performer has not seen before. Sight-singing is used to describe a singer who is sight-reading. Both activities require the musician to play or sing the notated rhythms and pitches. Many believe that sight-singing is the more challenging of the two, because singers do not have any keys, frets or valves (on keyboard instruments, guitars, and valved brass instruments, respectively) to help them obtain the correct pitches. Singers must also read and sing the correct lyrics, which adds another layer beyond pitch and dynamics. However, difficulty is related both to the instrument and the difficulty of the piece itself. For instance, sight-reading on a polyphonic instrument, such as the classical guitar, can be more challenging due to the fact that the guitarist has to read polyrhythms and polyphonic passages that can often be played in different positions using different frets.\n\nPeople in music literature commonly use the term \"sight-reading\" generically for \"the ability to read and produce both instrumental and vocal music at first sight […] the conversion of musical information from sight to sound\". Udtaisuk and some other authors prefer the use of the more specific terms \"sight-playing\" and \"sight-singing\" where applicable. This differentiation leaves a third, more restricted use of the term \"sight-reading\" for the silent reading of music without creating sound by instrument or voice.\n\nHighly skilled musicians can sight-read \"silently\"; that is, they can look at the printed music and hear it in their heads without playing or singing (see audiation). Less able sight-readers generally must at least hum or whistle in order to sight-read effectively. This distinction is analogous to ordinary prose reading in late antiquity, when the ability to read silently was notable enough for St. Augustine to comment on it. \n\nThe term \"a prima vista\" is also used, as Italian words and phrases are commonly used in music and music notation. To play a musical piece \"a prima vista\" means to play it 'at first sight'. According to Payne, \"the ability to hear the notes on the page is clearly akin to music reading and should be considered a prerequisite for effective performance... Egregious errors can occur when a student, analyzing a piece of music, makes no effort to play or hear the composition but mechanically processes the notes on the page\".\n\nThe ability to sight-read is important for all musicians, even amateur performers, but with professional orchestra musicians and session musicians, it is an essential professional skill. Some professional orchestras require sight-reading as part of an audition.\n\nSome musicians can transpose music during performance to suit particular instruments or vocal ranges, to make the playing of the instrument(s) or singing easier, or a number of other uses.\n\nAccording to Udtaisuk, \"many [authors] use the term sight-playing for instrumental sight-reading performance.\" However, Udtaisuk and some other authors use the more descriptive term \"sightplaying\" (or \"sight-playing\") for instrumental sight-reading, because sight-playing combines two unique skill sets: music reading and music making.\n\nSome authors, according to Udtaisuk, use the term \"sight-singing\" for vocal sight-reading. As with sight-playing, Udtaisuk advocates and uses the more descriptive term \"sightsinging\" for vocal sight-reading because sight-singing combines sight-reading and singing skills.\n\nThe ability to sight-read partly depends on a strong short-term musical memory. An experiment on sight reading using an eye tracker indicates that highly skilled musicians tend to look ahead further in the music, storing and processing the notes until they are played; this is referred to as the eye–hand span.\n\nStorage of notational information in working memory can be expressed in terms of the amount of information (load) and the time for which it must be held before being played (latency). The relationship between load and latency changes according to tempo, such that t = x/y, where t is the change in tempo, x is the change in load, and y is the change in latency. Some teachers and researchers have proposed that the eye–hand span can be trained to be larger than it would otherwise be under normal conditions, leading to more robust sight-reading ability.\n\nHuman memory can be divided into three broad categories: long-term memory, sensory memory, and short-term (working) memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is \"a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension.\" The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and sensory memory is this system's ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a\n\"limited capacity\", so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.\n\nExperiments dealing with memory span have been conducted by George Miller in 1956 that indicated, \"Most common number of items that can be stored in the working memory is five plus or minus two.” However, if this information is not retained and stored (“consolidated”) in one's long-term memory, it will fade quickly.\n\nResearch indicates that the main area of the brain associated with the working memory is the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. This area deals with cognition and contains two major neural loops or pathways that are central to processing tasks via the working memory: the visual loop, which is necessary for the visual component of the task, and the phonological loop, which deals with the linguistic aspects of the task (i.e. repeating the word or phrase). Although the hippocampus, in the temporal lobe, is the brain structure most frequently paired with memories, studies have indicated that its role is more vital for consolidation of the short-term memories into long-term ones than the ability to process, carry out, and briefly recall certain tasks.\n\nThis type of memory has specifically come into focus when discussing sight reading, since the process of looking at musical notes for the first time and deciphering them while playing an instrument can be considered a complex task of comprehension. The main conclusion in terms of this idea is that working memory and short-term memory capacity and mental speed are three important predictors for sight reading achievement. Although none of the studies discredits the correlation between the amount of time one spends practicing and musical ability, specifically sight-reading proficiency, more studies are pointing to the level at which one’s working memory functions as the key factor in sight-reading abilities. As stated in one such study, \"Working memory capacity made a statistically significant contribution as well (about 7 percent, a medium-size effect). In other words, if you took two pianists with the same amount of practice, but different levels of working memory capacity, it's likely that the one higher in working memory capacity would have performed considerably better on the sight-reading task.\"\n\nBased on the research and opinions of multiple musicians and scientists, the take home message about one's sight-reading ability and working memory capacity seems to be that “The best sight-readers combined strong working memories with tens of thousands of hours of practice.”\n\nSight-reading also depends on familiarity with the musical idiom being performed; this permits the reader to recognize and process frequently occurring patterns of notes as a single unit, rather than individual notes, thus achieving greater efficiency. This phenomenon, which also applies to the reading of language, is referred to as chunking. Errors in sight-reading tend to occur in places where the music contains unexpected or unusual sequences; these defeat the strategy of \"reading by expectation\" that sight-readers typically employ.\n\nStudio musicians (e.g., musicians employed to record pieces for commercials, etc.) often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. Often, the music played on television is played by musicians who are sight-reading. This practice has developed through intense commercial competition in these industries.\n\nMcNerney, jazz musician, professor, and private instructor, describes auditions for University of North Texas Jazz Lab Bands as being almost completely based on sight-reading: \"you walk into a room and see three or four music stands in front of you, each with a piece of music on it (in different styles ...). You are then asked to read each piece in succession.\"\n\nThis emphasis on sight-reading, according to McNerney, prepares musicians for studio work \"playing backing tracks for pop performers or recording [commercials].\" The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential. Typically, a studio performance is \"rehearsed\" only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance. They are known as \"rehearsal bands\", even though their performance is the rehearsal.\n\nAccording to Frazier, score reading is an important skill for those interested in the conducting profession and \"Conductors such as the late Robert Shaw and Yoel Levi have incredibly strong piano skills and can read at sight full orchestral scores at the piano\" (a process which requires the pianist to make an instant piano reduction of the key parts of the score).\n\nAlthough 86% of piano teachers polled rated sight-reading as the most important or a highly important skill, only 7% of them said they address it systematically. Reasons cited were a lack of knowledge of how to teach it, inadequacy of the training materials they use, and deficiency in their own sight-reading skills. Teachers also often emphasize rehearsed reading and repertoire building for successful recitals and auditions to the detriment of sight-reading and other functional skills.\n\nHardy reviewed research on piano sight-reading pedagogy and identified a number of specific skills essential to sight-reading proficiency:\n\nBeauchamp (1999) identifies five building blocks in the development of piano sight-reading skills:\n\nGrand-staff knowledge consists of fluency in both clefs such that reading a note evokes an automatic and immediate physical response to the appropriate position on the keyboard. Beauchamp asserts it is better to sense and know where the note is than what the note is. The performer does not have time to think of the note name and translate it to a position, and the non-scientific note name does not indicate the octave to be played. Beauchamp reports success using a Key/Note Visualizer, note-reading flashcards, and computer programs in group and individual practice to develop grand-staff fluency.\n\nUdtaisuk also reports that a sense of keyboard geography and an ability to quickly and efficiently match notes to keyboard keys is important for sight-reading. He found that \"computer programs and flash cards are effective ways to teach students to identify notes [and] enhance a sense of keyboard geography by highlighting the relationships between the keyboard and the printed notation.\"\n\nMost students do not sight-read well because it requires specific instruction, which is seldom given. A major challenge in sight-reading instruction, according to Hardy, is obtaining enough practice material. Since practicing rehearsed reading does not help improve sight-reading, a student can only use a practice piece once. Moreover, the material must be at just the right level of difficulty for each student, and a variety of styles is preferred. Hardy suggests music teachers cooperate to build a large lending library of music and purchase inexpensive music from garage sales and store sales.\n\nIn some circumstances, such as examinations, the ability of a student to sight-read is assessed by presenting the student with a short piece of music, with an allotted time to peruse the music, then testing the student on the accuracy of the performance. A more challenging test requires the student to perform without any preparation at all.\n\nThe Washington Assessment of Student Learning has piloted a classroom based assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to sight-sing or perform on instruments from sheet music they have written. It is suggested that students use solfege or numbering systems or fingering without instruments as aids. 8th graders are expected to sing by sight: \"Students are asked to perform a sight-singing exercise of four measures of music. Students will be assessed on their understanding of rhythm and steady beat and their ability to perform in the designated key with accurate interval changes, acappella.\"\n\nMany students and adults cannot sight-sing, and even some professional singers cannot sing by sight. However, in combination with an assessment which requires composing music on a staff as early as 5th grade, it is hoped that such a requirement will raise arts achievement. Pilot data show that many students can meet or exceed such standards.\n\nThe Standard Assessment of Sight Reading (SASR) is a non-subjective sight reading evaluation method. It was created with a scientific/electronic platform to insure a non-subjective approach to grading and administering that test. It consists of several thousand pieces of music over 80 graded levels of difficulty that have been reviewed by 135 teachers and students to ascertain the correct difficulty levels. Their scores were averaged electronically in order to insure a scientific approach to graduating the difficulty levels of the music.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1598658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1598658", "title": "Tunica language", "text": "Tunica language\n\nThe Tunica (or Tonica, or less common form Yuron) language is a language isolate that was spoken in the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley in the United States by Native American Tunica peoples. There are no native speakers of the Tunica language, but , there are 32 second language speakers.\n\nTunica-Biloxi tribal member William Ely Johnson worked with Swiss ethnologist Albert Gatschet to help him document the language in 1886. This initial documentation was further developed by linguist John R. Swanton in the early 1900s.\n\nThe last known native speaker, Sesostrie Youchigant, died in 1948. In the 1930s, linguist Mary Haas worked with him to describe what Youchigant remembered of the language, and the description was published in \"A Grammar of the Tunica Language\" in 1941. That was followed by \"Tunica Texts\" in 1950 and \"Tunica Dictionary\" in 1953.\n\nBy the 17th century, the people had suffered a high rate of fatalities from Eurasian infectious diseases, warfare, and social disruption. The reduced Tunica tribe lived close to the Ofo and Avoyelles tribes, in present-day Louisiana. They communicated by Mobilian Jargon or French. The small population and the use of a jargon made Haas note that the eventual deterioration of the Tunica language was inevitable.\n\nIn 2010, the Tunica-Biloxi tribe formed the Tunica Language Project in partnership with the Linguistics Program at Tulane University in a continuing effort to revitalize the Tunica language. Tribal members read from a new children's book in Tunica at a 2010 pow wow. Only about half of the tribal members live within of the reservation, in Avoyelles Parish. The Tunica-Biloxi Language & Culture Revitalization Program uses webinars to teach the language to those who do not live near the reservation.\n\nTunica has seven vowels, all of which are usually short but may be lengthened in stressed syllables, and all of which are voiced completely, except if a /u/ is at the end of a phrase in a word with stress on the second-last syllable, when it is unvoiced after a /k/ or /hk/. Vowels are paired with a certain melody in last or occasionally second-last syllable of a word. The melodies are high, low, rising, falling, and falling-rising.\n\nVowels may appear only following or preceding consonants, never adjacent to one another. Also, /i/, /a/, and /u/ may appear in any position, but the others appear only in syllables with stress. Vowels do not typically occur at the end of a phrase, and when any vowel precedes \"n\" in the same syllable, it becomes nasalized.\n\nThe transcription style (represented in bolded symbols below) is based on Mary Haas' work \"Tunica Language\". The IPA symbols are in brackets next to each consonant.\n\nThe consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, and /t͡ʃ/ are always fairly aspirated unless they occur before a /ʔ/, when they are completely unaspirated. Meanwhile, /b/, /d/, and /g/ do not occur frequently, as is the case with /f/. The fricatives /s/ and /š/ are pronounced with a stronger hiss than in English, and /ʔ/ is said to have a very strong closure. The semi-vowels /j/ and /w/ are always voiced, as is the nasal /m/. On the other hand, /n/, /l/, and /r/ can be voiced or voiceless. The /l/ and /r/ are voiced between vowels or before /ʔ/ or continuants. However, they are voiceless before voiceless consonants except /ʔ/ or at the end of a phrase: \"ši'lka\" \"blackbird,\" \"ši'hkal\" \"stone.\" Similarly, /n/ is voiced between vowels or before /ʔ/ and is voiceless at the end of a phrase or before voiceless consonants except /ʔ/.\n\nTunica has both stressed and unstressed syllables, and stressed syllables can have a higher pitch than other syllables, depending on the position of the syllable in a phrase. The first stressed syllable of a phrase is typically spoken with a slightly higher pitch than the following syllables are. The exception is the last syllable when the high or the falling melody is used or the last syllable during the use of the low or the rising melody. The phrase-final melody then determines much of the stress in the rest of the phrase.\n\nWhen there is use of the high melody, the last syllable is about a minor third higher pitch than the second-last syllable. The first syllable with stress is usually a major second higher than the following syllables are except for the last. All other syllables may not be spoken with any kind of pitch, and the same goes for other unstressed syllables. For example, \"ta'čiyak ʔura'pʔikʔahčá\" \"You will kill the squirrel\" shows the melody. \"ta'-\" is a major second higher than the syllables that follow it except for \"-ča\", which is a minor third higher than any syllable that comes before it other than \"ta'-\".\n\nThe falling melody causes the last syllable to start at a minor third higher than the second-last syllable: it goes down quickly: \"ʔa'hkiš ma'rʔikî\" \"Go back!\"\n\nThe low melody that occurs as the last syllable is lower than the last stressed syllable, which is a little higher than the syllables that it immediately follows. All unstressed syllables between the last stressed syllable and the last syllable take on the same stress as the latter. Unless it is also the last stressed syllable, the first stressed syllable is higher than any following syllable except that last stressed syllable:'ʔu'riš ma'rʔuwa'nì\" \"He went back home, they say.\"\n\nWhen the rising melody occurs, the last syllable starts lower than the last stressed syllable and goes upward quickly by about a minor third. Elsewhere in the phrase, the tone is like a low melody: \"lɔ'ta wiwa'nǎn\" \"Do you want to run?\"\n\nThe falling-rising melody is a fast drop by a fourth, followed by a fast rise by a minor third. However, only one word uses it: \"hőn\" \"Yes.\"\n\nEvery syllable in Tunica begins with a single consonant. Sometimes, double or triple consonants may occur in the middle of words or phrases, but no more than two consonants in a row occur at the end of a phrase. The smallest phonetic group in Tunica is a phrase, but a word and a phrase can be differentiated by certain processes. Those that affect grammatical elements that merge to form words are vocalic contraction, vocalic assimilation, vocalic syncope, consonantic syncope, haplology, and patterns in stress. Those that affect words that combine into phrases are vocalic apocope, consonantic apocope, amalgamation, and stress losses. More specific information and basic examples are detailed below:\n\n\nNouns can be divided into the categories of indeterminative and determinative. The indeterminative nouns have a stem without any affixes, and the determinative nouns are distinguished by the articular prefix or the pronominal prefix. Determinative nouns belong are definitive, non-definitive, and locative, which may be distinguished by different prefixes or suffixes.\n\nThe articular prefix is similar to the definite article in English and appears as \"ta'-\" before all stems not beginning with /ʔ/ or /t/. The prefix appears as \"t-\" before stems beginning with /ʔ/, and it is omitted by haplology before stems beginning with /t/: \"te'tiha'yihta\" \"on the road\"; \"te'ti\" \"the road\" < \"te'ti\" \"road\"\n\nAll proper nouns, unless their stems begin with /t/, must begin with the articular prefix. For instance, \"ta'wišmi'li\" \"Red River\" is \"ta'-\" + \"wi'š(i)mi'li\" \"red water\".\n\nThe pronominal prefixes signify possession when they attached to a noun and preclude the need for articular prefixes with the same stem. Some stems, called inalienably-possessed noun stems, cannot be used without a pronominal prefix. They include those of kinship, body parts, and miscellaneous terms. Kinship terms are those such as \"-e'si\" \"father\" or \"'-gači\" \"mother.\" Body part terms are those such as \"-e'sini\" \"head\" or \"-e'neri\" \"horns.\" Finally, miscellaneous terms can be nouns like \"-e'htiwa'hkuni\" \"breechcloth\" or \"-e'tisa\" \"name.\"\n\nGender-number suffixes can be used only in the definitive case of the determinative category so whenever one is used, there must also be a determining prefix attached to the stem. Below is a table showing the gender-number suffixes: \nSometimes, gender-number suffixes are put on an inflected verb form to convert it to a relative clause. It could be that a noun has the appropriate suffix, and the verb of the clause then takes the same one. Other times, only the verb takes the suffix. Examples of the use of the gender-number suffixes follow:\n\n\nFinally, there are three possible locative suffixes to put nouns in the locative case. The nouns will also have a determining prefix attached. Gender-number suffixes and locative suffixes are mutually exclusive, but a locative noun may have a number. Also, locative suffixes can take stems and convert them into adverbs and postpositions. \"-ši\" is the most commonly used locative suffix, and its meaning is comparable to the English \"in, into\" or \"on, over,\" but in Tunica, it is used as \"at, to.\" That can be seen in the sentence \"He stayed at home,\" which breaks down into \"ʔu'riš ʔunanì\" < \"at his house\" \"ʔu'riš(i)\" < \"ʔuhk-\" + \"ri-\" \"house\" + \"ši\". \"-štihki\" \"toward, in the direction of\" is the second suffix.\n\nUsually, it is used with the names of directions: \"ta'sapʔaraštihk\" \"to the west\" < \"ta-\" +\"sa'pʔara\" \"west\" + \"-štihki\". The final locative suffix is \"-hat\" \"on, onto.\" It is typically used only with \"ta'hali\" \"the ground.\" It can be seen in the sentence \"He spat on the ground\" as \"ta'haltǎn, ču'hʔuhkɛ'nì\"; \"ta'halta\" < \"ta'-\" + \"ha'l(i)\" \"ground, land\" + \"-hat\".\n\nThe possible word classes that are found in Tunica include independent personal pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, postpositions, adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, active verbs, static verbs, sentence connectives, and exclamatives and imitatives. Syntactic elements of a sentence are made up of words, phrases, or clauses acting in one of the following: predicative words, independent subjects, independent objects, subject or object modifiers, predicate modifiers, predicate complements, or sentence connectives. The syntactic elements can all be made into clauses that are either main or subordinate, and subordinate clauses can be dependent, complementary, relative, or adverbial.\n\nThere are three types of sentences that the Tunica language produces: simple, compound, and complex. Simple sentences must contain only one predicative word. Compound sentences have two or more main clauses. Complex sentences have a main clause and one or more of the different types of subordinate clauses that are mentioned above.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of possible syntactic elements of a clause:\n\nmay be words when used as adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, and locatives and may be phrases and clauses when it is adverbial.\n\nThere are other special constructions that also take place in certain specific environments. For example, quantificatives and nouns can be in apposition to other nouns that independent subjects or objects: \"ʔuhkʔo'nisɛ'mǎn, ho't ʔaku'hpanʔuhkɛ'nì\" \"He assembled all (of) his people, it is sad\" < \"he assembled, it is said, his people, all.\" Additionally, a possessive nexus can serve in the same syntactical functions that a noun can. For example, \"ta'čɔhak ʔu'rǐhč, hi'yuhɔ'nì\" \"The chief's house was (made of) grass\" (\"ta'čɔhaku\" \"the chief\", possessor noun, + \"ʔu'rihči\" \"his house\", alienably possessed noun, the combination serving as independent subject).\n\nThere are certain rules that are observed to form sentences in the correct order:\n\n\nThere are also certain rules in the order of clauses:\n\n\nNoun can belong to one of the following gender-number classes: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine dual, feminine dual, masculine plural, or feminine plural. There are rules to help determine classification of nouns:\n\n\nNouns in Tunica are also classified according to what position they take. There are three positions that are available and that encompass every noun in the Tunica language: horizontal, squatting, and vertical. Humans and four-legged non-humans can take any of the positions, but elongated non-human animates (like fish or snakes) always take the horizontal position. Smaller non-human animates, like frogs and birds, always take the squatting position.\n\nInanimates are always horizontal or vertical: abstract nouns are always horizontal, and inanimate objects that take an erect position, like trees, are vertical.\n\nThe preverbs are often used with active verb predicative words:\n\nThere are many postfixes, which express different meanings like certain tenses and negation. Sometimes, more than one postfix may be attached to one word, and each postfix has its own governing rules.\n\n\nThere are two possible noun categories: the determinative and the indeterminative. The determinative category can be divided into definitive, non-definitive, and locative. Indeterminative nouns can be predicative words, subjects of predications, objects of transitive and transimpersonal active verbs and of static verbs, and complements of impersonal and transimpersonal active verbs and of static verbs.\n\nPersonal pronouns are inflected depending on person, number, and gender, but they do not have special forms that indicate whether they fall into the determinative or indeterminative categories. They substitute for nouns, and they can be used like nouns, except in the locative case.\n\nThe interrogative-indefinite pronouns are \"ka'ku\" \"who, someone, anyone\" and \"ka'nahku\" \"what, something, anything.\" They can substitute for nouns when they do not occur in the locative case. Also, \"ka'nahku\" does not appear as an independent subject.\n\nQuantificatives include numerals and others like \"ho'tu\" \"all, everything,\" \"na'mu\" \"many, much,\" \"ka'šku\" \"a few, a little bit,\" \"ka'škuto'hku\" \"several, quite a few,\" and \"ʔa'mari\" \"enough.\" They can be used as minimal clauses, substitutes for nouns, modifiers of nouns, and modifiers of active verbs.\n\nPostpositions are used to modify locatives and predicates.\n\nAdjectives can be used as predicate words, as noun modifiers used as predicative words, or as modifiers of the interrogative-indefinite pronoun \"ka'nahku\".\n\nComparatives can be used as modifiers of adjectives, static verbs, adverbs, nouns, or quantificative \"na'mu\".\n\nAdverbs can be used to modify auxiliary and active verbs.\n\nAuxiliary verbs are always in a predicative word position. Active verbs are either finite or infinitive in form. Finite verbs take subjective pronominal referentials and are predicative words. Infinitives are taken as predicate complements. Sometimes, they are inflected for an objective referential. Static verbs are always inflected for an objective referential and are always predicative words.\n\nSentence connectives connect or contrast two sentences or sometimes two words.\n\nExclamatives and imitatives always appear as minimal clauses. The most predominant exclamatives are \"hõn\" \"yes\", \"ʔahâ\" \"no\", and \"dâ\" \"now; ready.\"\n\n"}
