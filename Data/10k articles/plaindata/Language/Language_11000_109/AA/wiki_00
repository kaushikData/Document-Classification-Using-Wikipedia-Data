He was a scholar of science, with great intellectual abilities and eloquent of both pen and speech. He had a remarkable openness to modern Western knowledge as well as Eastern knowledge. Choudhury made a lasting contribution to Bengali literature with his novels, travelogue, essays and his introspective autobiographical and epistolary works.\n\nHis novels and short stories were often set against an emergent urban background, but more commonly in cities outside Bangladesh such as London, Bedford, Calcutta, Karachi and Kohat; where the majority of immigrant Bengali resided. Choudhury created his characters from highly diverse backgrounds and developed themes that revolved around the twists and turns of events, the conflicts and contradictions prevailing in the social processes. His characters embraced a new change; death of an old social values which were based on the ideas of corruptions, religious, political, economical; and the rise of the self-freedom, birth of a new society, these immediately preceded the social processes of the present day and hence are vital to identifying and understanding contemporary problems.\n\nIt is essential to analyses Choudhury's writings in the light of the social scenario from 60s-90s, when deprivation and degradation were taken for granted in Bangladesh, London and India-Pakistan which were known by some and unknown by others. These realities some times were dedicated and made indelible in the name of religious sermons and social sanctions. Thus his main task was to focus readers' attention, by giving a frame-by-frame picture of the helplessness and inhuman predicament of the victims of injustice.\n\nIn Porodeshe Porobashi (Life on Distant Shores), Chowdhury has not only discovered London, where he stayed with fellow Sylhetis, but also discovered his own homeland. When you are far away, when you are detached from your object of love, your inner eye gets working and you discovery the truth. This discovery is ugly from a close look but is beautiful and lovable when seen from a distance. Most of us who stay in our homeland fail to take a close look at it. But the novelist succeeds in discovering his own land while staying overseas and thinking of it and loving it. Reality and nostalgia get mixed with each other to form a perfect image of the writer's homeland in his mind. Porodeshe Porobashi is a quality work of art by any standard. The writer is a powerful narrator and uses wit and humour quite deftly. He is a skilful user of words. The writer depends on autobiographical elements and has a philosophical outlook. He clearly understood the psyche of Bangladeshis staying abroad. He dips deep into the human mind, as he has written elsewhere about the book, the writer mixes reality with the light and shade of truth. Thus it is a true picture of common life. It is lively and hat at all dull, neither a travelogue nor a memoir, it is a novel with lively characters, a touching story of human suffering and a story of the eternal lonely man.\n\nThe wide canvas of words and tales of this artist brought out the plight of women in the male-dominated set-up of society. Over and above the Islamic-based code of beliefs of the society; male-domination society pushed woman into complete subjugation, making them property for the use of men, because of such a 'life-style's set-up, economical and social oppression was principally faced by women. This drove women to utter frustration and desperation. Choudhury portrayed women, their plight, and their helplessness in the face of this male-dominated society. On the other hand, he wrote about their sense of humanitarian values, their love, sorrows, their deep longing for a life as normal and beautiful as free women.\n\nIn the wake of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, which surged up all over Bangladesh, was recounted in his writing Ekti Jatike Hotay (Legacy of a Nation). Choudhury believed that in today's world men no longer wanted to keep themselves constricted within the sphere of a specified duty.\n\nIn Choudhury's time, in a modern society with priest as its advocate and protector, religion lost all its progressivism. It went so far that religion became bogged down in rituals, superstitions and bigotry, while its proponents stank of greed, corruption, even debauchery: even the so-called mullahs could not keep themselves free from this downfall. Almost half the characters in his novels Sampan Crass (St. Pancras) and Aniketon represented the mainstay of the decadent society, while the other half, were absorbed with the emerging thoughts, ideals and values of the new society - humanist and secular in content.\n\nChoudhury's most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) vol. 1, 2, 3. This is the largest novel of Choudhury. Based mainly on the political activities and the political leaders of Pakistan, of the Indian Subcontinent in board sense, the novel covers the span from 1968 to the Liberation War of Bangladesh (1971). The novel begins with no other character than that of Bhutto and gradually reveals his true nature. The readers will also get a vivid picture of greater \"Undivided Bengal\", changes in the social structure and the creation of a socialist state. The author's own experiences of tension, imagination and dreams combined together to produce a multi-faceted novel.\n\nIn Choudhury's short-stories the write portrays the changes of village life brought by the time. He is very much in love with his motherland, the rivers and paddy fields. He portrays the London life of people from Sylhet quite faithfully and in great detail. Researchers will find his works useful in the future. Choudhury handles a lot of characters and a wide range of time. Most of the writings are perfect picture of our society, and it has a lovely appearance also. In some of his short stories the writer gives a lot of importance to the physical state of human existence, society should get rid of its negative forces, and build strength on human body and its soul, both of which are deeply linked, and hence both are very important for human beings.\n\nHe was an understanding revolutionary in his own right, ploughing alone a firm held furrow. He carried on his revolution through revealing revelations of all surviving social practices and norms. Unlike many others of his stature, Choudhury as a man, towers far above Choudhury as a writer, though he carved out a place for himself amongst the galaxy of contemporary novelists.\n\nNovels\n\nA Collection of Short-Stories\n\nEssays\n\nA Collection of poem\n\n\n[Source: Jibani Granthamala: A Series of Literary biographies, Bangla Academy, Dhaka, Feb 1991.]\n\nFollowing Bengali writers and free-thinkers received Drouhee Kotha-shahitayk Abdur Rouf Choudhury Award:\n\n"}

Orphaned when he was 10 years old, he went to live with his uncle in Fortaleza. In 1883, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, where another relative of his matriculated him in a naval school. In 1886, he published his first book: \"Voos Incertos\" (\"Uncertain Flights\"). In the same year, he made an instruction trip to the United States.\n\nIn 1887 he was promoted to Second Lieutenant and published the short story books \"Judite\" and \"Lágrimas de um Crente\" (\"Tears of a Believer\"). In 1888 he returned to Fortaleza, but got involved on a scandal where he eloped with an \"alférez\"s daughter. They would have two daughters, and fled to Rio de Janeiro, where Caminha would spend his life as a civil servant.\n\nBy 1891, Caminha was working on journals such as the \"Jornal do Commercio\", \"Gazeta de Notícias\" and \"O País\", using the pseudonym Félix Guanabarino. He also published the novel \"A Normalista\". In 1894, he published an account of his travel to the U.S.A., entitled \"No País dos Ianques\" (\"In the Country of the Yankees\"). In 1895, he published his controversial novel \"Bom-Crioulo\" and \"Cartas Literárias\". In 1896, he founded a journal named \"Nova Revista\", and published the novel \"Tentação\".\n\nPoor and debilitated by tuberculosis, he would die at only 29 years old, leaving unfinished two novels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38507907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38507907", "title": "Author editing", "text": "Author editing\n\nAn authors' editor is a language professional who works \"with authors to make draft texts fit for purpose\". He or she edits manuscripts that have been drafted by the author (or authors) but have not yet been submitted to a publisher for publication. This type of editing is called \"author editing\", to distinguish it from other types of editing done for publishers on documents already accepted for publication: an authors' editor works \"with (and, commonly, for) an author rather than for a publisher\". A term sometimes used synonymously with authors' editor is \"manuscript editor\" which, however, is less precise as it also refers to editors employed by scholarly journals to edit manuscripts after acceptance (in place of the term copy editor).\n\nAuthors' editors usually work with academic authors, researchers and scientists writing scholarly journal articles, books and grant proposals. Thus, the authors' editor facilitates the academic writing process by acting before submission or peer review. Authors' editors may also help authors revise manuscripts after peer review, but once the document is accepted for publication the collaboration ends (and other editors, for example a copy editor or production editor, take over).\n\nAn author's collaboration with an authors' editor begins after a manuscript has been drafted. The manuscript must be drafted in the desired publishing language: author editing does not include translation. The manuscript must be relatively complete, as author editing does not include the tasks of drafting or writing. If authors need help conceiving, structuring or writing their text, then they require the work of a developmental editor or a writer (e.g. medical writer or technical writer).\n\nThe goal of author editing is to help authors produce a clear, accurate and effective document that meets readers' expectations and that will be favorably received by publishers, journal editors and peer reviewers. Therefore, authors' editors do both linguistic editing and substantive editing (editing of \"substance\", i.e. content). They improve format, structure, grammar, style, data presentation, argumentation, flow and accuracy. They query authors about unclear content, inform and educate authors about good writing techniques (called \"didactic editing\"), and engage authors in revising the text (they \"elicit revision\"). Rather than simply correct the text, they collaborate with authors by dialoging with them (through in-text comments, email, phone, internet telephony, etc.) about the content and style; examples of how they annotate texts and negotiate the acceptability of the language have been given in an essay by Burrough-Boenisch. Authors' editors may also advise authors on peer review and the publishing process, and on high-impact publishing strategies.\n\nWhen authors receive the revised manuscript, they usually must dedicate substantial time and effort to reviewing the editor's changes and queries. They may discuss the work with the editor, to learn why certain changes were made and to resolve issues that were raised during editing. After they have revised the text, they may resubmit it to the editor for an additional round of editing (if the fee agreement so permits) or finalize it on their own.\n\nThe authors' editor is an optional figure in the publishing process. Authors are more likely to hire an authors' editor when they are not fluent in the language in which they wish to publish: this is particularly the case for non-anglophone academics and scientists who publish their research in English for international communication. Another reason for working with an authors' editor regards the author's writing skills, as some scientists and clinicians may face difficulties composing an adequate text in a reasonable amount of time despite being excellent researchers.\n\nSkilled writers will not need to hire such an editor, instead finding sufficient the feedback of colleagues (prior to submitting a manuscript) and peer reviewers (after submission). Nonetheless, even skilled writers may benefit from author editing, especially when they are short of time and have ambitious publishing goals. In fact, since these editors can save researchers time, help them improve their writing, and maximize their chances of publication success, when a regular collaboration is established, authors' editors can become trusted allies of research teams.\n\nLess skilled writers who are aware that editing will improve their manuscripts (or have been told to seek editing by a journal or publisher) also may not go to an authors' editor, but instead may use one of the many specialized editing firms (for convenience, greater availability, possibly lower costs). However, these firms, for their global nature, do not always permit the establishment of the collaborative relationship between editor and author-clients which is necessary for true author editing. Finally, novice writers may not realize how they can benefit by presubmission author editing; by submitting unedited manuscripts, they may find themselves in a situation of multiple rejections.\n\nAlthough term \"authors' editor\" is little known, even by persons whose work could accurately be called author editing, it is not new but has been in use at least since the 1970s. The roots of this profession seem to lie in the arena of medical editing in the US. The first known use of the term to describe an editor working in the research setting dates to 1968, in an essay by Mayo Clinic editor Bernard Forscher. In 1973, an article entitled \"The author's editor\" by L.B. Applewhite was published in the first volume of the journal \"Medical Communications\" of the American Medical Writers Association. In 1974, an essay by Barbara G. Cox with the same title was published in the \"Mayo Clinic Proceedings\". In the early 1980s, the Council of Biology Editors (now the Council of Science Editors) began to define and discuss the role of authors' editors, through a seminal paper by Martha M. Tacker followed by a national survey of 100 scientific authors' editors, both published in the journal \"CBE Views\" (now \"Science Editor\"). The survey sparked an editorial in the \"Canadian Medical Association Journal\". These early papers used the term \"author's editor\" (with author in singular) but today, when academic papers usually have multiple authors, the pluralized term \"authors' editor\" is becoming standard usage.\n\nCuriously, the term \"authors' editor\" was used in 1953, in the title of a Doctor of Education thesis, to describe Maxwell Perkins, a literary editor who helped shape American literature in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\n"}
{"id": "27664789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27664789", "title": "Betula utilis", "text": "Betula utilis\n\nBetula utilis (Himalayan birch, bhojpatra, \"bhūrjá\") is a birch tree native to the Himalayas, growing at elevations up to . The specific epithet, \"utilis\", refers to the many uses of the different parts of the tree. The white, paper-like bark of the tree was used in ancient times for writing Sanskrit scriptures and texts. It is still used as paper for the writing of sacred mantras, with the bark placed in an amulet and worn for protection. Selected varieties are used for landscaping throughout the world, even while some areas of its native habitat are being lost due to overuse of the tree for firewood.\n\n\"Betula utilis\" was described and named by botanist David Don in his \"Prodromus Florae Nepalensis\" (1825), from specimens collected by Nathaniel Wallich in Nepal in 1820. \"Betula jacquemontii\" (Spach), first described and named in 1841, was later found to be a variety of \"B. utilis\", and is now \"Betula utilis\" var. \"jacquemontii\".\n\nIn its native habitat, \"B. utilis\" tends to form forests, growing as a shrub or tree reaching up to tall. It frequently grows among scattered conifers, with an undergrowth of shrubs that typically includes evergreen \"Rhododendron\". The tree depends on moisture from snowmelt, rather than from the monsoon rains. They often have very bent growth due to the pressure of the deep winter snow in the Himalaya.\n\nLeaves are ovate, long, with serrated margins, and slightly hairy. Flowering occurs from May–July, with only a few male catkins, and short, single (sometimes paired) female catkins. The perianth has four parts in male flowers, and is absent in the female flowers. Fruits ripen in September–October.\n\nThe thin, papery bark is very shiny, reddish brown, reddish white, or white, with horizontal lenticels. The bark peels off in broad, horizontal belts, making it very usable for creating even large pages for texts. A fungal growth, locally called \"bhurja-granthi\", forms black lumps on the tree weighing up to 1 kg.\n\nThe wood is very hard and heavy, and quite brittle. The heartwood is pink or light reddish brown.\n\nThe bark of Himalayan birch was used centuries ago in India as paper for writing lengthy scriptures and texts in Sanskrit and other scripts, particularly in historical Kashmir. Its use as paper for books is mentioned by early Sanskrit writers Kalidasa (c. 4th century CE), Sushruta (c. 3rd century CE), and Varahamihira (6th century CE). In the late 19th century, Kashmiri pandits reported all of their books were written on Himalayan birch bark until Akbar introduced paper in the 16th century. The Sanskrit word for the tree is \"bhûrja\"—sharing a similarity with other Indo-European words that provide the origin for the common name \"birch\".\n\nThe bark is still used for writing sacred mantras, which are placed in an amulet and worn around the neck for protection or blessing. This practice was mentioned as early as the 8th or 9th century CE, in the Lakshmi Tantra, a Pancaratra text. According to legend, the bark was also used as clothing by attendants of Lord Shiva.\n\nThe bark is widely used for packaging material (particularly butter), roof construction, umbrella covers, bandages, and more. The wood is used for bridge construction, and the foliage for fodder. The most widespread use is for firewood, which has caused large areas of habitat to be eliminated or reduced. Parts of the plant, including the fungal growth (\"bhurja-granthi\") have also long been used in local traditional medicine.\n\nDeforestation due to overuse of the tree has caused loss of habitat for many native groves of \"B. utilis\" (locally called \"bhojpatra\" in the Indian Himalaya). The first high-altitude \"bhojpatra\" nursery was established in 1993 at Chirbasa, just above Gangotri, where many Hindus go on pilgrimage to the source of the sacred Ganges river. Dr. Harshvanti Bisht, a Himalayan mountaineer, established the first nursery and continues to expand the reforestation of \"bhojpatra\" in the Gangotri area and inside Gangotri National Park. About 12,500 bhojpatra saplings had been planted in the area by the year 2000. In recent years, attempts have been made to ban the collection of \"bhojpatra\" trees in the Gangotri area.\n\nMany named varieties and cultivars are used in landscaping throughout the world. In the eastern end of the tree's native distribution, several forms have orange- or copper-colored bark. \"Betula utilis\" var. \"jacquemontii\", from the western end of the native habitat, is widely used because several cultivars have especially white bark. These include:\nThose cultivars marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\"B. utilis\" 'Fascination' has an orange- to mahogany-colored bark, which peels off to reveal a polished-looking layer underneath. The bark of 'Wakehurst Place Chocolate', as the name implies, is dark brown to nearly black.\n\n"}
{"id": "47492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47492", "title": "Biomass (ecology)", "text": "Biomass (ecology)\n\nThe biomass is the mass of living biological organisms in a given area or ecosystem at a given time. Biomass can refer to \"species biomass\", which is the mass of one or more species, or to \"community biomass\", which is the mass of all species in the community. It can include microorganisms, plants or animals. The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area, or as the total mass in the community.\n\nHow biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured. Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms \"in situ\", just as they are. For example, in a salmon fishery, the salmon biomass might be regarded as the total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the water. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried organic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest being water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth, bones and shells are excluded. In some applications, biomass is measured as the mass of organically bound carbon (C) that is present.\n\nThe total live biomass on Earth is about 550 - 560 billion tonnes C, and the total annual primary production of biomass is just over 100 billion tonnes C/yr. The total live biomass of bacteria may be as much as that of plants and animals or may be much less. The total number of DNA base pairs on Earth, as a possible approximation of global biodiversity, is estimated at (5.3±3.6) x 10, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 x 10 tonnes of carbon.\n\nAn ecological pyramid is a graphical representation that shows, for a given ecosystem, the relationship between biomass or biological productivity and trophic levels.\n\n\nAn ecological pyramid provides a snapshot in time of an ecological community.\n\nThe bottom of the pyramid represents the primary producers (autotrophs). The primary producers take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called primary production. The pyramid then proceeds through the various trophic levels to the apex predators at the top.\n\nWhen energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass. The remaining ninety percent goes to metabolic processes or is dissipated as heat. This energy loss means that productivity pyramids are never inverted, and generally limits food chains to about six levels. However, in oceans, biomass pyramids can be wholly or partially inverted, with more biomass at higher levels.\n\nTerrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher trophic level (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial producers are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that consume them, such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest predators in the food chain, such as foxes and eagles.\n\nIn a temperate grassland, grasses and other plants are the primary producers at the bottom of the pyramid. Then come the primary consumers, such as grasshoppers, voles and bison, followed by the secondary consumers, shrews, hawks and small cats. Finally the tertiary consumers, large cats and wolves. The biomass pyramid decreases markedly at each higher level.\n\nOcean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with phytoplankton, and follows the course:\n\nPhytoplankton → zooplankton → predatory zooplankton → filter feeders → predatory fish\nPhytoplankton are the main primary producers at the bottom of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton use photosynthesis to convert inorganic carbon into protoplasm. They are then consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton.\n\nZooplankton comprise the second level in the food chain, and includes small crustaceans, such as copepods and krill, and the larva of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.\n\nIn turn, small zooplankton are consumed by both larger predatory zooplankters, such as krill, and by forage fish, which are small, schooling, filter-feeding fish. This makes up the third level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are swordfish, seals and gannets.\n\nApex predators, such as orcas, which can consume seals, and shortfin mako sharks, which can consume swordfish, make up the fifth trophic level. Baleen whales can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nMarine environments can have inverted biomass pyramids. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers grow and reproduce slowly.\n\nThere is an exception with cyanobacteria. Marine cyanobacteria are the smallest known photosynthetic organisms; the smallest of all, \"Prochlorococcus\", is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across. Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful species on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater may contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, there are estimated to be several octillion (~10) individuals. \"Prochlorococcus\" is ubiquitous between 40°N and 40°S and dominates in the oligotrophic (nutrient poor) regions of the oceans. The bacterium accounts for an estimated 20% of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and forms part of the base of the ocean food chain.\n\nThere are typically 50 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. The 2018 census gives for bacterial biomass ≈70 billions of tonnes of carbon, equal to 15% of the whole biomass, In a much-cited study from 1998 the world bacterial biomass had been mistakenly calculated to be 350 to 550 billions of tonnes of carbon, equal to between 60% and 100% of the carbon in plants. More recent studies of seafloor microbes had cast considerable doubt on that, one study in 2012 reduced the calculated microbial biomass on the seafloor from the original 303 billions of tonnes of C to just 4.1 billions of tonnes of C, reducing the global biomass of prokaryotes to 50 to 250 billions of tonnes of C. Further, if the average per cell biomass of prokaryotes is reduced from 86 to 14 femtograms C then the global biomass of prokaryotes was reduced to 13 to 44.5 billions of tonnes of C, equal to between 2.4% and 8.1% of the carbon in plants. The mentioned current value (≈70 billions of tonnes of carbon) was published in May 2018.\n\nEstimates for the global biomass of species and higher level groups are not always consistent across the literature. Apart from bacteria, the total global biomass has been estimated at about 550 billion tonnes C. Most of this biomass is found on land, with only 5 to 10 billion tonnes C found in the oceans. On land, there is about 1,000 times more plant biomass (\"phytomass\") than animal biomass (\"zoomass\"). About 18% of this plant biomass is eaten by the land animals. However, in the ocean, the animal biomass is nearly 30 times larger than the plant biomass. Most ocean plant biomass is eaten by the ocean animals.\n\nHumans comprise about 100 million tonnes of the Earth's dry biomass, domesticated animals about 700 million tonnes, earthworms over 1,100 million tonnes, and annual cereal crops about 2.3 billion tonnes.\n\nThe most successful animal species, in terms of biomass, may well be Antarctic krill, \"Euphausia superba\", with a fresh biomass approaching 500 million tonnes, although domestic cattle may also reach these immense figures. However, as a group, the small aquatic crustaceans called copepods may form the largest animal biomass on earth. A 2009 paper in \"Science\" estimates, for the first time, the total world fish biomass as somewhere between 0.8 and 2.0 billion tonnes. It has been estimated that about 1% of the global biomass is due to phytoplankton, and 25% is due to fungi.\n\nNet primary production is the rate at which new biomass is generated, mainly due to photosynthesis. Global primary production can be estimated from satellite observations. Satellites scan the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) over terrestrial habitats, and scan sea-surface chlorophyll levels over oceans. This results in 56.4 billion tonnes C/yr (53.8%), for terrestrial primary production, and 48.5 billion tonnes C/yr for oceanic primary production. Thus, the total photoautotrophic primary production for the Earth is about 104.9 billion tonnes C/yr. This translates to about 426 gC/m²/yr for land production (excluding areas with permanent ice cover), and 140 gC/m²/yr for the oceans.\n\nHowever, there is a much more significant difference in standing stocks—while accounting for almost half of total annual production, oceanic autotrophs account for only about 0.2% of the total biomass. Autotrophs may have the highest global proportion of biomass, but they are closely rivaled or surpassed by microbes.\n\nTerrestrial freshwater ecosystems generate about 1.5% of the global net primary production.\n\nSome global producers of biomass in order of productivity rates are\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9606120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9606120", "title": "Camfranglais", "text": "Camfranglais\n\nCamfranglais, Francanglais, or Francamglais (portmanteau of the French adjectives \"camerounais\", \"français\", and \"anglais\") is a pidgin language of Cameroon, consisting of a macaronic mixture of Cameroonian French, Cameroonian English and Cameroonian Pidgin English, in addition to lexical contributions from various indigenous languages of Cameroon.\n\nThe language blend is common among young people in the country, and rivals Cameroonian Pidgin English (\"Creole\") as the country's most common lingua franca. It is most popular in the high-density urban centres where anglophones and francophones meet. Camfranglais has caused concern for educators, who worry that the language blend may hinder acquisition of regular French and English and may be seen as a shortcut around true bilingualism. Studies are underway over Camfranglais, which some academics consider to be on its way to becoming a proper language.\n\nCamfranglais first emerged in the mid-1970s after the reunification of Francophone Cameroun and Anglophone Southern Cameroons. It is believed to have originated in the markets, ports, schools, and sports stadiums of Cameroon's larger cities. It became fashionable in the late 1990s, due partially to its use by popular musicians. Camfranglais continues to be used in music today, in the work of musicians like Koppo, Krotal, and AkSangGrave, as well as by writers such as Kalalobe and Labang.\n\nToday, Camfranglais sees widespread unofficial use in the Cameroonian education system. Though Cameroon claims both French and English as official languages, elementary schools teach in only a single language. Thus, elementary pupils are surrounded by others that primarily speak the same language. It is not until secondary school that learning the other becomes mandatory. This helps explain why Camfranglais sees use in secondary school environments, as it is the first time that many students from different linguistic backgrounds begin to attend the same schools. Furthermore, Camfranglais is a hidden language, mainly used by speakers as a way to hide their conversations, or appear mysterious to others. As such, it has grown rapidly within the Cameroonian secondary school system, where students use it to communicate without being understood by outsiders.\n\nWhile it is classified as a pidgin language, this is inaccurate. Speakers are already fluent in either English and French, and as such it is not used in situations where both parties lack a common tongue. As a whole, Camfranglais sets itself apart from other pidgins and creoles in that it consists of an array of languages, at least one of which is already known by those speaking it. For instance, while it contains elements of borrowing, code-switching, and pidgin languages, it is not a contact language as both parties can be presumed to speak French, the lexifer. Numerous other classifications have been proposed, like ‘pidgin’, ‘argot’, ‘youth language’, a ‘sabir camerounais’, an ‘appropriation vernaculaire du français’ or a ‘hybrid slang’. However, as Camfranglais is more developed than a slang, this too is insufficient. Kießling proposes it be classified as a 'highly hybrid sociolect of the urban youth type\", a definition that Stein-Kanjora agrees with.\n\nCamfranglais has been accepted and embraced by Cameroon's urban youth population, particularly on the internet. In fact, this acceptance has created what some consider to be a 'Camfranglais Cult' among the youth. While the reasons for this are many, Stein-Kanjora posits that by choosing it over French, English, or indigenous languages, the youth are able to form a modern, urban identity, separate from the colonial and tribal connotations of older languages.\n\nCamfranglais is predominantly used by youth between the ages of 12 and 26. Additionally, although the number of female speakers is growing, the language is mainly used and developed by males, at least partially due to active exclusion of women by male speakers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is also known for her correspondence with Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht. Ahlgren was a leading person in the \"Female literary world of the 1750s and 1770s\" in Sweden. She later emigrated to Finland, where she published the first Finnish paper in the country.\n\nCatharina Ahlgren was the daughter of Anders Ahlgren, governor of Östergötland, and Laurentia Juliana Liungenfeldt. Through her sister, she was the sister-in-law of Johan Gustaf Halldin, chancellor of the Kungliga Biblioteket.\n\nAccording to V. Örnberg, she was at one point a chamber lady in the court of the queen Louisa Ulrika, but lost her position because of some kind of intrigue: \"Chamberlady at court but soon lost her position because of plotting, managed a book shop that failed. Made translations and wrote literary things.\"\n\nCatharina Ahlgren married first to Bengt Edvard Eckerman, cavalry master of the royal Scanian Husars. During her first marriage, she had the daughters Charlotte Eckerman and Julie Eckerman and the sons Bengt Gustaf and Christopher. Her first marriage was reportedly troubled by economic difficulties and her youngest son were not acknowledged by her spouse as his. The marriage ended in a divorce in 1770. She married for the second time to the book printer journeyman Anders Bark or Barck.\n\nShe moved with her second spouse to Finland, possibly in 1775, and are listed as a resident in Åbo in 1782. Also her second marriage ended in a divorce. At the death of her eldest daughter Charlotte in 1790, she was one of the beneficiaries of the will. In 1796, she settled with her youngest daughter Julie in Linköping.\n\nHer contemporary, the orientalist and writer Jonas Apelblad, listed her in his writers dictionary as a strong and gifted personality, \"[f]emina potens, sed ingenio plena\" (\"a forceful woman, but full of talent\") who did not live a more peaceful life with her second spouse then she had with her first.\n\nCatharina Ahlgren reportedly became known as a poet and translator in the 1750s literary world before she had anything formally published. She was a personal friend of the famed poet Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, and their correspondence is preserved. While her friend Nordenflycht wrote under the pseudonym \"Herdinnan i Norden\" (Shepherdess of the North), Catharina Ahlgren wrote under the name \"Herdinnan i Ahl-Lunden\" (Shepherdess of the Alder-Grove).\n\nShe was active as a translator of both poetry and novels from the English, French and German languages. Among her translations were German poem \"Die Prüfung Abrahams\" by Christoph Martin Wieland, and the English novel \"The Distressed Wife, or the history of Eliza Wyndham\".\n\nShe debuted as a poet with her French language poem \"Au jour de l'illustre naissance de sa majestee notre adourable Reine Le 24 Jullet\", dedicated to the queen, Louisa Ulrika, on the queens birthday in 1764.\n\nDuring the age of liberty in Sweden, there were many essay papers published, discussing important issues in society, notably \"Then Swänska Argus\".\nThese essay papers were often written in form of a debate or a correspondence between two anonymous signatures. Some of them also took up the topic of the role of women in society and gender equality, the earliest one being \"Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga\" by Margareta Momma in 1738-39. This presaged first-wave feminism in the English-speaking world. Many of them are believed to have female editors and journalists, but as they were customarily written under anonymous pseudonyms, most of them have not been identified. Of the few identified of them were Margareta Momma, Anna Maria Rückerschöld and Catharina Ahlgren.\n\nLiterary women were viewed as fashionable. A male editor stated during a publication of a female poet: \"As we wish for nothing higher than to encourage the knowledge among us, it cannot be anything other than pleasant that a member of the gender [women] so admirably support our intention.\"\n\nIn the correspondence-debate in her paper, she wrote 1772:\n\nLikely through her second marriage, Catharina Ahlgren acquired a printing press, which she managed for a period. Among the writers she published was works by Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht.\n\nOn 29 October 1772, Catharina Ahlgren published and edited the essay paper \"Brefwäxling emellan twänne fruntimmer, den ena i Stockholm och den andra på landet i åskillige blandade ämnen\" (Correspondence between two ladies, on in Stockholm and the other in the country, in a number of various subjects), under the signature Adelaide. This was a feminist essay publication, written in the form of a debate i letters between two female signatures, in which she argued in favor of a social conscience, democracy and gender equality, and recommended solidarity between women as a protection against male guardianship and superiority. She stated that the only way to reach true love within a relationship is to be equals, adding that as men so often want to rule over women, it is much harder to retain friendship with them than with another woman. She discussed love and friendship, upbringing and education, monarchy and religion. In February 1773, the essay was renamed \"Brefväxling emellan Adelaide och någre wittre snillen i omwäxlande ämnen\" (Correspondence between Adelaide and some literary geniuses in various subjects), and later that year \"Fortsättning af Adelaides brefwäxling, angående Fru Windhams historie\" (Adelaide's continuing correspondence, concerning the history of Mrs Windham).\nCatharina Ahlgren is also presumed to be the author of the noted essay paper \"De Nymodiga Fruntimren, eller Sophias och Bélisindes Tankespel\" (Modern Women, or the thought play of Sophia and Belisinde), which were written in the same fashion. This primarily concerned with women's education as a mean of reform in women's position: for example, criticizing the dominating French language in the customary education of females, as this was used for nothing more than reading of romantic novels, and advocated that girls should learn English instead, so they could be able to take part in the scientific literature normally only published in that language, such as history and geography.\n\nCatharina Ahlgren also played a pioneer role in Finland, where she lived in Åbo from at least 1782 onward. She is identified as the editor behind \"Om att rätt behaga\" (Of the Art to Please Properly), which was, in fact, the first paper published in Finland. \nShe discontinued \"Om konsten at rätt behaga\" officially because of health reasons. In her farewell she wrote: \"You may see, gentlemen, how much I wished to copy you.\" In 1783, she published her last paper, \"Angenäma Sjelwswåld\" (Pleasant Defyings).\n\n\n\n"}

This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter, PhD, of the Yale School of Management, and John D. Thompson, MPH, of the Yale School of Public Health. The system is also referred to as \"the DRGs\", and its intent was to identify the \"products\" that a hospital provides. One example of a \"product\" is an appendectomy. The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement, to replace \"cost based\" reimbursement that had been used up to that point. DRGs are assigned by a \"grouper\" program based on ICD (International Classification of Diseases) diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or comorbidities. DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each \"product\", since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources. DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs). DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers. \n\nThe original objective of diagnosis related groups (DRG) was to develop a classification system that identified the \"products\" that the patient received. Since the introduction of DRGs in the early 1980s, the healthcare industry has evolved and developed an increased demand for a patient classification system that can serve its original objective at a higher level of sophistication and precision. To meet those evolving needs, the objective of the DRG system had to expand in scope. Today, there are several different DRG systems that have been developed in the US. They include:\n\nThe system was created in the early 1970s by Robert Barclay Fetter and John D. Thompson at Yale University with the material support of the former Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now called the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nDRGs were first implemented in New Jersey, beginning in 1980 with a small number of hospitals partitioned into three groups according to their budget positions — surplus, breakeven, and deficit — prior to the imposition of DRG payment.\n\nThe New Jersey experiment continued for three years, with additional cadres of hospitals being added to the number of institutions each year until all hospitals in New Jersey were dealing with this prospective payment system.\n\nDRGs were designed to be homogeneous units of hospital activity to which binding prices could be attached. A central theme in the advocacy of DRGs was that this reimbursement system would, by constraining the hospitals, oblige their administrators to alter the behavior of the physicians and surgeons comprising their medical staffs. Hospitals were forced to leave the \"nearly\nrisk-free world of cost reimbursement.\" and face the uncertain financial consequences associated with the provision of health care. DRGs were designed to provide practice pattern information that administrators could use to influence individual physician behavior.\n\nDRGs were intended to describe all types of patients in an acute hospital setting. DRGs encompassed elderly patients as well as newborn, pediatric and adult populations.\n\nThe prospective payment system implemented as DRGs had been designed to limit the share of hospital revenues derived from the Medicare program budget, and in spite of doubtful results in New Jersey, it was decided in 1983 to impose DRGs on hospitals nationwide.\n\nIn that year, HCFA assumed responsibility for the maintenance and modifications of these DRG definitions. Since that time, the focus of all Medicare DRG modifications instituted by HCFA/CMS has been on problems relating primarily to the elderly population.\n\nIn 1987, New York state passed legislation instituting DRG-based payments for all non-Medicare patients. This legislation required that the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) evaluate the applicability of Medicare DRGs to a non-Medicare population. This evaluation concluded that the Medicare DRGs were not adequate for a non-Medicare population. Based on this evaluation, the NYS DOH entered into an agreement with 3M to research and develop all necessary DRG modifications. The modifications resulted in the initial APDRG, which differed from the Medicare DRG in that it provided support for transplants, high-risk obstetric care, nutritional disorders, and pediatrics along with support for other populations. One challenge in working with the APDRG groupers is that there is no set of common data/formulas that is shared across all states as there is with CMS. Each state maintains its own information.\n\nIn 1991, the top 10 DRGs overall were: normal newborn, vaginal delivery, heart failure, psychoses, cesarean section, neonate with significant problems, angina pectoris, specific cerebrovascular disorders, pneumonia, and hip/knee replacement. These DRGs comprised nearly 30 percent of all hospital discharges.\n\nThe history, design, and classification rules of the DRG system, as well as its application to patient discharge data and updating procedures, are presented in the CMS \"DRG Definitions Manual\" (Also known as the \"Medicare DRG Definitions Manual\" and the \"Grouper Manual\"). A new version generally appears every October. The 20.0 version appeared in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, author Rick Mayes described DRGs as:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "514444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=514444", "title": "Epithet", "text": "Epithet\n\nAn epithet (from \"epitheton\", neuter of \"epithetos\", \"attributed, added\") is a byname, or a descriptive term (word or phrase), accompanying or occurring in place of a name and having entered common usage. It has various shades of meaning when applied to seemingly real or fictitious people, divinities, objects, and binomial nomenclature. It can also be a descriptive title: for example, Pallas Athena, Alfred the Great, Suleiman the Magnificent or Władysław I the Elbow-high.\n\nIn contemporary use, \"epithet\" often refers to an abusive, defamatory, or derogatory phrase, such as a racial or animal epithet. This use as a euphemism is criticized by Martin Manser and other proponents of linguistic prescription.\n\nEpithets are sometimes attached to a person's name or appear in place of his or her name, as what might be described as a glorified nickname or sobriquet. An epithet is linked to its noun by long-established usage. Not every adjective is an epithet. An epithet is especially recognizable when its function is largely decorative, such as if \"cloud-gathering Zeus\" is employed other than in reference to conjuring up a storm. \"The epithets are decorative insofar as they are neither essential to the immediate context nor modeled especially for it. Among other things, they are extremely helpful to fill out a half-verse\", Walter Burkert has noted.\n\nSome epithets are known by the Latin term \"epitheton necessarium\" because they are required to distinguish the bearers, e.g. as an alternative to numbers after a prince's name—such as Richard the Lionheart (Richard I of England), or Charles the Fat alongside Charles the Bald. The same epithet can be used repeatedly joined to different names, e.g. Alexander the Great as well as Constantine the Great.\n\nOther epithets can easily be omitted without serious risk of confusion, and are therefore known (again in Latin) as \"epitheton ornans\". Thus the classical Roman author Virgil systematically called his main hero \"pius Aeneas\", the epithet being \"pius\", which means religiously observant, humble and wholesome, as well as calling the armsbearer of Aeneas \"fidus Achates\", the epithet being \"fidus\", which means faithful or loyal.\n\nThere are also specific types of epithets, such as the \"kenning\" which appears in works such as \"Beowulf\". An example of a kenning would be using the term \"whale-road\" instead of the word \"sea\".\n\nEpithets are characteristic of the style of ancient epic poetry, notably in that of Homer or the northern European sagas (see above, as well as \"Epithets in Homer\"). When James Joyce uses the phrase \"the snot-green sea\" he is playing on Homer's familiar epithet \"the wine-dark sea\". The phrase \"Discreet Telemachus\" is also considered an epithet.\n\nThe Greek term antonomasia, in rhetoric, means substituting any epithet or phrase for a proper name, as \"Pelides\", signifying the \"son of Peleus\", to identify Achilles. An opposite substitution of a proper name for some generic term is also sometimes called \"antonomasia\", as a Cicero for an orator. The use of a father's name or ancestor's name, such as \"Pelides\" in the case of Achilles, or \"Saturnia\" in the case of the goddess Juno in Vergil's \"Aeneid\", is specifically called a patronymic device and is in its own class of epithet.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\", epithets are used in the prologue, used in \"star-cross'd lovers\" and \"death-mark'd love.\"\n\nEpithets were in layman's terms glorified nicknames that could be used to represent one's style, artistic nature, or even geographical reference. They originated to simply serve the purpose of dealing with names that were hard to pronounce or just unpleasant. It from there went to something that could be very significant assigned by elders or counterparts to represent one's position in the community or it could be a representation of whomever one wanted to be or thought he was. The elegance of this movement was used throughout history and even modern day with many examples ranging from \"Aphrodite the Heavenly & Zeus the Protector of Guests\" all the way to \"Johnny Football & King James\".\n\nAmerican comic books tend to give epithets to superheroes, such as The Phantom being \"The Ghost Who Walks\", Superman called \"The Man of Steel\", and \"The Dynamic Duo\" Batman and Robin, who are individually known as \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Boy Wonder\".\n\nAdditionally, epíteto, the Spanish version of epithet, is commonly used throughout poems in Castilian literature.\n\nIn many polytheistic religions, such as those of ancient Greece and Rome, a deity's epithets generally reflected a particular aspect of that god's essence and role, for which his influence may be obtained for a specific occasion: Apollo \"Musagetes\" is \"Apollo, [as] leader of the Muses\" and therefore patron of the arts and sciences while \"Phoibos\" Apollo is the same deity, but as shining sun-god. \"Athena protects the city as \"polias\", oversees handicrafts as \"ergane\", joins battle as \"promachos\" and grants victory as \"nike\".\"\n\nAlternatively the epithet may identify a particular and \"localized\" aspect of the god, such as a reference to the mythological place of birth or numinous presence at a specific sanctuary: sacrifice might be offered on one and the same occasion to Pythian Apollo (\"Apollo Pythios\") and Delphic Apollo (\"Apollo Delphinios\"). A localizing epithet refers simply to a particular center of veneration and the cultic tradition there, as the god manifested at a particular festival, for example: Zeus Olympios, Zeus as present at Olympia, or Apollo Karneios, Apollo at the Spartan Carneian festival.\n\nOften the epithet is the result of fusion of the Olympian divinity with an older one: Poseidon Erechtheus, Artemis Orthia, reflect intercultural equations of a divinity with an older one, that is generally considered its pendant; thus most Roman gods and goddesses, especially the Twelve Olympians, had traditional counterparts in Greek, Etruscan, and most other Mediterranean pantheons, such as Jupiter as head of the Olympian Gods with Zeus, but in specific cults there may be a different equation, based on one specific aspect of the divinity. Thus the Greek word \"Trismegistos\": \"thrice grand\" was first used as a Greek name for the Egyptian god of science and invention, Thoth, and later as an \"epitheton\" for the Greek Hermes and, finally, the fully equated Roman Mercurius Mercury (both were messenger of the gods). Among the Greeks, T. H. Price notes the nurturing power of \"Kourotrophos\" might be invoked in sacrifices and recorded in inscription, without specifically identifying Hera or Demeter.\n\nSome epithets were applied to several deities of a same pantheon rather accidentally if they had a common characteristic, or deliberately, emphasizing their blood- or other ties; thus in pagan Rome, several divinities gods, and heroes were given the \"epitheton\" \"Comes\" as companion of another (usually major) divinity. An epithet can even be meant for collective use, e.g. in Latin \"pilleati\" 'the felt hat-wearers' for the brothers Castor and Pollux. Some epithets resist explanation.\n\nCatholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and other Christians practice the use of epithets in the veneration of Jesus (e.g., \"Christ\"; \"Prince of Peace\"; \"The Good Shepherd\"), of Mary, Mother of Jesus (e.g. \"Mother of God\"; \"Panagia\"), and of the saints (e.g. \"Pope Saint John Paul the Great\"). \"Our Lady of Lourdes\" is essentially periphrasis, except where some aspect of the Virgin is invoked.\n\nAn epithet is an adjective or adjectival phrase that characterizes a place, a thing, or a person that helps make the characteristics of this thing more prominent. These descriptive phrases can be used in a positive or negative way that benefits the orator. \"It will generally happen, that the Epithets employed by a skillful orator, will be found to be, in fact, so many abridged arguments, the force of which is sufficiently conveyed by a mere hint; e.g. if any one says, 'We ought to take warning from the bloody revolution of France,' the Epithet suggests one of the reasons for our being warned; and that, not less clearly, and more forcibly, than if the argument had been stated at length.\" With persuasion being a key component of rhetoric, it is rational to use epithets. The use of persuasive wording gives leverage to one's arguments. Knowledge along with descriptive words or phrases can be a powerful tool. This is supported in Bryan Short's article when he states, \"The New Rhetoric derives its empiricist flavor from a pervasive respect for clarity and directness of language.\" Rhetors use epithets to direct their audience to see their point of view, using verbal forms of imagery as a persuasive tactic.\n\nOrators have a variety of epithets that they can employ that have different meanings. The most common are fixed epithets and transferred epithets. A fixed epithet is the repetitive use of the same word or phrase for the same person or object. A transferred epithet qualifies a noun other than the person or thing it is describing. This is also known as a hypallage. This can often involves shifting a modifier from the animate to the inanimate; for example, \"cheerful money\"and \"suicidal sky\".\n\nOrators take special care when using epithets as to not use them as smear words. Orators could be accused of racial or abusive epithets if used incorrectly. American journalist William Safire discussed the use of the word in a 2008 column in \"The New York Times\": \"'I am working on a piece about nationalism with a focus on epithet as a smear word,' writes David Binder, my longtime Times colleague, 'which was still a synonym for 'delineation' or 'characterization' in my big 1942 Webster’s but now seems to be almost exclusively a synonym for ‘derogation’ or ‘smear word.’ . . . In the past century, [epithet] blossomed as 'a word of abuse,' today gleefully seized upon to describe political smears.\"\n\nIn historical, journalistic, and other writings, epithets often carry a political message. These differ from official titles as they express no legal status; however, they may confer prestige, especially if bestowed by an authority or legislature, and may be used for propaganda purposes. Examples of such epithets are the various traditions of victory titles awarded to generals and rulers or to entire military units, such as the adjective 'Fidelis' ('loyal') bestowed on various Roman legions.\n\n"}

Gridlock can occur when two legislative houses, or the executive branch and the legislature are controlled by different political parties, or otherwise cannot agree.\n\nGeorge Brown, John A Macdonald, George Etienne Cartier, Francis Hinks, Robert Baldwin says in United States politics, gridlock frequently refers to occasions when the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate are controlled by different parties, or by a different party than the party of the President. Gridlock may also occur within the Senate, when no party has a filibuster-proof majority.\n\n\"Political Gridlock\" by author Ned Witting identifies many of the causes of gridlock in the United States and outlines ways to get government working again.\n\nLaw professors such as Sanford Levinson and Adrian, as well as political commentators such as Matthew Yglesias, have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enVerme, as well as political commentators such as Debbie Parks, have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enabling situations of legislative gridlock. Along these lines, David Brady, a professor of Political Science at Stanford University, and Craig Volden, a professor of Public Policy and Politics at the University of Virginia, explain gridlock by pointing to two interrelated factors: first, \"the preferences of members of Congress regarding particular policies\" and second, \"supermajority institutions - the Senate filibuster and the presidential veto\". As a result, they argue, gridlock is not determined by party control of the government, but rather by an interplay between the existing policy and the spectrum of individual preferences held by congressional representatives. They maintain, in essence, that \"the policy preferences of Members of Congress at or near the median are among the crucial determinants of policy outcomes.\"\n\nMarcus Ethridge, an emeritus professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, argues in a 2011 policy analysis published by the libertarian Cato Institute that the US Constitution was designed to foster gridlock in order to increase \"the likelihood that policies will reflect broad, unorganized interests instead of the interests of narrow, organized groups.\" Ethridge presented an extended version of his analysis in \"The Case for Gridlock: Democracy, Organized Power, and the Legal Foundations of American Government\" (2010), which argues that \"progressive reformers sought to shift the power to shape policy from the legislative branch to the executive bureaucracy\" in an attempt to limit the power of special interests, but that this strategy backfired because of \"the ability of interest groups to infiltrate the bureaucracy and promote their interests, often in ways diametrically opposed to the reformers' intentions\" and \"the capacity of Congress to overcome the influence of groups and generate policy change.\" In order to counter this, Ethridge suggests a \"return to the 'constitutional principle' of gridlock, in which special interests must compete in a legislative forum\".\n\nIn parliamentary systems based on the Westminster system, parliamentary deadlocks may arise when an election results in neither or none of the major political parties having the numbers in the lower house (the house where the government is formed) to form a government, or when the votes in a lower house of parliament are so close that a government cannot be sure of getting its legislation passed through the house, or when another party (usually referred to as the opposition party) controls a majority of votes in the upper house. \n\nA recent innovation has been to remove the power of the upper house to block supply, as well as some other bills.\n\nThe Australian Constitution provides a mechanism for breaking a deadlock between the two houses of Parliament, by means of a double dissolution and, if the deadlock is still not resolved, by a joint sitting of both houses of parliament.\n"}

Through various workshops, seminars, events and programs, GrubStreet supports writers at all stages of development. According to GrubStreet's website, its mission is \"to be an innovative, rigorous, and welcoming community for writers who together create their best work, find audience, and elevate the literary arts for all.\" Since it was founded, 53 instructors and 22 students have successfully published their books. Among those include \"New York Times\" bestselling author Jenna Blum. GrubStreet is considered to be center of literary life in Boston.\n\nGrubStreet was founded in 1997 in Boston, Massachusetts. Founder Eve Bridburg opened GrubStreet as a place for anyone interested in creative writing to gain instruction and guidance. At first, GrubStreet only offered fiction workshops, had two instructors (Bridburg one of them) and eight students. GrubStreet demonstrated early success when, a year later in 1998, HarperCollins published student Jamie Katz's mystery novel \"Dead Low Tide\". By 2001 GrubStreet had nearly 100 students, more than a dozen instructors, and courses in poetry, screenwriting, nonfiction, and playwriting. GrubStreet became a fully accredited nonprofit in 2002.\n\nSince then, GrubStreet has taught over 10,000 Boston-area writers of all levels and has put over $1 million into the pockets of writers. It has a fully staffed office overlooking Boston Common in downtown Boston and operates on an annual budget of $800,000, funded by grants, donations, and membership dues. New books affiliated with GrubStreet include: Jenna Blum's \"The Stormchasers\"; Jonathan Papernick's \"There is No Other\"; Lynne Griffin's \"Sea Escape\"; Michelle Hoover's \"The Quickening;\" Marianne Leone's \"Knowing Jesse\"; Bruce Machart's \"The Wake of Forgiveness\"; Randy Susan Meyers's \"The Murderer's Daughters\" and \"The Comfort Of Lies\"; Amy MacKinnon's \"Tethered\"; Lisa Genova's \"Still Alice\"; and Daphne Kalotay's \"Russian Winter\", Nichole Bernier's \"The Unfinished Work of Elizabeth D\", Julie Wu's forthcoming \"The Third Son\" and Henriette Power Lazaridis' forthcoming \"Clean Monday\".\n\nGrubStreet does not offer any writing degrees. Rather, it provides writing instruction that is comparable to an MFA program. The pedagogy is, in effect, to offer classes in both the \"muse\" (inspiration) and \"marketplace\" (how to get published). The writing workshops --- courses in poetry, fiction, essay, narrative nonfiction, as well as screen and playwriting --- are run like traditional writing workshops, with weekly group critiques of student work, led by the instructor. Classes in the \"Writing Life\" (time management, blogging, writer's block, etc.) and publishing and promotion (such as classes on submitting to agents or planning book tours) help writers address the marketplace aspects of their writing careers. Courses can be one-night seminars, weekend workshops, or 6- or 10-week-long workshops.\n\nGrubStreet classes are open to all, however the membership provides discounts and benefits. Members, called “Grubbies,” are given discounts on courses, as well as benefit from discounts at all Boston independent bookstores. Further benefits include discounts on theatre tickets, magazine subscriptions, free access to the GrubStreet space and library.\n\nGrubStreet’s signature event, The Muse and the Marketplace, is a three-day, weekend-long writer’s symposium. It is known for attracting acclaimed authors, agents, and editors to its programs. Hugely successful, the Boston Globe calls it the “highlight of the Boston literary scene”. It is attended by over 900 writers and publishing professionals.\n\nOver the three days, prominent authors lead craft seminars, while agents, editors, and publicists lead sessions on the business aspects of writing. There is also a Manuscript Mart, where writers meet one-on-one with an agent or editor for personalized feedback. Various seminars, lectures, and panels about creative writing and the business of writing are held.\n\nMany bestselling authors and renowned agents and editors have been involved with GrubStreet’s Muse and the Marketplace. In 2010, Chuck Palahniuk was the keynote speaker. Other people of note include: Steve Almond, Jessica Shattuck, Jeanne Leiby, Richard Abate, Elyse Cheney, Lynne Barrett, Martha Southgate, Christina Thompson, Jenni Ferrari-Alder, Lisa Grubka, Maud Casey, Ben Percy, Miriam Altshuler, PJ Mark, Vestal McIntyre, Michael Downing, Joseph Olsham, Elizabeth Evans, Tim Bartlett, Susan Tiberghien, Lauren Grodstein, Leslea Newman, Reagan Arthur, Regina Brooks, Joanna Volpe, Ann Hood, Allison Winn Scotch, Christine Pride, Stephany Evans, Mitchell Waters, Jennifer 8.

The joint effort aims at teaching and encouraging the elderly to use writing as a creative outlet as well as document and preserve their stories for future generations. Neighborhoods involved include: Chinatown, Charlestown, East Boston, Mattapan, Roxbury, South Boston, and the North End. Two anthologies of collected works have been published: \"Born Before Plastic\" and “My Legacy Is Simply This: Stories From Boston’s Most Endearing Neighborhoods.” Another anthology is to be published.\n\nGrubStreet’s Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP) offers free writing workshops for all Boston-area teenagers. The program consists of monthly, 4-hour workshops during a Saturday at the downtown offices. Workshops range from poetry and fiction to graphic novel and are taught by Grub Street instructors. YAWP has been recognized as the hub for creative writing teenagers in the Boston area.\n\nGrubStreet runs the YAWP Teen Writing Fellowship, an intensive three-week creative writing program during the summer. Accepted teens are immersed in the writers’ life of craft and publishing: they work with published authors, meet with agents and editors, and receive a stipend for their commitment. GrubStreet aims to mimic writers’ residencies, thus the YAWP Fellowship is by application only. About 20 students are accepted each summer.\n\nThe GrubStreet Book Prize is awarded three times a year to a writer publishing his/her second or beyond. As the goal of the prize is to bring writers to Boston, only writers whose primary residence is not Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, or Rhode Island are eligible. Though merit is the most important criterion, authors publishing with small presses, writers of short stories, and writers of color are encouraged to apply. \nWinners of the Book Prize each receive $1000, as well as a book party at GrubStreet’s downtown location and co-sponsored by an independent bookstore. Winners will also lead a seminar of his or her choice, with accommodations, travel, and board provided for by GrubStreet. Fiction and non-fiction winners are invited as guest authors to the next Muse and the Marketplace.\n\nPrevious Book Prize winners include:\n\n\n\n\n\nWriters associated with Grub Street (former or current instructors, or those on the board) include: Steve Almond, Arthur Golden, Margot Livesey, Sue Miller, Susan Orlean, Tom Perrotta, Michelle Hoover and Ethan Gilsdorf.\n\n"}

{"id": "72712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72712", "title": "Iconicity", "text": "Iconicity\n\nIn functional-cognitive linguistics, as well as in semiotics, iconicity is the conceived similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to arbitrariness.\n\nIconic principles:\n\nThe use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as \"\". It is also common to use reduplication to iconically mark increase, as Edward Sapir is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978). This can be seen, for example, in Amharic, where ' means \"it was broken\" and ' means that \"it was shattered\".\n\nIconic coding principles may be natural tendencies in language and are also part of our cognitive and biological make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, Haspelmath has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material.\n\nOnomatopoeia (and mimesis more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness.\n\nDerek Bickerton has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. Animal communication systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of indexical (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, \"most words are symbolic, and ... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language\". The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of displacement, with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, \"may or may not have it depending on how they’re used ... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language\".\n\nUsing a niche-construction view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead megafauna. This process \"would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence—even from fitness\", and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language.\n\nIn \"The Symbolic Species\", Terrence Deacon argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. \"The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought—symbolic representation.\"\n\nIconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition.) Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered language, or language-like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment (ideophones) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other mammals produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive chimpanzees have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling \"et al.\" states: \"Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named Kanzi, described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by \"extending his hand\". Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. Bee dances are another example of iconicity in animal communication systems.\n\nIconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of gesture. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to onomatopoeia). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary. More recently, as sign language researchers gain confidence (and the fear of losing linguistic status subsidies), the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers.\n\nIconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of sign languages called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In American Sign language (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting “intensity” is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD. The ASL marker for \"intensity\" is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion).\n\nLike in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes \"contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation\". For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU + YOU + YOU + ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between.\n\nIconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes, though, the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem's content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is E. E. Cummings. A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings's grasshopper poem (\"r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r\") the word \"arriving\" begins on the far right of the poem with the \"a\", the \"r\" is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to \"arrive\". The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems \"The Fish\" and \"The Moose\" by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read \"The Fish\" coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in \"The Moose\" coincides with the poem's long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose.\n\nIconicity occurs in rejective phono-semantic matching. \"Consider Lithuanian Ashkenazic Hebrew רע דם \"ra dom\" (cf. Yiddish \"ra dam\"), lit. 'of bad blood' (from Hebrew רע דם \"ra` dam\" 'of bad blood'). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of Polish \"Radom\", the name of a town in Poland (approximately south of Warsaw), or of its Yiddish adaptation \"ródem\" (see Uriel Weinreich 1955: 609, Paul Wexler 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by \"ra dam\" ‘of bad blood’. Obviously, providing such an etymythological explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of \"ra dam\" as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine \"Ursprache\".\"\n\nIt has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being “Horizontal-Iconicity” and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal-Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in Egyptian mer, which means right hand and rem, which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more Mnemonic tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.\n\nVowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as , , and ; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as , , and . Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods.\n\nA test run by Sapir asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as \"mal\" and \"mil\". He discovered a word containing was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing . Nuckolls states: \"Newman discovered that ... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker\". Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that sounds were judged larger or lower than sounds.\n\nIn morphology, examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of phonemes. Jakobson cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure.\n\nOver a seven-year span, Marc Davis, Brian Williams, and Golan Levin have managed to develop their own iconic visual language. The creation of their program called Media Streams was derived from a need and a desire to have a universal language when creating videos. Media accessibility is becoming easier to obtain by the day, and with this growth new development in the field is bound to happen.\n\nMedia production was once limited to an elite group of individuals who spent a large portion of their time taking courses and specializing in the art. Now with the technological advancements and internet use of today, much of the skill can be learned out of your own home. As Marc Davis would say, just as the printing press was given to the users via Desktop Publishing, media production can now, also, be given to these same users. Streaming media is vastly growing and the manipulation and reconstruction of this hot trend is more than needed and necessary to keep the diversity coming.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1997, Marc Davis and his colleagues worked out of the Machine Understanding Group of the MIT Laboratory and the Interval Research Corporation to create their media streams program.\n\nMedia Streams \"s a system for annotating, retrieving, repurposing, and automatically assembling digital video\". (Davis; Media Streams) The system uses a stream based, semantic representation of video content with an iconic visual language interface of hierarchically structured and searchable primitives.\n\nThe goal of this system is to address the problems of annotation convergence and human-computer communication. Developing the iconic visual language was necessary to assist the computational reading and writing of representational consensual interpretations of video content in a standardized way. Illiterate, diverse languages and the like will all be able to work with this system due to its universal language.\n\n"}

Born in Scotland and raised in Germany, Mackay was the author of \"Die Anarchisten\" (The Anarchists, 1891) and \"Der Freiheitsucher\" (The Searcher for Freedom, 1921). Mackay was published in the United States in his friend Benjamin Tucker's magazine, \"Liberty\". He was a noted homosexual.\n\nMackay was born in Greenock on February 6, 1864. His mother came from a prosperous Hamburg family. His father was a Scottish marine insurance broker who died when the child was less than two years old, at which point mother and son returned to Germany, where Mackay grew up.\n\nMackay lived in Berlin from 1896 onwards, and became a friend of scientist and Gemeinschaft der Eigenen co-founder Benedict Friedlaender.\n\nMackay died in Stahnsdorf on 16 May 1933, ten days after the Nazi book burnings at the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. Adolf Hitler had become Reichskanzler on 30 January 1933, and soon all activities of the German homosexual emancipation movement ceased. Allegations that Mackay's death may have been a suicide have been disputed:\nUsing the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled \"Die Bücher der namenlosen Liebe\" (\"Books of the Nameless Love\"). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the \"Fenny Skaller\", a story of a pederast. Under his real name he also published fiction, such as \"Der Schwimmer\" (1901) and, again as Sagitta, he published a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, \"Der Puppenjunge\" (literally \"The Boy-Doll\", but published in English as \"The Hustler\") (1926). In a note to the American publisher of this book, Christopher Isherwood said, \"It gives a picture of the Berlin sexual underworld early in this century which I know, from my own experience, to be authentic.\"\n\nRichard Strauss's well-known songs from his \"Vier Lieder\" (Op. 27), a wedding gift to his wife in 1894, include settings to music of two of Mackay's poems: \"Morgen!\" and \"Heimliche Aufforderung\". Other uses of Mackay's poems by Strauss include \"Verführung\" (Op. 33 No. 1) and \"In der Campagna\" (Op. 41 No. 2).\n\nArnold Schoenberg set music to his poem \"Am Wegrand.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Survey was first proposed by George Abraham Grierson, a member of the Indian Civil Service and a linguist who attended the Seventh International Oriental Congress held at Vienna in September 1886. He made a proposal of the linguistic survey and it was initially turned down by the Government of India. After persisting and demonstrating that it could be done using the existing network of government officials at a reasonable cost, it was approved in 1891. It was however formally begun only in 1894 and the survey continued for thirty years with the last of the results being published in 1928.\n\nAn on-line searchable database of the LSI is available, providing an excerpt for each word as it appeared in Grierson's original publication. In addition, the British Library has gramophone recordings in its sound archive which document the phonology.\n\nGrierson made use of Government officers to collect data from across India. He made forms and guidance material for the officers who gathered the information. There were numerous problems in ensuring uniformity of data gathering and clarity of understanding. One officer noted the difficulty even of noting the name of the language from a household. Interviewees would name their language after their caste.\n\nThe maps and boundaries indicated by Grierson have often been used by political groups seeking reorganizations of state boundaries.\n\nThe list of volumes published by Grierson from 1898 to 1928 are:\n\nA second Linguistic Survey of India project was initiated by the Language Division of Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner of India in 1984. This project is ongoing and at the end of year 2010 approximately 40% of the survey has been completed. This survey has a limited objective to trace the changes in the linguistic scenario after Grierson’s study. Several professional linguists have criticized the project for repeating Grierson's methodological mistakes – like choosing local language teachers or government officials as informants rather than laypersons for collecting the linguistic data.\n\nThe 1991 census of India found 1,576 \"mother tongues\" with separate grammatical structures and 1,796 languages classified as \"other mother tongues\". Calls for a more complete and exact Linguistic Survey of India soon followed. It was noted that Grierson's works had relied on untrained field workers and neglected the former province of Burma, Madras and the then princely States of Hyderabad and Mysore. The result was that South India was under-represented in the LSI.\n\nThe Government of India announced an ambitious project to expand and revise the Linguistic Survey of India. In the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–12) Rs. 2.8 billion was sanctioned for the project. It was classified into two sections: a New Linguistic Survey of India and a Survey of Minor and Endangered Languages. Under the auspices of the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysore, and under the direction of Udaya Narayana Singh, the project was expected to involve over 54 universities, 2,000 investigators and 10,000 linguists and language specialists working over a period of ten years.\n\nAn April 2010 article in the online Times of India mentions that the above project has been abandoned but then announces a new initiative following up on the original Grierson survey: the People's Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI) under the auspices of an NGO called the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, and with Ganesh N. Devy as Chairperson. The project will begin with a survey of Himalayan languages.

Historically, some local posts have been operated by governments, while others, known as private local posts have been for-profit companies. Today, many stamp collectors operate hobbyists' local posts, issuing their own postal \"stamps\" for other collectors but rarely carrying any mail.\n\nGovernment local posts go back to at least 1680, when the Penny Post was established in London to handle intra-city mail delivery at a uniform rate of one penny.\n\nFrom 1840 onwards, when postage stamps were first introduced, special stamps were often issued; for instance the cantons of Switzerland issued stamps for use within a canton, and inscribed them \"Poste-Local\" or \"Orts-Post\". The Russian province of Wenden issued stamps for a local post from 1862 to 1901, while Nicaragua issued stamps for Zelaya only, due to its use of a different currency.\n\nIn rural Russia Zemstvo Post handled local mail independently of the central government; some of these lasted until the 1917 revolution.\n\nMany countries have had private local posts at one time or another. Usually these operated with the acquiescence of the government, and at other time in competition. Types of local posts included intra-city systems, transcontinental delivery (such as the Pony Express), and riverboat routes. Many of these existed for only short periods, and little is known of their operations. Some of their stamps are among the great rarities of philately.\n\nIn 1865 the local post distribution company \"Liannos et Cie\" was established in Constantinople to distribute mail arriving in the city which was not addressed in Arabic as the staff of the Ottoman Postal Service were unable to read the Latin alphabet. The stamps were printed by Perkins Bacon from plates that are now held in the museum of the Royal Philatelic Society London. In 1866 a second service was set up on behalf of the Egyptian post office operating in the city to solve the same problem. Both services were short lived.\n\nIn 2013, \"Welly Post\" was established as a private carrier of local mail by EJ Teare Newsagents in Wellington, Somerset, United Kingdom. Local delivery was limited to the village of Wellington and 2 1/2 miles outside the village. The service was established after customers complained about the high price of postage.\n\nPrivate local posts typically issue their own stamps, which can become collectors' items. These stamps are typically cancelled with special cancellations, and their first day of issue can be thus commemorated.\n\nIn 1844, Lysander Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, competing with the legal monopoly of the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service (USPS), in violation of the Private Express Statutes. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.\n\nAn example of a private modern day local post currently in operation is Hawai'i Post.\n\nIn 1968, Thomas M. Murray (1927–2003) founded the Independent Postal System of America (IPSA) as a nationwide commercial carrier of Third and Fourth Class Mail, in direct competition with the United States Post Office (USPO), now the United States Postal Service (USPS). But in 1971, when the company entered the First Class delivery business, they endured a number of lawsuits brought against them, which finally led to the company's collapse in the mid-1970s. The company issued a number of stamps during the years of its operation, including commemoratives for Lyndon B. Johnson, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Charles Lindbergh before the USPS did.\n\nRattlesnake Island is an island located on Lake Erie near Put-In-Bay, northeast of Port Clinton, Ohio, and has the only USPS-sanctioned local post operating in the United States. For many years, service was provided by way of a Ford Trimotor which shuttled mail between the island and the mainland. From 1966 to 1989, USPS mail was routed by way of Port Clinton, Ohio. Today, outgoing mail from the island enters the USPS mail stream by way of Sandusky, Ohio. Local Post service began in 1966 and continued through 1989, when the island was sold and the new owners discontinued the service. It was restarted in 2005 and continues to the current day.\n\nToday's Local Posters issue their local post \"stamps\", and issue a variety of commemorative \"stamps\" covering a wide range of events or personal interests, of subjects that are not normally issued by their own countries' postal services.\n\nIn some cases these modern day local posts have issued stamp subjects before their own country issued the same subject. The Free State Local Post issued an Audie Murphy stamp long before the U.S. Postal Service issued one of the same subject. The Ascension AAF Local Post, \nlocated on the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean, in 1972 commemorated the anniversary of the first aircraft to land at Ascension Island. This same subject was commemorated by the Ascension Island postal system in 1982.\n\nThis sort of local post is effectively a \"home-brewed\" postal system, and the typical hobbyist carries little, if any, mail (though some do carry mail over a short distance for themselves or a few people).\n\nThe Local Post Collectors' Society established in 1972, coordinates communication among local posters. The LPCS issues a regular Bulletin \"The Poster\" to its members around the world, relating stories of local posts, showing new issues and other related items.\n\n\n"}

The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.\n\nThe game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of \"Mad Libs\" books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958..\n\nMad Libs was invented in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. Stern and Price co-created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when Stern and Price were eating eggs Benedict at a restaurant in New York City. While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor. According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to \"ad-lib\" an upcoming interview. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be \"mad\". Stern and Price used that eavesdropped conversation to finally create the name \"Mad Libs\". The duo released the first \"Mad Libs\" book themselves in 1958. The first \"Mad Libs\" resembled the earlier games of consequences and exquisite corpse.\n\nStern was head writer and comedy director for \"The Steve Allen Show\", and suggested to the show's host that guests be introduced using Mad Libs completed by the audience. Four days after an episode introduced \"our guest NOUN, Bob Hope\", bookstores sold out of \"Mad Libs\" books.\n\nStern and Price next partnered with Larry Sloan, a high school friend who was working as a publicist at the time, to continue publishing \"Mad Libs\". Together, the three founded the publishing firm Price Stern Sloan in the early 1960s as a way to release \"Mad Libs\". In addition to releasing more than 70 editions of \"Mad Libs\" under Sloan, the company also published 150 softcover books, including such notable titles as \"How to Be a Jewish Mother\", first released in 1964; \"Droodles\", which was also created by Roger Price; \"The VIP Desk Diary\"; and the series, \"World's Worst Jokes\".\n\nPrice died in 1990, and three years later, Sloan and Stern sold Price Stern Sloan, including \"Mad Libs\", to the former Putnam Berkley Group, which is now known as Penguin Random House. \"Mad Libs\" books are still published by Price Stern Sloan, a division of the Penguin Random House. Stern died at age 88 on June 7, 2011, and Sloan died on October 14, 2012.\n\nMore than 110 million copies of \"Mad Libs\" have been sold since the game series was first published in 1958.\n\nMad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as \"noun\", \"verb\", \"place\", or \"part of the body\". One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical.\n\nStern and Price's original Mad Libs book gives the following sentence as an example:\n\nAfter completion, they demonstrate that the sentence might read:\n\n\nA game show called \"Mad Libs\", with some connections to the game, aired on the Disney Channel in 1998 and 1999.\n\nSeveral imitations of Mad Libs have been created, most of them on the Internet. Imitation Mad Libs are sometimes used in educational settings to help teach the parts of speech.\n\nLooney Labs released \"Mad Libs: The Game\", a card game, in 2016.\n\n\n"}

She was the writer of the political essay \"Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga\", and the editor of the \"Stockholm Gazette\". Chronologically, she may be counted as the first female journalist in Sweden.\n\nMargareta Momma was born in the Netherlands, possibly as a descendant of French Huguenots.\n\nIn 1735, she married the Swedish publisher Peter Momma (d. 1772), himself of a Swedish family of Dutch origin, and settled in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. She was the mother of Petter (1738-1758), Wilhelm (1740-1772) and Elsa Fougt. Peter Momma was the publisher and editor of popular papers such as the \"Stockholm Gazette\" (1742) and the \"Stockholms Weckoblad\" (1745), and she played an active part in his business. \n\nMomma was identified as the author behind the French language essay paper \"Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga\" (English: 'Conversation between the Shadow of Argus and the unfamiliar Shadow of a Female'), or popularly \"Samtal\" (Conversation), which has become her most known work. As a female journalist, she was rare in Europe and possibly the first identifiable one in Sweden. The essay aroused great attention in contemporary Sweden, but the author was anonymous and unknown during her own lifetime. \nThe essay was published in ten issues in connection with the Riksdag of 1738-1739. Essay papers was a new form of media in contemporary Europe, and hers was among the first to introduce this media form in Sweden. The paper was contemporary to similar publications in Sweden such as \"Skuggan Af den döda Argus\" (The Death Shadow of Argus), \"Samtal, I The Dödas Rijke, Emellan Den Sedo-Lärande Mercurius\" (Conversation, In the Kingdom of the Dead, With the Instructive Mercurius) and \"Den Swänska Argus\", and was likely inspired by them.\n\n\"Samtal\" discussed foreign policy, social policy, morality, and independence and subjects of the age of enlightenment. The essay numbers were written in the form of a fictive argumentative conversation - hence the name of the paper - between two fictions figures, the male \"Argi skugga\" (Shadow of Argi) and the female \"Fruentimbers skugga\" (Shadow of a Female), of various topics. Other characters sometimes participate in the conversation, such as \"Muselmanen\" (The Moslem) and \"Philosophen\" (The Philosopher). Criticism against the Catholic church within the subject of enlightenment, until then uncommon in Sweden but common in the Netherlands, was often presented. In the conversations, the essay promoted freedom of speech, freedom of religion, advocated to translate knowledge to the Swedish language to make it available to more people rather than to restrict most such literature to foreign languages in the universities, and stated that women should also been given higher education and participate in public debate. In it, she satirizes the letters from some readers who criticize the thought of a woman discussing philosophy. Affected strongly by the continental ideas of enlightenment, it was regarded as radical and progressive and came in conflict with the contemporary censorship laws. It was not banned by the censorship, but discontinued for unknown causes after ten issues in 1739, despite having planned further issues. \n\nDuring the 18th-century Age of Liberty and the Gustavian Age, there were several publications in Sweden written by and for women which, except for the more common topics of the Age of Enlightenment, discussed and questioned the rights and status of women in society, often written in the form of essays, letters and fictions conversations, of which the publication of Margareta Momma was arguably the first. Most of the female journalists and writers in 18th-century Sweden wrote under pseudonym (normally a French name), and therefore, they have seldom been identified: also in this aspect, Momma is one of the first identified female journalists in Sweden. \n\nMomma is also identified as the editor behind the French language edition of the \"Stockholm Gazette\", which she published between 1742 and 1752. \nIn 1772, she died along with her spouse and her remaining son, and the family business was inherited by her daughter Elsa Fought.\n\nThe award \"Mommapriset - Årets Utgivare\" ('Momma Award - The Publisher of the Year') is named after Margareta Momma. \n\n\n"}

It is closely related to other varieties of Caribbean Spanish.\n\nThe variations among different speaker groups of the same language can be lexical (vocabulary), phonological (pronunciation), morphological (word forms), or in the use of syntax (grammar).\n\nHistorically, Panama and Colombia were part of the same political entity. Colombia, governed from the Real Audiencia of Panama during the 16th century, then part of Castilla de Oro, with its capital in Panama, during the 17th century, and after independence from Spain, Panama voluntarily became part of the Republic of Gran Colombia along with Venezuela and Ecuador, with its capital in Bogota. From the colonial times and periods and also during most of the 19th century and until 1903, and even though there are still lexical similarities shared by the two countries (e.g., \"pelao\" in both Colombia and Panama means \"kid\" or \"child\"), phonetically, Panamanian Spanish is very similar with the Spanish as spoken in the coastal areas around the Caribbean, specifically Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the Atlantic coast of Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nThe main characteristic of Caribbean Spanish is the debuccalization of the sound at the end of a syllable or word, such as in the word \"cascada\", pronounced (like \"h\" in the English word \"he\") instead of . The aspiration is also observed in the coastal regions of Peru and Ecuador and in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, and in Andalusia and the Canary Islands of Spain.\n\nAnother change observed in Panamanian Spanish is the deaffrication of (as \"ch\" in the English word \"chips\") to (as \"sh\" in the English word \"she\") so \"muchacho\" is pronounced , rather than .

However, most users of the term intend no such belittlement, but rather a light-hearted way of apologizing on-the-fly for having used a somewhat profane comment. In other words, it can be (and usually is) used as a very effective oral English device to indicate that the speaker does not intend to escalate the general level of profanity use.\n\nAt least one source suggests that the phrase \"derives from a literal usage of the exclamation.

{"id": "17229765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17229765", "title": "Process theory of composition", "text": "Process theory of composition\n\nThe process theory of composition (hereafter referred to as \"process\") is a field of composition studies that focuses on writing as a process rather than a product. Based on Janet Emig's breakdown of the writing process, the process is centered on the idea that students determine the content of the course by exploring the craft of writing using their own interests, language, techniques, voice, and freedom, and where students learn what people respond to and what they don't. Classroom activities often include peer work where students themselves are teaching, reviewing, brainstorming, and editing.\n\nHistorically, the ideas behind process were born out of increased college enrollment thanks to the GI Bill following World War II. Writing instructors began giving students more group work and found that, with guidance, students were able to identify and recognize areas that needed improvement in other students' papers, and that criticism also helped students recognize their own areas to strengthen [cite]. Composition scholars such as Janet Emig, Peter Elbow, and Donald Murray began considering how these methods could be used in the writing classroom. Emig, in her book, The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders, broke down writing into distinct parts; these were later simplified into a basic three-step process by Murray: prewriting, writing, and rewriting (also called \"revision\").[2]\n\nProcess also gained prominence in the collegiate world as a reaction against the formalism composition methods, sometimes called \"current-traditional\" methods, that encouraged adherence to established modes of writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.\n\nProcess can be taught using a variety of methods intended to strengthen the relationship between students and instructor. In other words, classroom discussion and activities center on students' ability to mimic what has come before in hopes that they will understand what good writing is and learn to mimic it. Some of the methods include:\nPrewriting activities. These could include brainstorming and/or other freewriting activities, drawing conceptual maps, participating in an ethnographic study, research, and more.\nDrafting. Class time can be spent writing papers, and students can ask instructors for ideas or help.\nRevision. Instructors can designate class time for the revision of drafts and direct students to focus on rhetorical strategies.\nPortfolio-based assessment. Students are given a deadline, such as the end of a semester, and a goal, such as demonstrating skills like rhetorical awareness, conventional thinking, and source acceptance and integration. The intervening time is spent drafting and revising papers. Composition instructors serve as final authorities on the quality of work, helping students explore areas foreign to them, rather than more free wheeling teachers who tell students how to express their individuality. From among the papers they work on in the semester, students choose the papers the instructor considers to be their best and put them in a portfolio, which is graded by the instructor. Often students are graded on their drafts during the semester as well as on the work they produce at the end of it.\nReflection on the writing process.\n\nThomas Kent argues that process theories insist, “writing can be captured by a generalized process or a Big Theory,” and that process theory makes three central claims about writing: “(1) writing is private; (2) writing is not up for interpretation; and (3) writing can, and should be, highly organized.” \n\nWhen writing is conceived of and taught as a prescriptive and generalizable “process,” according to Gary Olson, useful implications arise in the creation of a Theory of Writing, a master narrative that attempts to “systematize something that simply is not susceptible to systematization.” \n\nSimilarly, George Pullman positions the writing process movement as a rhetorical narrative, positioned in history as a result of writing as an undervalued, utilitarian skill that could be universally transmitted in higher education (17). This emerged from “current traditional rhetoric” that originated at Harvard in the 1880s and peaked in the late 1960s. Writing became a highly scientific affair, rooted exclusively in empirical observation. Post-process theorists argue, however, that if the writing process “were really the way all successful writers write regardless of context, then unless all writing is somehow supportive of a single ideological system, there would be no obfuscatory ideological baggage attending the process.\" \n\nTheorists continue to discuss pedagogical and systemic implications of both process and post-process approaches to composition.\n\nProcess theorists themselves have had to identify and work around certain constraints the process method brings with it; namely:\n\nIf papers are not graded throughout the semester, students don't have any idea of the grade they are earning. Also, students might not be inclined to take control of the class content and decide what they want to explore; they may expect the instructor to provide material for them. Additionally, students may not improve their grammar and other writing conventions if content is emphasized over form.\n\nComposition classes are often overfilled, so instructors have to spend much of their time reading through drafts. Power can also be a struggle, for if student grades depend on a portfolio, then instructors have to find ways of encouraging and/or enforcing attendance.\nAnd if there are no rules as to what students may and may not write about, instructors have to be well-versed in a variety of discourses and ready to deal with conflict that may arise when two or more discourses meet (sometimes called a contact zone). Instructors must also find ways to encourage each student to explore and bring content to the course and must deal with diversity and a range of opinions on what should be done in the course.\n\nProcess rose to prominence in composition classrooms during the late 1960s and enjoyed its status as the gold standard method of teaching through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Many of its tenets are still used today; however, its popularity and methods have brought criticism from different composition theorists, such as post-process theorists, who charge that:\n\nAmir Kalan (2014) has explored the pedagogical potentials of post-process theory in an article entitled \"A Practice-Oriented Definition of Post-Process Second Language Writing Theory\".\n\nComposition studies\n\n\n"}

Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows;\nCentral and subordinate revolutions may support each other militarily, as for example the USSR, Cuba, Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and other Marxist regimes did in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nA further dimension to Katz's typology is that revolutions are either against (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or for (pro-fascism, communism, nationalism etc.).In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.\n\nThere is no consensus on a complete list of revolutionary waves. In particular, scholars disagree on how similar the ideologies of different events should be in order for them to be grouped as part of a single wave, and over what period a wave can be considered to be taking place – for example, Mark N. Katz discussed a \"Marxist-Leninist wave\" lasting from 1917 to 1991, and a \"fascist wave\" from 1922 to 1945, but limits an \"anti-communist wave\" to just the 1989 to 1991 period.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Katz theorises that Buddhism (in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indochina, Burma, Tibet) and Confucianism (to replace Marxism in China and promote unity with Chinese in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia) might be the revolutionary waves of the future. In the past, these religions have been passively acquiescent to secular authority; but so was Islam, until recently.\n\nKatz also suggests that nationalisms such as Pan-Turanianism (in Turkey, Central Asia, Xinjiang, parts of Russia), 'Pan-native Americanism' (in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay) and Pan-Slavism (in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) could also form revolutionary waves.\n\n"}

It is also used to describe Chinese generals holding those same traits while defeating their enemies with ease.\n\nIn popular culture, Ruya was first used to describe tennis star Rafael Nadal on the Baidu Rafa Post Bar (rafa Bar of Baidu Tieba). The post pointed out that Nadal never curses against his opponent; instead, he always gives credit to them. He never abuses his racquet, never gives up, and uses all means possible to achieve victory. These traits fit the meaning of the word \"Ruya\". With the close resemblance of the pronunciation of Ruya and Rafa, many message board posters started to use Ruya as Nadal's nickname.\n\nThe phenomenon of spreading Ruya continues through the Chinese sporting world. Besides Rafael Nadal, other tennis players have been considered as Ruya, including Australian Bernard Tomic and former WTA World No.1 Victoria Azarenka. Today, the word generally describes individuals with conflicting sides of being modest in public, but yet using all means to self-serve in their personal nature.\n"}
{"id": "351269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351269", "title": "Sacred language", "text": "Sacred language\n\nA sacred language, \"holy language\" (in religious context) or liturgical language is any language that is cultivated and used primarily in religious service or for other religious reasons by people who speak another, primary language in their daily life. The oldest sacred language is Sanskrit.\n\nA sacred language is often the language which was spoken and written in the society in which a religion's sacred texts were first set down; however, these texts thereafter become fixed and holy, remaining frozen and immune to later linguistic developments. Once a language becomes associated with religious worship, its believers may ascribe virtues to the language of worship that they would not give to their native tongues. In the case of sacred texts, there is a fear of losing authenticity and accuracy by a translation or re-translation, and difficulties in achieving acceptance for a new version of a text. A sacred language is typically vested with a solemnity and dignity that the vernacular lacks. Consequently, the training of clergy in the use of a sacred language becomes an important cultural investment, and their use of the tongue is perceived to give them access to a body of knowledge that untrained lay people cannot (or should not) access.\n\nBecause sacred languages are ascribed with virtues that the vernacular is not perceived to have, the sacred languages typically preserve characteristics that would have been lost in the course of language development. In some cases, the sacred language is a dead language. In other cases, it may simply reflect archaic forms of a living language. For instance, 17th-century elements of the English language remain current in Protestant Christian worship through the use of the \"King James Bible\" or older versions of the Anglican \"Book of Common Prayer\". In more extreme cases, the language has changed so much from the language of the sacred texts that the liturgy is no longer comprehensible without special training.\n\nThe concept of sacred languages is distinct from that of divine languages, which are languages ascribed to the divine (i.e. God or gods) and may not necessarily be natural languages. The concept, as expressed by the name of a script, for example in \"Devanāgarī\", the name of a script that roughly means \"[script] of the city”, and is used to write many Indian languages.\n\nHinduism is traditionally considered to have Sanskrit as its principal liturgical language. Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, Bhagavadgita, Puranas like Bhagavatam, the Upanishads, the Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and various other liturgical texts such as the Sahasranama, Chamakam and Rudram. \n\nSanskrit is also the tongue of most Hindu rituals. It is an Indo-Aryan language and therefore a member of the Indo-European language family. It therefore has some similarities with Greek and Latin, as well as with many vernacular languages of Europe and south Asia. Like Latin and Greek, it also has secular literature along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language. \n\nWhile Sanskrit has often been associated with Brahmanism, it remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across India. The \"de facto\" position that Sanskrit enjoyed, as the principal language of Hinduism, enabled its survival not only in India but also in other areas where Hinduism thrived like South East Asia. Apart from Sanskrit, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Tulu.\n\nTheravada Buddhism uses Pali as its main liturgical language, and prefers its scriptures to be studied in the original Pali. Pali is derived from the Indian language Prakrit, which in turn is a derivative of Sanskrit. In Thailand, Pali is written using the Thai alphabet, resulting in a Thai pronunciation of the Pali language.\n\nMahayana Buddhism makes little use of its original language, Sanskrit. In some Japanese rituals, Chinese texts are read out or recited with the Japanese pronunciations of their constituent characters, resulting in something unintelligible in both languages. In Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan language is used, but mantras are in Sanskrit.\n\nChristian rites, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. The Churches which trace their origin to the Apostles continued to use the standard languages of the first few centuries AD.\n\nThese include:\n\nThe extensive use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy has continued, in theory; it was used extensively on a regular basis during the Papal Mass, which has not been celebrated for some time. by the reign of Pope Saint Damasus I, the continuous use of Greek in the Roman Liturgy had come to be replaced in part by Latin. Gradually, the Roman Liturgy took on more and more Latin until, generally, only a few words of Hebrew and Greek remained. The adoption of Latin was further fostered when the Vetus Latina (old latin) version of the Bible was edited and parts retranslated from the original Hebrew and Greek by Saint Jerome in his Vulgate. Latin continued as the Western Church's language of liturgy and communication. One simply practical reason for this may be that there were no standardized vernaculars throughout the Middle Ages. Church Slavonic was used for the celebration of the Roman Liturgy in the 9th century (twice, 867-873 and 880-885).\n\nIn the mid-16th century the Council of Trent rejected a proposal to introduce national languages as this was seen, among other reasons, as potentially divisive to Catholic unity.\n\nDuring the Reformation in England, when the Protestant authorities banned the use of Latin liturgy, various schools obtained a dispension to continue to use Latin, for educational purposes.\n\nFrom the end of 16th century, in coastal Croatia, the vernacular was gradually replacing Church Slavonic as the liturgical language. It was introduced in the rite of the Roman Liturgy, after the Church Slavonic language of glagolitic liturgical books, published in Rome, was becoming increasingly unintelligible due to linguistical reforms, namely, adapting Church Slavonic of Croatian recension by the norms of Church Slavonic of Russian recension. For example, the vernacular was used to enquire of the bride and bridegroom whether they accepted their marriage vows.\n\nJesuit missionaries to China had sought, and for a short time received permission, to translate the Roman Missal into scholarly Classical Chinese. (See Chinese Rites controversy). However, ultimately permission was revoked. Among the Algonquin and Iroquois, they received permission to translate the propers of the Mass into the vernacular.\n\nIn the 20th century, Pope Pius XII granted permission for a few vernaculars to be used in a few rites, rituals, and ceremonies. This did not include the Roman Liturgy of the Mass.\n\nThe Catholic Church, long before the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), had accepted and promoted the use of the non-vernacular liturgical languages listed above; while vernacular (i.e. modern or native) languages were also used liturgically throughout history; usually as a special concession given to religious orders conducting missionary activity. The use of vernacular language in liturgical practice after 1964 created controversy for a minority of Catholics, and opposition to liturgical vernacular is a major tenet of the Catholic Traditionalist movement.\n\nIn the 20th century, Vatican II set out to protect the use of Latin as a liturgical language. To a large degree, its prescription was initially disregarded and the vernacular not only became standard, but was generally used exclusively in the liturgy. Latin, which remains the chief language of the Roman Rite, is the main language of the Roman Missal (the official book of liturgy for the Latin Rite) and of the Code of Canon Law, and the use of liturgical Latin is still encouraged. Large-scale papal ceremonies often make use of it. Meanwhile, the numerous Eastern Catholic Churches in union with Rome each have their own respective \"parent-language\". As a subsidiary issue, unrelated to liturgy, the Eastern Code of Canon Law, for the sake of convenience, has been promulgated in Latin.\n\nEastern Orthodox Churches vary in their use of liturgical languages in Church services. Koine Greek and Church Slavonic are the main sacred languages used in the Churches of the Eastern Orthodox communion. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church permits other languages to be used for liturgical worship, and each country often has the liturgical services in their own language. This has led to a wide variety of languages used for liturgical worship, but there is still uniformity in the liturgical worship itself. So one can attend an Orthodox service in another location and the service will be (relatively) the same.\n\nLiturgical languages used in the Eastern Orthodox Church include: Koine Greek, Church Slavonic, Romanian, Georgian, Arabic, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, Albanian, Finnish, Swedish, Chinese, Estonian, Korean, Japanese, several African languages and other world languages.\n\nOriental Orthodox churches outside their ancestral lands regularly pray in the local vernacular; but some clergymen and communities prefer to retain their traditional language or use a combination of languages.\n\nMany Anabaptist groups, such as the Amish, use High German in their worship despite not speaking it amongst themselves.\n\nClassical Arabic aka Quranic Arabic is the language of the Quran and is considered the holiest language in Islamic thought.\n\nThe core of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, referred to by some Jews as \"Lashon Hakodesh\" (, \"The Holy Language\"). Hebrew (and in the case of a few texts such as the Kaddish, Aramaic) remains the traditional language of Jewish religious services, although its usage today varies by denomination: Orthodox services are almost entirely in Hebrew, Reform services make more use of the national language and only use Hebrew for a few prayers and hymns, and Conservative services usually fall somewhere in between. Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic are used extensively by the Orthodox for writing religious texts. \n\nAmong many segments of the Haredi, Yiddish, although not used in liturgy, is used for religious purposes, such as for Torah study. In contemporary Israel, where Yiddish has virtually disappeared as a spoken language among the general public, it is cultivated and extensively used by some Haredi groups - partly in protest against Hebrew, the traditional sacred language having been \"profaned\" by Zionism, making it the main language of modern secular Israeli society. Moreover, in these circles Yiddish is associated with the memory of the great Torah sages of Eastern Europe, who spoke it and whose communities were destroyed in the Holocaust.\n\nAmong the Sephardim Ladino, a calque of Hebrew or Aramaic syntax and Castilian words, was used for sacred translations such as the Ferrara Bible. It was also used during the Sephardi liturgy. Note that the name \"Ladino\" is also used for Judeo-Spanish, a dialect of Castilian used by Sephardim as an everyday language until the 20th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "33205495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33205495", "title": "Workplace communication", "text": "Workplace communication\n\nWorkplace communication is the process of exchanging information and ideas, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from any missed deadline or activity that could affect the company negatively, communication is crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication.Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, nonverbal communication must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one. \n\nAnother important aspect to have effective workplace communication is taking into consideration the different backgrounds of employees. \"While diversity enriches the environment, it can also cause communication barriers.\" Difficulties arise when a coworker’s cultural background leads him or her to think differently than another. It is for this reason that knowing about intercultural communication at work and learning how to treat others without offending them can bring several benefits to the company.\n\nDifferent people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and free riding should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity. Preferring two-way communication is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.\n\nThe content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won’t make them involved. Use of jargon while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication.\n\nWhile formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits. A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they must be communicated early to engage employees in the objectives of the organization.\n\nGetting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.\n\nWhen selecting a candidate, most employers seek for those who have strong speaking and writing skills. Problem solving and self- motivation are also highly necessary skills among the workplace. These allow rapidly changing environments to become less of a challenge.\n\nWith the fast evolution of technology, companies have to stay up to date with communication tools that facilitate the workplace communication. Some of these include email, blogs, instant messaging and even social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. It is important to keep in mind that sending an email, a fax or a letter does not necessarily mean that communication has taken place. Only when a message has been sent, received and understood by the intended receiver, it can be said that communication has occurred.\n\nEven though they facilitate communication, studies have shown that communication tools may distract employees from their duties. To reduce the interrupt effect, methods such as employee training and changing of environment can be implemented. Employees making themselves unavailable during specific times of the day or week can also help resolve this issue. This will increase concentration and as a result, productivity.\n\nThe solution to have effective communication in a workplace can be achieved by having a central portal where everybody can access all the relevant information, communications, documents, and contracts in one place. \n\nCommon barriers to effective communication at workplace:\n\nPhysical barriers: Physical structure, location and construction of the workplace acts as a barrier to effective communication. Employees seated remotely from each other hinders effective interaction. \n\nLanguage barriers: Employees with different native languages will be working in an organization. As everyone in organization are not comfortable with native language of the other person, language acts as a barrier for effective workplace communication. \n\nCultural barriers: Employees from different cultures, following different practices will be working in an organization. This cultural diversity among the employees can act as barrier for effective communication at workplace. \n\nEmotional barriers: Emotional barriers like fear, inferiority, shyness, lack of self confidence and skills will stop an employee in communicating effectively with his colleagues.\n\nPerception barriers: Employees will have different experiences, values, preferences and attitudes.These may lead to a variety of assumptions and can act as a communication barrier.\n\n"}
{"id": "16908902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16908902", "title": "Writing in space", "text": "Writing in space\n\nSeveral instruments have been used to write in outer space, including different types of pencils and pens. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions.\n\nA common urban legend states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the conditions experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was developed independently by a private organization in the 1960s.\n\nSpace versus ground recordkeeping presents several serious issues:\n\nAs with submarines before them, space capsules are closed environments, subject to strict contamination requirements. Incoming material is screened for mission threats. Any shedding, including wood, graphite, and ink vapors and droplets, may become a risk. In the case of a manned capsule, the much smaller recirculating volume, combined with microgravity and an even greater difficulty of resupply, make these requirements even more critical.\n\nRelease of wood shavings, graphite dust, broken graphite tips, and ink compounds are a dangerous flight hazard. Lack of gravity makes objects drift, even with air filtration. Any conductive material is a threat to electronics, including the electromechanical switches in use during early manned space programs. Nonconductive particles may also hamper switch contacts, such as normally-open and rotary mechanisms. Drifting particles are a threat to the eyes (and to a lesser extent an inhalation threat), which may risk execution of a critical procedure. Personnel may don protective gear, but both ground and flight crews are more comfortable and more productive \"in shirtsleeves\". Paul C. Fisher of Fisher Pen Company recounts that pencils were 'too dangerous to use in space'.\n\nEven before the Apollo 1 fire, the CM crew cabin was reviewed for hazardous materials such as paper, velcro, and even low-temperature plastics. A directive was issued but poorly enforced. When combined with high oxygen content, the Apollo 1 cabin burned within seconds, killing all three crew members.\n\nCosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev flew with Space Pens starting in the '80s and states \"pencil lead breaks...and is not good in space capsule; very dangerous to have metal lead particles in zero gravity\".\n\nStrict documentation requirements accompany anything as complex as a large-scale aerospace demonstration, let alone a manned spaceflight. Quality assurance records document individual parts, and instances of procedures, for deviances. Low production and flight rates generally result in high variance; most spacecraft designs (to say nothing of individual spacecraft) fly so infrequently that they are considered experimental aircraft. When combined with the stringent weight drivers of orbital and deep-space flight, the quality-control demands are high. Change control records track the evolution of hardware and procedures from their ground testing, initial flights, through necessary corrections and midlife revision and upgrades, and on to retention of engineering knowledge for later programs, and any incident investigations.\n\nWhen the flight also has scientific or engineering science objectives, low-quality data may affect mission success directly.\n\nFaced with these requirements, pencils or other non-permanent recordkeeping methods are unsatisfactory. The act of taking permanent, high-integrity documentation itself deters kludges, workarounds, and \"go fever\". The Apollo 1 investigation uncovered procedural and workmanship deficiencies in multiple areas, up to procedures on the pad.\n\nAt sea level, temperature is moderated by the thick atmosphere. As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically. Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, to decrease the stresses (and thus, mass) of their capsules. Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times. Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures. While the Soyuz spacecraft had a design pressure, and could use its orbital module as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned lunar missions. In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental depressurizations), provide a margin, and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.\n\nThe wood pencil has been used for writing by NASA and Soviet space programs from the start. It is simple with no moving parts, except for the sharpener. However, wood, graphite, and rubber (in the eraser) are all combustible and create dust. Graphite, in particular, both burns and produces dust that conducts electricity.\n\nThe mechanical pencil has been used by NASA starting in the 1960s Gemini program. It can be made to be as wide as the width of astronauts' gloves, yet maintain its light weight. There are no wooden components which might catch fire and create dust. However, the pencil lead still creates graphite dust that conducts electricity.\n\nGrease pencils on plastic slates were used by the Soviet space program as an early substitute for wood pencils. It is simple with no moving parts. The paper shroud is peeled back when needed. The disadvantage is that the paper wrapper has to be disposed of. Writing done with the grease pencil is also not as durable as ink on paper.\n\nBallpoint pens have been used by Soviet and then Russian space programs as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with graphite pencils and grease pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to outgassing and temperature variations.\n\nFelt-tip pens were used by NASA astronauts in the Apollo missions. However, wick-based instruments are designed around low viscosity, and thus operating temperature and pressure.\n\nThe Fisher Space Pen is a gas-charged ball point pen that is rugged and works in a wider variety of conditions, such as zero gravity, vacuum and extreme temperatures. Its thixotropic ink and vent-free cartridge release no significant vapor at common temperatures and low pressures. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), and it functions at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m) and at temperatures from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). However, it is more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives. It has been used by both NASA and Soviet/Russian astronauts on Apollo, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS missions.\n\n"}
