He is one of the best known figures in Kyrgyzstan's literature.\n\nHe was born to a Kyrgyz father and Tatar mother. Aitmatov's parents were civil servants in Sheker. In 1937 his father was charged with \"bourgeois nationalism\" in Moscow, arrested and executed in 1938.\n\nAitmatov lived at a time when Kyrgyzstan was being transformed from one of the most remote lands of the Russian Empire to a republic of the USSR. The future author studied at a Soviet school in Sheker. He also worked from an early age. At fourteen he was an assistant to the Secretary at the Village Soviet. He later held jobs as a tax collector, a loader, an engineer's assistant and continued with many other types of work.\n\nIn 1946 he began studying at the Animal Husbandry Division of the Kirghiz Agricultural Institute in Frunze, but later switched to literary studies at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow, where he lived from 1956 to 1958. For the next eight years he worked for Pravda. His first two publications appeared in 1952 in Russian: \"The Newspaper Boy Dziuio\" and \"Ашым.\" His first work published in Kyrgyz was \"Ак Жаан\" (White rain, 1954), and his well-known work \"Jamila\" (Jamila) appeared in 1958. In 1961 he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1971 he was a member of the jury at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\n1980 saw his first novel \"The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years\"; his next significant novel, \"The Scaffold\" was published in 1988. \"The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years\" and other writings were translated into several languages. In 1994 he was a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2002 he was the President of the Jury at the 24th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nAitmatov suffered kidney failure, and on 16 May 2008 was admitted to a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, where he died of pneumonia on 10 June 2008 at the age of 79. After his death, Aitmatov was flown to Kyrgyzstan, where there were numerous ceremonies before he was buried in Ata Beyit cemetery, which he helped found and where his father most likely is buried, in Chong-Tash village, Alamüdün district, Chüy oblast, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nHis obituary in The New York Times characterized him as \"a Communist writer whose novels and plays before the collapse of the Soviet Union gave a voice to the people of the remote Soviet republic of Kyrgyz\" and adds that he \"later became a diplomat and a friend and adviser to the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\"\n\nChinghiz Aitmatov belonged to the post-war generation of writers. His output before \"Jamila\"\n\nAitmatov was honoured in 1963 with the Lenin Prize for \"Tales of the Mountains and Steppes\" (a compilation including \"Jamila\", \"First Teacher\" and \"Farewell Gulsary\") and was later awarded a State prize for \"Farewell, Gulsary!\". Aitmatov's art was glorified by admirers. Even critics of Aitmatov mentioned the high quality of his novels.\n\nAitmatov's work has some elements that are unique specifically to his creative process. His work drew on folklore, not in the ancient sense of it; rather, he tried to recreate and synthesize oral tales in the context of contemporary life. This is prevalent in his work; in nearly every story he refers to a myth, a legend, or a folktale. In \"The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years,\" a poetic legend about a young captive turned into a mankurt serves as a tragic allegory and becomes a significant symbolic expression of the philosophy of the novel.\n\nA second aspect of Aitmatov's writing is his ultimate closeness to our \"little brothers\" the animals, for their and our lives are intimately and inseparably connected. The two central characters of \"Farewell, Gulsary!\" are a man and his stallion. A camel plays a prominent role in \"The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years\"; one of the key turns of the novel which decides the fate of the main character is narrated through the story of the camel's rut and riot. \"The Scaffold\" starts off and finishes with the story of a wolf pack and the great wolf-mother Akbara and her cub; human lives enter the narrative but interweave with the lives of the wolves. Some of his stories were filmed, like \"The First Teacher\" in 1965 and \"Red Scarf\" (1970) as The Girl with the Red Scarf (1978).\n\nAs many educated Kyrgyzs, Aitmatov was fluent in both Kyrgyz and Russian. As he explained in one of his interviews, Russian was as much of a native language for him as Kyrgyz. Most of his early works he wrote in Kyrgyz; some of these he later translated into Russian himself, while others were translated into Russian by other translators. Since 1966, he was writing in Russian.\n\nIn addition to his literary work, Chinghiz Aitmatov was first the ambassador for the Soviet Union and later for Kyrgyzstan, to the European Union, NATO, UNESCO and the Benelux countries.\n\n\"(Russian titles in parentheses)\"\n\nEnglish-language collections and interviews\n\n\n"}

A critical apparatus is often a by-product of textual criticism.\n\nMany editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from \"Hamlet\", which the Oxford \"Complete Works\" (1988) prints as follows:\n\nThe apparatus for the line might be rendered as:\n\nThe format of the apparatus has several parts:\n\nTo save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a \"siglum\". In Shakespeare editions, F always signifies the First Folio; the second through fourth folios are referred to as F2 through F4 respectively. Similarly, Q1 is the first quarto, Q2 the second quarto, and Q3 the third.\n\nIn the example given, the first folio (F) and the three early quartos (Q1 to Q3) each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by G. R. Hibbard. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.\n\nThis format has been used for critical apparatuses of Shakespeare and many other authors. In variorum editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford \"Complete Works\" breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.\n\nIn the United States, bibliographer Fredson Bowers established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.\n\nThe first printed edition of the New Testament with \"critical apparatus\", noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer Robert Estienne of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the \"Textus Receptus\" (Latin for \"received text\"), a name given to it in the Elzevier edition of 1633, which termed it as the text \"nunc ab omnibus receptum\" (\"now received by all\").\n\nThe de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative. While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format. \n"}

Although it shares many similarities with both Franco-Provençal and Italian, it is distinct from both. These two small communities have been isolated from the rest of Italy by mountains, and so Faetar has evolved and changed over the centuries into a distinct language.\n\nAfter a large wave of emigration from Italy after the Second World War, many Faetano and Cellese settled in North America; with a relatively large group immigrating to Toronto, Canada. The language has been studied both in its native Italy, and in Toronto, because of its small number of speakers, its unique blend of Italian and Franco-Provençal features, and its changes brought on by language contact.\n\nAlthough not given a distinct language code from Franco-Provençal, it is listed by UNESCO as \"definitely endangered\".\n\nThe Faetar language has its beginnings in the 13th century. A Franco-Provençal group of soldiers was sent to the Puglia region to fight the battle of Benevento of 1266. After the battle, some soldiers stayed and set up communities in the region. Celle di San Vito was founded as a monastery on the mountainside to avoid an outbreak of malaria down the mountain, and Faeto was founded either on 8 July 1268, or 20 October 1274 by an edict from Charles of Anjou.\n\nIn the 20th century, hundreds of Faetano and Cellese people left Italy and settled in the Toronto area of Canada, and in small pockets of the United States, such as upstate New York (The demonyms for the people from Faeto and Celle di San Vito are Faetani and Cellese, respectively). The Toronto community has been studied recently to examine the effects of language contact, and to look at the differences between the language in Toronto and in its native Italy.\n\nThere have been at least two dictionaries and one grammar published since 2000 that describe the Faetar language in Italian. It has also been studied extensively in English, French, and Italian as a minority language, a language in contact, and for comparison with other Franco-Provençal languages.\n\nFaetar’s grammar is similar to most other Romance languages with articles that agree with masculine and feminine nouns, and verbs that are inflected with different endings for person, number, and tense. Because of these inflected verbs, pronouns are not necessary. However, Faetar has a unique pronoun characteristic in that it has two versions of each pronoun. There is a \"strong\" pronoun and a \"weak\" pronoun. In conversation, both the strong and the weak can be used together (the strong always comes first), or only the strong, or only the weak, or no pronoun at all. The weak can also appear after a noun. For example:\n\n(1) No overt subject pronoun\n\n/ɛ lu dʒórɛ Ø stav a la kaz/\n\n\"and that day, [Ø=I] was at the house\"\n\n(2) Weak pronoun\n\n/e i stávo vakánt/\n\n\"and it was vacant\"\n\n(3) Strong pronoun\n\n/no íʎɛ sta tútːo/\n\n\"No, he was always…\"\n\n(4) Strong + Weak pronoun\n\n/íʎɛ i e lu me prɛfɛríːtə/\n\n\"She-\"strong \"she-\"weak \"is my favourite\" \n\nThis case of strong and weak pronouns has been the source of much study as to what constrains, if anything, the choice of pronouns in a given phrase. This also makes Faetar a partial pro-drop language.\n"}
{"id": "1810753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810753", "title": "Gender bender", "text": "Gender bender\n\nA gender bender (LGBT slang: one who genderfucks) is a person who disrupts, or \"bends\", expected gender roles. Gender bending is sometimes a form of social activism undertaken to destroy rigid gender roles and defy sex-role stereotypes, notably in cases where the gender-nonconforming person finds these roles oppressive. It can be a reaction to, and protest of, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny or misandry. Some gender benders identify with the sex assigned them at birth, but challenge the societal norms that assign expectations of particular, gendered behavior to that sex. This rebellion can involve androgynous dress, adornment, behavior, and atypical gender roles. Gender benders may self-identify as trans or genderqueer. However, many trans people do not consider themselves \"gender benders\".\n\nGenderbending may be political, stemming from the early identity politics movements of the 1960s and 1970s, a guiding principle of which is the idea that the personal is political. In his 1974 article, \"Genderfuck and Its Delights\", Christopher Lonc explained his motivation for performing genderfuck: \"I want to criticize and poke fun at the roles of women and of men too. I want to try [to] show how not-normal I can be. I want to ridicule and destroy the whole cosmology of restrictive sex roles and sexual identification.\"\n\nThe term \"genderfuck\" has long been part of the gay vernacular, and started to appear in written documents in the 1970s. Sheidlower cites the definition of the term \"gender fuck\" in L Humphreys' 1972 work \"Out of the Closets: Sociology of Homosexual Liberation\" as \"a form of extended guerilla theatre\". Also quoted is the August 1972 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, in reference to the glam rock style: \"The new \"macho\" transvestism, called vulgarly \"gender-fuck\", a curious satire of female impersonation – dresses, pumps, full make-up and beards – Is represented by, among others, three men in WAC uniforms and big moustaches\".\n\nTo \"fuck with\" gender, one must have an expectation to be able to rebel against. These expectations are socially constructed and can vary widely between cultures. The gender binary is the idea that only two genders exist: men and women. In many cultures it is only acceptable for an individual to embody one of two polar gender roles. Gender roles often mimic the social expectations of the sexual categories of \"male\" and \"female\". Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine. The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.\n\nIn many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes. These roles are highly influenced by culture and peers. This sex-role stereotype includes sexual orientation. To this end, those who go against expected conduct, for example gays and lesbians, may be seen as \"less than\" or \"other\".\n\nIn Western cultures, gender roles have changed somewhat over the years. However, mainstream western culture still tends to expect stereotypical \"feminine\" behaviors from females, and \"masculine\" sex-role stereotypes from males. A study by Princeton University outlined these common, prescriptive gender stereotypes: \"masculine\" - acts as a leader, aggressive, ambitious, analytical, assertive, athletic, competitive, defends own beliefs, dominant, forceful, has leadership abilities, independent, individualistic, makes decisions easily, self-reliant, self-sufficient, strong-personality, willing to take a stand, and willing to take risks. \"Feminine\" sex-role stereotypes, as defined by this same study included: affectionate, cheerful, childlike, compassionate, does not use harsh language, eager to soothe hurt feelings, flatterable, gentle, gullible, loves children, loyal, sensitive to the needs of others, shy, soft-spoken, sympathetic, tender, understanding, warm, and yielding.\n\nIn Christian and Jewish cultures, gender roles and gender presentation have been policed since Biblical times: \"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God\" (Deut. 22:5). Crossing these lines has been interpreted by some Christians as a moral transgression.\n\nHowever, other cultures - often indigenous peoples, or subcultures that exist within Western cultures - may conceptualize gender as having more than two options, and even see their people as potentially fulfilling more than one gender role. Some indigenous peoples of North America have historically had more than two gender roles as part of their social structure, while others, who may or may not have embraced this diversity historically, may accept modern two spirit people as part of their communities now. Other cultures may see people as being capable of embodying more than one gender role at different times, or of being \"in the middle\", \"embracing both male and female spirit.\" One such example is the Bugis people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. People of the Bugis society have a total of five genders. These genders include what would traditionally be seen as cisgender man and woman, as well as transgender men and women, and the androgynous \"Bissu\" shamans.\n\nOften, parody and exaggeration are used to transgress gender roles, usually to expose them as artificial. For example, a person who engages in genderfucking may purposefully exaggerate conventional notions of femininity, or masculinity. Genderfucking can also be achieved through cross-dressing and androgyny, both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of biological or physiological sex. Thus, genderfucking protests gender essentialism. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well – for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Genderfucking is based in gender performativity: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"\n\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. Androgyny is not specifically genderfucking, but it can be considered genderfucking if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so. The origin of the word \"androgynous\" is from the Greek \"androgynos\": \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\".\n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star Prince was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. Eddie Izzard started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\nShakespeare used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra, Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Rosalind in As You Like It, Viola in Twelfth Night.\n\nGenderfucking is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is drag.\n\nDrag shows are stage performances where people perform in drag. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the persons's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves drag kings or drag queens. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or lip sync.\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a faux queen or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.\n\nLiterature, in particular erotica, is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to Carol Queen's short story \"The Leather Daddy and the Femme\", where a lesbian femme uses a strap-on dildo to have sex with a gay leather daddy as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.\n\nGenderfucking is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is performed; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the gender binary roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally political radicalism. Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: \nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical – otherwise gender-benders such as Boy George, Prince, Annie Lennox, David Bowie etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck – such as that of RuPaul or (to a limited extent) Madonna – gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender \"as an axis of power\" that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining\n\nJudith Butler is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"gender performativity\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article \"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory\", Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, the gender binary and its strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script, this script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of which are a way to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, \"Gender Trouble\" (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.\n\nAccording to Susan Witt's recent study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more androgynous gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self. Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits gender performances that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson reports that a parental figure may respond with hostility. According to the \"Official Journal of American Academy of Pediatrics\", people who do not conform to the gender binary are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community. Types of abuse range from physical and sexual to psychological abuse and are not associated with homosexuality alone.\n\nThe Cockettes were a psychedelic drag queen troupe, founded in San Francisco In the late 1960s. According to the journal \"Maledicta\" in 1987: \"Real transvestites and transsexuals are... embarrassed... [by]... The gender-fuck Cockettes and such (in dresses and beards).\"\n\nCredited as one of the innovators of the early 70's glam rock era, lead singer and guitarist Marc Bolan of rock band T. Rex was dubbed 'feminine looking'. He was known for his volumised curly hair, vibrant wardrobe and experimentation with glittery make-up and eyeliner. As well as this, he wore platform boots and feather boas during his performances.\n\nExploiting his androgynous appearance, rock star David Bowie wore a dress on the UK cover of his 1970 album, \"The Man Who Sold the World\", and often wore dresses, makeup and leotards both onstage and while doing interviews. In a time when very few people were out, he announced he and his wife were both bisexual. In 1972 Bowie co-produced Lou Reed's album \"Transformer\", which includes several genderbendings songs, notably the classic, \"Walk on the Wild Side\".\n\nThe New York Dolls are a protopunk band, formed in 1971 and who were very influential in the early New York City punk rock scene. They broke up in 1977 but reformed in 2004. While they often performed in dresses, long hair and glitter/glam makeup, at least one reviewers called their genderfuck \"quite subtle.\"\n\nDr. Frank-N-Furter from the 1973 musical, The Rocky Horror Show, and later the cult film / midnight movie, \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", is a male bodied person but wears lingerie, clothing, and accessories considered feminine in the English and American culture of the era. The character also wears heavy make-up influenced by 1940s female film stars like Joan Crawford. In one of the songs featured in the musical Dr. Frank-N-Furter sings, \"I'm just a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania.\"\n\nPrince wrote many songs that dealt with ambiguity - of gender, of sexuality, and of race. A charismatic entertainer and prolific songwriter, his songs with bisexual content have also been recorded by artists such as Cyndi Lauper, who in \"When You Were Mine\", sang about sharing a lover with another man, who was in bed with them, \"sleeping in between the two of us.\"\n\nAccording to SheWired, Grace Jones laughs at outside attempts to define her gender identity. Jones herself has said of her gender ambiguity that she feels her masculine side is \"a bit stronger\". NPR cites her as an influence on Madonna and Lady Gaga.\n\nSinger-songwriter and political activist Annie Lennox began her career as lead singer with The Tourists in the late 1970s. In The 1980s she fronted synthpop band the Eurythmics but has focused on solo work since the 1990s with the exception of an album and tour with Eurythmics In 1999. The \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" described her in 1995 as \"Gender-fuck goddess Annie Lennox\".\n\nThe American singer-songwriter and artist Phranc began her career in 1978 with punk band Nervous Gender. In 1985 \"Village Voice\" wrote: \"Part of Phranc's appeal is the genderfuck of her sweet feminine voice coming from such a masculine frame.\" She later worked with queercore band Team Dresch.\n\nThe charity, protest and street performance organization Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was formed by gay men in 1979, originally using nuns' attire and high camp to draw attention to social conflicts in the Castro, San Francisco. Currently they fundraise for AIDS and other LGBT causes and promote and educate on safer sex issues. The \"Cambridge Guide to American Theater\" identified them as one of the \"more anarchic uses of \"gender-fuck\"... [which]... \"parodied traditional drag\".\n\nBoy George of the 1980s band Culture Club, has cultivated an androgynous style, and was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the early 1980s. He famously stated, \"I can do anything. In \"GQ\", I appeared as a man.\"\n\nAmerican drag queen, singer, actor, and host/star of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul got his start by performing in genderfuck, performance art, music videos and punk bands in Atlanta in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nPat, a character from the television show \"Saturday Night Live\", served as the basis for the movie \"It's Pat\". The sketches and film feature an androgynous main character, Pat. People are unable to determine Pat's sex, including one male who cannot determine it after having sex with Pat while stranded on a deserted island.\n\nCharlotte Richardson Andrews of \"The Guardian\" says Marilyn Manson's gender-bending rock act \"shows trans identities can resonate with the public in a way that cannot be ghettoised\". Manson's gender-bending has been compared to that of Alice Cooper and Bowie.\n\nEddie Izzard started to freely talk about his transvestism in venues like Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992. His stance is that cross-dressing is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He remarks in his show \"Unrepeatable\", \"Women wear what they want and so do I.\" According to Izzard, \"Most transvestites fancy women.\" He identifies as \"a straight transvestite or a male lesbian\". He has also described himself as \"a lesbian trapped in a man's body\", transgender, and \"a complete boy plus half girl\".\n\nLady Gaga is very specific in what she wears and even states that, \"But in a sense, I portray myself in a very androgynous way, and I love androgyny.\"\n\nWisCon, the world's oldest and foremost feminist science fiction convention, sponsors an annual \"Genderfloomp\" dance to \"seek to explore and expand our concepts of gender via dance party. Gender play/blurring/queering/drag, both in dress and manner, is highly encouraged but hardly required\".\n\nIn fiction, the term gender bender may refer not only to characters modeled after real-life gender benders, but also to characters who undergo changes in their physical sex – magically or otherwise – throughout the story. A work of art which challenges gender roles or features gender bending may itself be referred to as a \"gender bender\".\n\n\nSome films including gender-fuck characters or drag characters are:\n\n"}

In most of his novels (more prominently in \"Vidas Secas\") he depicts the precarious situation of the poor inhabitants of the Brazilian \"sertão\".\n\nGraciliano Ramos de Oliveira was born in the city of Quebrangulo, in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, on October 27, 1892, to Sebastião Ramos de Oliveira and Maria Amélia Ramos. Graciliano was the oldest of the couple's 16 children.\n\nHe would spend most part of his childhood travelling through different cities of Northeast Brazil. After finishing high school in Maceió, he became a collaborator of the newspaper \"Jornal de Alagoas\" in 1909, where he published a sonnet called \"Céptico\" under the pen name Almeida Cunha, and some other texts under many different pseudonyms. He also published texts in the magazine \"O Malho\", under the pen name Feliciano de Olivença, and founded a short-lived periodical named \"Echo Viçosense\" in 1906.\n\nIn 1914 he moved to Rio de Janeiro, but had to return to Alagoas in September 1915, in order to live with his father, who became a salesman in the city of Palmeira dos Índios. Also in 1915, he married his first wife, Maria Augusta de Barros, having with her four children. Maria Augusta died in 1920, due to troubles during childbirth.\n\nIn 1927, Ramos was elected mayor of Palmeira dos Índios: he took office in 1928 and would abdicate his post in 1930. Mesmerized by the high literary quality of his prefecture reports, Augusto Frederico Schmidt would approach Ramos into publishing his first novel, \"Caetés\", that Ramos started to write circa 1925. He would finish \"Caetés\" in 1930, but did not publish it until 1933. In 1928, he married his second wife, Heloísa Leite de Medeiros, having with her four more children.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1936 he lived once again in Maceió. In 1934 he published the novel \"São Bernardo\", and in the following year, he was arrested due to alleged (but never confirmed) participation in the Communist Revolt of 1935. (Graciliano wrote an account of his time in prison named \"Memórias do Cárcere\", published a few months after his death in 1953.) After being freed from prison, he publishes with the help of associates such as José Lins do Rego his most famous novel, \"Angústia\".\n\nIn 1938 he publishes \"Vidas Secas\" and moves definitely to Rio de Janeiro, where he became in 1945 a member of the Communist Party of Brazil. In the subsequent years, he travelled alongside his wife to countries such as France, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Also in 1945 he published an account of his childhood years, named \"Infância\". Beginning in 1952, Graciliano's health gradually began to decline.

{"id": "19999853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19999853", "title": "Icelandic language", "text": "Icelandic language\n\nIcelandic (; ) is a North Germanic language spoken in Iceland. Along with Faroese, Norn, and Western Norwegian it formerly constituted \"West Nordic\"; while Danish, Eastern Norwegian and Swedish constituted \"East Nordic\". Modern Norwegian is influenced by both groups, leading the Nordic languages to be divided into mainland Scandinavian languages and \"Insular Nordic\" (including Icelandic). Historically, it was the westernmost of the Indo-European languages until the Portuguese settlement in the Azores. \n\nMost Western European languages have greatly reduced levels of inflection, particularly noun declension. In contrast, Icelandic retains a four-case synthetic grammar comparable to German, though considerably more conservative and synthetic. Icelandic is distinguished by a wide assortment of irregular declensions. Icelandic also has many instances of oblique cases without any governing word, much like Latin. For example, many of the various Latin ablatives have a corresponding Icelandic dative. The conservatism of the Icelandic language and its resultant near-isomorphism to Old Norse (which is equivalently termed Old Icelandic by linguists) means that modern Icelanders can easily read the \"Eddas,\" sagas, and other classic Old Norse literary works created in the tenth through thirteenth centuries.\n\nIcelandic is closely related to, but not mutually intelligible with the Faroese language, and is also not mutually intelligible with the continental Scandinavian languages. It is also farther away from the largest Germanic languages English and German than those three are.\n\nThe vast majority of Icelandic speakers—about 320,000—live in Iceland. More than 8,000 Icelandic speakers live in Denmark, of whom approximately 3,000 are students. The language is also spoken by some 5,000 people in the United States and by more than 1,400 people in Canada, notably in the province of Manitoba. While 97% of the population of Iceland consider Icelandic their mother tongue, the language is in decline in some communities outside Iceland, particularly in Canada. Icelandic speakers abroad represent recent emigration in almost all cases except Gimli, Manitoba, which was settled from the 1880s onwards.\n\nThe state-funded Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies serves as a centre for preserving the medieval Icelandic manuscripts and studying the language and its literature. The Icelandic Language Council, comprising representatives of universities, the arts, journalists, teachers, and the Ministry of Culture, Science and Education, advises the authorities on language policy. Since 1995, on 16 November each year, the birthday of 19th-century poet Jónas Hallgrímsson is celebrated as Icelandic Language Day.\n\nThe oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD. Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise the historical works and the eddaic poems.\n\nThe language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old Norse. The Dano-Norwegian, then later Danish rule of Iceland from 1536 to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic (in contrast to the Norwegian language), which remained in daily use among the general population. Though more archaic than the other living Germanic languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, ', ', \"\", and \"/\").\n\nThe modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard established in the 19th century, primarily by the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask. It is based strongly on an orthography laid out in the early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as \"The First Grammatical Treatise\" by an anonymous author, who has later been referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of ' rather than '. Various archaic features, as the letter ', had not been used much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in practice. Later 20th-century changes include the use of ' instead of ' and the removal of ' from the Icelandic alphabet in 1973.\n\nApart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years ago. The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand the original manuscripts.\n\nAccording to an act (61/2011) passed by parliament in 2011, Icelandic is \"the official language in Iceland\".\n\nIceland is a member of the Nordic Council, a forum for co-operation between the Nordic countries, but the council uses only Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as its working languages (although the council does publish material in Icelandic). Under the Nordic Language Convention, since 1987 Icelandic citizens have had the right to use Icelandic when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries, without becoming liable for any interpretation or translation costs. The convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. It does not have much effect since it is not very well known, and because those Icelanders not proficient in the other Scandinavian languages often have a sufficient grasp of English to communicate with institutions in that language (although there is evidence that the general English skills of Icelanders have been somewhat overestimated). The Nordic countries have committed to providing services in various languages to each other's citizens, but this does not amount to any absolute rights being granted, except as regards criminal and court matters.\n\nIcelandic has very minor dialectal differences phonetically. The language has both monophthongs and diphthongs, and consonants can be voiced or unvoiced.\n\nVoice plays a primary role in the differentiation of most consonants including the nasals but excluding the plosives. The plosives \"b\", \"d\", and \"g\" are voiceless and differ from \"p\", \"t\" and \"k\" only by their lack of aspiration. Preaspiration occurs before geminate (long or double consonants) \"p\", \"t\" and \"k\". It does not occur before geminate \"b\", \"d\" or \"g\". Pre-aspirated \"tt\" is analogous etymologically and phonetically to German and Dutch \"cht\" (compare Icelandic ', ' with the German ', ' and the Dutch ', ').\n\n\n includes three extra phones: .\n\nA large number of competing analyses have been proposed for Icelandic phonemes. The problems stem from complex but regular alternations and mergers among the above phones in various positions.\n\nIcelandic retains many grammatical features of other ancient Germanic languages, and resembles Old Norwegian before much of its fusional inflection was lost. Modern Icelandic is still a heavily inflected language with four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. Icelandic nouns can have one of three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. There are two main declension paradigms for each gender: strong and weak nouns, and these are further divided into subclasses of nouns, based primarily on the \"genitive singular\" and \"nominative plural\" endings of a particular noun. For example, within the strong masculine nouns, there is a subclass (class 1) that declines with \"-s\" (') in the genitive singular and \"-ar\" (') in the nominative plural. However, there is another subclass (class 3) of strong masculine nouns that always declines with \"-ar\" (') in the genitive singular and \"-ir\" (') in the nominative plural. Additionally, Icelandic permits a quirky subject, i.e. certain verbs have subjects in an oblique case (i.e. other than the nominative).\n\nNouns, adjectives and pronouns are declined in the four cases and for number in the singular and plural. T-V distinction (\"\") in modern Icelandic seems on the verge of extinction, but it can still be found, especially in structured official address and traditional phrases.\n\nVerbs are conjugated for tense, mood, person, number and voice. There are three voices: active, passive and middle (or medial), but it may be debated whether the middle voice is a voice or simply an independent class of verbs of its own (because every middle-voice verb has an active ancestor but concomitant are sometimes drastic changes in meaning, and the middle-voice verbs form a conjugation group of their own). Examples are ' (\"come\") vs. ' (\"get there\"), ' (\"kill\") vs. ' (\"perish ignominiously\") and ' (\"take\") vs. ' (\"manage to\"). In each of these examples, the meaning has been so altered, that one can hardly see them as the same verb in different voices. Verbs have up to ten tenses, but Icelandic, like English, forms most of them with auxiliary verbs. There are three or four main groups of weak verbs in Icelandic, depending on whether one takes a historical or a formalistic view: ', ', and ', referring to the endings that these verbs take when conjugated in the first person singular present. Some Icelandic infinitives end with the ' suffix, some with ', two with ' (', ') one with ' (': \"wash\") and one with ' (the Danish borrowing ' which is probably withdrawing its presence). Many transitive verbs (i.e they require an object), can take a reflexive pronoun instead. The case of the pronoun depends on the case that the verb governs. As for further classification of verbs, Icelandic behaves much like other Germanic languages, with a main division between weak verbs and strong, and the strong verbs, of which there are about 150 to 200, are divided into six classes plus reduplicative verbs. They still make up some of the most frequently used verbs. (', \"to be\", is the example \"par excellence\", having two subjunctives and two imperatives in addition to being made up of different stems.) There is also a class of auxiliary verbs, called the ' verbs (4 or 5, depending who is counting) and then the oddity \"\" (\"to cause\"), called the only totally irregular verb in Icelandic although every form of it is caused by common and regular sound changes.\n\nThe basic word order in Icelandic is subject–verb–object. However, as words are heavily inflected, the word order is fairly flexible, and every combination may occur in poetry; SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS are all allowed for metrical purposes. However, as with most Germanic languages, Icelandic usually complies with the V2 word order restriction, so the conjugated verb in Icelandic usually appears as the second element in the clause, preceded by the word or phrase being emphasized. For example:\n\nIn the above examples, the conjugated verbs ' and ' are always the second element in their respective clauses.\n\nEarly Icelandic vocabulary was largely Old Norse. The introduction of Christianity to Iceland in the 11th century brought with it a need to describe new religious concepts. The majority of new words were taken from other Scandinavian languages; \"\" (\"church\"), for example. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic: French brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the semantic field of trade and commerce have been borrowed from Low German because of trade connections. In the late 18th century, language purism began to gain noticeable ground in Iceland and since the early 19th century it has been the linguistic policy of the country (see linguistic purism in Icelandic). Nowadays, it is common practice to coin new compound words from Icelandic derivatives.\n\nIcelandic personal names are patronymic (and sometimes matronymic) in that they reflect the immediate father or mother of the child and not the historic family lineage. This system—which was formerly used throughout the Nordic area and beyond—differs from most Western family name systems.\n\nDuring the 19th century, a movement was started by writers and other educated people of the country to rid the language of foreign words as much as possible and to create a new vocabulary and adapt the Icelandic language to the evolution of new concepts, thus avoiding the use of borrowed neologisms as are found in many other languages. Many old words which had fallen into disuse were recycled and given new senses in the modern language, and neologisms were created from Old Norse roots. For example, the word ' (\"electricity\"), literally means \"amber power\", calquing the derivation of the Greek root \"electr-\" from Greek ' (\"amber\"). Similarly, the word ' (\"telephone\") originally meant \"cord\", and ' (\"computer\") is a portmanteau of ' (\"digit; number\") and ' (\"seeress\").\n\nThe Icelandic alphabet is notable for its retention of two old letters which no longer exist in the English alphabet: Þ, þ (, modern English \"thorn\") and Ð, ð (, anglicised as \"eth\" or \"edh\"), representing the voiceless and voiced \"th\" sounds (as in English \"thin\" and \"this\"), respectively. The complete Icelandic alphabet is:\n\nThe letters with diacritics, such as ' and ', are for the most part treated as separate letters and not variants of their derivative vowels. The letter ' officially replaced ' in 1929, although it had been used in early manuscripts (until the 14th century) and again periodically from the 18th century. The letter ', which had been a part of the Icelandic alphabet for a long time but was no longer distinguished from ' in pronunciation, was officially removed in 1973.\n\nAs Icelandic shares its ancestry with English and both are Germanic languages, there are many cognate words in both languages; each have the same or a similar meaning and are derived from a common root. The possessive, though not the plural, of a noun is often signified with the ending \"\", as in English. Phonological and orthographical changes in each of the languages will have changed spelling and pronunciation. But a few examples are given below.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "393671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393671", "title": "Implicature", "text": "Implicature\n\nImplicature is a technical term within pragmatics, a subdiscipline of linguistics. It was coined by H. P. Grice to refer to what is \"suggested\" in an , even though neither expressed nor \"strictly implied\" (that is, entailed) by the utterance. As an example, the sentence \"Mary had a baby and got married\" strongly suggests that Mary had the baby before the wedding, but the sentence would still be \"strictly true\" if Mary had her baby after she got married. Further, if we append the qualification \"not necessarily in that order\" to the original sentence, then the implicature is now cancelled even though the meaning of the original sentence is not altered.\n\n\"Implicature\" is an alternative to \"implication\", which has additional meanings in logic and informal language.\n\nConversational implicatures are implicatures that arise during conversation, where the speaker voluntarily flouts, or violates, one of maxims in the maxims of conversation that create an implied meaning to the addressee. These conversational implicatures have many uses in creating an additional meaning to a given utterance.\n\nAs seen here, this utterance flouts the maxim of quantity because of the extra amount of information given about the types of options and pricing. Giving examples about the types of options at the restaurant and mentioning their prices gives much more information than needed in reference to a name of a restaurant. Also, this example flouts the maxim of relevance because the name of a restaurant is not directly relevant to a list of food items and prices.\n\nIn this context, the addressee is flouting the maxim of relevance, because the question of who is driving is not directly related to the number of people that someone's car can fit. Also, the use of \"only\" is a quantity maxim that semantically flouts that there is a maximum number of people that can fit in the car; and, that the number of people present exceeds this limit. \n\nIn this example, the addressee is flouting the maxim of quality because the utterance of mac and cheese is known to not always be dairy free. Since this utterance is not true, we can conclude that the maxim of quality is being violated. \n\nA key characteristic of conversational implicature is that it is context dependent. This means that the utterance will not give rise to the implicature if said in a different context. Conversational implicatures are cancellable, meaning that the implicature may be canceled with further information or context:\n\nWe see in example (a) the implicature underneath is created. However, with the introduction of new information in example (b), the speaker is able to cancel the conversational implicature which was arisen.\n\nScalar implicatures are implicatures that have both a semantic and pragmatic use in language. These types of implicatures are types of quantity maxims. Some of these implicatures include \"some\", \"few\", and \"many\".\n\nThe implicature itself has a meaning and social use that imply something about an object. For example:\nHere, the use of \"some\" semantically implies that more than one cookie was eaten. Consequently, \"some\" pragmatically implies that not every cookie was eaten, but more than one was.\nHere, the use of \"few\" semantically implies that more than one cupcake is needed, while pragmatically implies that more than one BUT not many are needed for the dinner.\n\nThe use of these implicatures flout to the addressee that semantically, a nonspecific amount exists in the utterance; and, pragmatically, that the quantity is defined in a certain interval of large or small.\n\nConventional implicature is independent of the cooperative principle and its four maxims. A statement always carries its conventional implicature.\n\nThis sentence implies poverty and happiness are not compatible but in spite of this Donovan is still happy. The conventional interpretation of the word \"but\" will always create the implicature of a sense of contrast. So \"Donovan is poor but happy\" will always necessarily imply \"Surprisingly Donovan is happy in spite of being poor\".\n\nImplicature differs from entailment. Sentences with implicatures are open to interpretation because they “require contextual factors and conventions [...] observed in conversation.” Entailments must follow the literal meaning of utterances and do not require context outside of a given utterance, and thus also cannot be cancelled.\n\nExample of entailment:\n\n\"If\" A is true, B must be true. “The President was assassinated” entails “The president is dead” No alterations can be made to the truth A without changing the truth of B.\n\nExample of implicature:\n\n\"If\" A is true, B and/or C can be true. “Raj was late to the wedding after he crashed his car” implicates “Raj was late to the wedding because he crashed his car” but could also mean “A week after crashing his car, Raj was late to the wedding.” Neither B nor C must be true for A to be true.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "379978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379978", "title": "In situ", "text": "In situ\n\nIn situ (; often not italicized in English) is a Latin phrase that translates literally to \"on site\" or \"in position.\" It can mean \"locally,\" \"on site,\" \"on the premises,\" or \"in place\" to describe an event where it takes place, and is used in many different contexts. For example, in fields such as physics, chemistry, or biology, \"in situ\" may describe the way a measurement is taken, that is, in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test.\n\nIn the aerospace industry, equipment on-board aircraft must be tested \"in situ\", or in place, to confirm everything functions properly as a system. Individually, each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems. Special test equipment is available for this \"in situ\" testing.\n\nIn archaeology, \"in situ\" refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition. In other words, it is stationary, meaning \"still.\" An artifact being \"in situ\" is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and, consequently, of the culture which formed it. Once an artifact's 'find-site' has been recorded, the artifact can then be moved for conservation, further interpretation and display. An artifact that is not discovered \"in situ\" is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture. However, the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of \"in situ\" artifacts yet to be discovered. When excavating a burial site or surface deposit \"in situ\" refers to cataloging, recording, mapping, photographing human remains in the position they are discovered.\n\nThe label \"in situ\" indicates only that the object has not been \"newly\" moved. Thus, an archaeological \"in situ\" find may be an object that was historically looted from another place, an item of \"booty\" of a past war, a traded item, or otherwise of foreign origin. Consequently, the \"in situ\" find site may still not reveal its provenance, but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown. It is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident (by humans, natural forces or animals). For example, in a Tell mound, where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal, or in land cleared or tilled for farming.\n\nThe term \"in situ\" is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the Sphinx or Petra. This distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the Colossi of Memnon, which was moved in ancient times.\n\nIn art, \"in situ\" refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site, or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited. For a more detailed account see: Site-specific art. The term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed, rather than one created in the artist's studio and then installed elsewhere (\"e.g.,\" a sculpture carved \"in situ\"). In architectural sculpture the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building, frequently from scaffolds, after the building has been erected.\nAlso commonly used to describe the site specific dance festival “Insitu”. Held in Queens, New York.\n\nA fraction of the globular star clusters in our galaxy, as well as those in other massive galaxies, might have formed \"in situ\". The rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies.\n\nIn astronomy, \"in situ\" also refers to \"in situ\" planet formation, in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit.\n\nIn biology and biomedical engineering, \"in situ\" means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs (i.e., without moving it to some special medium).\n\nIn the case of observations or photographs of living animals, it means that the organism was observed (and photographed) in the wild, exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found. This means it was not taken out of the area. The organism had not been moved to another (perhaps more convenient) location such as an aquarium.\n\nThis phrase \"in situ\" when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\". For example, examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be \"in situ\" investigation. This would not be \"in vivo\" as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation, but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone (a common scenario for \"in vitro\" experiments).\n\n\"In vitro\" was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab. Eventually, the limitation of \"in vitro\" experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments. To compensate for this problem, \"in vivo\" experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment. To bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies, \"in situ\" experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of \"in vitro\" to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of \"in vivo\" experimentation.\n\nIn conservation of genetic resources, \"\"in situ\" conservation\" (also \"on-site conservation\") is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat, as opposed to \"ex situ\" conservation (also \"off-site conservation\").\n\nIn chemistry, \"in situ\" typically means \"in the reaction mixture.\"\n\nThere are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized \"in situ\" in various processes. This may be done because the species is unstable, and cannot be isolated, or simply out of convenience. Examples of the former include the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome.\n\nIn biomedical engineering, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.\n\nIn chemical engineering, \"in situ\" often refers to industrial plant \"operations or procedures that are performed in place.\" For example, aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place (\"in situ\") without being removed from the reactors.\n\nIn architecture and building, \"in situ\" refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials. Compare that with \"prefabricated\" construction, in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly. For example, concrete slabs may be \"in situ\" (also \"cast-in-place\") or \"prefabricated\".\n\nIn situ techniques are often more labour-intensive, and take longer, but the materials are cheaper, and the work is versatile and adaptable. \"Prefabricated\" techniques are usually much quicker, therefore saving money on labour costs, but factory-made parts can be expensive. They are also inflexible, and must often be designed on a grid, with all details fully calculated in advance. Finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions.\n\nThe phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site. In this case, it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile.\n\nSite construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is \"cut\" out of one area and \"filled\" in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope. The term \"in situ\" distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified (filled) during construction. The differences in the soil properties for supporting building loads, accepting underground utilities, and infiltrating water persist indefinitely.\n\n. For example, a file backup may be restored over a running system, without needing to take the system down to perform the restore. In the context of a database, a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened. An \"in situ\" upgrade would allow an operating system, firmware or application to be upgraded while the system was still running, perhaps without the need to reboot it, depending on the sophistication of the system.\n\nAnother use of the term in-situ that appears in Computer Science focuses primarily on the use of technology and user interfaces to provide continuous access to situationally relevant information in various locations and contexts. Examples include athletes viewing biometric data on smartwatches to improve their performance , a presenter looking at tips on a smart glass to reduce their speaking rate during a speech , or technicians receiving online and stepwise instructions for repairing an engine. \n\n, that is, does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input ---except for space for recursive calls on the \"call stack.\" Typically such an algorithm operates on data objects directly in place rather than making copies of them. \n\nFor example, heapsort is an \"in situ\" sorting algorithm, which sorts the elements of an array in place. Quicksort is an \"in situ\" sorting algorithm, but in the worst case it requires linear space on the call stack (this can be reduced to log space). Merge sort is generally not written as an \"in situ\" algorithm. \n\nIn designing user interfaces, , for example, if a word processor displays an image and allows the image to be edited without launching a separate image editor, this is called \"in situ editing.\"\n\nAJAX partial page data updates is another example of \"in situ\" in a Web UI/UX context. \"Web 2.0\" included AJAX and the concept of asynchronous requests to servers to replace a portion of a web page with new data, without reloading\nthe entire page, as the early HTML model dictated. Arguably, \"all\" asynchronous data transfers or \"any\" background task is \"in situ\" as the normal state is normally unaware of background tasks, usually notified on completion\nby a callback mechanism.\n\nIn Big Data space, in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located, rather than the other way like in traditional RDBMS systems where data is moved to computational space.\n\nIn design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations. This is a pre-visualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept.\n\nIn physical geography and the Earth sciences, \"in situ\" typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport. For example, \"in situ\" is used in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion, the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium (such as wind, ice, or water), whereas weathering occurs \"in situ\". Geochemical processes are also often described as occurring to material \"in situ\".\n\nIn the atmospheric sciences, \"in situ\" refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject, such as a radiosonde measuring a parcel of air or an anemometer measuring wind, as opposed to remote sensing such as weather radar or satellites.\n\nIn economics, \"in situ\" is used when referring to the \"in place\" storage of a product, usually a natural resource. More generally, it refers to any situation where there is no out-of-pocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold. Examples of \"in situ\" storage would be oil and gas wells, all types of mineral and gem mines, stone quarries, timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested, and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay.\n\nIn electrochemistry, the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell, i.e., under potential control. This is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control. Potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrode/electrolyte interphasial region.\n\n\"In situ\" can refer to where a clean up or remediation of a polluted site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the soil, contrary to \"ex situ\" where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere, off site.\n\nIn experimental physics \"in situ\" typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment. For example, the Si(111) 7x7 surface reconstruction is visible using a scanning tunneling microscope when it is prepared and analyzed \"in situ\".\n\nIn psychology experiments, \"in situ\" typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting.\n\nIn gastronomy, \"in situ\" refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available at the site of the event. Here a person is not going to the restaurant, but the restaurant comes to the person's home.\n\nIn legal contexts, \"in situ\" is often used for its literal meaning. For example, in Hong Kong, \"\"in situ\" land exchange\" involves the government exchanging the original or expired lease of a piece of land with a new grant or re-grant with the same piece of land or a portion of that.\n\nIn the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term \"in situ\" is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory, i.e. the government \"in situ\".\n\nIn linguistics, specifically syntax, an element may be said to be \"in situ\" if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted. For example, questions in languages such as Chinese have \"in situ\" wh-elements, with structures comparable to \"John bought what?\" with \"what\" in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart (for example, \"John bought bread\"). An example of an English wh-element that is not \"in situ\" (see wh-movement): \"What did John buy?\"\n\nIn literature \"in situ\" is used to describe a condition. The Rosetta Stone, for example, was originally erected in a courtyard, for public viewing. Most pictures of the famous stone are not \"in situ\" pictures of it erected, as it would have been originally. The stone was uncovered as part of building material, within a wall. Its in situ condition today is that it is erected, vertically, on public display at the British Museum in London, England.\n\nIn oncology: for a carcinoma, \"in situ\" means that malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized, or invaded, beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered. This can happen anywhere in the body, such as the skin, breast tissue, or lung. This type of tumor can often, depending on where it is located, be removed by surgery.\n\nIn anatomy: \"in situ\" refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies. For example, one can open up a cadaver's abdominal cavity and view the liver \"in situ\" or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadaver's body.\n\nIn nursing, \"in situ\" describes any devices or appliances on the patient's body that remain in their desired and optimal position.\n\nIn medical simulation, \"in situ\" refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments, such as wards, operating rooms, and other settings, rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities.\n\nIn biomedical, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.\n\n\"In situ leaching\" or \"in situ recovery\" refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uranium-impregnated water to the surface for extraction.\n\n\"In situ\" refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earth's crust. There are several varieties of \"in situ\" techniques, but the ones which work best in the oil sands use heat (steam).\n\nThe most common type of \"in situ\" petroleum production is referred to as SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) this is becoming very popular in the Alberta Oil Sands.\n\nIn radio frequency (RF) transmission systems, \"in situ\" is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode, rather than operation in a test mode. For example, if an \"in situ\" wattmeter is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system, the wattmeter can accurately measure power while the station is \"on air.\"\n\nFuture space exploration or terraforming may rely on obtaining supplies \"in situ\", such as previous plans to power the Orion space vehicle with fuel minable on the moon. The Mars Direct mission concept is based primarily on the \"in situ\" fuel production using Sabatier reaction.\n\nIn the space sciences, \"in situ\" refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in, such as the detection of energetic particles in the solar wind, or magnetic field measurements from a magnetometer.\n\nIn urban planning, in-situ upgrading is an approach to and method of upgrading informal settlements.\n\nIn vacuum technology, \"in situ\" baking refers to heating parts of the vacuum system while they are under vacuum in order to drive off volatile substances that may be absorbed or adsorbed on the walls so they cannot cause outgassing.\n\nThe term \"in situ\", used as \"repair in situ,\" means to repair a vehicle at the place where it has a breakdown.\n\n"}

The Tat language is spoken by the Muslim Tats of Azerbaijan, a group to which the Mountain Jews were mistakenly considered to belong during the era of Soviet historiography though the languages probably originated in the same region of the Persian empire. The words \"Juvuri\" and \"Juvuro\" literally translate as \"Jewish\" and \"Jews\".\n\nJudeo-Tat has Semitic (Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic) elements on all linguistic levels. Judeo-Tat has the Semitic sound \"ayin/ayn\" (ع/ע), whereas no neighbouring languages have it.\n\nJudeo-Tat is an endangered language classified as \"definitely endangered\" by UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. \n\nThe language is spoken by an estimated 101,000 people:\n\nIn the early 20th century Judeo-Tat used the Hebrew script. In the 1920s the Latin script was adapted for it; later it was written in Cyrillic. The use of the Hebrew alphabet has enjoyed renewed popularity.\n\nJudeo-Tat is a Southwest Iranian language (as is modern Persian) and is much more closely related to modern Persian than most other Iranian languages of the Caucasus e.g. Talysh, Ossetian, and Kurdish. However, it also bears strong influence from other sources:\n\nMedieval Persian: Postpositions are used predominantly in lieu of prepositions e.g. modern Persian: باز او > Judeo-Tat \"æ uræ-voz\" \"with him/her\".\n\nArabic: like in modern Persian, a significant portion of the vocabulary is Arabic in origin. Unlike modern Persian, Judeo-Tat has almost universally retained the original pharyngeal/uvular phonemes of Arabic e.g. \"honey\" (Arab. ), \"morning\" (Arab. ).\n\nHebrew: As other Jewish dialects, the language also has many Hebrew loanwords e.g. \"table\" (Heb. ), \"luck\" (Heb. ), \"rich\" (Heb. ). Hebrew words are typically pronounced in the tradition of other Mizrahi Jews. Examples: and are pronounced pharyngeally (like Arabic ‎, respectively); is pronounced as a voiced uvular plosive (like Persian ). Classical Hebrew () and (kamatz), however, are typically pronounced as /v/ and /o/ respectively (similar to the Persian/Ashkenazi traditions, but unlike the Iraqi tradition, which retains and )\n\nAzeri: Vowel harmony and many loan words\n\nRussian: Loanwords adopted after the Russian Empire's annexation of Daghestan and Azerbaijan\n\nNortheast Caucasian languages: e.g. \"small\" (probably the same origin as the medieval Caucasian city name \"Sera-chuk\" mentioned by Ibn Battuta, meaning \"little Sera\")\n\nOther common phonology/morphology changes from classical Persian/Arabic/Hebrew:\n\nBeing a variety of the Tat language, Judeo-Tat itself can be divided into several dialects:\nThe dialects of Oğuz (formerly Vartashen) and the now extinct Jewish community of Mücü have not been studied well and thus cannot be classified.\n\n"}

{"id": "2304820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2304820", "title": "Kelantan-Pattani Malay", "text": "Kelantan-Pattani Malay\n\nKelantan-Pattani Malay, often referred to in Thailand as Yawi (in Thai) or Jawi (in Patani Malay), and in Kelantan as \"Baso Kelaté\", is an Austronesian language and a Malayic / Malayan language spoken in the Malaysian state of Kelantan and the neighbouring southernmost provinces of Thailand. It is the primary spoken language of Thai Malays, but is also used as a lingua franca by ethnic Southern Thais in rural areas, Muslim and non-Muslim, and the \"samsam\", a mostly Thai-speaking population of mixed Malay and Thai ancestry.\n\nKelantan–Pattani Malay is a highly divergent dialect of Malay because of the geographical isolation of the dialect from the rest of the Malay world by high mountains, deep rainforest and the Gulf of Thailand. In Thailand, it is influenced by Thai. Several varieties exist, but they are mutually comprehensible to the extent that native speakers of Pattani and Kelantanese often cannot differentiate each other.\n\nKelantanese–Pattani Malay is distinct enough that radio broadcasts in Standard Malay cannot be understood easily by native speakers of Kelantanese–Pattani Malay who are not taught the standard language, for example, those in Thailand. Unlike Malaysia where Standard Malay is compulsory in the school curriculum, no one is required to learn Standard Malay in Thailand, and so there is potentially less language influence from standard Malay but potentially more from Thai. It is different also from Kedah Malay and Terengganuan Malay, but both languages have close similarities with the Kelantanese-Pattani Malay language.\n\nThe language is often referred to in Thai as \"Phasa Yawi\" (Thai: ภาษายาวี ), which is a corruption of the Malay name for the modified Arabic alphabet for writing Malay, Jawi (Yawi: جاوي, Rumi: Jawi, ). It is also referred to in Thai as \"Phasa Malayu Pattani\" (Thai: ภาษามลายูปัตตานี ) and similarly locally in Malay as \"Bahasa Malayu Patani\" (Jawi: بهاس ملايو ڤطاني, Rumi: Bahasa Melayu Patani, ). The dialect is often simply just called \"Bahasa Patani\".\n\nKelantanese is known in Standard Malay as , and in Kelantanese as \"Baso Kelate\".\n\nPattani Malay is the main language of the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani where the Malay ethnic group is the dominant one. Also some part of Songkhla. It is less spoken in Satun, where even the ethnic Malays generally speak Southern Thai and Kedah Malay. It is also spoken in scattered villages as far north as Hat Yai. In the past, Malay was the main language as far north as the Isthmus of Kra, the traditional division between Central Thailand and Southern Thailand, based on the preponderance of etymologically Malay place names.\n\nKelantanese is spoken in the state of Kelantan, as well as in Besut and Setiu districts of Terengganu and the Perhentian Islands. Also in Merapoh district of Pahang. Many people in the districts of Baling, Sik and Padang Terap in Kedah as well as Grik and Hulu Perak districts of Perak speak Kelantanese dialects, since most of the Malay people there are the descendants of Kelantanese migrants and Pattani refugees.\n\nKelantanese Malay has an older and a richer literary history than standard Malay. It is written in the Jawi alphabet, based on the Arabic script, which is where the name \"Yawi/Jawi\" for the language comes from. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the general population of Malay speakers in both Malaysia and Indonesia that now use the Latin script, known in Malay as \"rumi\" (رومي), for daily communication. Today, Pattani Malay itself is generally not a written language, though it is sometimes written in informal settings or eye dialect. When writing is needed, an old-fashioned variety of standard Malay is used rather than the local dialect. A phonetic rendering of Pattani Malay in the Thai alphabet has been introduced, but it has not met with much success, due to the socio-religious significance of Jawi to Muslim Malays, as well as because of numerous inconsistencies and inaccuracies.\n\nSouthern Thailand has continued to be a region affected by two cultural spheres: the mainly Buddhist, Thai-speaking Siamese kingdoms and the mainly Muslim, Malay-speaking sultanates. The region was a warehouse of trade where merchants from Europe, India, Arabia, China, Siam, and the other Malay world met. At first dominated by Hindu-Buddhist Indian influences, the great kingdom of Srivijaya would later fall in chaos. Islam was introduced by Arab and Indian traders in the 11th century and has been the dominant religion ever since, replacing the Buddhism and Hinduism that had held sway before. By the 14th century, the area became vassals to Ayutthaya, but the region was autonomous and never fully incorporated into the modern Thai nation-state till 1902. This political autonomy and isolation from the rest of the Malay world allowed for preservation of the Malay language and culture but also led to the divergence of the dialect.\n\nKelantanese is different enough from Standand Malay that it is often unintelligible to speakers of the standard language. Differences include different vocabulary, but also involve regular sound changes. The influence of Southern Thai and Pattani Malay upon each other is great, and both have large numbers of loanwords from the other. The influence of the Thai language is one factor that makes comprehension between Pattani Malay and Standard Malay difficult.\n\nPronunciation\n\n"}

(Ostana Premio Scritture in Lingua Madre) He writes in Yoruba and English.\n\nTubosun was born in Ibadan, Nigeria on 22 September 1981, and holds a Masters in Linguistics from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (2012) and a BA from the University of Ibadan (2005). He also studied briefly at Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya, in April 2005, as part of a MacArthur Foundation-sponsored Socio-Cultural Exchange Programme.\n\nHe was granted a Fulbright scholarship in 2009 through which he taught Yoruba at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2009–10. In 2010, he worked as a volunteer adult literacy tutor, with resettled immigrants, at the International Institute of St. Louis, Missouri, and later as a high school teacher of English language in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nTubosun is known for his work in language advocacy. In 2012, he started an online campaign to demand that Twitter include Yoruba (his mother tongue) in the list of languages into which Twitter was being translated: 1 March 2012 was declared \"the Tweet Yoruba Day\" to call attention to the matter. The campaign involved other speakers of Yoruba online tweeting only in the language and directing their comments to the Twitter translation platform, and it eventually yielded first an acknowledgment of the protest and then a promise to act in support of the idea.\n\nThe campaign continued on 1 March 2013 and again on 1 March 2014. In August 2014, Twitter announced through a tweet that they were now adding Yoruba (along with Esperanto) to the translation platform, ending the two years of advocacy.\n\nTubosun founded the \"Yorùbá Names Project\" at YorubaName.com in March 2015 after months of crowdfunding as an effort to document all names in Yoruba in an accessible multimedia format while bringing together a community of interested linguists and other culture enthusiasts to document the African cultural and linguistic experience on the web. He is also involved in setting up a version for Igbo language at IgboName.com. On 8 August 2015, the project released a free Yorùbá Keyboard software for Mac and Windows to allow its users type in Yorùbá language on the internet with an update to cater for Igbo in July 2016.\n\nIn November 2017, the project released the first online speech synthesizer for Yoruba, created after crowdfunding and months of research In December 2017, in collaboration with the Orisha Image Blog, the project released a free Yoruba learning audio course.\n\nBetween October 2015 and July 2016, Tubosun worked as a Linguist at Google with the Speech team as Project Manager.\n\nWhile at Google, he was also instrumental to changing the erstwhile inaccurate translation of Esu on Google Translate, which had hitherto caused a lot of backlash in the Yoruba language community.\n\nTubosun has contributed to Nigerian writing since 2005, through poetry, travel writing, essay, prose, and literary criticism. His work has appeared in the International Literary Quarterly, Sentinel Poetry, Brittle Paper, Ake Review and Enkare Review.\n\nIn September 2005, Tubosun released a chapbook of poems called \"Headfirst into the Meddle,\" to a limited audience. In 2015, he followed it with \"Attempted Speech & Other Fatherhood Poems\", published by Saraba Magazine. It contains poems written about the experience of raising a child.\n\nIn October 2006, his poem \"Here, Moving\" won the Sentinel Poetry Bar Challenge.\n\nIn 2018, he announced the publication of his first full collection of poems \"Edwardsville by Heart\" (November 2018), a travelogue-memoir to be published by Wisdom's Bottom Press, UK.\n\nSince 2009, Tubosun has blogged at KTravula.com to document travel, teaching, writing, and student experiences in the United States, Nigeria, and other places. \n\nIn 2010, he contributed to 234Next as a travel writer.\n\nIn October 2015, he was nominated for the CNN African Journalists Award for his travel piece \"Abeokuta's Living History\", first published at KTravula.com. He was the first ever blogger on the award shortlist.\n\nIn September 2018, he accompanied Brandon Stanton from Humans of New York as a guide while the latter was in Nigeria.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Tubosun worked as the pioneering editor of a Literary Magazine of new writing from Nigerian and Africa called \"NTLitMag\".\n\nIn November 2015, he co-edited as well as \"Aké Review\", the literary publication of the Aké Arts and Book Festival, with Kolade Arogundade.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, while he taught as a schoolteacher, he edited two issues of \"The Sail\", an anthology of creative works of high school students.\n\nHis work of literary criticism has appeared in the \"NTLitMag, Aké Review,\" Brittle Paper, and Enkare Review.\n\nIn 2016, he wrote the entry on Nnedi Okorafor's science fiction novel \"Lagoon\" for \"Imaginary Wonderlands\" (October, 2016), a collection of essays about invented worlds in literature from around the globe, from Dante to Rushdie. The book was edited by Laura Miller (writer).\n\nTubosun's work in localizing the predictive text input product \"T9\" was detailed in a memoir/ essay for Farafina Magazine in 2007 titled \"Speaking the Machine\".\n\nIn February 2014, he was part of the Cassava Republic Press Ankara Press Valentine Anthology, which had short stories about love by African writers translated into local languages.\n\nIn November 2016, at the Aké Arts and Book Festival, he was instrumental in translating a short story by Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o into Yoruba language, part of which he read out at the festival.\n\nTubosun was the president of the Union of Campus Journalists at University of Ibadan (2002-2004) during which time he helped institute two prizes for student journalists, as well as set up the first internship opportunities for student journalists with prominent media houses in the country. Some students from that program became full-time journalists upon graduation.\n\nIn September 2016, after the demolition of Ilojo Bar, a national monument on Lagos Island, he published a three-part investigative feature in the Nigerian Guardian about the causes, cost, and consequences of the demolition.\n\nIn 2003, during a nine-month strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, Tubosun created a petition online admonishing the president and minister of education in Nigeria and warning them of the dangers of a continued elongation of the industrial strike to students and the educational system.\n\nIn November 2016, after the election of Donald Trump, he co-wrote a petition to restate \"our respect for the dignity of people of all races, faiths, creeds, classes, abilities, ancestries, gender identities, and sexual orientations\" and express support for the goals of the Fulbright Program \"to bring a little more knowledge, a little more reason, and a little more compassion into world affairs and thereby increase the chance that nations will learn at last to live in peace and friendship\" warning that cuts to the program will jeopardize its goals. The petition was signed by about 2000 Fulbright Program grantees and alumni. The Fulbright Program has so far survived the proposed cut to the US government budget.\n\nHe has been listed in 2015 and 2016 in the YNaija list of Nigeria's innovators in technology \n\nIn 2016, he was named in the Quartz African Innovator's List. He was also listed in the \"40 Under 40\" Innovators for 2017 by Ventures Africa.\n\nIn January 2016, he was chosen as a recipient of a Premio Ostana \"Special Prize\" for Mother Tongue Literature (Il Premio Ostana Internazionale Scritture in Lingua Madre 2016), a prize given to any individual who has done writing and notable advocacy for the defence of an indigenous language. The prize ceremony was held from 2 to 5 June 2016, in the town of Ostana (Cuneo, Italy). Tubosun was the first African to be so honoured by the organisation.\n\nIn April 2017, Tubosun joined \"nearly 300 participants from over 80 countries around the world, including key players involved in the fields of government, arts, philanthropy, heritage preservation, education, media, science and technology\" at Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi, to \"explore... a wide range of topics all focused on answering how cultural tools can be used to help address significant international challenges and seize emerging opportunities.\" It was the first edition of the Culture Summit, sponsored by Foreign Policy Magazine.\n\nTubosun was one of the 160 writers and artists countries invited from eighteen countries around the world to participate in the \"Cultural Olympics\" in Seoul and Pyeongchang, preceding the 2018 Winter Olympics. The event aimed \"to bring the world together through sport, writers at the event are sharing their ideas on how to tackle some of the difficulties around the world\n\nPoetry\n\n\n\nEdited\n\n\n\nEssays\n\n\n"}

It maintains a consistent meaning regardless of the context, with \"the intended meaning corresponding exactly to the meaning\" of the individual words. Figurative use of language is the use of words or phrases that \"implies a non-literal meaning which does make sense or that could [also] be true\".\n\nAristotle and later the Roman Quintilian were among the early analysts of rhetoric who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language.\n\nIn 1769, Frances Brooke's novel \"The History of Emily Montague\" was used in the earliest \"Oxford English Dictionary\" citation for the figurative sense of \"literally\"; the sentence from the novel used was, \"He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally \"to feed among the lilies\".\" This citation was also used in the OED's 2011 revision.\n\nWithin literary analysis, such terms are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.\n\nFigurative language can take multiple forms, such as simile or metaphor. \"Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature\" says that figurative language can be classified in five categories: resemblance or relationship, emphasis or understatement, figures of sound, verbal games, and errors. \n\nA simile is a comparison of two things, indicated by some connective, usually \"like\", \"as\", \"than\", or a verb such as \"resembles\" to show how they are similar.\n\nA metaphor is a figure of speech in which two \"essentially unlike things\" are shown to have a type of resemblance or create a new image. The similarities between the objects being compared may be implied rather than directly stated.\n\nAn extended metaphor is a metaphor that is continued over multiple sentences.\n\nOnomatopoeia is a word designed to be an imitation of a sound.\n\nPersonification is the attribution of a personal nature or character to inanimate objects or abstract notions, especially as a rhetorical figure.\n\nAn oxymoron is a figure of speech in which a pair of opposite or contradictory terms is used together for emphasis.\n\nA paradox is a statement or proposition which is self-contradictory, unreasonable, or illogical.\n\nHyperbole is a figure of speech which uses an extravagant or exaggerated statement to express strong feelings.\n\nAllusion is a reference to a famous character or event.\n\nAn idiom is an expression that has a figurative meaning unrelated to the literal meaning of the phrase.\n\nA pun is an expression intended for a humorous or rhetorical effect by exploiting different meanings of words.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, the \"standard pragmatic\" model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension. Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.\n\nBeginning with the work of Michael Reddy in his 1979 work \"The Conduit Metaphor\", many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a \"literal\" and \"figurative\" mode of language.\n\n"}
{"id": "355247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355247", "title": "Mam language", "text": "Mam language\n\nMam is a Mayan language spoken by about half a million Mam people in the Guatemalan departments of Quetzaltenango, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Retalhuleu, and the Mexican state of Chiapas. Thousands more make up a Mam diaspora throughout the United States and Mexico, with notable populations living in Oakland, California and Washington, D.C.\n\nMam is closely related to the Tektitek language, and the two languages together form the Mamean sub-branch of the Mayan language family. Along with the Ixilan languages, Awakatek and Ixil, these make up the Greater Mamean sub-branch, one of the two branches of the Eastern Mayan languages (the other being the Greater Quichean sub-branch, which consists of 10 Mayan languages, including K'iche').\n\nBecause contact between members of different Mam communities is somewhat limited, the language varies considerably even from village to village. Nevertheless, mutual intelligibility, though difficult, is possible through practice.\n\nMam varieties within Guatemala are divided into four dialect groups:\n\n\nIn addition to these, the dialects of Chiapas, Mexico may form a fifth dialect group, characterised by significant grammatical as well as lexical differences from the Guatemalan varieties.\n\nMam is spoken in 64 communities in four Guatemalan departments and 18 communities in Chiapas, Mexico. Neighboring languages include Jakaltek and Q'anjob'al to the north, Tektitek to the west, and Ixil, Awakatek, Sipacapense, and K'iche' to the east.\n\nQuetzaltenango Department\n\nHuehuetenango Department\nSan Marcos Department\n\nRetalhuleu Department\nChiapas\n\nMam has 10 vowels, 5 short and 5 long:\n\n\nLike in many other Mayan languages, vowel length is contrastive, and short and long vowels have different phonemic values and are treated as separate vowels. The long versions of the back vowels, /o/, /u/, /ɑ/ vowels, transcribed as [oo], [uu], and [aa] are slightly compressed and pronounced as /o͍ː/, /u͍ː/, and /ɑ͍ː/ respectively, being partially rounded.\n\nIn the Todos Santos dialect the vowel structure is somewhat different. While /o/, /a/, and /u/ remain the same as in other varieties, short /e/ has become the diphthong /ɛi/, an audio example of this can be heard here:\n\nIn the Todos Santos dialect, the long vowels (distinguished by the doubling of the letter) have evolved into separate sounds altogether. Long /aː/ has become /ɒ/, long /oː/ has become /øː/ and long /uː/ has become /yː/.\n\nIn some dialects vowels interrupted by stop have evolved into individual phonemes themselves, for example in Todos Santos dialect\n/oʔ/ represented by o' has evolved into /ɵʏˀ/ and /oʔo/ represented by o'o has evolved into /ɵ'ʉ/.\n\nMam has 27 consonants, including the glottal stop:\n\n/ɓ/ is realized as [βʼ] word-finally and when part of a consonant cluster in many dialects. In the Todos Santos dialect it is pronounced as [v] as part of a consonant cluster and as [βv̻] word finally.\n\n/p/ is realized as [pʰ] word-finally and word initially, [p] elsewhere, [ɸ] in a consonant cluster and before short i, o, and u. It is pronounced as [ɸʰ] word finally in certain dialects. [f] is an interchangeable pronunciation of [ɸ].\n\n/ch/ has evolved from /tʃ/ to /sʃ/ in most Mexican dialects and some northern Guatemalan dialects. Sometimes the /t/ sound is still lightly pronounced before the stressed /sʃ/ sound.\n\n/t/ is realized as [tʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [t] elsewhere.\n\n/k/ is realized as [kʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [k] elsewhere.\n\n/w/ can be pronounced [ʋ], [v], [v̥] or [β] word initially, [w], [ʍ] [ʋ] following a consonant, and [ʋ], [v], [v̻ʰ] or [fʰ] word finally. It is freely variable between [w] [v] [ʋ] [v̥] in all other positions with [ʋ] being the most common pronunciation. In the Todos Santos dialect, /w/ is realized as either [v] or [ʋ] word-initially or between vowels and before another consonant, as [ʍ] following a consonant and as [v̥] word finally.\n\n/q/ is realized as [qʰ] word-finally and before another consonant, [q] elsewhere.\n\n/tʼ/ is realized interchangeably as [tʼ] and [ɗ] word-initially and -finally, after a vowel or before [l].\n\n/n/ is realized as [ŋ] before velar- and uvular consonants and word-finally,as [ɲ] before [j] and as [m] before /ɓ/ and /p/, [n] elsewhere.\n\n/l/ is realized as [l̥] word-finally, [ɺ] before short vowels and after plosives, bilabial, aveolar and retroflex consonants and [l] elsewhere. \n\n/ky/ is realized as [kɕʲ] in front of another consonant and kɕʰ word finally. It is pronounced as kʲ in all other instances.\n\n/ ' / is realized as [ʲʔ] following /a/, /aa/, /e/, /ee/, /i/, /u/, /uu/ and /oo/. The standard pronunciation is simply [ʔ] after all vowels however in spoken speech [ʲʔ] is the common pronunciation. A similar trend can be seen in other Eastern Mayan languages. After /o/ it is pronounced as [ʉʔ] and after /ii/ it is pronounced simply as [ʔ]. Following consonants / ' / modifies each individual consonant differently as explained in the section above. In the Mam language every word must start with a consonant. In the current orthography initial / ' / is not written but if a word ever begins with a vowel, the word is treated as if it begin with a / ' /. The initial / ' / may be pronounced as either [ʔ] or [ʡ] in free variation.\n\nThe most extensive Mam grammar is that of Nora C. England's \"A grammar of Mam, a Mayan language\" (1983), which is based on the San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán dialect of Huehuetenango Department.\n\nThe basic word order of Mam is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object, Verb-Ergative-Absolutive, or Verb-Agent-Patient). Most roots take the morphological shape CVC (England 1983:93). The only possible root final consonant cluster is -\"nC\".\n\nMam has no independent pronouns (England 1983:155). Rather, pronouns in Mam always exist as bound morphemes.\n\nBelow is a table of Set A (ergative) and Set B (absolutive) prefixes from England (1983:56). (\"Note: The terms \"Set A\" and \"Set B\" are frequently used by Mayanists to describe the ergative systems typical of Mayan languages.\")\n\nPhonologically conditioned allomorphs are as follows.\nWhen Set A prefixes can also be used with nouns. In this context, the Set A prefixes become possessives.\nSome paradigmatic examples from England (1983) are given below. Note that \"Ø-\" designates a null prefix. Additionally, \"ma\" is an aspectual word meaning 'recent past.'\n\nThe following Set B person markers are used for non-verbal predicates (i.e., nouns, adjectives). Also, in statives, \"aa\" can be omitted when the rest of the stative is a non-enclitic (in other words, a separate, independent word).\n\nParadigmatic examples from England (1983:76) are given below.\n\nThe Mam language displays inalienable possession. Certain Mam nouns cannot be possessed, such as \"kya7j\" 'sky' and \"che7w\" 'star' (England 1983:69). On the other hand, some Mam nouns are always possessed, such as \"t-lok' \" 'its root' and \"t-b'aq' \" 'its seed'.\n\nNoun phrase structure can be summarized into the following template (England 1983:140).\n\nThe plural clitic is \"qa\".\n\nNoun affixes\n\nRelational noun affixes\n\nLocative affixes\nClassifiers\n\nMeasure words<br>\nMeasure words quantify mass nouns.\n\nSan Ildefonso Ixtahuacán Mam numbers are as follows (England 1983:84). Numbers above twenty are rarely used in Ixtahuacán and are usually only known by elderly speakers. Although the number system would have originally been vigesimal (i.e., base 20), the present-day number system of Ixtahuacán is now decimal.\n\n1. juun <br>\n2. kab' <br>\n3. oox <br>\n4. kyaaj <br>\n5. jwe7 <br>\n6. qaq <br>\n7. wuuq <br>\n8. wajxaq <br>\n9. b'elaj <br>\n10. laaj <br>\n20. wiinqan <br>\n40. kya7wnaq <br>\n60. oxk'aal <br>\n80.. junmutx'\n\nLike all other Mayan languages, Mam is an ergative language. \n\nTransitive verbal affixes\nIntransitive verbal affixes\n\nOther verbal affixes\nAspects<br>\nMam verbs have 6 aspects that are prefixed to the verb root (England 1983: 58, 161-162).\nModes\nDirectionals<br>\nDirectionals are auxiliary elements in verb phrases.

{"id": "40202568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40202568", "title": "Na'vi grammar", "text": "Na'vi grammar\n\nThe grammar of the constructed Na'vi language was created for the movie \"Avatar\" by Paul Frommer. It is a tripartite, primarily affixing agglutinative language.\n\nLenition is a phonological change that is the result of the application of certain prefixes:\nConventional notation uses + to denote a prefix that causes lenition.\n\nSince Na'vi does not make the distinction between long and short vowels, if the application of an affix results in two of the same vowels in a row, it usually is shortened to one. There is also some nasal assimilation of place. Specific affixes listed hereafter will list there variants. Many prefixes combine with each other to form slight variants\n\nNa'vi has a singular, dual, trial and plural number. The dual prefix is me+, the trial is pxe+ and the general plural ay+. All of these prefixes cause lenition. If the ay+ prefix causes a word to undergo lenition, the prefix may be dropped and the modified stem is also considered the general plural, and is known as the short plural\nThe prefix fra- indicates means \"every\".\n\nThe prefix fì- indicates proximal deixis. When used as a plural, it becomes fay+.\npayoang \"fish\" → fìpayoang \"this fish\"\nThe prefix tsa- indicates distal dexis. When used as a plural, it becomes tsay+.\n\nThere is also the prefix fne- which means a type, sort or class of the noun it is attached to.\n\nThe suffix -o marks the noun as indefinite (i.e. \"some\").\nThe suffix -tsyìp is used as a diminutive/endearment suffix.\nThe suffix -fkeyk make the noun refers to the state of the noun to which it is attached.\n\nNa'vi does not have grammatical gender, but it has two suffixes that indicate the gender of a noun: the feminine suffix -e and the masculine suffix -an. These are not mandatory.\n\nNa'vi is a tripartite language which means that the subject of an intransitive verb takes the intransitive case. The subject of a transitive verb takes the ergative case, which is -l on nouns ending with vowels and -ìl on nouns ending with consontants. The object of a transitive verb takes the accusative case, which is \"-t\" on nouns that end with a vowel and \"-ìt\"\n\nExample: oel ngati tse’a\n\nThe dative case is -r or -ru on nouns ending with a vowel, and -ìr on nouns ending with a consonant.\nThe genitive case is -yä, except on nouns ending with o or u, where it is -ä, or nouns ending with -ia that become -iä.\nThe topical case is -ri on nouns ending with a vowel, and -ìri on nouns ending with a vowel.\n\nThe suffix -yu turns a verb into an agent noun.\nThe prefix tì, in combination with the infix -us-, forms the gerund.\nThe suffix -tswo creates a noun indicating the ability to do the verb.\n\nNa'vi verbs primarily use affixes to modify their meaning. They do not conjugate for person, but for tense. Each affix has a specific location.\n\nWhen an infix is added to a Na'vi syllable, the infix goes after the initial consonant but before the vowel. There are three positions where an infix is added: the pre-first preposition, which goes immediately before the first position, the first position, which goes in the penultimate syllable, and the second position, which goes in the final syllable. If the verb is monosyllabic, all three positions go after each other. If the verb is a compound, the infixes only go in the head\n\nThe causative infix is -eyk-. When a causative verb is used, the ergative becomes the dative, and the accusative remains as it is.\n\nThe reflexive infix is -äp-. When it is used with -eyk-, it always comes first (-äpeyk-)\n\nThere are four types of tense infixes, which mark for the past, near past, general, near future and future tenses, and that mark for the general, imperfective, and perfective aspects\nThe first type are the regular ones\n\nThere are two future intent infixes.\n\nThere are also a few subjunctive infixes\nNa'vi has a few modal verbs, which when used, they must take the tense affixes and the modified verb must take the general subjunctive. The subject of the modal verb takes the intransitive case.\n\nExample:\n’emyu new syuvet ayfol yivom\n\nThere are four infixes in this category, two indicating affect, two indicating speaker judgement. The infix -ei- indicate that the speaker is happy about the verb. The infix -äng- indicates that the speaker is unhappy about the verb. The variant -eiy- of -ei- is used behind i,ì, ll, and rr and the variant -eng- of -äng- is used behind i\n\nThe infix -ats- is used to indicate that the speaker is uncertain of the accuracy of his or her statement. There is also the honorific infix -uy-.\n\nAdjectives are created with the -a- affix. Adjectives can go before or after the noun that they modify. If the ajective is before the noun -a becomes a suffix, and if the adjective is after the noun, a- becomes a prefix. \nCompare the two ways of saying \"the long river\" (kilvan \"river\", ngim \"long\")\nand\n\nNa'vi has an active participle infix -us-, and the passive participle infix -awn-\n\nThere are two prefixes that mark ability tsuk- indicates that the subject (ergative) is able to perform the verb. It is negated with ke-. These turn a verb into an adjective \n\nNouns can be turned into adjective modifiers with the prefix le-. If this kind of adjective is used after the noun in question, the a- affix is usually dropped. When it is used is after the prefix ke- they become kel-. If the ke- goes before le-, they become kel-.\n\nThe Na'vi copula is the verb lu. They can be linked to nouns or adjectives. Number is only required to be declared once in a phrase involving lu Adjectives linked with lu are not required to have the -a- affix\nThe verb lu can also be used in the sense of having. In this case, the possessor takes the dative suffix.\n\nExample: lu poru tstxo\n\nYes–no questions are formed with the word srak(e), which can go at the beginning or end of a clause (It has no e if it occurs at the end of a clause.\n\nThe affix -pe+ is used to form question words when attached to a noun, which means which. It can go before or after the noun, and it causes lenition if placed before the noun. If it is a prefix, and the noun is plural, they will combine and become pem+ (dual), pep+ (trial) or pay+ (plural).\n\nNa'vi pronouns have the same declension as any other noun. The pronouns are declined for four persons: 1st person inclusive, 1st person exclusive, 2nd person, and 3rd person animate. Most of the plural forms of the various pronouns are made from the addition of the number prefixes to the singular. \n\nThe singular inanimate 3rd person is tsa'u, the demonstrative pronoun. The reflexive pronoun is sno, and the indefinite personal pronoun is fko.\n\nAdpositions may go before or after the noun they modify. If it is before, then it is a separate word, but if after they are attach to the noun they modify.\n\nRelative clauses are formed with the particle a. If the head noun is the ergative or accusative of the phrase it modifies, it is not present in the relative clause. If the head of the relative clause uses any other case or adposition, a resumptive pronoun is used.\n\nA conditional is use the words txo and tsakrr. The condidion goes after txo, and takes the subjunctive case, then the consequent goes after the tsakrr (which is often omitted) and takes the relevant case.\nA counter-factual conditional uses the words zun for the condition and zel for the consequent, and uses the subjunctive in both clauses\n\nNa'vi's native number system is an octal one. The numbers 0-7, 10 (8), and 100 (64) are\nThe powers of eight are combined with special prefixes to create multiples of powers of eight. These are the first syllable of the corresponding number, except for 1, which has none, and 2, which has me- instead of mu-.

Although he was very popular in his time and a giant in Yiddish literature, sometimes styled the \"Dumas of Yiddish literature\", he was significantly damaged by Sholem Aleichem, who derided his plotting as extravagantly artificial and improbable, characteristic of a cheap potboiler.\n\nSchaikewitz was born at Nesvizh, in the then government of Minsk, in the Russian Empire, on December 18, 1849. He distinguished himself as a clever story-teller even as a boy. His first literary efforts took the form of short stories in Hebrew for \"Ha-Meliẓ\"; in this way he became acquainted with such writers of Hebrew as Ẓebi Hirsch Scherschewski, Dobsevage, and others. Later he became a business manager in Vilnius, and spent some time in traveling. While in Bucharest he came under the influence of the Jewish theater and resolved to become a dramatic author. He then settled in Odessa, where he became theatrical manager and playwright at the Mariinski Theatre. His play \"Der Rewizor\" (Odessa, 1883), an adaptation from Gogol's \"Revizor\" (\"The Government Inspector\"), proved very successful and showed Schaikewitz's talent as a writer. After the Jewish theater was closed in Russia, Schaikewitz went to New York in 1888, where he edited \"Der Menschenfreund\" and \"Der Jüdischer Puck\", two Yiddish-language weeklies.\n\nSchaikewitz is the author of several Hebrew novels, all representing Jewish life in Russian towns. Among these are: \"Mumar le-Hak'is\" (Warsaw, 1879); \"Kewiyah Taḥat Kewiyah\" and \"Ṭa'ut Goi\" (Warsaw. 1880); and \"Ha-Niddaḥat\" (vols. 1 and 2, Vilnius, 1886; vol. 3, Warsaw, 1887). He also wrote \"Ḳayin\" (Warsaw, 1887), a novel on Jewish life in Portugal. But Schaikewitz became especially known as a writer in Yiddish, taking as a model, and finally excelling, Isaac Meir Dick. He wrote over two hundred novels in Yiddish, partly historical and partly reflecting Jewish life in the small towns and villages of Russia in the middle of the nineteenth century. As his language is simple, just as was spoken by the Jewish masses in Lithuania, his novels had the effect of greatly decreasing the fanaticism which prevailed in the small rural and urban communities. Among his more popular novels were \"Der Ḳaṭorzḥnikh\", \"Der Blutiger Adieu\", and \"Der Frumer Merder\". Many of his historical novels appeared in the Yiddish daily press.\n\nOver thirty of Schaikewitz's plays were produced, first in Russia, then in New York, among them being one entitled \"Tisza-Eslar\", on the subject of the blood accusation brought in the Hungarian town of that name. Others included \"Der Bel Tchuve\" (The Penitent) and \"Trefnyak\" (The Impure One). He was the subject of vitriolic attacks by S. Rabinovitz (\"Sholem Aleichem\"), who directed against him his \"Shomer's Mishpaṭ\" (Berdychev, 1888), reproaching him for his literary deficiencies. Schaikewitz successfully defended himself in a pamphlet entitled \"Yehi Or\" (New York, 1898), showing that his literary problem was to satisfy every plane of intelligence, from the householder to the servant-girl who could not understand the works of the later Yiddish writers. Jacob Adler later wrote of his melodramas that \"Nothing so crude as this can be found in Goldfaden... [but] the humor in Sheikevitch is more believable.\"\n"}

The goal of predictive manufacturing system (PMS) is to enable machine and systems with “self-aware” capabilities. The core technology of PMS in order to deliver “self-aware” capabilities is the smart computational agent that will contain advanced analytics to conduct predictive modeling functionalities.\n\nTransparency in an organization allows unraveling and even quantifying sources of uncertainty. It is an objective estimation of the company’s manufacturing capability and readiness. Most manufacturing strategies (such as mass production, lean manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, and reconfigurable manufacturing) haphazardly assume continuous equipment availability and constant maximum performance, which may never occur in a real factory. Manufacturing machines, like any other mechanical engineering assets, are prone to wear and tear that inhibit uninterrupted uptime. In order to achieve transparency within a facility, manufacturing industry is then asked to metamorphose into predictive manufacturing system so that data can be systematically processed into information that can explain the uncertainties and thereby enable users of the manufacturing assets to make more informed and evidence-based decisions.\n\nThe foundations of predictive manufacturing have already been laid out with the aggressive adoption of “Internet of Things” (IoT) principles wherein essential structures such as smart sensor networks and smart machines have become more prevalent. \nSuch scenario enables for seamless aggregation of data from assets (or asset fleet) on to a central location for appropriate processing. With the discovery and development of more advanced analytics, such data can then be transformed into information that can provide clarity or transparency, eventually addressing the uncertainties in the factory.\n\nAn illustration of the conceptual framework of a predictive manufacturing system is shown in Figure 1. The system starts out with a data acquisition system that can either be built-in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a third party provider. Using appropriate sensor assemblies, various signals such as vibration, pressure, temperature, etc. can be recorded. The types of signals and data acquisition parameters are determined by the application and the failure modes of the asset being monitored. Communication protocols, such as MTConnect and OLE-DB Process Control or OPC, can help users to acquire process or controller signals. Such data can provide context as to the type of action/function the machine was performing when sensor data was being collected. Imagine when all data are gathered and combined with all the assets in a facility. When all the data are aggregated, this phenomenon is called “Big Data” because of the volume of data collected, velocity by which data is being received and variety of data that are being collated. Such phenomenon requires new paradigms and approaches for analysis instead of statistical process control or other traditional statistical analysis techniques. The new transforming agent then consists of several components: an integrated platform, predictive analytics and visualization tools. The deployment platform is naturally selected based on several factors such as speed of computation, investment cost, ease of deployment for scaling purposes and update, etc. The actual processing or transformation of big data into useful information is performed by utilizing predictive analytics such as the tools found in the Watchdog Agent® toolbox that has been developed by researchers at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Research Cooperative Center (I/UCRC) for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) since 2001. There are also other predictive analytic providers such as IBM, Hadoop, SAS, SAP, etc. The algorithms found in the Watchdog Agent® can be categorized into four sections namely, signal processing and feature extraction, health assessment, performance prediction and fault diagnosis. By utilizing visualization tools, health information such as current condition, remaining useful life estimation, root cause, etc., can be effectively conveyed using radar charts, fault maps, risk charts and even health degradation curves. The calculated health information can then be forwarded or made available to existing company management systems such as enterprise resource planning system (ERP), manufacturing execution system (MES), supply chain management system (SCM), customer relation management system (CRM), product lifecycle management system (PLM) to achieve overall enterprise control and optimization. With manufacturing transparency, management then has the appropriate information (such as actual condition and state of machines, not just cycle times) to determine factory-wide overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). By knowing when assets will fail, equipment can then be managed more effectively with just-in-time maintenance. Finally, if historical health and failure modes can be compiled, such information can then be fed back to the equipment designer for closed loop lifecycle redesign\n\n"}

These overprints have principally been used as a security measure, however, propaganda and commemorative examples are also known. When overprinted for security purposes, they serve a similar function to perfins. It is important to distinguish between private overprints and private cancellations.\n\nPrivate overprints have been used for a number of reasons. Generally they cannot be used as control marks, as the stamp or stamps are thus rendered invalid for prepayment of postage (though some such invalid stamps have successfully passed through the mails, presumably due to an oversight of postal employees). However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as receipts for tax payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps. This is to be distinguished from the more or less frequent application of private overprints to the back of stamps as control marks.\nIn Great Britain, commercial overprints were principally used to pay the tax on receipts and are found on both revenue and postage stamps with a great number of different varieties known between the 1880s and 1970s.\n\nOther countries which had commercial overprints include Canada, Ceylon, India, Kenya & Uganda, New South Wales, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, the Straits Settlements and Victoria.\n\nPrivate overprints can also originate from speculative philatelic purposes produced deliberately with a view to selling them to unsuspecting collectors.\n\nPrivate overprints have been used to express political opinions, or to commemorate events by creating collectors' items in cases in which the overprinted stamps cannot be used. For instance, German sympathisers in the Sudetenland privately overprinted Czechoslovakian stamps with swastikas before the annexation, and in Italy, after the fall of Mussolini and his establishment of the Italian Social Republic, stamps of the King were overprinted with fasces by Fascist sympathizers.\n\nPrivate overprints have also been used in the United States, though the Domestic Mail Manual states that stamps \"overprinted with an unauthorized design, message or other marking\" are not valid for postage. A private overprint exists on the Florida commemorative, and during the Vietnam War, a woman privately overprinted the stamps on her outgoing mail with the slogan \"Pray for War\" before postal authorities compelled her to move this stamping away from the stamps. There have been several American examples of postal cards being overprinted with a private overprint revaluation shortly after a rate change, including the Post Office Department's authorization of a special Pitney-Bowes Tickometer surcharge to be used to revalue postal cards in the possession of General Electric when the postcard rate went up to 3 cents in August 1958. The USPS also authorised overprinting of the 10¢ Tractor Trailer and 5¢ Canoe Transportation coil stamps.\n\n\n\n"}

By virtue of the proclamation declaring a \"State of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in Mindanao\", the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) were ordered to suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and to undertake measures to prevent violence from spreading to other parts of the Philippines. The proclamation also came on the heels of the Philippine military offensive against the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf in Patikul, Sulu which left 15 soldiers dead on August 29, 2016. It also acknowledged the threats of further terror attacks by lawless elements in other parts of the country, including the metropolitan areas, following these developments in Mindanao.\n\nPresident Duterte issued the proclamation in Manila just before leaving for Laos to attend the 2016 ASEAN Summit. Earlier, he verbally declared a \"state of lawlessness\" in the country on September 3, 2016. In a press conference in Davao the day following the attacks, Duterte said the declaration was to \"ensure coordinated efforts\" between the police and the military in the government's fight against illegal drugs, criminals and terrorism. He also said it was not a declaration of martial law and that the writ of \"habeas corpus\" will not be suspended.\n\nThe presidential proclamation orders the Philippine law enforcement officials to carry out suppression of violence \"as may be permitted in the Constitution and existing laws,\" as well as \"with due regard to the fundamental civil and political rights of our citizens.\" It also states that the \"state of national emergency on account of lawless violence shall remain in force and effect until lifted or withdrawn by the President.\"\n\nUnder Memorandum Order No. 3 released on September 7, 2016, the Department of National Defense and the Department of the Interior and Local Government are ordered to deploy additional forces of the AFP and PNP in public areas throughout the country without causing undue alarm to the general public, and to intensify their local and transnational intelligence operations against individuals or groups suspected of, or responsible for, committing or conspiring to commit acts of lawless violence. It also orders the Department of Justice to coordinate with law enforcement agencies for the prompt investigation and prosecution of all suspected individuals or groups. \n\nThe memorandum guarantees the civil and political rights of individuals in the duration of the state of emergency and sets out the rules governing arrests for AFP and PNP personnel. It states: \n\nThe memorandum also lists the existing rules and procedures in carrying out warrantless searches and seizures, such as when the individual consents to the search or waives his right against warrantless search; when the search is made contemporaneous to a lawful arrest; the search of vessels and aircraft for violation of immigration and customs laws; the search of automobiles at borders for violation of immigration or smuggling laws; the seizure of objects made in plain view; stop-and-frisk situations; and searches arising from emergency circumstances.\n\nMilitary and police checkpoint inspections shall be limited to requesting to roll down vehicle windows to search for objects in plain view only, and the production of identification and vehicle registration papers.

It is of uncertain affiliation.\n\nRemsangpuia (2008:17) lists the following Puroik villages. The Puroik also live in Nyishi, Aka, and Miji areas.\n\n\nAccording to the \"Ethnologue\", Puroik is spoken in 53 villages along the Par River in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThe Puroik are located from the Upper Subansiri River drainage basin (西巴霞区) to the Tawang River drainage basin (Li 2005). Names include \"pɯh31 ɣut55\" (autonym) and \"su55 loŋ33\" (Bangni exonym). There are about 3,000 people as of 2002.\n\nLieberherr (2015) consider Puroik to be a dialect chain where geographically distant dialects are mutually unintelligible, whereas dialects located close to each other are mutually intelligible. The internal diversity of Puroik is about equal to that of the Western Kho-Bwa branch. Lieberherr (2015) and Lieberherr & Bodt (2017) list the following dialects of Puroik, provided here in geographical order from east to west.\n\nLieberherr & Bodt (2017) classify Puroik as Kho-Bwa, and has traditionally been considered to be a Sino-Tibetan language. There is some mutual intelligibility with Bugun, and Burling (2003) grouped it with Bugun and Sherdukpen, and possibly with Lish and Sartang.\n\nJames A. Matisoff (2009) considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language. Lieberherr (2015) also considers Puroik to be a Tibeto-Burman language, although he notes that it has likely borrowed from non-Tibetan-Burman languages. However, Roger Blench (2011) considers Puroik to be a language isolate.\n\nBesides their own language, the Puroik also use Nishi, Hindi, and Assamese. Literacy is very low, at about 2%. Those who are literate use either the Bengali script, Devanagari or the Latin alphabet to write Puroik.\n\nThe Sulung grammar notes here have been adapted primarily from Tayeng (1990).\n\nNumber is not considered a grammatical feature in Sulung. Plurality is expressed, when required to be stated clearly by the huangda meaning all, many, etc.\n\nThere is no grammatical gender in Sulung. However the two sexes are distinguished when necessary.\nTo indicate other relatives and persons the suffix -aphu is added for the male and -amua for the female. Demonstrative, and Interrogative.\n\nSeven cases may be distinguished: Subject (Nominative), Object (Accusative), Instrumental, Dative (Purposive), Ablative, Possessive (Genitive), and Locative.\n\nThe Personal Pronoun distinguished three persons (the first person, second person, and third person) and two numbers (singular and plural). The same form is used for both genders.\n\nThere are four types of adjectives: adjective of quality, adjective of quantity, demonstrative adjective, interrogative adjective.\n\nSulung verbs do not indicate number and person.\n\nThe three principal tenses (present, past, and future), including the indefinite and the continuous are indicated by means of particles used as suffixes.\n\nThere are four moods: Imperative, potential, conditional, and subjunctive. \nImperative uses the suffix -bo, -da, and -ge for commands.\nPotential uses the suffix -pa to express the ability to perform.\nConditional uses -re/-hangra to express obligation.\n\nAdverbs may be distinguished into four classes: Time, place, manner, and interrogative.\n\nThe following list of 181 words in three Puroik dialects, in addition to Proto-Puroik (the reconstructed proto-language of the Puroik lects), is from Lieberherr (2015: 280-286). Lieberherr (2015) reconstructs Proto-Puroik, drawing data from the \"Chayangtajo\" dialect and the newly described \"Kojo-Rojo\" and \"Bulu\" dialects.

It is an official language – alongside English – in both jurisdictions.\n\nSamoan, a Polynesian language, is the first language for most of the Samoa Islands' population of about 246,000 people. With many Samoan people living in other countries, the total number of speakers worldwide is estimated at 510,000 in 2015. It is the third most widely spoken language in New Zealand, where more than 2% of the population – 86,000 people – were able to speak it as of 2013.\n\nThe language is notable for the phonological differences between formal and informal speech as well as a ceremonial form used in Samoan oratory.\n\nSamoan is an analytic, isolating language and a member of the Austronesian family, and more specifically the Samoic branch of the Polynesian subphylum. It is closely related to other Polynesian languages with many shared cognate words such as \"aliʻi\", \"ʻava\", \"atua\", \"tapu\" and numerals as well as in the name of gods in mythology.\n\nLinguists differ somewhat on the way they classify Samoan in relation to the other Polynesian languages. The \"traditional\" classification, based on shared innovations in grammar and vocabulary, places Samoan with Tokelauan, the Polynesian outlier languages and the languages of Eastern Polynesia, which include Rapanui, Māori, Tahitian and Hawaiian. Nuclear Polynesian and Tongic (the languages of Tonga and Niue) are the major subdivisions of Polynesian under this analysis. A revision by Marck reinterpreted the relationships among Samoan and the outlier languages. In 2008 an analysis, of basic vocabulary only, from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database is contradictory in that while in part it suggests that Tongan and Samoan form a subgroup, the old subgroups Tongic and Nuclear Polynesian are still included in the classification search of the database itself.\n\nThere are approximately 470,000 Samoan speakers worldwide, 50 per cent of whom live in the Samoan Islands. Thereafter, the greatest concentration is in New Zealand, where people of Samoan ethnicity comprise the largest group after New Zealand European, Māori, and Chinese: the 2006 New Zealand census recorded 95,428 speakers of the Samoan language, and 141,103 people of Samoan ethnicity. Among ethnic Samoans in New Zealand, 70.5 percent (87,109 people) could speak Samoan. Samoan is the third most commonly spoken language in New Zealand after English and Māori. \nThe majority of Samoans in New Zealand (66.4 per cent) reside in the commercial capital, Auckland. Of those who speak Samoan, 67.4 percent live in Auckland, and 70.4 percent of people who are both of Samoan ethnicity and Samoan speakers live in that city.\n\nAccording to the Australian census of 2006, there were 38,525 speakers of Samoan in Australia, and 39,992 people of Samoan ancestry.\n\nUS Census 2010 shows more than 180,000 Samoans reside in the United States, which is triple the number of people living in American Samoa, while slightly less than the estimated population of the island nation of Samoa – 193,000, as of July 2011.\n\nSamoan Language Week (\"Vaiaso o le Gagana Sāmoa\") is an annual celebration of the language in New Zealand supported by the government and various organisations including UNESCO. Samoan Language Week was started in Australia for the first time in 2010.\n\nThe Samoa alphabet consists of 14 letters, with another three letters (H, K, R) used in loan words. The (\"koma liliu\" or \"ʻokina\") is used for the glottal stop.\n\nVowel length is phonemic in Samoan; all 5 vowels also have a long form denoted by the macron. For example, \"tama\" means child or boy, while \"tamā\" means father.\n\nDiphthongs are .\n\nThe combination of u followed by a vowel in some words creates the sound of the English w, a letter not part of the Samoan alphabet, as in \"uaua\" (artery, tendon).\n\nIn formal Samoan, used for example in news broadcasts or sermons, the consonants are used. In colloquial Samoan, however, merge as and is pronounced .\n\nThe glottal stop is phonemic in Samoan. The presence or absence of the glottal stop affects the meaning of words otherwise spelled the same, e.g. \"mai\" = from, originate from; \"maʻi\" = sickness, illness.\n\nThe consonants in parentheses are only present in loanwords and formal Samoan.\nLoanwords from English and other languages have been adapted to Samoan phonology:\n\n/k/ is retained in some instances (Christ = \"Keriso\", club = \"kalapu\", coffee = \"kofe\"), and has become [t] in rare instances (such as \"se totini\", from the English \"stocking\").\n\n/ɹ/ becomes [ɾ] in some instances (e.g. Christ = \"Keriso\", January = \"Ianuari\", number = \"numera\"), and [l] in others (January = \"Ianuali\", herring = \"elegi\").\n\n/d/ becomes [t] (David = \"Tavita\", diamond = \"taimane\").\n\n/g/ becomes [k] in some cases (gas = \"kesi\"), while /dʒ/ and /tʃ/ usually become [s] (George = \"Siaosi\", Charlotte = \"Salata\", James = \"Semisi\").\n\n/h/ is retained at the beginning of some proper names (Herod = \"Herota\"), but in some cases becomes an 's' (hammer = \"samala\"), and is omitted in others (herring = \"elegi\", half-caste = \"afakasi\")\n\n/z/ becomes [s] (Zachariah = \"Sakaria\")\n\n/w/ becomes [v] (William = \"Viliamu\")\n\n/b/ becomes [p] (Britain = \"Peretania\", butter = \"pata\")\n\nStress generally falls on the penultimate mora; that is, on the last syllable if that contains a long vowel or diphthong or on the second-last syllable otherwise. There are exceptions though, with many words ending in a long vowel taking the accent on the ultima; as \"ma'elega\", zealous; \"ʻonā\", to be intoxicated; \"faigatā\", difficult.\n\nVerbs formed from nouns ending in a, and meaning to abound in, have properly two aʻs, as \"puaa\" (puaʻaa), \"pona\", \"tagata\", but are written with one.\n\nIn speaking of a place at some distance, the accent is placed on the last syllable; as \"ʻO loʻo i Safotu\", he is at Safotu. The same thing is done in referring to a family; as Sa Muliaga, the family of Muliaga, the term \"Sa\" referring to a wide extended family of clan with a common ancestor. So most words ending in \"ga\", not a sign of a noun, as \"tigā\", \"puapuaga\", \"pologa\", \"faʻataga\" and \"aga\". So also all words ending in a diphthong, as \"mamau\", \"mafai\", \"avai\".\n\nIn speaking the voice is raised, and the emphasis falls on the last word in each sentence.\n\nWhen a word receives an addition by means of an affixed particle, the accent is shifted forward; as \"alofa\", love; \"alofága\", loving, or showing love; \"alofagía\", beloved.\n\nReduplicated words have two accents; as \"palapala\", mud; \"segisegi\", twilight. Compound words may have even three or four, according to the number of words and affixes of which the compound word is composed; as \"tofátumoánaíná\", to be engulfed.\n\nThe articles \"le\" and \"se\" are unaccented. When used to form a pronoun or participle, \"le\" and \"se\" are contractions for \"le e\", \"se e\", and so are accented; as \"ʻO le ona le mea\", the owner, literally the (person) whose (is) the thing, instead of \"O le e ona le mea\". The sign of the nominative \"ʻo\", the prepositions o, a, i, e, and the euphonic particles i and \"te\", are unaccented; as \"ʻO maua, ma te o atu ia te oe\", we two will go to you.\n\n\"Ina\", the sign of the imperative, is accented on the ultima; \"ína\", the sign of the subjunctive, on the penultima. The preposition \"iá\" is accented on the ultima, the pronoun \"ia\" on the penultima.\n\nSamoan syllable structure is (C)V, where V may be long or a diphthong. A sequence VV may occur only in derived forms and compound words; within roots, only the initial syllable may be of the form V. Metathesis of consonants is frequent, such as \"manu\" for \"namu\" 'scent', \"lavaʻau\" for \"valaʻau\" 'to call', but vowels may not be mixed up in this way.\n\nEvery syllable ends in a vowel. No syllable consists of more than three sounds, one consonant and two vowels, the two vowels making a diphthong; as \"fai\", \"mai\", \"tau\". Roots are sometimes monosyllabic, but mostly disyllabic or a word consisting of two syllables. Polysyllabic words are nearly all derived or compound words; as \"nofogatā\" from \"nofo\" (sit, seat) and \"gatā\", difficult of access; \"taʻigaafi\", from \"taʻi\", to attend, and \"afi\", fire, the hearth, making to attend to the fire; \"talafaʻasolopito\", (\"history\") stories placed in order, \"faletalimalo\", (\"communal house\") house for receiving guests.\n\nLike many Austronesian languages, Samoan has separate words for inclusive and exclusive we, and distinguishes singular, dual, and plural. The root for the inclusive pronoun may occur in the singular, in which case it indicates emotional involvement on the part of the speaker.\n\nIn formal speech, fuller forms of the roots \"mā-\", \"tā-\", and \"lā-\" are \"‘imā-\", \"‘itā-\", and \"‘ilā-.\"\n\nThe definite article is \"le\": \"ʻo le Atua\", God; indefinite e.g., \"ʻo le matai o Pai\", (the) chief (named) Pai. It is sometimes used where English would require the indefinite article: \"Ua tu mai le vaʻa\", a canoe appears. The article \"se\" is always a singular indefinite (\"ta mai se laʻau\" = cut me a stick), while \"ni\" is the plural indefinite (\"ta mai ni laʻau\" = cut me some sticks). The article \"le\" is omitted before plural nouns: \"ʻO le tagata\", the person; \"ʻO tagata\", people.\n\nNames of natural objects, such as men, trees and animals, are mostly primitive nouns, e.g.\"ʻO le la\", the sun; \"ʻo le tagata\", the person; \"ʻo le talo\", the taro; \"ʻo le iʻa\", the fish; also manufactured articles, such as \"matau\", an axe, \"vaʻa\", canoe, \"tao\", spear, \"fale\", house, etc.\n\nSome nouns are derived from verbs by the addition of either \"ga\", \"saga\", \"taga\", \"maga\", or \"ʻaga\": such as \"tuli\", to chase; \"tuliga\", chasing; \"luluʻu\", to fill the hand; \"luʻutaga\", a handful; \"feanu\", to spit; \"anusaga\", spittle; \"tanu\", to bury; \"tanulia\", the part buried. These verbal nouns have an active participial meaning; e.g. \"ʻO le faiga o le fale\", the building of the house. Often they refer to the persons acting, in which case they govern the next noun in the genitive with \"a\"; \"ʻO le faiga a fale\", contracted into \"ʻo le faiga fale\", those who build the house, the builders. In some cases verbal nouns refer to either persons or things done by them: \"ʻO le faiga a talo\", the getting of taro, or the party getting the \"taro\", or the \"taro\" itself which has been got. The context in such cases decides the meaning. Sometimes place is indicated by the termination; such as \"tofā\", to sleep; \"tofāga\", a sleeping-place, a bed. \"ʻO le taʻelega\" is either the bathing-place or the party of bathers. The first would take \"o\" after it to govern the next noun, \"ʻO le taʻelega o le nuʻu\", the bathing-place of the village; the latter would be followed by \"a\", \"ʻO le taʻelega a teine\", the bathing-place of the girls.\n\nSometimes such nouns have a passive meaning, such as being acted upon; \"ʻO le taomaga a lau\", the thatch that has been pressed; \"ʻo le faupuʻega a maʻa\", the heap of stones, that is, the stones which have been heaped up. Those nouns which take \"ʻaga\" are rare, except on Tutuila; \"gataʻaga\", the end; \"ʻamataʻaga\", the beginning; \"olaʻaga\", lifetime; \"misaʻaga\", quarrelling. Sometimes the addition of \"ga\" makes the signification intensive; such as \"ua\" and \"timu\", rain; \"uaga\" and \"timuga\", continued pouring (of rain).\n\nThe simple form of the verb is sometimes used as a noun: \"tatalo\", to pray; \"ʻo le tatalo\", a prayer; \"poto\", to be wise; \"ʻo le poto\", wisdom.\n\nThe reciprocal form of the verb is often used as a noun; e.g. \"ʻO le fealofani\", \"ʻo femisaiga\", quarrellings (from \"misa\"), \"feʻumaiga\"; \"E lelei le fealofani\", mutual love is good.\n\nA few diminutives are made by reduplication, e.g. \"paʻapaʻa\", small crabs; \"pulepule\", small shells; \"liilii\", ripples; \"'ili'ili\", small stones.\n\nAdjectives are made into abstract nouns by adding an article or pronoun; e.g. \"lelei\", good; \"ʻo le lelei\", goodness; \"silisili\", excellent or best; \"ʻo lona lea silisili\", that is his excellence or that is his best.\n\nMany verbs may become participle-nouns by adding \"ga\"; as \"sau\", come, \"sauga\"; e.g. \"ʻO lona sauga muamua \", his first coming; \"mau” to mauga\", \"ʻO le mauga muamua\", the first dwelling.\n\nGender is sometimes expressed by distinct names:\n\n\"ʻO le matai\", a chief.\n\n\"ʻO le tamāloa\", a man.\n\n\"ʻO le tama\", a boy.\n\n\"ʻO le poʻa\", a male animal.\n\n\"ʻO le toeaʻina\", an elderly man.\n\n\"sole\", colloquial male label.\n\"ʻO le tamaitaʻi\", a lady.\n\n\"ʻO le fafine\", a woman.\n\n\"ʻO le teine\", a girl.\n\n\"ʻO le manu fafine\", a female animal.\n\n\"ʻO le loʻomatua\", an elderly woman.\n\n\"suga, funa\", colloquial female label.\n\nWhen no distinct name exists, the gender of animals is known by adding \"poʻa\" and \"fafine\" respectively. The gender of some few plants is distinguished by \"tane\" and \"fafine\", as in \"ʻo le esi tane\"; \"ʻo le esi fafine\". No other names of objects have any mark of gender.\n\nThe singular number is known by the article with the noun; e.g. \"ʻo le tama\", a boy.\n\nProperly there is no dual. It is expressed by omitting the article and adding numbers \"e lua\" for things e.g. \"e toʻalua teine\", two girls, for persons; or \"ʻo fale e lua\", two houses; \"ʻo tagata e toʻalua\", two persons; or \"ʻo lāʻua\", them/those two (people).\n\nThe plural is known by:\n\nPlurality is also expressed by internal reduplication in Samoan verbs \"(-CV- infix)\", by which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated.\nPossessive relations are indicated by the particles \"a\" or \"o\". Possessive pronouns also have a-forms and o-forms: \"lou\", \"lau\", \"lona\", \"lana\", \"lo\" and \"la matou\", etc. Writers in the 1800s like Platt were unable to understand the underlying principles governing the use of the two forms: \"There is no general rule which will apply to every case. The governing noun decides which should be used; thus \"ʻO le poto ʻo le tufuga fai fale\", \"the wisdom of the builder\"; \"ʻO le amio a le tama\", \"the conduct of the boy\"; \"ʻupu o fāgogo\", \"words of \"fāgogo\"\" (a form of narrated and sung storytelling); but \"ʻupu a tagata\", \"words of men\". Pratt instead gives a rote list of uses and exceptions:\n\n\"O\" is used with:\n\n\"A\" is used with:\n\nSome words take either \"a\" or \"o\"; as \"manatu\", \"taofi\", \"ʻO se tali a Matautu\", an answer given by Matautu; \"ʻo se tali ʻo Matautu\", an answer given to Matautu.\n\nExceptions:\n\nSome adjectives are primitive, as \"umi\", long; \"poto\", wise. Some are formed from nouns by the addition of \"a\", meaning \"covered with\" or \"infested with\"; thus, \"ʻeleʻele\", dirt; \"ʻeleʻelea\", dirty; \"palapala\", mud; \"palapalā\", muddy.\n\nOthers are formed by doubling the noun; as \"pona\", a knot; \"ponapona\", knotty; \"fatu\", a stone; \"fatufatu\", stony.\n\nOthers are formed by prefixing \"faʻa\" to the noun; as \"ʻo le tu fa'asāmoa\", Samoan custom or \"fa'amatai.\n\nLike \"ly\" in English, the \"faʻa\" often expresses similitude; \"ʻo le amio faʻapuaʻa\", behave like a pig (literally).\n\nIn one or two cases \"a\" is prefixed; as \"apulupulu\", sticky, from \"pulu\", resin; \"avanoa\", open; from \"vā\" and \"noa\".\n\nVerbs are also used as adjectives: \"ʻo le ala faigatā\", a difficult road; \"ʻo le vai tafe\", a river, flowing water; \"ʻo le laʻau ola\", a live tree; also the passive: \"ʻo le aliʻi mātaʻutia\".\n\n\"Ma\" is the prefix of condition, \"sae\", to tear; \"masae\", torn; as, \"ʻO le iʻe masae\", torn cloth; Goto, to sink; \"magoto\", sunk; \"ʻo le vaʻa magoto\", a sunken canoe.\n\nA kind of compound adjective is formed by the union of a noun with an adjective; as \"ʻo le tagata lima mālosi\", a strong man, literally, the stronghanded man; \"ʻo le tagata loto vaivai\", a weak-spirited man.\n\nNouns denoting the materials out of which things are made are used as adjectives: \"ʻo le mama auro\", a gold ring; \"ʻo le fale maʻa\", a stone house. Or they may be reckoned as nouns in the genitive.\n\nAdjectives expressive of colours are mostly reduplicated words; as \"sinasina' or \"paʻepaʻe\" (white); \"uliuli\" (black); \"samasama\" (yellow); \"ʻenaʻena'\" (brown); \"mumu\" (red), etc.; but when they follow a noun they are usually found in their simple form; as \"ʻo le ʻie sina\", white cloth; \"ʻo le puaʻa uli\", a black pig. The plural is sometimes distinguished by doubling the first syllable; as \"sina\", white; plural, \"sisina\"; \"tele\", great; pl. \"tetele\". In compound words the first syllable of the root is doubled; as \"maualuga\", high; pl. \"maualuluga\". Occasionally the reciprocal form is used as a plural; as \"lele\", flying; \"ʻo manu felelei\", flying creatures, birds.\n\nComparison is generally effected by using two adjectives, both in the positive state; thus \"e lelei lenei\", \"ʻa e leaga lena\", this is good – but that is bad, not in itself, but in comparison with the other; \"e umi lenei\", a e puupuu lena\", this is long, that is short.\n\nThe superlative is formed by the addition of an adverb, such as \"matuā\", \"tasi\", \"sili\", \"silisiliʻese aʻiaʻi\", \"naʻuā\"; as \"ʻua lelei tasi\", it alone is good – that is, nothing equals it. \"ʻUa matuā silisili ona lelei\", it is very exceedingly good; \"ʻua tele naʻuā\", it is very great. \"Silisili ese\", highest, \"ese\", differing from all others.\n\n\"Naua\" has often the meaning of \"too much\"; \"ua tele naua\", it is greater than is required.\n\nSentences have different types of word order and the four most commonly used are verb–subject–object (VSO), verb–object–subject (VOS), subject–verb–object (SVO) and object–verb–subject (OVS).\n\nFor example:- \"The girl went to the house.\" (SVO); girl (subject), went (verb), house (object).\n\nSamoan word order;\n\n\"Sa alu le teine ʻi le fale.\"; \"sa alu\" (verb), \"teine\" (subject), \"fale\" (object).\n\nwent-girl-house.\n\n\"Sa alu ʻi le fale le teine.\"\n\nwent-house-girl.\n\n\"Le fale sa alu ʻi ai le teine.\"\n\nhouse-went-girl.\n\n\"Le teine sa alu ʻi le fale.\"\n\ngirl-went-house.\n\nA phrase or clause can be made negative by the addition of a particle, a morpheme usually meaning ‘not’. There are two common negative particles in Samoan, \"lē\" and \"leʻi\" (sometimes also written as \"lei\")\".\" \"Lē\" has the allomorphs [le:] or [le] (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 142, 375). \"Lē\" should not be confused for \"le\", the specific singular article, which indicates that the noun phrase refers to one particular entity (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 259). \"Lē\" and \"lei\" negate declarative and interrogative sentences, but do not negate imperative sentences. Negative imperative verbs are discussed later in this entry. \"Lē\" (meaning “not”) can be combined with all tense-aspect-mood particles (or 'TAM' particles), except those that are optative and subjunctive, such as \"neʻi\", \"seʻi\", and \"ʻia\" (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.375).\n\nA negative particle may mark a negative verbal clause, as seen in the example below (from Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.56).\nIn this example of a negated declarative sentence, it can be seen that, in Samoan, there is no equivalent gloss for 'unhappy'. The negative particle \"lē\" modifies the verbal clause to form something like “not happy” instead.\n\nThe meaning of \"leʻi\" differs slightly from that of \"lē.\" \"Leʻi\" indicates that an event or state has not been actualised yet, or for the time being, but is expected to become so. Therefore, \"leʻi\" is often translated as “not yet” rather than simply “not”. \"Leʻi\" is usually only combined with the general TAM particle \"e\" or \"te\". See the example below (from Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 376).\nThe above example (2) demonstrates the common usage of \"leʻi\" to mean “not yet”. In some cases, \"leʻi\" simply means “no, not at all”, expressing the concept that an event that had been expected to happen or had been thought to have happened, did not occur after all (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 479).\n\nThere is a particle, \"faʻa=,\" that acts as a causative, as well being as the most common prefix in the Samoan language. This particle can be attached to nearly all nouns and non-ergative verbs. When attached to negated verb phrases, \"faʻa=\" means having the qualities of or being similar to whatever is denoted by the basic stem or phrase. It is often combined with the negative particle \"lē\" (or its allomorphs) to form the construction \"faʻa=lē=\". Prefixing \"Faʻa=lē=\" onto a verb provides a polite way to say a negative phrase. Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 175–179) state that these particles provide three ways to express negative evaluations that vary on a scale of politeness, as demonstrated below:\nIn Samoan, particles modifying sentences usually take the first place in the sentence, with the exception of the question particle \"ʻea\". The particles forming a category are not always mutually exclusive: for instance, while two negative particles cannot be combined, certain prepositions can occur together. Additionally, negative prenuclear particles will follow the preverbal pronoun or the TAM particle (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.140).\n\nIn the following examples from Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.331), the negative particles follow the TAM particle \"te\" (Example 1: \"e\") or the preverbal pronoun (Example 2: \"ʻou\"). \n\nIn both examples, the negative particle is in the second position, after the preverbal pronoun and/or the TAM particle. In Example 2, there is both a preverbal pronoun (\"‘ou\") AND a TAM particle following it (\"te\"). This demonstrates that the negative particle must always follow these two types of preceding particles in the sentence, even if they are both present.\n\nThere are two existential verbs in Samoan: \"iai,\" “to exist, be present” and the negative equivalent \"leai\" [leái] or [le:ái], “to not exist, be absent”. They differ from all other Samoan verbs in at least one respect: they cannot be negated by a negative particle. Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.114) suggest that this originates in the etymology of these verbs: the negative existential verb \"leai\" is probably derived from \"lē\" (“not”) and \"ai\" (ANAPH, “not there”). It seems that the inclusion of negation in the verb itself disallows the negative particle from the sentence structure.\n\nSee the example from Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp.56) in the sentence below: \nIn this example, the existential verb \"leai\" has been used to indicate the absence of something (that is, the cars) rather than using a negative particle. However, a negative particle (\"lei\") has been used in the second clause, modifying the verbal clause to create the phrase “the roads did NOT reach there”, with the emphasis on the absence of the roads in that area.\n\nAccording to Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 480–481) the only TAM particles that appear with \"leai\" are \"ʻua\" and \"e or te.\" This means that \"leai\" acts as if non-existence is a general fact, rather than linking it to a specific point in time. When another verb follows \"leai\" within the same verb phrase, it functions as a more emphatic negation meaning something like “not at all”. This is demonstrated in the following example: \nHere, the addition of \"leai\" to the verb \"gāoi\" “to move” makes the statement more emphatic: not only did Sina not move, she did not move \"at all\".\n\nThere are two negative imperative verbs, \"ʻaua\" and \"sōia.\" \"ʻAua\" should not be confused with \"aua\", which means \"because\". These negative imperative verbs can be used independently of negative particles; as the negation is in the verb itself, an extra particle is not required. \"ʻAua\" means “don’t do, should not do” and is employed to express commands in both direct and indirect speech. What should not be done is indicated by a verbal complement clause, as seen in the example below (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 482). \n\nAs discussed above, this sentence does not require a negative particle, because the negative imperative verb is sufficient. Alternatively, \"sōia\" means that ‘one should stop doing something one has already started’ (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp. 483). As with \"ʻaua\", what should not be done is indicated by a verbal complement. In direct speech, \"sōia\" is either used in the imperative without any TAM particle or in the optative marked by \"seiʻi\" (Mosel & Hovdhaugen, 1992, pp.483).\n\nSee the example below with \"sōia\" as the negative imperative:\n\nThis works differently from \"ʻaua\", although they are both imperative. It can be seen here that \"sōia\" means something like “cease what you are doing immediately” while \"ʻaua\" means “don’t do that action\" (in a general sense).\n\nThe noun phrase forming an existential clause is introduced by a preposition: \"ʻo\" or \"naʻo\", meaning “only”. An existential clause is negated with a complex clause: Mosel & Hovdhaugen (1992, pp. 500–501) state that 'the existential clause functions as the argument of a verbal predicate formed by a TAM particle and the negative particle \"lē\" (“not”)'. An example of this can be seen in the example below, where the preposition \"o\" precedes the negative particle \"lē\".\n\nThis complex sentence has several examples of negation where the negative particle lē is combined with the preposition \"o\" in order to negate an existential clause (\"there will be no...\").\n\nThe language has a polite or formal variant used in oratory and ceremony as well as in communication with elders, guests, people of rank and strangers.\n\nThe consonant system of colloquial Samoan (\"casual Samoan\", or \"tautala leaga\" as it is known) is slightly different from the literary language (\"proper Samoan\", or \"tautala lelei\"), and is referred to as K speech or K style. In colloquial speech, defined as taking place in casual social situations among intimates or in the home among familiars of equivalent social rank, /t/ is sometimes pronounced [k] and /n/ has merged with /ŋ/ as [ŋ]. Additionally, /l/ is pronounced following a back vowel (/a, o, u/) and preceding an /i/. /s/ is less sibilant than in English, and /h/ and /r/ are found only in borrowings, with /s/ and /l/ sometimes being substituted for them.\n\nTherefore, in colloquial Samoan speech, common consonant replacements occur such as:\n\nt is pronounced k – \"tama\" (child, boy) is pronounced \"kama\"; \"tautala\" (\"to speak\") is pronounced \"kaukala\"; \"tulāfale\" (\"orator\", \"talking chief\") is pronounced \"kulāfale\".\n\nn is pronounced ng – \"fono\" (\"meeting\", \"assembly\") is pronounced \"fongo\"; \"ono\" (the numeral \"six\") is pronounced \"ongo\"; \"māona\" (\"satisfied\", \"full\") is pronounced \"māonga\".\n\nHistorically and culturally, an important form of the Samoan language is oratory, a ceremonial language sometimes referred to in publications as 'chiefly language', or \"gagana fa'aaloalo\" (\"dignified language\") which incorporates classical Samoan terms and prose as well as a different set of vocabulary, which is tied to the roles of orator chiefs (\"tulāfale\") and 'speechmaking' (\"failāuga\") that remains part of the culture's continuing indigenous \"matai\" system of governance and social organization. The \"gagana fa'aaloalo\" (polite speech) register is used by lower-ranking people to address people of higher status, such as their family \"matai\" chief, government officials, or clergy. It is also the formal register used among chiefs during ceremonial occasions and social rites such as funerals, weddings, chiefly title bestowals and village council meetings. It is not common for entire conversations to be held in chiefly register, instead the \"dignified language\" is mainly employed when making formal introductions between individuals, opening and concluding formal meetings, and executing ceremonial tasks (such as the Samoa 'ava ceremony). It is also considered proper to use the \"polite\" language when praying. Untitled people (those without \"matai\" chief titles) who are unfamiliar with each other will often greet each other in chiefly register as a common courtesy, while familiar individuals frequently use chiefly addresses in jest (as in humorously addressing friends with \"talofa lava lau afioga\" – \"respectful greetings your highness\" – instead of the more colloquial \"malo sole!\" – \"hey man!\").\n\nExamples of \"polite\" word variants according to social rank:\nAnother polite form of speech in \"polite\" Samoan includes terms and phrases of self-abasement that are used by the speaker in order to show respect and flatter the listener. For example when praising the child of another woman, a mother might politely refer to her own children as \"ui\" (literally, \"piglets\"); in order to emphasize the beauty of a fine tapa cloth, the presenter might refer to it as a simple \"vala\" (plain cloth); the weaver of an especially fine mat might call it \"launiu\" (coconut leaf) or \"lā\" (sail cloth) in order to not appear boastful. Overshadowing the dignity or prestige of higher-ranking individuals is a grave offense in Samoan culture, so words are chosen very carefully to express individual feelings in a way that acknowledges relative statuses within social hierarchy.\n\nEncounters with Europeans began in the 1700s, followed by the era of colonialism in the Pacific. Samoan was only a spoken language until the early to mid-1800s when Christian missionaries began documenting the spoken language for religious texts and introducing the Latin script for writing. In 1834, an orthography of the language was distributed by the London Missionary Society, which also set up a printing press by 1839. The first complete Bible (\"Tusi Pa'ia\", Sacred Book) in Samoan was completed and published in 1862.\n\nThe first problem that faced the missionaries in Polynesia was that of learning the language of the island, which they intended to convert to Christianity. The second was that of identifying the sounds in the local languages with the symbols employed in their own languages to establish alphabets for recording the spelling of native words. Having established more-or-less satisfactory alphabets and spelling, teaching the indigenous people how to write and read their own language was next necessary. A printing press, with the alphabet keys used only English, was part of the mission equipment, and it was possible not only to translate and write out portions of the Bible scriptures, and hymns in the local language but also to print them for use as texts in teaching. Thus, the missionaries introduced writing for the first time within Polynesia, were the first printers and established the first schools in villages.\n\nThe alphabet proper consists of only 14 letters: 5 vowels, a e i o u, and 9 consonants, f g l m n p s t v. In addition, there are two diacritics. A macron (\"fa'amamafa\") indicates the five long vowels, ā ē ī ō ū, as in \"manu\" 'animal', \"mānu\" 'float, afloat', and a reversed apostrophe, ' (\"koma liliu\" or \"ʻokina\"), indicates the glottal stop, as in many other Polynesian languages. The ' (\"ʻokina\") is often replaced by (\"apostrophe\") in modern usage. The additional letters h, k, r are used in foreign loanwords, apart from the single interjection \"puke(ta)!\" 'gotcha!'; although the sound is found in native words in colloquial speech, it is spelled t. The letter g represents a velar nasal, as in the English word \"sing,\" rather than a voiced velar stop, as in the English \"go.\" Thus, the correct pronunciation of Pago Pago is not \"Pay-go Pay-go\" but \"Pah-ngo Pah-ngo\".\n\nThe first grammar and dictionary of the Samoan language, \"A Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, with English and Samoan Vocabulary\", was written by Reverend George Pratt in 1862. Pratt's valuable Samoan dictionary records many old words of special interest, specialist terminology, archaic words and names in Samoan tradition. It contains sections on Samoan proverbs and poetry, and an extensive grammatical sketch.\nPratt was a missionary for the London Missionary Society and lived for 40 years in Matautu on the island of Savai'i.\n\nThe cardinal numerals are:\n\nThe term \"mano\" was an utmost limit until the adoption of loan words like \"miliona\" (million) and \"piliona\" (billion). Otherwise, quantities beyond \"mano\" were referred to as \"manomano\" or \"ilu\"; that is, innumerable.\n\nThe prefix \"fa'a\" is also used to indicate the number of times.\nFor example; \"fa'atolu\" – three times. Or \"fa'afia?\" – how many times?\n\nThe prefix \"lona\" or \"le\" indicates sequential numbering, as in \"lona lua\" (second), lona tolu (third), \"le fa\" (fourth); \"muamua\" or \"ulua'i\" denote \"first\". Familial sequence was denoted with terms such as \"ulumatua\" (\"eldest\"), \"ui'i\" (\"youngest\"), and \"ogatotonu\" (\"middle child\"); first and last born were also deemed honorifically, \"pa le manava\" (\"opening the womb\") and \"pupuni le manava\" (\"sealing the womb\"), respectively.\n\nTo denote the number of persons, the term \"to'a\" is used. \nFor example; \"E to'afitu tagata e o i le pasi\". Seven people are going/travelling by bus.\n\nThe suffix \"lau\" is used when formally counting fish, in reference to the customary plaiting of fish in leaves (\"lau\") before cooking.\nFor example: \"tolu lau\" – three fishes\n\nThere are also formal prefixes or suffixes used in the chiefly register when counting different species of fish, taro, yams, bananas, chickens, pigs, and other foodstuffs.\n\nDespite the geographical distance, there are many shared words between different Austronesian languages. Below is a list of examples from 4 other Malayo-Polynesian languages: Tongan, Hawaiian, Ma'anyan, Malay. Note the presence of IPA where available. \n\nThough it is not the primary language of a number of nations outside of Samoa, there is an effort by the descendants of Samoans to learn the native language of their ancestors and to better understand their origins and history. Much like any language, a shift is occurring in the way words are spoken and pronounced, especially as Samoans further integrate with other languages. Unfortunately, most looking to learn Samoan are forced to turn to written materials instead of living examples. To preserve the language, linguists must use diacritical marks. Without them, the actual pronunciations of words quickly become altered and lost. The marks are commonly found before, under and above letters in words and are especially helpful for students and non-native speakers to realize the difference the vowels and glottal stops can make in the pronunciation of words.\n\nExamples include: \n\nBelow is another example of a sentence with and without diacritical marks from the Samoan Bible (O le tusi paia, o le Feagaiga Tuai ma le Feagaiga fou lea) [https://books.google.com/books?id=aDs7AAAAcAAJ&pg=PR14&dq=%22Faauta,+ua+e+le+foai+mai+ia+te+au%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt09b0ka_VAhWnh1QKHY_XDhgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Faauta%2C%20ua%20e%20le%20foai%20mai%20ia%20te%20au%22&f=false <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]:\n\n[Original] Faauta, ua e le foai mai ia te au ...\n\n[With diacritics] Fa'auta 'ua 'e lē fōa'i mai iā te a'u ...\n\nSamoan diacritical marks may seem confusing at first due to the way the language shifts based on context. Also, the mixed use of diacritical marks in literature and even within the same publication can surprise non-native speakers. This is evident in the Bible translation created by early missionaries and Reverend George Pratt which features markings in some words and not others. Part of it was due to the need to save time on the writing and typesetting and to use the markings as a guideline. Much like the Bible helped improve literacy and understanding of the language throughout Samoan communities, written works continue to be important in much the same way today.\n\nThe use of the diacritical marks are not only prevalent in Samoan but also other proto-Polynesian languages, such as Hawaiian, where similar pronunciation losses exist. Since native speakers understand how a word should be pronounced without the markings, words are commonly written and accepted with the markings absent. To prevent the loss of correct pronunciations, however, language preservation groups and the Samoan and Hawaiian governments, are taking measure to include diacritical markings in signage, television programs, school materials and printed media.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30954587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30954587", "title": "Second-language acquisition classroom research", "text": "Second-language acquisition classroom research\n\nSecond-language acquisition classroom research is an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.\n\nEfforts have been made to systematically measure or evaluate the effectiveness of language teaching practices in promoting second-language acquisition. Such studies have been undertaken for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. It is therefore impossible to summarize their findings here. However, some more general issues have been addressed.\n\nResearch has indicated that many traditional language-teaching techniques are extremely inefficient. One issue is the effectiveness of explicit teaching: can language teaching have a constructive effect \"beyond\" providing learners with enhanced input? Research on this at different levels of language has produced quite different results. Traditional areas of explicit teaching, such as phonology, grammar and vocabulary, have had decidedly mixed results. It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency. Rather, to become proficient in the L2, the learner must be given opportunities to use the L2 for communicative purposes, learning (as for example, through a teacher's corrective feedback) to attend to both meaning and formal accuracy.\n\nThere is considerable promising research in the classroom on the impact of corrective feedback on L2 learners' use and acquisition of target language forms. The effectiveness of corrective feedback has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction, and the overall focus of the classroom, whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content. However, it appears that a learner's ability to focus on corrective feedback on grammatical features that do not affect meaning is considerably altered when the learner has low alphabetic literacy.\n\nThere is considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms. As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students, they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development.\n\nHorwitz summarises findings of SLA research, and applies to L2 teaching some principles of L2 acquisition honed from a vast body of relevant literature. Like Asher, Horwitz highlights the importance of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices based on these principles; ‘[m]uch class time should be devoted to the development of listening and reading abilities’, and ‘[t]eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’. The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices used in the present study are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.\n\nPedagogical content knowledge is understood as the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the content knowledge as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater to the needs of their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific knowledge domain, we can turn to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [the] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language that include but are not limited to syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [the] subject area” these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language teachers need to possess to become effective practitioners.\n\nA 1999 study of 50 years of second-language education at the United States Department of State's Foreign Service Institute found that adult native speakers of English required 24 weeks or 600 classroom hours to achieve general proficiency (\"3\" on the DLPT, or \"Superior\" rating on the ACTFL scale) in \"Category I\" closely cognate languages, such as French, Spanish, and Swedish. \"Category II\" languages such as Finnish, Russian, and Vietnamese required 44 weeks or 1,100 hours. The \"Category III\" languages Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean required 88 weeks with the second year in the language's country, or 2,200 hours.\n\nThe term E-Learning 2.0 is a neologism for Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems that came about during the emergence of Web 2.0. From an E-Learning 2.0 perspective, conventional e-learning systems were based on instructional packets, which were delivered to students using assignments, and then evaluated by the teacher. In contrast, the new e-learning places increased emphasis on social learning and use of social software such as blogs, wikis and podcast.\nThis phenomenon has also been referred to as Long Tail Learning\nSee also \n\nE-Learning 2.0, by contrast to e-learning systems not based on CSCL, assumes that knowledge (as meaning and understanding) is socially constructed. Learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions. Advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others.\n\nIn addition to virtual classroom environments, social networks have become an important part of E-learning 2.0. Social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around language education. Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) is the use of handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning. Some feel, however, that schools have not caught up with the social networking trends. Few traditional educators promote social networking unless they are communicating with their own colleagues.\n\nHistorically language learning in classrooms focused more on reading and writing than on speaking. The use of modern technology has made it more practical for second language learners to actually practice speaking. One approach is use a video-call technology such as Skype to pair off two students who wish to learn each other's native language. One obvious advantage of using such technology is that there is no need for the two students to be geographically close. Though if they are in very different time-zones, finding a suitable time can be a challenge.<br>\nAnother approach is to use speech recognition software. In the past the hardware costs alone were so high that this was not a viable option in public schooling. However, in recent years as technology improved and prices fell, schools around the world introduced tablet computers to the classroom. And so the required computing power is already in the hands of an increasing number of children. One of the major advantages of using speech recognition software is that it can give feedback and so can be used to help improve pronunciation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1155621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1155621", "title": "Silverpoint", "text": "Silverpoint\n\nSilverpoint (one of several types of metalpoint) is a traditional drawing technique first used by medieval scribes on manuscripts.\n\nA silverpoint drawing is made by dragging a silver rod or wire across a surface, often prepared with gesso or primer. Silverpoint is one of several types of metalpoint used by scribes, craftsmen and artists since ancient times. Metalpoint styli were used for writing on soft surfaces (wax or bark), ruling and underdrawing on parchment, and drawing on prepared paper and panel supports. For drawing purposes, the essential metals used were lead, tin and silver. The softness of these metals made them effective drawing instruments. (Watrous, 1957) Goldsmiths also used metalpoint drawings to prepare their detailed, meticulous designs. Albrecht Dürer's father was one such craftsman who later taught his young son to draw in metalpoint, to such good effect that his 1484 \"Self-Portrait at the Age of 13\" is still considered a masterpiece.\n\nIn the late Gothic/early Renaissance era, silverpoint emerged as a fine line drawing technique. Not blunting as easily as lead or tin, and rendering precise detail, silverpoint was especially favored in Florentine and Flemish workshops. Silverpoint drawings of this era include model books and preparatory sheets for paintings. Artists who worked in silverpoint include Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer and Raphael. Cennino Cennini's \"Il Libro dell'Arte\" provides a window on the practice of silver and leadpoint drawing, as well as preparing metalpoint grounds, in the late 14th century (Thompson, 1933; Duval, et al., 2004). Susan Dorothea White's book \"Draw Like da Vinci\" (2006) describes the silverpoint technique of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nAs noted by Francis Ames-Lewis, drawing styles changed at the end of the 16th century, resulting in a decline for metalpoint. The discovery of graphite deposits at Seathwaite in Borrowdale, Cumbria, England in the early 1500s, and its increasing availability to artists in a pure, soft (and erasable) form hastened silverpoint's eclipse. Artists sought more gestural qualities, for which graphite, red and black chalk were better suited. Ink and wash drawings are also prevalent in the period. In addition, these other drawing techniques required less effort and were more forgiving than silver, which resists erasure and leaves a fainter line. Furthermore, the preparation of silverpoint supports, usually with hide glue with finely ground bone ash, was labor-intensive. Modern practitioners use zinc, pre-prepared acrylic-based grounds or titanium white tempera or marble dust as a ground. Natural chalks and charcoal have the advantage of producing immediate results on uncoated papers (Ames-Lewis, 2000).\n\nDutch artists Hendrik Goltzius and Rembrandt maintained the silverpoint tradition into the 17th century, as it declined in other parts of Europe. Rembrandt made several silverpoints on prepared vellum, the best-known being the portrait of his wife Saskia, 1633 (KdZ1152, Berlin). Botanical artists and architects continued to use metalpoint because of its exact lines. However, artists who continued this tradition of fine line drawing, such as J. A. D. Ingres, turned to graphite, which gradually improved in quality and availability throughout Europe since the 17th century. Silverpoint was for practical purposes rendered obsolete by the 18th century (Reiche, 2005). There has however been a contemporary art revival among European and American artists and academies because the medium imposes considerable discipline in draughtsmanship since drawings cannot be erased or altered.\n\nJoseph Meder (\"Das Buchlein vom Silberstift\", 1909), Alphonse Legros, the Pre-Raphaelites and Joseph Stella helped revitalize the technique. Art historian Meder created interest in the traditional technique in Austria and Germany, while artist and teacher Legros did likewise in England. In the early 20th century, Stella was one of the few American artists working in this method on the East Coast of the United States. Stella explored the technique on zinc white gouache prepared grounds, often with crayon and other media. Stella's silverpoint oevre includes the 1921 portrait of Marcel Duchamp (MoMA, Katherine S. Dreier Bequest) (Haskell, 1994). On the West Coast Xavier Martinez, the Mexican-American artist who had studied in Paris at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in the late 1890s during the resurgence of interest in silverpoint, taught this technique at the California College of the Arts from 1909 to the late 1930s. The last known exhibition of Martinez’s silverpoints was in 1921 at the Print Room of San Francisco where critics praised his “unusual” and “strongly futuristic” action figures on an unconventional dark mottled ground as “archaic in execution . . . terse, alert . . . with a bit too much flesh.” \n\nAn exhibit, \"The Fine Line: Drawing with Silver in America\" was curated for the Norton Museum of Art, in 1985 by Bruce Weber.\n\nA traditional silverpoint stylus is made with a small fine rod of silver, such as jeweler's wire, which is inserted into a wooden rod. Another design is a silver-tipped metal stylus with points on both ends. An example of this type is shown in Rogier van der Weyden's \"St. Luke Drawing the Virgin,\" ca. 1435–40 (Boston Museum of Fine Arts). For a contemporary stylus, jeweler's wire may be inserted into a pin vise or mechanical pencil (Watrous, 1957).\n\nThe initial marks of silverpoint appear grey as other metalpoints, but silverpoint lines, when exposed to air, tarnish to a warm brown tone. The oxidation becomes perceptible over a period of several months. The speed of oxidation varies according to the level of pollution in the air. Historically, silverpoint styli ranged widely in composition from pure silver to heavily alloyed with copper (over 20% weight) (Duval, 2004; Reiche, 2004/2005; Watrous, 1957).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, metalpoint was used directly on parchment for the underdrawing of illuminated manuscripts or model books. On uncoated parchment (and paper), silverpoint is particularly light in value. However, since the 14th century, silverpoint was used more successfully on prepared supports. A traditional ground may be prepared with a rabbit skin glue solution pigmented with bone ash, chalk and/or lead white. Contemporary grounds include acrylic gesso, gouache and commercially prepared claycoat papers. The slight tooth of the ground preparation takes a little of the silver as it is drawn across the surface.\n\nSilverpoint has encompassed a wide range of styles from Dürer's curvilinear precision to Rembrandt's gestural sketches. Silverpoint has also proven adaptable to modern styles. Thomas Wilmer Dewing's late 19th Century silverpoint portraits are essentially tonal, as are Paula Gerard's mid-20th-century abstract compositions. Gerard's \"Vortex\" (Fairweather Hardin Gallery) is an innovative combination of silverpoint, goldpoint and watercolor on casein-coated parchment (Weber, 1985).\n\nOld Master silverpoints are typically intimate in scale, recalling the technique's roots in manuscript illumination. However, modern artists have also utilized this fine line technique for works on an increasingly large scale. John Wilde's \"The Great Autobiographical Silverpoint Drawing\" (The Art Institute of Chicago 1986.8) which is 38 × 91\", one of the largest modern silverpoints.\n\nSilverpoint was also used in conjunction with other metal points by 20th-century artists. Pedro Joseph de Lemos, the Director of the San Francisco Art Institute from 1911 to 1917, popularized his “techniques” in California art schools with his published instructions on the easy fabrication of various types of metal points that would react with inexpensive coated paper. In his \"The Last of the Old Woodstock Inn\", 1968 (The Art Institute of Chicago), Ivan Le Lorraine Albright used silver with platinum, gold, copper and brasspoint on commercially prepared video media paper. Contemporary artists continue to push the boundaries of this ancient drawing technique. Carol Prusa, for example, combines graphite and binder on acrylic hemispheres with metal leaf, video projection and fiber optics. Susan Schwalb has combined smoke and fire in silver and copperpoints in the 1980s and currently creates drawings and paintings using numermous metals as well as acrylic paint. Jeannine Cook combines touches of colour with monochromatic drawings, employing such media as Prismacolour, watercolour, Plike paper, silk fabric and silk threads. Experimental metalpoint techniques including goldpoint on silicon carbide paper are demonstrated in \"Draw Like da Vinci\" by Susan Dorothea White, as in \"Gilding the Lily\" (2005).\n\n"}
{"id": "265417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265417", "title": "Spanish language in the Americas", "text": "Spanish language in the Americas\n\nThe different varieties of the Spanish language spoken in the Americas are distinct from Peninsular Spanish and Spanish spoken elsewhere, such as in Africa and Asia. Linguistically, this grouping is somewhat arbitrary, akin to having a term for \"overseas English\" encompassing variants spoken in the United States, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand and Ireland, but not the Island of Britain. There is great diversity among the various Latin American vernaculars, and there are no traits shared by all of them which is not also in existence in one or more of the variants of Spanish used in Spain. A Latin American \"standard\" does, however, vary from the Castilian \"standard\" register used in television and notably the dubbing industry.\nOf the more than 469 million people who speak Spanish as their native language, more than 418 million are in Latin America and the United States.\n\nThere are numerous regional particularities and idiomatic expressions within Spanish. In Latin American Spanish, loanwords directly from English are relatively more frequent, and often foreign spellings are left intact. One notable trend is the higher abundance of loan words taken from English in Latin America as well as words derived from English. The Latin American Spanish word for \"computer\" is \"computadora\", whereas the word used in Spain is \"ordenador\", and each word sounds foreign in the region where it is not used. Some differences are due to Iberian Spanish having a stronger French influence than Latin America, where, for geopolitical reasons, the United States influence has been predominant throughout the twentieth century.\n\nPronunciation varies from country to country and from region to region, just as English pronunciation varies from one place to another. In general terms, the speech of the Americas shows many common features akin to southern Spanish variants, especially to western Andalusia (Seville, Cádiz) and the Canary Islands. Coastal language vernaculars throughout Hispanic America show particularly strong similarities to Atlantic-Andalusian speech patterns while inland regions in Mexico and Andean countries are not similar to any particular dialect in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3688175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3688175", "title": "Sprechbund", "text": "Sprechbund\n\nA sprechbund (; , \"speech bond\") refers to \"shared ways of speaking which go beyond language boundaries\" (Romaine, 1994:23). Thus people speaking different languages can share certain linguistic characteristics.\n\nThis is a particularly useful concept for describing, for example, hip-hop music. Hip-hop has a number of defining characteristics including musical style, clothing, and association with minorities. It also has a number of defining linguistic characteristics like rapping, rhyme and human beatboxing. These are essentially linguistic features, but they can be used in any language – even genetically unrelated languages. Their combined use in different languages allows a kind of universal \"language of hip-hop\".\n\nThe sprechbund is to be contrasted with the sprachbund, which refers to \"relatedness at the level of linguistic form\" (Romaine 1994:23). A sprachbund (Norwegian \"\") is a group of languages that have become structurally similar in some way because of geographical proximity. As the names suggest, sprechbund is about speech, and how language is produced; sprachbund is about the underlying structure of language.\n\n"}
{"id": "2318782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318782", "title": "Terminology of the British Isles", "text": "Terminology of the British Isles\n\nThe terminology of the British Isles refers to the various words and phrases that are used to describe the different (and sometimes overlapping) geographical and political areas of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, and the smaller islands which surround them. The terminology is often a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of the actual words used, but also because they are often used loosely. In addition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations which are affected by the history of the islands. \n\nThe purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships among the terms in use; however many of these classifications are contentious and are the subject of disagreement .\n\nThe use of terminology depends on context; words and phrases can generally be grouped into four main areas: geographical, political, linguistic and sporting terms. In brief, the main terms and their simple explanations are as follows:\n\n\nBelow is a visual reference guide to some of the main concepts and territories described in this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" is the official full title of the state. This name appears on official documentation such as British passports. For convenience, the name is usually shortened to \"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" or \"Britain\".\n\nThe United Kingdom is a sovereign state. Its four constituent countries are sometimes considered to be of different status. This view may be supported by the existence of devolved governments with different levels of power in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (see Asymmetrical federalism).\n\nWales is also often erroneously described as a principality of the United Kingdom. The title of Prince of Wales is usually given to the heir apparent to the British throne but it has no political or other role in respect of Wales. The International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) has defined Wales as a \"country\" rather than a \"principality\" since 2011, following a recommendation by the British Standards Institute and the Welsh Government.\n\nNorthern Ireland is sometimes described by United Kingdom citizens as a province of the United Kingdom, which derives from the Irish province of Ulster, of which Northern Ireland is a part. Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of self-government than the other constituent parts of the UK.\n\n\"Great Britain\" is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but as a political entity it also includes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its constituent nations – England, Wales and Scotland – such as England's Isle of Wight, Wales' Anglesey and Scotland's Inner Hebrides, Outer Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.\n\nThe abbreviation \"GB\" is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for example in the Olympics, or as the vehicle registration plate country identification code for UK-registered cars \"(see also British car number plates)\". \"SCO\" in Scotland, \"CYM\" for Wales (Cymru), \"NI\" for Northern Ireland, or \"ENG\" for England can also be used.\n\nThe internet code \".gb,\" although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains use \".uk\".\n\nThe four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting contexts, as \"Home Nations\" or the \"Four Nations\". The BBC refers to its UK-wide broadcasting operation as \"Nations and Regions\" (\"regions\" referring to geographic regions of England. Thus the UK naming conventions tend towards describing distinct \"regions\" or \"nations\" which exist within a single sovereign \"state\".\n\nIn sport, the UK Nations mostly have their own separate national teams – England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, for example in football. Sporting contests between the Four Nations are known as \"Home internationals\" (an example is the British Home Championship in football).\n\nThe governing body for football in Northern Ireland is called the Irish Football Association (the IFA), having been in existence since some forty years before Partition. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus Derry City FC) is the Football Association of Ireland (the FAI). The Northern Ireland national team retained the name \"Ireland\" for some fifty years after partition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to as \"Northern Ireland\" and \"Republic of Ireland\" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at the Olympic Games. According to the Olympic Charter the Olympic Council of Ireland represents the entire island of Ireland. Olympic athletes from Northern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSince the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting organisation (and several other organisations, e.g. tourism, Irish Gaelic and Ulster Scots language boards) on the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.\n\nCitizens of the UK are called \"British\", \"Brits\", \"Britons\" or \"Britisher\" (archaic). The term \"Unionists\" may also be used, sometimes pejoratively, for example by supporters of Scottish independence when referring to supporters of the Union. Some older slang names for Britons are \"Tommy\" (for British soldiers) and \"Anglo\". Anglo properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, \"Anglo-French relations\" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities France and the United Kingdom. \"Anglo-Saxon\" may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole English-speaking world.\n\nSince the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, Ireland has been the English name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The name Éire is used when writing in Irish.\n\nSince the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, the term \"Republic of Ireland\" is the term used as the additional \"description\" of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state. However, the term \"Ireland\" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the European Union or the United Nations. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name \"Éire – Ireland\".\n\nBefore the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the Irish Free State occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous dominion of the British Empire in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The King ceased to be its Head of State in 1936 and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth in 1948.\n\nTraditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four provinces – Leinster, Connacht, Munster and Ulster, with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.\n\nOn the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of \"Ireland\" as the official name of the state causes offence to some Unionists in Northern Ireland, who believe it implies that the state still has a territorial claim to the whole island – the terminology of \"Republic of Ireland\" or \"Éire\" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some Nationalists in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of \"Ireland\" to refer to the whole island.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the Nationalist and Republican communities by the term \"the Twenty-six Counties\", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the Irish Republic, which would consist of all of the thirty-two counties into which the island is divided. The term \"the Six Counties\" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include \"the North of Ireland\" and \"the North\". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ. More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include \"the occupied six counties\" or \"occupied Ireland\", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Irish passport is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the Irish nationality law, any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.\n\nUnder the Interpretation Act 1978 of the United Kingdom, the legal term British Islands (as opposed to the geographical term \"British Isles\") refers to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with the Crown dependencies: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey (which in turn includes the smaller islands of Alderney, Herm and Sark) in the Channel Islands; and the Isle of Man.\n\nSpecial British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" are replaced with \"British Islands\" followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to Jersey passport, Guernsey passport and Isle of Man passport. Like UK passports, Crown dependency also bear the title \"European Union\" for customs purposes. However, Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom are granted a special limited \"Islander Status\" under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community).\n\nSome suggest an early known for the term might be from ancient Greek writings. Though some of the original texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. Parts of the Massaliote Periplus, a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the sixth century BC, were used in translation in the writings of Avienus around AD 400. Ireland was referred to as \"Ierne\" (\"Insula sacra\", the \"sacred island\", as the Greeks interpreted it) \"inhabited by the race of \"Hiberni\"\" (\"gens hiernorum\"), and Britain as \"insula Albionum\", \"island of the Albions\". Several sources from around 150 BC to AD 70 include fragments of the travel writings of the ancient Greek Pytheas around 320 BC, use the terms \"Albion\" and \"Ierne\" and have been described as referring to the British Isles, including Ireland, as the \"Prettanic\" or \"Brettanic Islands\" () or as , literally \"the Britains\".\nGreek writers called the peoples of these islands the , later (alternative spellings of this and of all relative words have a single tau or a double nu), a name that possibly corresponds to the \"Priteni\". These names may have derived from a \"Celtic language\" term which may have reached Pytheas from the Gauls who may have used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.\n\nThe Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern France) \"Galli\" or \"Celtae\", the latter term deriving from the Greek name for a central European people. Antiquarians of the seventeenth century who found language connections developed the idea of a race of Celts inhabiting the islands, but this term was not used by the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland, nor is there any record of the inhabitants of the British Isles referring to themselves as such. Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the province of Britannia into the praetorian prefecture of Gaul, in common with Hispania, which had Celtiberians. Armorica, where the Bretons would settle, was part of \"Gallia Celtica\", so there were tertiary relations between the Britons and Gallic Celts at least. In addition, the Parisii of Gallia Celtica are thought to have founded Aldborough in Britain. Belgae and Silures also came from Gallic areas, although not strictly \"Celtic\", but from \"Gallia Belgica\" and \"Aquitainia\".\n\n\"Priteni\" is the source of the Welsh language term Prydain, \"Britain\", and has the same source as the Goidelic term Cruithne. The latter referred to the early Brythonic speaking inhabitants of the Scottish highlands and the north of Scotland, who are known as the Cruithne in Scottish Gaelic, and who the Romans called Picts or Caledonians.\n\nCaesar's invasions of Britain brought descriptions of the peoples of what he called \"Britannia pars interior\", \"inland Britain\", in 55 BC. Throughout Book 4 of his \"Geography\", Strabo is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as \"Prettanikē\"; he uses the terms \"Prettans\" or \"Brettans\" loosely to refer to the islands as a group – a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, \"…οι νοτιώτατοι των Βρεττανών βορειότεροι τούτων εισίν\" (\"…the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this\"). He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.\nPliny the Elder writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his \"Naturalis Historia\". He writes of Great Britain: \"Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.\" (\"Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment\"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.\nIn his \"Geography\" written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100, Ptolemy includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland (Iwernia) in the so called \"Bretanic\" island group. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as \"Iwernia, Bretanic Island\", and Chapter 2 as \"Alwion [sic], Bretanic Island\".\n\nThe name \"Albion\" for Great Britain fell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as Πρεττανία or Βρεττανία, in Latin \"Britannia\", an inhabitant as Βρεττανός, \"Britannus\", with the adjective Βρεττανικός, \"Britannicus\", equating to \"British\". With the Roman conquest of Britain the name Britannia was used for the province of Roman Britain. The Emperor Claudius was honoured with the agnomen \"Britannicus\" as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46 inscribed or . With the visit of Hadrian in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label as a personification or goddess of the place. These and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which would be reintroduced in the 17th century.\n\nIn the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at home and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as \"Brittanus\" or \"Britto\", and where describing their citizenship gave it as \"cives\" of a British tribe or of a \"patria\" (homeland) of \"Britannia\", not \"Roma\". From the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the English Channel and founded Brittany.\n\nWhile Latin remained the language of learning, from the early mediaeval period records begin to appear in native languages. The earliest indigenous source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the \"Life of Saint Columba\", a hagiography recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk Saint Columba among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by Adomnán of Iona, an Irish monk living on the Inner Hebridean island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is Oceani Insulae meaning \"Islands of the Ocean\" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no \"Priteni\"-derived collective reference is made.\n\nAnother early native source to use a collective term is the \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" of Bede written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is \"insularum\" meaning \"islands\" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain \"studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins\", distinguishing between the Brythonic languages of the \"ancient Britons\" or Old Welsh speakers and other language groups.\n\nBrythonic, Saxon and Viking kingdoms such as Strathclyde, Wessex, and Jórvík amalgamated, leading to the formation of Scotland, and England. Wales was sometimes united under princes or kings such as Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent Norman Ireland, local lords gained considerable autonomy from the Lordship of Ireland until it became the Kingdom of Ireland under direct English rule.\n\nAbraham Ortelius makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570 by the full title of his map: \"Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio\" ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). George Lily's 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by Polydore Vergil for Henry VIII states, \"The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people.\"\n\nMaps of the Mediaeval, Renaissance and later periods often referred to \"Albion\". This archaic term was originally used by Ptolemy and Pliny to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (\"Albany\", or \"Alba\" in Gaelic). \"Albion\" has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.\n\nFollowing the Acts of Union 1707, a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as \"North Britain\" and \"South Britain\" respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the North British Railway, which became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in Edinburgh in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.\n\nThe diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the Scottish King James VI inherited the English throne as \"James I of England\". He styled himself as \"James I of Great Britain\", although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. (The term \"Great Britain\" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.)\n\nThe 1707 Act of Union united England and Scotland in the Kingdom of Great Britain under the Parliament of Great Britain, then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the Act of Union creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish unrest culminated in the Irish War of Independence and the 1922 separation of the Irish Free State, which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant northeast continued to be part of what became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nBritish overseas territories such as Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands have various relationships with the UK. The Commonwealth of Nations, initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former British Empire. (This has no connection with the Commonwealth of England, a short-lived republic replacing the previous kingdoms during the English Interregnum (1649–1660).)\n\nThe adjectives used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.\n\nIn the absence of a single adjective to refer to the United Kingdom, \"British\" is generally used to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, \"British\" is used to refer to the island of Great Britain. The adjectival phrase \"Great British\" is very rarely used to refer to Great Britain, other than to contrive a pun on the word \"great\", as in \"Great British Food\".\n\n\"Irish\", refers to people or a characteristic \"of Ireland\". As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of \"Ireland\" being used: it can relate both to the Irish state, and to the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, can thus be both \"British\" or \"Irish\", reflected in the ability for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship. In order to be more specific, \"Northern Irish\" is therefore in common usage. Members of the Nationalist communities would not describe themselves as \"British\" and would only use the terms \"Irish\", or specifically \"Northern Irish\" where needed.\n\nThe term \"Ulster\" can also be used as an adjective (e.g. \"Royal Ulster Constabulary\"), but this is more likely to be used by Unionists and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster, namely Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan forming part of the Republic). The term \"Ulsterman\" (or \"Ulsterwoman\") is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, Nationalists might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as \"Irish\".\n\nNote that the geographical term Irish Sea thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British Crown dependency, the Isle of Man—as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term’s usage to mirror that of \"British Isles\". The \"Northern\" in \"Northern Ireland\" is not completely accurate. The most northerly point on the island, Malin Head, is in the Republic of Ireland—in County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula.\n\nThe dictionary definition of British Isles is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of Ireland and Great Britain as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK; or to refer to Great Britain and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of Ireland entirely. The BBC and \"The Times\" have style guides that mandate the dictionary definition but occasional misuse can be found on their web sites.\n\nThe term \"British Isles\" can also be considered irritating or offensive by some on the grounds that the modern association of the term \"British\" with the United Kingdom makes its application to Ireland inappropriate.\n\nThe term \"British Isles\" can also be considered to imply a proprietary title on the entire archipelago.\n\nThe policy of the government of Ireland is that no branch of government should use the term, and although it is on occasion used in a geographical sense in Irish parliamentary debates, this is often done in a way that excludes the Republic of Ireland. In October 2006, \"The Times\" quoted a spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London as saying that they would discourage its use.\n\nDuring a stop-over visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1989, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, indicated that he assumed Ireland's head of state was Queen Elizabeth II, given that she was the British Queen and his officials said that Ireland was a part of the British Isles.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, some nationalists reject the term and instead use \"these islands\", \"these isles\" or \"Britain and Ireland\" as an alternative.\n\nThere have been several suggestions for replacements for the term \"British Isles\". Although there is no single accepted replacement, the terms \"Great Britain and Ireland\", \"The British Isles and Ireland\" and \"Britain and Ireland\" are all used.\n\nThe word \"England\" is often used synecdochically to refer to Great Britain—or the United Kingdom as a whole—which often causes offence, particularly to those from the non-English parts of Britain. In a similar way, references to England as an island, to an \"English passport\", or to Scottish or Welsh places as being in England are examples of this usage of the term \"England\".\n\nBecause of the offence likely to be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this usage, most politicians and official figures have avoided this usage since the early 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from earlier times. For a long time it was common for fans of the England football team to wave the British Union Flag—with the use of the specifically English St George's Cross flag only gaining popularity at the Euro 96 tournament.\n\nThe colloquial usage of \"England\" as a synonym for \"Britain\" is still widespread outside the UK. In Germany, the term \"England\" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for \"English\" is synonymous with \"British\"—see the article on Alternative words for British for more detail.\n\nThe term \"Europe\" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to Mainland Europe, sometimes called \"continental Europe\" or simply \"the Continent\" by some people in the archipelago. \"Europe\" may also be used in reference to the European Union (or, historically, to the European Economic Community). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom \"To the Manor Born\". When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built \"in feet and inches\", a tradesman says \"We're in Europe now\", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts \"Well you may be, but I'm staying here!\" - implying that to her, the word \"Europe\" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe word \"Great\" means \"larger\", in comparison with Brittany in modern-day France. One historical term for the peninsula in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is \"Lesser\" or \"Little Britain\". That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of Anglo-Saxon migration into Britain, and named \"Little Britain\" by them. The French term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to the British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called \"Grande-Bretagne\". In classical times, the Graeco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his \"Almagest\" also called the larger island \"megale Brettania\" (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of Ireland, which he called \"mikra Brettania\" (little Britain). In his later work \"Geography\", Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as \"Albion\" and to Ireland as \"Iwernia\". These \"new\" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.\n\nThe word \"Britain\" is ambiguous, being used variously to mean Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and for some, England. Use of \"Britain\" can be contentious, with many people in Northern Ireland objecting to its application to their province. While some organisations including the BBC and British Government prefer to use \"Britain\" as shorthand for Great Britain, others prefer, where precision is not required, to use \"Britain\" to mean the United Kingdom.\n\nThe word \"Ireland\" has two meanings.\n\n\nThe terminology and usage of the name \"Ulster\" in Irish and British culture varies. Many within the unionist community and much of the UK press refer to Northern Ireland as \"Ulster\"whereas the nationalist community refer to the traditional Irish province of Ulster, which is a nine-county entity that incorporates the three counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan (which are in the Republic) along with the counties of Armagh, Antrim, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone in Northern Ireland.\n\nThus, the word \"Ulster\" has two usages:\n\nThe Isle of Man and the two bailiwicks of the Channel Islands are Crown dependencies; that is, non-sovereign nations, self-governing but whose sovereignty is held by the British Crown. They control their own internal affairs, but not their defence or foreign relations. They are not part of the United Kingdom or part of the European Union.\n\nThere are five living Celtic languages in the region. Each has names for the islands and countries of the British Isles. They are divided into two branches:\n\n\nSome of the above are:\n\nThe English word \"Welsh\" is from a common Germanic root meaning \"Romanised foreigner\" (cognate with Wallonia and Wallachia, and also cognate with the word used in Mediaeval German to refer to the French and Italians).\n\nThe English names \"Albion\" and \"Albany\" are related to \"Alba\" and used poetically for either England or Scotland, or the whole island of Great Britain.\n\nEnglish \"Erin\" is a poetic name for Ireland derived from \"Éire\" (or rather, from its dative form \"Éirinn\").\n\nIn Irish, the term \"Oileáin Bhriotanacha\" is a translation of the English term \"British Isles\". Another translation is \"Oileáin Bhreataineacha\", which was used in the 1937 translation from English to Irish of a 1931 geography book.\n\nEarlier dictionaries give \"Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa\" as the translation, literally meaning \"West European Isles\". Today the most common term \"Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór\" is used, meaning literally as \"Ireland and Great Britain\", as provided by terminological dictionaries.\n\n\"Blighty\" is a slang word for Britain derived from the Hindustani word \"bilāyatī\" (\"foreign\"). Depending on the user, it is meant either affectionately or archly. It was often used by British soldiers abroad in the First World War to refer to home.\n\n"}

{"id": "323040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323040", "title": "Yale school", "text": "Yale school\n\nThe Yale school is a colloquial name for an influential group of literary critics, theorists, and philosophers of literature that were influenced by Jacques Derrida's philosophy of deconstruction. Many of the theorists were affiliated with Yale University in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists — including Derrida himself — subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the University of California at Irvine.\n\nAs a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the post-structuralist dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its phenomenological dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version of deconstruction that John D. Caputo has described as a \"Nietzschean free play of signifiers\" and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.\n\nDuring the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, Yale University was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to deconstruction. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, J. Hillis Miller, and Harold Bloom. This group came to be known as the \"Yale School\" and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, \"Deconstruction and Criticism\". However, Harold Bloom's position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.\n\nIn his introduction to \"Deconstruction and Criticism\", Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other. The former category he refers to as \"boa-deconstructors\" who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings. \n\nHartman claims that both himself and Bloom are \"barely deconstructionists\" and that they \"even write against it on occasion.\" Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of pathos as a fundamental impetus for literary language. In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.\n\n\nAfter teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, J. Hillis Miller left for the University of California, Irvine, where he is today Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nShortly after J. Hillis Miller's arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI’s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida’s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI’s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida’s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine’s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.\n\nThe Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the Paul de Man Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man's work in comparative literature.\n"}
