Returning to Maranhão, he initiated his artistical career, performing in a play that would make him arrested. After this incident, he moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nHe tried the artistic and the journalistic career, failing in the first one. He wrote for journals \"Folha Nova\", \"O Combate\" and \"A Gazetinha\", where he published some poems and works in prose — and, in this last one, he would collaborate once more with Azevedo, who was its founder. Alongside Ferreira de Menezes, Augusto Ribeiro, Hugo Leal and João de Almeida, he would work for the journal \"A Gazeta da Tarde\", that was, according to Múcio Leão, \"one of the most ill-fated journals ever founded\", because its founders would die in the next three years after the journal's existence.\n\nAfter the \"Gazeta da Tarde\" was bought by José do Patrocínio, Adelino becomes its correspondent in Paris. Already very sick, his situation got worse due to the harsh French winter, what made him move to Lisbon in an unsuccessful attempt to get better.\n\nHe died with only 25 years, without publishing any book.\n\nAs mentioned above, Fontoura's work is very sparse, as he did not published anything during his lifetime. Attempts of compiling his poetry were made during the 1940s and 1950s by Múcio Leão.\n\nHis most well-known poem is the sonnet \"Celeste\".\n\n"}

Esperema\". Although it was a full language, it may not have been created to be spoken. Many believe that as an Esperantist, Colas created Adjuvilo to help create dissent in the then-growing Ido movement. Colas himself called his language \"simplified Ido\" and proposed several reforms to Ido.\n\nColas created a nearly complete grammar, but did not create a new vocabulary. Adjuvilo uses mainly the vocabulary of Ido with modifications according to the grammatical changes of Ido. Colas in some cases reestablishes the Esperanto forms of words and even constructed some new words like \"sulo\" for \"sun\" (Ido/Esperanto: \"suno\") and \"dago\" for \"day\" (Ido: \"dio\", Esperanto: \"tago\").\n\nAdjuvilo uses the same phonology and orthography as Ido. The only modification is that the stress is always on the penultimate syllable like in Esperanto, whereas in Ido in the infinitive of the verbs the last syllable is stressed.\n\n\n\nAll in all the changes to Ido were so great that Adjuvilo in fact is a new constructed language.\n\nA sample of Adjuvilo, the often-translated \"Pater Noster:\"\n\"Patro nosa, qua estan en cielos, santa esten tua nomo, advenen tua regno, esten tua volo, quale en cielos, tale anke sur la tero; nosa panon omnadaga donen a nos hodie; nosas ofendos pardonen a nos, quale nos pardonan a nosas ofendantos e ne lasen nos fali en tento, ma liberifen nos de malbono.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1210365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1210365", "title": "All persons fictitious disclaimer", "text": "All persons fictitious disclaimer\n\nAn \"all persons fictitious\" disclaimer in a work of media is one which states that the persons portrayed in it are not based on real people. This is done to reduce the possibility of legal action for libel from any person who believes that he or she has been defamed by their portrayal in the work, whether portrayed under their real name or a different name. The wording of this disclaimer varies, and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as does its legal effectiveness.\n\nThe disclaimer for American studio films and TV series is routinely included among disclaimers on other topics, such as copyright, animal welfare, and promotion of tobacco use, such as:This motion picture is protected under the copyright laws of the United States and other countries throughout the world. Country of first publication: United States of America. Any unauthorized exhibition, distribution, or copying of this film or any part thereof (including soundtrack) may result in civil liability and criminal prosecution. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred. No person or entity associated with this film received payment or anything of value, or entered into any agreement, in connection with the depiction of tobacco products. No animals were harmed in the making of this motion picture.\n\nThe disclaimer came as a result of litigation against the 1932 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"Rasputin and the Empress\", which insinuated that the character Princess Natasha had been raped by Russian mystic Rasputin. The character of Natasha was supposedly intended to represent Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who sued MGM for libel. After seeing the film twice, the jury agreed that the princess had been defamed. Irina and her husband Felix Yusupov were reportedly awarded $127,373 in damages by the English Court of Appeal in 1934 and $1 million in an out-of-court settlement with MGM. As a preventive measure against further lawsuits, the film was taken out of distribution for decades. \n\nThe film began with a claim that \"This concerns the destruction of an empire … A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence.\" Reportedly, a justice in the case told MGM that not only was this claim damaging to their case, but that their case would be stronger if they had incorporated a directly opposite statement, that the film wasn't intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events. Prompted by the outcome of this case, many studios began to incorporate an \"all persons fictitious\" disclaimer in their films, to protect themselves from similar court action.\n\nAlthough the disclaimer is routinely included as boilerplate, producers sometimes vary from it, sometimes to make a statement about the veracity of their work, for humor, or to satirize the standard disclaimer. \n\nThe disclaimer is sometimes presented with qualifications. In Jack Webb's police series \"Dragnet\", each episode begins with an announcer intoning, \"The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.\" The 1969 alternative western comedy \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", based upon real individuals whose lives and exploits already had a place among American legends of the West, opens with the disclaimer \"Most of what follows is true.\" Because of the autobiographical nature of Dave Eggers' memoir, \"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\", the book features the following play on the usual disclaimer: \"Any resemblance to persons living or dead should be plainly apparent to them and those who know them, especially if the author has been kind enough to have provided their real names and, in some cases, their phone numbers. All events described herein actually happened, though on occasion the author has taken certain, very small, liberties with chronology, because that is his right as an American.\" All episodes of \"South Park\", which frequently features well-known public figures or parodies of them, open with a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that begins by stating, \"All characters and events in this show – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated – poorly.\" \n\nDisclaimers can occasionally be used to make political or similar points. One such disclaimer is shown at the end of the industrial/political thriller \"The Constant Gardener\", signed by the author of the original book, John le Carré: \"Nobody in this story, and no outfit or corporation, thank God, is based upon an actual person or outfit in the real world. But I can tell you this; as my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard.\" The 1969 film \"Z\", which is based on the military dictatorship ruling Greece at that time, has this notice: \"Any resemblance to actual events, to persons living or dead, is not the result of chance. It is DELIBERATE.\" German nobel laureate Heinrich Böll's novel \"The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum\" was originally preceded by a statement which made the usual disclaimer, but stated that similarities to the journalistic practices of the German newspaper \"Bild\" \"are neither intended nor coincidental but inevitable\"; this disclaimer was later removed in the English edition.\n\nThe familiar disclaimer is often rewritten for humor. Early examples include The Three Stooges' parody of Nazi Germany \"You Nazty Spy\", which stated that \"Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and any persons, living or dead, is a miracle,\" and its sequel \"I'll Never Heil Again\", which features a disclaimer that states that \"The characters in this picture are fictitious. Anyone resembling them is better off dead.\" In the 1966 film \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", a disclaimer states: 'None of the characters appearing in this photoplay intentionally resemble any persons living or dead…SINCE THEY DO NOT YET EXIST' (the film is set in the year 2068). In the film \"An American Werewolf in London\", and in \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\", the disclaimer refers to \"persons living, dead or undead\". \n\nVariations sometimes employ irony or satire. The film \"Return of the Living Dead\" features a disclaimer that reads \"The events portrayed in this film are all true. The names are real names of real people and real organizations.\" The novel \"Breakfast of Champions\" by Kurt Vonnegut features a truncated version of the disclaimer: \"All persons, living and dead, are purely coincidental, and should not be construed\", referring to the novel's existentialist themes. Richard Linklater's 1990 feature film \"Slacker\" ends with \"This story was based on fact. Any similarity with fictitious events or characters was purely coincidental.\"\n\nIn response to controversies over cultural appropriation and the use of an indigenous term, Filipino television network ABS-CBN used a special disclaimer in the 2018 fantaserye \"Bagani\", maintaining that the series takes place in an alternate fantasy universe inspired but unrelated to pre-colonial Philippines and is in no way intended to trivialize or misrepresent tribal groups: \"Ang kuwentong inyong mapapanood ay kathang-isip lamang at kumuha ng inspirasyon mula sa iba’t ibang alamat at mitolohiyang Pilipino. Ito’y hindi tumutukoy o kumakatawan sa kahit anong Indigenous People sa Pilipinas.\" (\"The story you're about to watch is a work of fiction and is inspired by Philippine mythology and folk legends. It does not refer to and is not representative of any Indigenous People in the Philippines.\")\n\nIf a fictitious film is perceived to be too close to actual events, the disclaimer may be ruled null and void in court and the inspiration behind the film may be due compensation. Such was the case with the 1980 film \"The Idolmaker\", which was based on a fictional talent promoter who discovers a talentless teenage boy and turns him into a manufactured star; Fabian, whose career path was very similar to the fictional boy's, took offense at the caricature, and the production company responded with the all persons fictitious disclaimer. As the promoter on which the fictional character was based, Bob Marcucci, was part of the production staff (and thus it could not be plausibly denied that actual events inspired the film), Fabian ultimately received a settlement granting a minority stake in the film's profits.\n\n"}

They may be most closely related to the Papuan languages of western Timor, but this is not yet clear. A more distant relationship with the Trans–New Guinea languages of the Bomberai peninsula has been proposed based on pronominal evidence, but though often cited has never been firmly established.\n\nThe family is conventionally divided into two branches, centered on the islands of Alor and Pantar.\n\n\nTereweng is sometimes considered a separate language from Blagar, and Hamap sometimes separate from Adang. Abui, Kamang, and Kabola may also not be unitary languages. 71940 total speakers.\n\nHolton, et al. (2012) propose the following classificatory subgrouping for the Alor–Pantar languages, with individual languages marked by italics.\n\n\n\"Proto-Alor–Pantar\" may be synonymous with Proto-Timor–Alor–Pantar, as the languages outside the Alor branch do not seem to form a valid node with it against the Oirata–Makasai languages of East Timor and Bunak language on the Timorese border. However, the relationship is distant. Ross (2005) postulates a \"West Timor\" group uniting Alor–Pantar with Bunak. He reconstructs the pronouns as:\n\n3pl *gi is not attested from Bunak, and the inclusive is just \"i\".\n\nLanguage documentation efforts in the early 21st century have produced a range of published documentary materials.\n\nIt has long been recognized that the Papuan languages of the Alor archipelago (including Alor and Pantar, as well as the four small islands of Buaya, Pura, Ternate, and Tereweng in the Pantar Strait) form a well-defined group. Apparent cognates among basic vocabulary are abundant, as demonstrated for example in Stokhof’s (1975) survey of basic vocabulary, and the shape of pronominal systems is almost identical across the group. The genetic relatedness of the Alor–Pantar languages has been confirmed through the reconstruction of the proto-Alor–Pantar language. Relationships between the Alor–Pantar languages and at least some (though perhaps not all) of the non-Austronesian languages of Timor Island may justify the positing of a Timor–Alor–Pantar language family, however the relationship between the AP group and the Timor languages is of a second order.\n\nBased on an examination of possessive prefixes, Capell (1944) originally postulated that the AP languages were related to the West Papuan Phylum languages of North Maluku and the Bird’s Head of New Guinea. This hypothesis was later countered by Wurm et al. (1975), who classified these languages as members of the putative Trans–New Guinea Phylum. However, the authors offered little evidence for this classification and remained somewhat doubtful, noting, “whichever way they [the Timor–Alor–Pantar languages] are classified, they contain strong substratum elements of the other … phyla involved” (Wurm et al. 1975:318).\nMost recently, based on an analysis of pronominal shapes Ross (2005) assigns AP to his West Trans–New Guinea linkage, a subgroup of Trans–New Guinea. Yet Ross’ proposal requires that AP pronouns be derived from pTNG via a flip-flop in which second person pronouns trade places with third person. Compare pTNG *ŋga ‘2pro’ and *(y)a ‘3pro’ with Nedebang aŋ and gaŋ, respectively. Bottom-up reconstruction based on regular sound correspondences may shed further light on these issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "288281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288281", "title": "Astral projection", "text": "Astral projection\n\nAstral projection (or astral travel) is a term used in esotericism to describe a willful out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of a soul or consciousness called an \"astral body\" that is separate from the physical body and capable of travelling outside it throughout the universe.\n\nThe idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of 'astral projection' was coined and promoted by 19th century Theosophists. It is sometimes reported in association with dreams, and forms of meditation. Some individuals have reported perceptions similar to descriptions of astral projection that were induced through various hallucinogenic and hypnotic means (including self-hypnosis). There is no scientific evidence that there is a consciousness or soul which is separate from normal neural activity or that one can consciously leave the body and make observations, and astral projection has been characterized as a pseudoscience.\n\nAccording to classical, medieval and renaissance Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and later Theosophist and Rosicrucian thought the astral body is an intermediate body of light linking the rational soul to the physical body while the astral plane is an intermediate world of light between Heaven and Earth, composed of the spheres of the planets and stars. These astral spheres were held to be populated by angels, demons and spirits.\n\nThe subtle bodies, and their associated planes of existence, form an essential part of the esoteric systems that deal with astral phenomena. In the neo-platonism of Plotinus, for example, the individual is a microcosm (\"small world\") of the universe (the macrocosm or \"great world\"). \"The rational soul...is akin to the great Soul of the World\" while \"the material universe, like the body, is made as a faded image of the Intelligible\". Each succeeding plane of manifestation is causal to the next, a world-view known as emanationism; \"from the One proceeds Intellect, from Intellect Soul, and from Soul - in its lower phase, or that of Nature - the material universe\".\n\nOften these bodies and their planes of existence are depicted as a series of concentric circles or nested spheres, with a separate body traversing each realm. The idea of the astral figured prominently in the work of the nineteenth-century French occultist Eliphas Levi, whence it was adopted and developed further by Theosophy, and used afterwards by other esoteric movements.\n\nCarrington, Muldoon, Peterson, and Williams—renowned experts in the field of astral projection—claim that the subtle body is attached to the physical body by means of a psychic silver cord. The final chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes is often cited in this respect: \"Before the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain, or the wheel be broken at the cistern.\" Scherman, however, contends that the context points to this being merely a metaphor, comparing the body to a machine, with the silver cord referring to the spine.\n\nPaul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians is more generally agreed to refer to the astral planes: \"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.\" This statement gave rise to the \"Visio Pauli\", a tract that offers a vision of heaven and hell, a forerunner of visions attributed to Adomnan and Tnugdalus as well as of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\".\n\nSimilar concepts of soul travel appear in various other religious traditions. For example, ancient Egyptian teachings present the soul (\"ba\") as having the ability to hover outside the physical body via the \"ka\", or subtle body.\n\nTaoist alchemical practice involves creation of an energy body by breathing meditations, drawing energy into a 'pearl' that is then \"circulated\". \"Xiangzi ... with a drum as his pillow fell fast asleep, snoring and motionless. His primordial spirit, however, went straight into the banquet room and said, \"My lords, here I am again.\" When Tuizhi walked with the officials to take a look, there really was a Taoist sleeping on the ground and snoring like thunder. Yet inside, in the side room, there was another Taoist beating a fisher drum and singing Taoist songs. The officials all said, \"Although there are two different people, their faces and clothes are exactly alike. Clearly he is a divine immortal who can divide his body and appear in several places at once. ...\" At that moment, the Taoist in the side room came walking out, and the Taoist sleeping on the ground woke up. The two merged into one.\"\n\nIn Buddhism the ability to do Astral Projection is one of many believed super normal powers for those who reach 4th Jhana.\n\nAccording to Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life (Digha Nikaya 2.85-87) Buddha said.\n\n\"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability (reaching 4th Jhana), he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way — with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.\" \n\nSimilar ideas such as the Lin'ga S'ari-ra are found in ancient Hindu scriptures such as the \"YogaVashishta-Maharamayana of Valmiki\". Modern Indians who have vouched for astral projection include Paramahansa Yogananda who witnessed Swami Pranabananda doing a miracle through a possible astral projection,\n\nThe Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba described one's use of astral projection:\nIn the advancing stages leading to the beginning of the path, the aspirant becomes spiritually prepared for being entrusted with free use of the forces of the inner world of the astral bodies. He may then undertake astral journeys in his astral body, leaving the physical body in sleep or wakefulness. The astral journeys that are taken unconsciously are much less important than those undertaken with full consciousness and as a result of deliberate volition. This implies conscious use of the astral body. Conscious separation of the astral body from the outer vehicle of the gross body has its own value in making the soul feel its distinction from the gross body and in arriving at fuller control of the gross body. One can, at will, put on and take off the external gross body as if it were a cloak, and use the astral body for experiencing the inner world of the astral and for undertaking journeys through it, if and when necessary...The ability to undertake astral journeys therefore involves considerable expansion of one’s scope for experience. It brings opportunities for promoting one’s own spiritual advancement, which begins with the involution of consciousness.\n\nAstral projection is one of the Siddhis considered achievable by yoga practitioners through self-disciplined practice.\nIn the epic The Mahabharata Drona leaves his physical body to see if his son is alive.\n\nIn Japanese mythology, an (also read \"shōryō\", \"seirei\", or \"ikisudama\") is a manifestation of the soul of a living person separately from their body. Traditionally, if someone holds a sufficient grudge against another person, it is believed that a part or the whole of their soul can temporarily leave their body and appear before the target of their hate in order to curse or otherwise harm them, similar to an evil eye. Souls are also believed to leave a living body when the body is extremely sick or comatose; such \"ikiryō\" are not malevolent.\n\nIn some Inuit groups, people with special capabilities are said to travel to (mythological) remote places, and report their experiences and things important to their fellows or the entire community; how to stop bad luck in hunting, cure a sick person etc., things unavailable to people with normal capabilities.\n\nThe \"yaskomo\" of the Waiwai is believed to be able to perform a \"soul flight\" that can serve several functions such as healing, flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a new-born baby, flying to the cave of \"peccaries' mountains\" to ask the \"father of peccaries\" for abundance of game or flying deep down in a river to get the help of other beings.\n\nThe expression \"astral projection\" came to be used in two different ways. For the Golden Dawn and some Theosophists it retained the classical and medieval philosophers' meaning of journeying to other worlds, heavens, hells, the astrological spheres and other imaginal landscapes, but outside these circles the term was increasingly applied to non-physical travel around the physical world.\n\nThough this usage continues to be widespread, the term, \"etheric travel\", used by some later Theosophists, offers a useful distinction. Some experients say they visit different times and/or places: \"etheric\", then, is used to represent the sense of being \"out of the body\" in the physical world, whereas \"astral\" may connote some alteration in time-perception. Robert Monroe describes the former type of projection as \"Locale I\" or the \"Here-Now\", involving people and places that actually exist: Robert Bruce calls it the \"Real Time Zone\" (RTZ) and describes it as the non-physical dimension-level closest to the physical. This etheric body is usually, though not always, invisible but is often perceived by the experient as connected to the physical body during separation by a \"silver cord\". Some link \"falling\" dreams with projection.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel, the etheric \"double\" serves as a medium between the astral and physical realms. In his system the ether, also called \"prana\", is the \"vital force\" that empowers the physical forms to change. From his descriptions it can be inferred that, to him, when one views the physical during an out-of-body experience, one is not technically \"in\" the astral realm at all.\n\nOther experients may describe a domain that has no parallel to any known physical setting. Environments may be populated or unpopulated, artificial, natural or abstract, and the experience may be beatific, horrific or neutral. A common Theosophical belief is that one may access a compendium of mystical knowledge called the \"Akashic records\". In many accounts the experiencer correlates the astral world with the world of dreams. Some even report seeing other dreamers enacting dream scenarios unaware of their wider environment.\n\nThe astral environment may also be divided into \"levels\" or \"sub-planes\" by theorists, but there are many different views in various traditions concerning the overall structure of the astral planes: they may include heavens and hells and other after-death spheres, transcendent environments, or other less-easily characterized states.\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg was one of the first practitioners to write extensively about the out-of-body experience, in his Spiritual Diary (1747–65). French philosopher and novelist Honoré de Balzac's fictional work \"Louis Lambert\" suggests he may have had some astral or out-of-body experience.\n\nThere are many twentieth century publications on astral projection, although only a few authors remain widely cited. These include Robert Monroe, Oliver Fox, Sylvan Muldoon, and Hereward Carrington, and Yram.\n\nRobert Monroe's accounts of journeys to other realms (1971–1994) popularized the term \"OBE\" and were translated into a large number of languages. Though his books themselves only placed secondary importance on descriptions of method, Monroe also founded an institute dedicated to research, exploration and non-profit dissemination of auditory technology for assisting others in achieving projection and related altered states of consciousness.\n\nRobert Bruce, William Buhlman, Marilynn Hughes, and Albert Taylor have discussed their theories and findings on the syndicated show Coast to Coast AM several times. Michael Crichton gives lengthy and detailed explanations and experience of astral projection in his non-fiction book \"Travels\".\n\nIn her book, \"My Religion\", Helen Keller tells of her beliefs in Swedenborgianism and how she once \"traveled\" to Athens: \n\nThe soul's ability to leave the body at will or while sleeping and visit the various planes of heaven is also known as \"soul travel\". The practice is taught in Surat Shabd Yoga, where the experience is achieved mostly by meditation techniques and mantra repetition. All Sant Mat Gurus widely spoke about this kind of out of body experience, such as Kirpal Singh.\n\nEckankar describes Soul Travel broadly as movement of the true, spiritual self (Soul) closer to the heart of God. While the contemplative may perceive the experience as travel, Soul itself is said not to move but to \"come into an agreement with fixed states and conditions that already exist in some world of time and space\". American Harold Klemp, the current Spiritual Leader of Eckankar practices and teaches Soul Travel, as did his predecessors, through contemplative techniques known as the \"Spiritual Exercises of ECK\" (Divine Spirit).\n\nIn occult traditions, practices range from inducing trance states to the mental construction of a second body, called the \"Body of Light\" in Aleister Crowley's writings, through visualization and controlled breathing, followed by the transfer of consciousness to the secondary body by a mental act of will.\n\nThere is no known scientific evidence that astral projection as an objective phenomenon exists.\n\nThere are cases of patients having experiences suggestive of astral projection from brain stimulation treatments and hallucinogenic drugs, such as ketamine, phencyclidine, and DMT.\n\nRobert Todd Carroll writes that the main evidence to support claims of astral travel is anecdotal and comes \"in the form of testimonials of those who claim to have experienced being out of their bodies when they may have been out of their minds.\" Subjects in parapsychological experiments have attempted to project their astral bodies to distant rooms and see what was happening. However, such experiments haven't produced clear results.\n\nAccording to Bob Bruce of the Queensland Skeptics Association, astral projection is \"just imagining\", or \"a dream state\". Bruce writes that the existence of an astral plane is contrary to the limits of science. \"We know how many possibilities there are for dimensions and we know what the dimensions do. None of it correlates with things like astral projection.\" Bruce attributes astral experiences such as \"meetings\" alleged by practitioners to confirmation bias and coincidences.\n\nPsychologist Donovan Rawcliffe has written that astral projection can be explained by delusion, hallucination and vivid dreams.\n\nArthur W. Wiggins, writing in \"Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins\", said that purported evidence of the ability to astral travel great distances and give descriptions of places visited is predominantly anecdotal. In 1978, Ingo Swann provided a test of his alleged ability to astral travel to Jupiter and observe details of the planet. Actual findings and information were later compared to Swann's claimed observations; according to an evaluation by James Randi, Swann's accuracy was \"unconvincing and unimpressive\" with an overall score of 37 percent. Wiggins considers astral travel an illusion, and looks to neuroanatomy, human belief, imagination and prior knowledge to provide prosaic explanations for those claiming to experience it.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22428249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22428249", "title": "Back-to-back film production", "text": "Back-to-back film production\n\nFilming \"back-to-back\" refers to the practice of filming two or more movies as one production, reducing costs and time.\n\nTrilogies are common in the film industry, particularly in science fiction, fantasy, action, horror, thriller, and adventure genres. Production companies may choose, if the first film is a financial success, to green-light a second and a third film at the same time and film them back-to-back. In a case where a lengthy novel is split into multiple installments for its film adaptation, those installments will usually be filmed back-to-back.\n\nIn modern filmmaking, the entire cast and crew for each film is assembled from scratch for each project, and each of them is laid off as soon as they complete their assigned tasks. Almost all participants in the industry are freelancers, who move easily from one project to the next and do not have much loyalty to any particular studio, as long as they get paid.\n\nThis differs from the old studio system in which studios carried large numbers of cast and crew on their payrolls under long-term contracts. To borrow a factory analogy, studios transitioned from using a single assembly line with an integrated staff to continuously churn out one film after another to building and disassembling separate assembly lines (each with its own unique staff) for every single film.\n\nThe advantage of the latter system is that film studios no longer have to bother either with paying people who are not involved in a current film production, or with green-lighting films very frequently so as to efficiently exploit sunk costs in their human resources. However, this also means that when they want a particular person for a film, that person may be unavailable because they are already committed to another film for another production company for that particular time slot. In turn, for every single film, studios (and ultimately their investors, shareholders, or backers) end up bearing massive transaction costs because they not only have to get the right person at the right price, but at the right time, and if they cannot get that person, they have to scramble to locate a satisfactory substitute. All successful directors and producers have certain favorite cast and crew members whom they prefer to work with, but that is of no help to the studio if that perfect character actor, costume designer, or music composer is already fully booked.\n\nTherefore, if a film does well at the box office and appears to have established a winning formula with a particular cast, crew and storyline, one way to minimize these transaction costs on sequels is to reassemble as much of the team as soon as possible (before anyone dies, retires, or does something else that allows them to command an even higher fee) and sign them to a single production that will be edited, released, and promoted as multiple films. This also minimizes the problem of stars visibly aging between sequels that do not have significant time gaps written in between them.\n\n\n\n"}

His father died when he was just five years old. He was raised by his maternal grandfather in Bangaon. Due to his exceptional memory and ability to recite Durgasaptshati at a very young age, he was given a scholarship by the queen of the Baniali state to pursue further studies. In 1910, he went to Benaras to study astrology under the tutelage of pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi. During his Benaras stay, he met with Acharya Narendra Deva whose intellect inspired him to study in English medium. This led him to appear in a combined Bengal-Bihar-Orissa matriculation board exam which he passed in the first division in 1916.\n\nIn 1922 he was appointed as a mathematics teacher at the Kashi Vidyapeeth. He worked at the Kashi Vidyapeeth until 1930. After that, he wrote a few books in Sanskrit for high school students on Trigonometry and Algebra. He also edited books on Ellipse and Calculus written by Sudhakar Dwivedi.\n\nIn 1933, he started to work as an editor of \"Pandit Patra\". In 1939, he started working in \"Saraswati Bhawan\" library in Benaras where he worked on listing the manuscripts of many old articles there. He worked there until 1951. He then returned to his native state of Bihar in 1952 to work as decipherment research scholar in the newly formed K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute, Patna. Here, he worked on deciphering many articles related to Pali and Prakrit languages found during the excavations in Bodh Gaya. His work is published in 27 books in Tibbati-Pali-Prakrit series published by the Bihar Research society.\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing his contributions to the Maithili literature, the Sahitya Akademi of India published a monograph on him under the Makers of Indian Literature (Maithili) series.

Chronic medical conditions include asthma, diabetes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, congestive heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension and depression. Without effective treatment chronic conditions may lead to disability.\n\nThe incidence of chronic disease has increased as mortality rates have decreased. It is estimated that by 2030 half of the population of the USA will have one or more chronic conditions.\n\nConditions, injuries and diseases which were previously fatal can now be treated with chronic care. Chronic care aims to maintain wellness by keeping symptoms in remission while balancing treatment regimes and quality of life. Many of the core functions of primary health care are central to chronic care. Chronic care is complex in nature because it may extend over a pro-longed period of time, requires input from a diverse set of health professionals, various medications and possibly monitoring equipment.\n\nAccording to 2008 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chronic medical care accounts for more than 75% of health care spending in the US. In response to the increased government expenditure in dealing with chronic care policy makers are searching for effective interventions and strategies. These strategies can broadly be described within four categories. These are disease prevention and early detection, new providers, settings and qualifications, disease management programs and integrated care models.\n\nOne of the major problems from a health care system which is poorly coordinated for sufferers of chronic conditions is the incidence of patients receiving conflicting advice from different providers. Patients will often be given prescriptions for medication that adversely interact with\none another. One recent study estimated that more than 20% of older patients in the USA took at least one medication which could negatively impact another condition. This is referred to as therapeutic competition.\n\nEffective chronic care requires an information platform to track patients' status and ensure appropriate treatments are given.\n\nThere is a recognised gap between treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care. Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because patients will place varying important on health outcomes. For example, some patients will fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes at the expense of quality of life.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders, which is called multi-morbidity. There are few incentives within current health care systems to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services. A 2001 survey by Mathematica Policy Research found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions. An increase in the number of chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations. Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.\n\nA nurse has to be qualified to handle all the needs of a chronic client and has to be an advocate to put the case of the chronically ill across to the health administration, hospital board or their families.\n\nA variety of specialists such as surgeons, dietitians, nutritionists, and occupational therapists have to be in attendance for the maximum benefit of the client. Someone suffering from chronic pain for a long time may need the help of a psychiatrist. Everyday activities that the physically fit see as normal may be a Herculean feat for the chronically ill and they need all the support that they can get. The nurse may be privy to some of these help that the chronically ill can benefit from. They need to be proactive and put these patients in contact with these help but also sensitive enough to give their client the freedom to decline any help if they think that they do not need it.\n\nChronic pain might also get the person to start questioning their faith and/or wanting to have a deeper spiritual experience because of their pain and suffering.\n\nThe patient also needs to take time to participate in some fun activities. They may need to check out of the facility/hospital or get out of the house occasionally preventing an association of hospitals with pain. This further helps the patients keep their sanity and keeps them psychologically sound.\n\nThey may need a nurse who is qualified in palliative care. Some may be dying and they need respect and dignity as they die in pain. They also need a nurse who is non-judgmental and one who is also compassionate and caring. The family has to be involved to help the client better manage the pain. One very important quality is co-ordinating the best care for the client and some amount of diplomacy and empathy.\n\nIn some cases, such as with diabetes or sleep apnea, the treatment is long term and difficult for patients to understand and comply with. In these cases chronic care management is highly recommended to help the patient learn about the consequences of refusing treatment and how to best follow treatment.\n\n"}

A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a \"course of performance.\"\n\nEven though, according to the parol evidence rule, words and terms in a writing intended to be the final expression of the agreement of the parties may not be contradicted by extrinsic evidence of a prior or contemporaneous agreement, extrinsic evidence in the form of course of dealing nonetheless may be used to explain or supplement the writing. An integration clause in a contract, stating that the parties intend the writing to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement does not suffice to negate the importance of course of dealing, \"because these are such an integral part of the contract that they are not normally disclaimed by general language in the merger clause.\"\n\nUnder the common law, extrinsic evidence such as course of dealing could be considered only the written contract was ambiguous. By contrast, \"Under the UCC, the lack of facial ambiguity in the contract language is basically irrelevant to whether extrinsic evidence ought to be considered by the court as an initial matter.\"\n\nEvidence of course of dealing will be disallowed, however, if it is \"carefully negated\" in the parties' contract by \"specific and unequivocal\" language.\n\nAlthough the term is usually used in US contract law, where the parties' course of dealing helps the court to understand the intention of the contracting parties, it is also used elsewhere in the law. In US patent law the term is used to help interpret the meaning of words used in patent claims by examining the prosecution history of a patent to determine what meaning the applicant and patent examiner understood claim words to have. It has been observed in the Federal Circuit:\n\nThe prosecution history often proves useful in determining a patent's scope, for it reveals the course of dealing with the Patent Office, which may show a particular meaning attached to the terms, or a position taken by the applicant to ensure that the patent would issue.\n"}

It is spoken by the Datooga people of the Great Rift Valley of Tanzania. The name is variously spelled \"Datog\", \"Datoga\", \"Tatoga\" or \"Tatog.\" The Sukuma name \"Taturu\" is also sometimes used in English; the Swahili name \"Mang'ati\" comes from Maasai, where it means \"enemy\". However, it is not considered offensive to the Datooga, as there is a degree of pride in being the historic enemy of the Maasai, and \"Mang'ati\" has become the standard name for the group in Swahili. In addition, numerous tribal and dialectal names may be found for the people or language as a whole. \n\nThe Datooga have been claimed to be one of the least educated peoples in Tanzania, and there is almost no literacy in the language; literacy in Swahili has been reported to be very low in some communities. However, the Barabaig and Gisamjang dialects have been written, and some work is being done on Asimjeeg.\n\nDialect diversity is great enough to make mutual intelligibility difficult, and Blench (2000) lists East Datooga and West Datooga as distinct languages. Dialects are often assumed to correspond to the seven Datooga tribes, but the speech of the Gisamjanga (Kisamajeng, Gisamjang) and the Barabaig, for example, are very close, and can be considered a single dialect. The other dialects, with alternate spellings, are: \n\n\n\"Ethnologue\" 16 mentions several other varieties of uncertain nature: \"Darorajega, Gidang'odiga, Bisiyeda, Daragwajega, Salawajega, Ghumbiega, Mangatiga,\" the last presumably just the Maasai and Swahili name. The suffixes \"-da\" and \"-ga\" on these names and many Datooga nouns are equivalent to English \"the\" .\n\nDatooga has been strongly influenced by South Cushitic languages previously spoken in the area where Datooga has taken over. In turn, Datooga has strongly influenced the Iraqw language which has occupied much former Datooga territory and has absorbed Datooga through intermarriage; for example, the Iraqw use Datooga vocabulary for poetic language. \n\nSome varieties of Datooga have a verb-initial word order, but the relative order of subject and object reflects pragmatic concerns. Grammatical case in the Gisamjanga variety is marked by tone in a marked nominative system. Numbers follow nouns, and question words come at the end of a clause. The numeral system is vigesimal, but domestic animals are counted in pairs, so that the word used for 'five' when counting other objects means 'ten' when referring to goats or cattle. \n\nFinal vowels are often devoiced in Gisamjanga and Barabaig, as may be the consonants which proceed them, which is why \"Barabayiiga\" for example is commonly transcribed as \"Barabaik.\"\n\nBajuta Datooga is typical. The consonants are as follows: \n\nPlosives are devoiced word-finally and when adjacent to another plosive or a fricative. \"Datooga\" is underlyingly (or equivalently ); the voiceless [t] is longer than a voiced [d]. There is also no distinction between [h] and a zero onset to a syllable.\n"}

{"id": "53736045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53736045", "title": "ESKAPE", "text": "ESKAPE\n\nESKAPE is an acronym encompassing the names of six bacterial pathogens commonly associated with antimicrobial resistance: They are called the ESKAPE pathogens because of their ability to “escape” the effects of commonly used antibiotics through evolutionarily developed mechanisms, and also because it is a clever acronym for their names.\n\n\nESKAPE pathogens are differentiated from other pathogens due to their increased resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, vancomycin, methicillin, carbapenems, and more. This increased resistance, combined with the clinical significance of these bacteria in the medical field, results in a necessity to understand their mechanisms of resistance and combat them with novel antibiotics. Common mechanisms for resistance include the production of enzymes that attack the structure of antibiotics (for example, β-lactamases inactivating β-lactam antibiotics), modification of the target site that the antibiotic targets so that it can no longer bind properly, efflux pumps, and biofilm production. Efflux pumps are a feature of the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that allows them to constantly pump out foreign material, including antibiotics, so that the inside of the cell never contains a high enough concentration of the drug to have an effect. Biofilms are a mixture of diverse microbial communities and polymers that protect the bacteria from antibiotic treatment by acting as a physical barrier.\n\nDue to their heightened resistance to frequently used antibiotics, these pathogens pose an additional threat to the safety of the general population, particularly those who frequently interact with hospital environments, as they most commonly contribute to hospital-acquired infections (HAI). The increased antimicrobial resistance profile of these pathogens varies, however they arise from similar causes. One common cause of antibiotic resistance due to incorrect dosing. When a sub-therapeutic dose is prescribed, or a patient chooses to use less of their prescribed antibiotic, bacteria are given the opportunity to adapt to the treatment. At lower doses, or when a course of antibiotics is not completed, certain strains of the bacteria develop drug-resistant strains through the process of natural selection. This is due to the random genetic mutations that are constantly occurring in many forms of living organisms, bacteria and humans included. Natural selection supports the persistence of strains of bacteria that have developed a certain mutation that allows them to survive. Some strains are also able to participate in inter-strain horizontal gene transfer, allowing them to pass resistance genes from one pathogen to another. This can be particularly problematic in nosocomial infections, where bacteria are constantly exposed to antibiotics and those benefiting from resistance as a result of random genetic mutations can share this resistance with bacteria in the area that have not yet developed this resistance on their own. Gram-negative bacteria seem to be particularly able to adapt to certain disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC).\n\n\"Enterococcus faecium\" is a Gram-positive rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria, most commonly involved in HAI in immunocompromised patients. It often exhibits a resistance to β-lactam antibiotics including penicillin and other last resort antibiotics. There has also been a rise in vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) strains, including an increase in \"E. faecium\" resistance to vancomycin, particularly vancomycin-A. These vancomycin-resistant strains display a profound ability to develop and share their resistance through horizontal gene transfer, as well as code for virulence factors that control phenotypes. These virulence phenotypes range from thicker biofilms to allowing them to grow in a variety of environments including medical devices such as urinary catheters and prosthetic heart valves within the body. The thicker biofilms act as a “mechanical and biochemical shield” that protects the bacteria from the antibiotics and are the most effective protective mechanism that bacteria have against treatment.\n\n\"S. aureus\" is a Gram-positive round-shaped (coccus) bacteria that is commonly found as a part of the human skin microbiota and is typically not harmful in humans with non-compromised immune systems in these environments. However, \"S. aureus\" has the ability to cause infections when it enters parts of the body that it does not typically inhabit, such as wounds. Similar to \"E. faecium\", \"S. aureus\" can also cause infections on implanted medical devices and form biofilms that make treatment with antibiotics more difficult. Additionally, approximately 25% of \"S. aureus\" strains secrete the TSST-1 exotoxin responsible for causing toxic shock syndrome. Methicillin-resistant \"S. aureus\", or MRSA, includes strains distinct from other strains of \"S. aureus\" in the fact that they have developed resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Some also express an exotoxin that has been known to cause “necrotic hemorrhagic pneumonia” in those who suffer from infection. Vancomycin and similar antibiotics are typically the first choices for treatment of MRSA infections, however from this vancomycin-resistant \"S. aureus\", or VRSA (VISA for those with intermediate resistance) strains have emerged.\n\n\"K. pneumoniae\" is a Gram-negative rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria that is particularly adept to accepting resistance genes in horizontal gene transfer. It is commonly also resistant to phagocyte treatment due to its thick biofilm with strong adhesion to neighboring cells. Certain strains have also developed β-lactamases that allow them to be resistant many of the commonly used antibiotics, including carbapenems, which has lead to the creation of carbapenem-resistant \"K. pneumoniae\" (CRKP), for which there are very few antibiotics in development that can treat infection.\n\n\"Acinetobacter baumannii\" is most common in hospitals, which has allowed for the development of resistance to all known antimicrobials. The Gram-negative short-rod-shaped (coccobacillus) \"A. baumannii\" thrives in a number of unaccommodating environments due to its tolerance to a variety of temperatures, pHs, nutrient levels, as well as dry environments. The Gram-negative aspects of the membrane surface of \"A. baumannii,\" including the efflux pump and outer membrane, affords it a wider range of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, some problematic \"A. baumannii\" strains are able to acquire families of efflux pumps from other species, and commonly first to develop new β-lactamases to improve β-lactam resistance.\n\nThe Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria \"P. aeurginosa\" is ubiquitous hydrocarbon degrader that is able to survive in extreme environments as well as in soil and many more common environments. Because of this versatility, it survives quite well in the lungs of patients suffering from late-stage cystic fibrosis (CF). It also benefits from the same previously mentioned Gram-negative resistance factors as \"A. baumannii.\" Mutants of \"P. aeurginosa\" with upregulated efflux pumps also exist that make finding an effective antibiotic or detergent incredibly difficult. There are also some multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of \"P. aeruginosa\" that express β-lactamases as well as upregulated efflux pumps which can make treatment particularly difficult.\n\n\"Enterobacter\" encompasses a family of Gram-negative, rod-shaped (bacillus) species of bacteria. Some strains cause urinary tract (UTI) and blood infections and are resistant to multiple drug therapies, which therefore puts the human population in critical need for the development of novel and effective antibiotic treatments. Colistin and tigecycline are two of the only antibiotics currently used for treatment, and there are seemingly no other viable antibiotics in development. In some \"Enterobacter\" species, a 5- 300 fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration was observed when exposed to several gradually increasing concentrations of benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Other Gram-negative bacterias (including \"Enterobacter\", but also \"Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella\" species, and more) also displayed a similar ability to adapt to the disinfectant BAC.\n"}
{"id": "3471277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3471277", "title": "Gender in Dutch grammar", "text": "Gender in Dutch grammar\n\nIn the Dutch language, the gender of a noun determines the articles, adjective forms and pronouns that are used in reference to that noun. Gender is a complicated topic in Dutch, because depending on the geographical area or each individual speaker, there are either three genders in a regular structure or a two genders in a dichotomous structure (neuter/common with vestiges of a three-gender structure). Both are identified and maintained in formal language.\n\nTraditionally, nouns in Dutch, like in German and Icelandic, have retained the three grammatical genders found in the older forms of all Germanic languages: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Almost all Dutch speakers maintain the neuter gender, which has distinct adjective inflection, definite article and some pronouns. The picture is less clear for the masculine and feminine gender, because in the standard language the adjective inflection of both is identical, and both share the same article and the same demonstrative pronouns. The standard language mostly distinguishes masculine and feminine genders by the use of the personal pronoun, which is \"hij\" for masculine nouns and \"zij\" for feminine nouns. It is also distinguished in the case forms of the definite article and some pronouns, but those have fallen out of use and are only retained in literary or archaic usage and fixed expressions.\n\nIn Belgium and southern dialects of the Netherlands, the distinction between the three genders is usually, but not always, maintained. Words that were traditionally feminine are still referred to with \"zij\", whereas traditionally masculine words retain the use of \"hij\". However, in the case of persons and animals of known sex the pronouns used are generally determined by the biological sex rather than by the grammatical gender of the word.\n\nIn most remaining parts of the Netherlands and in Suriname, the distinction between masculine and feminine nouns has disappeared, producing a common gender that uses the same inflections and pronouns as the original masculine. The pronouns \"hij\" and \"zij\" are used when the referent has a natural gender, so \"hij\" is used for a male person, \"zij\" for a female person. However, when the noun is inanimate and has no natural gender, the pronoun \"hij\" is used not only for traditionally masculine nouns, but for traditionally feminine nouns as well. Thus, the situation in these areas resembles that of English, although there is still a distinction among inanimate nouns between common \"hij\" and neuter \"het\" (English uses \"it\" for both, having lost all gender distinctions in inanimate nouns).\n\nIn the written tradition, which forms the base for the (prescribed) standard language, there are some remains of the traditional three genders. The following table shows the use of various articles and pronouns in the standard form of Dutch, as well as how the use of gender in the two language areas aligns with this. In areas maintaining the three genders, there is no common gender. In areas with only two genders, only nouns referring to people have a distinction between masculine and feminine, all other nouns that are not neuter are common.\n\nThe standard as prescribed by the Dutch Language Union categorises most nouns into one of four categories:\n\n\nThus, the standard only mandates the feminine gender for a subset of all historically feminine nouns. These are nouns with an overtly recognizable feminine suffix. However, this distinction is maintained only in formal or written standard Dutch, whereas many speakers do not make such a distinction in informal speech; they use only the common gender. Such speakers must therefore remember which endings are feminine, because they cannot rely on their own language intuition. Although some speakers do follow the standard in this respect, others do not and simply use the genders the way they are accustomed to them in their own everyday speech (either masculine/feminine/neuter or common/neuter).\n\nIn more formal, poetic or archaic language, a stronger distinction exists between the masculine and feminine genders, especially in the genitive forms as shown in the table below (although the distinctions in the bottom row are still commonly applied in informal speech):\n\nThe trend so far is towards the increasing use of the common gender, at the expense of the masculine/feminine distinction. Although this process has long been completed in the spoken language of the north, the three gender structure is still widespread in the south, though some suggest it is slowly losing ground due to the increase of language contact through mass media like television and the Internet. Some dictionaries have dropped the distinction between the two genders entirely, preferring to mark words with their definite article \"de\" (common) or \"het\" (neuter), whereas others like the Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal—the largest Dutch dictionary—retain it. Because the feminine gender of nouns tends to be respected in formal or written language, which tends to follow the standard more strictly, this sometimes also results in hypercorrection, caused by the perceived formality of the feminine gender, with feminine pronouns occasionally used for nouns that are historically masculine, and even for nouns that are neuter.\n\nThe following list reflects the use of gender that is prescribed for standard Dutch and used by the Language Union and educational material for teaching gender. It is not exhaustive, and covers only cases that follow some recognizable pattern. Many words have unpredictable gender and simply have to be memorized (and will be \"f/m\" in the standard, if not neuter).\n\nWords referring to animate entities whose natural gender is masculine:\n\nHowever, diminutives such as \"jongetje\" \"little boy\" are neuter nouns. Nouns for professions (which are often historically masculine) may also be treated as gender-neutral, and are then either masculine or feminine depending on the referent.\n\nWords ending in the following suffixes, which mostly form agent nouns, are masculine:\n\nThere are a few exceptions, such as:\n\nAbstract deverbal nouns are normally masculine:\n\nNew abstract nouns formed in this way are always masculine. However, some may be feminine, particularly if they are older words.\n\nWords referring to animate objects whose natural gender is feminine:\n\nThis includes words ending in a suffix that derives a noun for a female person from either a masculine noun or from another word:\n\nThe Dutch language leaves in many cases some liberty to individual users on how to derive the female form of a noun; for example \"apothekeres, \"apothekerin and \"apotheekster\" would all be considered correct forms for \"female apothecarian\".\n\nHowever, diminutives such as \"meisje\" \"girl\" are neuter (but see below).\n\nWords for abstract concepts ending with the following suffixes are feminine:\n\nThere are a few exceptions, e.g. \"dienst \"service\", which is masculine, or \"vonnis \"verdict\", which is neuter. There are also many nouns ending in \"-schap\" that are neuter, such as \"gereedschap\" \"tool\", \"landschap\" \"landscape\". These usually refer to concrete objects rather than abstract concepts, but the distinction is not always clear. For example, \"ouderschap\" \"parenthood\" is neuter but abstract, whereas \"gemeenschap\" \"community\" is feminine but concrete.\n\nSuffixes that are borrowed from Latin or Greek often retain their feminine gender from those languages. This includes:\n\nThere are, as always, a few exceptions. For example, \"kanarie \"canary\" is masculine and \"ministerie \"ministry\" is neuter.\n\nDiminutives are always neuter. They end in \"-je\" in the standard language, but the suffix \"-ke\" is also used in many dialects.\n\nWhen a diminutive refers to a person, masculine or feminine pronouns may be used to refer to the person instead of the neuter \"het\". However, the definite article, demonstrative pronouns, and adjective inflection remain neuter. The exception is \"meisje\", of whose gender (neuter) hardly anyone is aware of this even in formal speech, using feminine pronouns to refer to the word. Whilst this is officially incorrect, the proper usage, e.g. \"kijk dat meisje, het kamt zijn haar\" (look at that girl, \"it\" is combing \"its\" hair), is often perceived as queer especially in speech. Almost everyone treats \"meisje\" as a feminine word, with the exception of its article. The same applies to \"jongetje\", \"mannetje\" (\"little man\"), \"vrouwtje\" (\"little woman\"), etc.\n\nNouns prefixed with \"ge-\" with no suffix are neuter, especially if they are collectives derived from a verb stem:\n\nCollective nouns prefixed with \"ge-\" and suffixed with \"-te\" are neuter:\n\nNouns prefixed with \"ge-\" and suffixed with \"-te\" are feminine if they are abstract concepts, such as \"gedachte\" \"thought\".\n\nNames of towns, countries and languages are always neuter, even if they are clearly derived from a masculine, feminine or even plural noun:\nThe exceptions are formed by countries or regions that contain a masculine or feminine article as part of their name: \"de Randstad\" (\"stad\" is feminine), \"de Soedan\", \"de Congo\", etc.\n\nThe following suffixes that are borrowed from Latin or Greek are neuter:\n\nThere is one notable exception, \"datum\" (date), which is masculine, and has both a \"regular\" plural in \"datums\" (perceived as wrong by most speakers) and the original Latin neuter plural in \"data\".\n\nSouthern Dutch consists roughly of all dialects south of the river Meuse. In these dialects, there was a tendency towards \"accusativism\" in early modern Dutch (16th and 17th centuries). This was the tendency to use the accusative case in the role of the nominative. When cases fell out of use later, the nominative was the one that survived, but in areas with accusativism these forms historically belonged to the accusative case. Unlike the old nominative, the accusative had a clear distinction between masculine and feminine forms. As it was these forms that survived in southern Dutch, the genders remained naturally distinct, and remain so up to the present day.\n\nIn addition, Southern Dutch developed a separate indefinite article for neuter words—\"e\" or \"ee(n)\"—which is pronounced as a schwa (IPA: ə). Similar to English \"an\" versus \"a\", this article is not used when the following word starts with a vowel or a h-; rather \"een\" ('n) is used in those cases.\n\nThe following table shows the points where the southern dialects differ from the standard language. As the dialects themselves are not standardised, different forms may be found in different areas, although differences have lessened in the Tussentaal, the Dutch regiolect in the Region of Flanders.\n\nExample 1: (\"vrouw\" is feminine)\n\nExample 2: (\"auto\" and \"boom\" are masculine)\n\nExample 3: (\"appartement\" and \"dorp\" are neuter)\n\nUnlike English (with the use of \"they\" as the singular gender-neutral pronoun) or Swedish (which developed the new gender-neutral pronoun \"hen\"), Dutch did not develop a gender-neutral pronoun. As a consequence, Dutch employs a variety of means to accommodate cases where the gender of a person is not known. Standard solutions include the use of \"degene\" (\"the one\"; unstressed) and \"diegene\" (\"that one\"; stressed). More formally, the word \"alwie\" (\"any(one) who\") may be employed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58130360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58130360", "title": "Glyphosate-based herbicides", "text": "Glyphosate-based herbicides\n\nGlyphosate-based herbicides are usually made of a glyphosate salt that is combined with other ingredients that are needed to stabilize the herbicide formula and allow penetration into plants. The glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup was first developed by Monsanto in the 1970s. It is used most heavily on corn, soy, and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to be resistant to the herbicide. Some products include two active ingredients, such as Enlist Duo which includes 2,4-D as well as glyphosate. As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market. The names of inert ingredients used in glyphosate formulations are usually not listed on the product labels.\n\nGlyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides have low acute toxicity in mammals. They likewise have not been shown to pose a significant risk to human health during normal use, although human deaths have been reported from deliberate ingestion of concentrated RoundUp. It is difficult to determine how much surfactants contribute to the overall toxicity of each formulation. Glyphosate formulations containing the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) are sometimes used terrestrially, but are not approved for aquatic use in the US due to their toxicity to aquatic organisms.\n\nThe consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that there is no evidence that the active ingredient glyphosate is carcinogenic for humans. The EPA has classified glyphosate as a Group E chemical, meaning the agency has determined there is \"evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans\". The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is the only agency that has classified glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic\".\n\nThere have been multiple lawsuits against Monsanto asserting that exposure to glyphosate herbicides is carcinogenic and that the company did not adequately disclose the risk to consumers. In 2018 a California jury awarded $289 million in damages to a groundskeeper who argued that Monsanto failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicides.\n\nThe glyphosate-based herbicide RoundUp (styled: Round\"up\") was first developed in the 1970s by Monsanto. Glyphosate-based herbicides were initially used in a similar way to paraquat and diquat, as non-selective herbicides. Attempts were made to apply them to row crops, but problems with crop damage kept glyphosate-based herbicides from being widely used for this purpose. In the USA, use of glyphosate experienced rapid growth following the commercial introduction of a glyphosate-resistant soybean in 1996. Between 1990 and 1996 sales of RoundUp increased around 20% per year. it is used in over 160 countries. RoundUp is used most heavily on corn, soy, and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to withstand the chemical, but since 2012 glyphosate was used in California to treat other crops like almond, peach, cantaloupe, onion, cherry, sweet corn, and citrus.\n\nBayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, is the largest producer of glyphosate-based herbicides, but formulations from other manufacturers are available that use different inert ingredients. Other glyphosate-based formulations include Bronco, Glifonox, KleenUp, Ranger Pro (styled: Ranger PRO), Rodeo, and Weedoff. Other manufacturers include Anhui Huaxing Chemical Industry Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Jiangsu Good Harvest-Weien Agrochemical Company, Nantong Jiangshan Agrochemical & Chemicals Co., Nufarm Limited, SinoHarvest, Syngenta, and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Company. As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market.\n\nSurfactants, solvents, and preservatives are inert ingredients, or adjuvants, that are commonly added to glyphosate-based herbicide formulations. Some products contain all the necessary adjuvants, including surfactant; some contain no adjuvant system, while other products contain only a limited amount of adjuvant. Some formulations require the addition of surfactants to the spray tank before application. The names of inert ingredients used in glyphosate formulations are usually not listed on the product labels.\n\nPolyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) is a surfactant added to Roundup and other herbicides as a wetting agent. POEA is not a single surfactant, but a complex mixture. The composition of each POEA surfactant is a proprietary trade secret. Monsanto's RoundUp, for example, contains a proprietary POEA surfactant called MON 0818 at a 15% concentration.\n\nAs part of the process to renew glyphosate's license under EU regulations, a 2013 systematic review by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (Bfr) of epidemiological studies of workers exposed to glyphosate formulations found no significant risk, stating that \"the available data are contradictory and far from being convincing\". In 2015, as part of the ongoing renewal process, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a final risk assessment on 12 November 2015 stating that glyphosate met EU-level regulatory standards. Despite classifying glyphosate as non-carcinogenic, this report also acknowledged that some of the co-formulants added to glyphosate based pesticides \"appeared to have toxic effects higher than the glyphosate itself\", noting POEA in particular. The conclusion of the final EFSA assessment was that the active ingredient glyphosate met EU-level regulatory standards, but individual formulations would have to be evaluated by member states.\n\nThere was insufficient support among the Member States for a 2016 European Commission proposal to renew the approval of glyphosate. Because the 2015 EFSA and IARC assessments had reached contradictory conclusions regarding the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) was asked to assess the hazard properties of the substance. Though no majority of Member States voted either for or against the renewal proposal, in July 2016 they voted to amend the conditions of glyphosate's existing approval. The new conditions require Member States to minimize the pre-harvest use of glyphosate products, as well as use in certain public places. Formulations that include the surfactant POEA were banned. These conditions were later included in the implementing act for the 5-year renewal that was approved on 12 December 2017.\n\nIn 2014 the EPA approved Enlist Duo, which was developed by Dow AgroSciences. This herbicide combined two active ingredients: 2,4-D and glyphosate. Enlist Duo is intended for use with genetically modified crops that have also been developed by the Dow Chemical subsidiary. The initial approval was limited to the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. During the course of litigation in 2015, the EPA found out that Dow had told the United States Patent and Trademark Office that Enlist Duo offers \"synergistic herbicidal weed control\", and requested additional clarification about the \"synergistic effects\" and sought to reverse its approval pending a full review of the new information provided by Dow. In 2016, the 9th Circuit rejected the EPA's petition to vacate its approval of the herbicide.\n\nSince some glyphosate herbicide formulations contain an inert ingredient that may be toxic to fish and amphibians, only formulation's labeled for aquatic use are recommended when water contamination is possible. Aquatic formulations using the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate include Glypro (also called Rodeo, Aquapro, and Accord Concentrate) and Shore-Klear. Refuge is also approved for aquatic applications; the active ingredient in this formulation is the potassium salt of glyphosate. There are a few aquatic formulations that already include a surfactant that are registered for aquatic applications including GlyphoMate41 and Shore-Klear Plus, but most aquatic formulations do not include surfactant. The composition of surfactants is proprietary and non-disclosed, but low-toxicity surfactants that are labeled for aquatic use are available.\n\nOn 10 August 2018, Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was awarded $289 million in damages after a jury in San Francisco found that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide, a decision the company plans on appealing. Johnson had routinely used two different glyphosate formulations in his work as a groundskeeper, RoundUp and another Monsanto product called Ranger Pro. The jury's verdict addressed the question of whether Monsanto knowingly failed to warn consumers that RoundUp could be harmful, but not whether RoundUp causes cancer. After the IARC classified glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic\" in 2015, over 300 federal lawsuits have been filed that were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation called \"In re: RoundUp Products Liability\".\n\nThe lethal dose of different glyphosate-based formulations varies, especially with respect to the surfactants used. Formulations intended for terrestrial use that include the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) can be more toxic than other formulations for aquatic species. Due to the variety in available formulations, including five different glyphosate salts and different combinations of inert ingredients, it is difficult to determine how much surfactants contribute to the overall toxicity of each formulation. Independent scientific reviews and regulatory agencies have regularly concluded that glyphosate-based herbicides do not lead to a significant risk for human or environmental health when the product label is properly followed. \n\nThe acute oral toxicity for mammals is low, but death has been reported after deliberate overdose of concentrated formulations. The surfactants in glyphosate formulations can increase the relative acute toxicity of the formulation. Surfactants generally do not, however, cause synergistic effects (as opposed to additive effects) that increase the acute toxicity of glyphosate within a formulation. The surfactant POEA is not considered an acute toxicity hazard, and has an oral toxicity similar to vitamin A and less toxic than asprin. Deliberate ingestion of Roundup ranging from 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has resulted in death within hours of ingestion, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. Consumption of over 85 ml of concentrated product is likely to cause serious symptoms in adults, including burns due to corrosive effects as well as kidney and liver damage. More severe cases lead to \"respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia\" and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nSkin exposure to ready-to-use concentrated glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are probably due to the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: \"There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to glyphosate or co-formulants in glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations.\" The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritation.\n\nInhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate.\n\nGlyphosate products for aquatic use generally do not use surfactants, and formulations with POEA are not approved for aquatic use due to aquatic organism toxicity. Due to the presence of POEA, glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone. Terrestrial glyphosate formulations that include the surfactants POEA and MON 0818 (75% POEA) may have negative impacts on various aquatic organisms like protozoa, mussels, crustaceans, frogs and fish. Aquatic organism exposure risk to terrestrial formulations with POEA is limited to drift or temporary water pockets. While laboratory studies can show effects of glyphosate formulations on aquatic organisms, similar observations rarely occur in the field when instructions on the herbicide label are followed.\n\nStudies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of GBFs containing POEA to amphibian larvae. These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations has been associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at metamorphosis, developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stress. Glyphosate-based formulations can cause oxidative stress in bullfrog tadpoles. The use of glyphosate-based pesticides are not considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure.\n\nThere is limited evidence human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization, European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. The final assessment of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority in 2017 was that \"glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans\". The EPA has classified glyphosate as Group E, meaning \"evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans\". Only one international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews. The IARC has been criticized for its assessment methodology by failing to consider the broad literature and only assessing hazard rather than risk.\n"}

The glyphs to present the characters are stored in the alphanumeric character generator's resident read-only memory (like ROM or flash) and are thus not user-changeable. They are available for use by the system without having to load any font definitions into the device first. Startup messages issued by a PC's System BIOS or displayed by an operating system before initializing its own code page switching logic and font management and before switching to graphics mode are displayed in a computer's default hardware code page.\n\nIn North American IBM-compatible PCs, the hardware code page of the display adapter is typically code page 437. However, various portable machines as well as (Eastern) European, Arabic, Middle Eastern and Asian PCs used a number of other code pages as their hardware code page, including code page 100 (\"Hebrew\"), 151 (\"Nafitha Arabic\"), 667 (\"Mazovia\"), 737 (\"Greek\"), 850 (\"Multilingual\"), encodings like \"Roman-8\", \"Kamenický\", \"KOI-8\", \"MIK\", and others. Most display adapters support a single 8-bit hardware code page only. The bitmaps were often stored in an EPROM in a DIP socket. At most, the hardware code page to be activated was user-selectable via jumpers, configuration EEPROMs or CMOS setup. However, some of the display adapters designed for Eastern European, Arabic and Hebrew PCs supported multiple software-\"switchable\" hardware code pages, also named font pages, selectable via I/O ports or additional BIOS functions.\n\nIn contrast to this, printers frequently support several user-switchable character sets, often including various variants of the 7-bit ISO/IEC 646 character sets such as code page 367 (\"ISO/IEC 646-US / ASCII\"), sometimes also a couple of 8-bit code pages like code page 437, 850, 851, 852, 853, 855, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, and 866. Printers for the Eastern European or Middle Eastern markets sometimes support other locale-specific hardware code pages to choose from. They can be selected via DIP switches or configuration menus on the printer, or via specific escape sequences.\n\nWhen operating systems initialize their code page switching logic, they need to know but have no means to determine the previously active hardware code page by themselves. Therefore, for code page switching to work correctly, the hardware code page needs to be specified.\n\nUnder DOS and Windows 9x this is accomplished by specifying the hardware code page as a parameter (hwcp) to the device drivers DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS:\n\nIf multiple hardware code pages are supported in OEM issues, the first hardware code page (hwcp1) in the list specifies the default hardware code page:\n\nIf no hardware code page(s) are specified, these drivers default either to a dummy code page number 999 or assume the hardware code page to be equal to the primary code page (the first code page listed in COUNTRY.SYS files for a particular country with the country code either specified in the CONFIG.SYS COUNTRY directive or assumed to be the operating system's internal default, usually 1 (US) in Western issues of DOS).\nIn many English-speaking countries, the primary code page is either 437 (f.e. in the US) or 850 (f.e. in the UK, Ireland and Canada), so that, without specifying a different code page, the system would often assume one of these to be the corresponding device's default hardware code page as well.\n\nIf a hardware code page does not match one of those with official code page assignments, an arbitrary number from the range 57344–61439 (E000h–EFFFh) for user-definable code pages or 65280–65533 (FF00h–FFFDh) for private use code pages could be specified per IBM CDRA to give the operating system a non-conflictive \"handle\" to select that code page.\n\nArabic and Hebrew MS-DOS do not use DISPLAY.SYS and PRINTER.SYS, but provide similar facilities using ARABIC.COM, HEBREW.COM, and .\n\nHardware code pages are also OEM code pages. The designation \"OEM\", for \"original equipment manufacturer\", indicates that the character set could be changed by the manufacturer to meet different markets.\n\nHowever, OEM code pages do not necessarily reside in ROM, but include so called prepared code pages, (aka downloadable character sets or downloadable fonts), character sets loaded as raster fonts into the font RAM of suitable display adapters (like Sirius 1/Victor 9000, NEC APC, HP 100LX/200LX/700LX, Persyst's BoB Color Adapter, Hercules' HGC+, InColor and Network Plus with RAMFONT, and IBM's MCGA, EGA, VGA, etc.) and printers as well. Hence, the group of OEM code pages is a superset of hardware code pages.\n\n"}

Insufflation has many medical uses, most notably as a route of administration for various drugs.\n\nNasal inhalation of recreational drugs (\"snorting\") is often considered an example of insufflation, though the etymology and scientific understanding of the term does not include inhalation of any kind, as blowing requires the application of positive pressure to push the substance into the nose, whereas inhaling refers to drawing or sucking in, which requires the generation of negative pressure in the thorax.\n\nGases are often insufflated into a body cavity to inflate the cavity for more workroom, e.g. during laparoscopic surgery. The most common gas used in this manner is carbon dioxide, because it is non-flammable, colorless and dissolves readily in blood. It is, however, not an inert gas.\n\nGases can be insufflated into parts of the body to enhance radiological imaging or to gain access to areas for visual inspection (e.g. during colonoscopy).\n\nOxygen can be insufflated into the nose by nasal cannulae to assist in respiration.\n\nPump inhalers for asthmatics deliver aerosolized drugs into the lungs via the mouth. However, the insufflation by the pump is not adequate for delivery to the lungs, necessitating an active inhalation by the patient.\n\nInsufflated gases and vapors are used to ventilate and oxygenate patients (oxygen, air, helium), and to induce, assist in or maintain general anaesthesia (nitrous oxide, xenon, volatile anesthetic agents).\n\nNasal insufflation is the most common method of nasal administration. Other methods are nasal inhalation (common in recreational use) and nasal instillation. Drugs administered in this way can have a local effect or a systemic effect. The time of onset for systemic drugs delivered via nasal administration is generally only marginally slower than if given intravenously. The bioavailability of drugs administered nasally is generally significantly higher than drugs taken orally.\n\nNasal administration can also be used for treatment of children or patients who are otherwise alarmed or frightened by needles, or where intravenous (IV) access is unavailable.\n\nAs an alternative medicine treatment, ozone therapy is claimed to increase the amount of oxygen in the body through rectal and vaginal insufflation.\n\nIn the 18th century, the tobacco smoke enema, an insufflation of tobacco smoke into the rectum, was a common method of reviving drowning victims.\n"}

He relocated to London around 1565, in the reign of Elizabeth I. In 1570 he co-authored \"A Booke containing divers sortes of hands\", the first writing manual published in English. He travelled to Italy and France, where he published additional writing manuals, returning to England by 1583. In his later years he was appointed writing master to two of the children of James I, Elizabeth and Charles (later King Charles I). Beauchesne died in London in May 1620.\n\nJohn de Beauchense was born in Paris around 1538, and was probably raised a Huguenot. He is likely related to a group of printers and booksellers active in Paris in the 16th century named Beauchesne: Abraham Beauchesne (active around 1532), Julien Beauchesne (1545) and Jeanne Beauchesne, wife of the Parisian printer Jean Plumyon, killed In 1572 during the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.\n\nHe emigrated to London around 1565 (perhaps to find a more favourable environment for Protestant opinions); in 1567 he had been living in the ward of Farringdon Without, home to Chancery Lane and St Bartholomew's Hospital, for two years. That year he was working as a scribe for William Bowyer, Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London. Berthold Wolpe identified Beauchesne as the creator of the calligraphic pages in Bowyer's \"Heroica Eulogia\", a manuscript dedicated (but perhaps never presented) to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester combining \"paintings, coats of arms, Latin poems, 14 distinctive styles of handwriting, and historical documents\". \n\nIn 1570, the French Huguenot printer Thomas Vautrollier published Beauchesne's \"A Booke containing divers sortes of hands\", the first book of \"copies\" or sample alphabets for students to be printed in English. Its full title was As Vautrollier had registered two books of \"copies\" of hands with the Stationers' Company in 1569, it is possible that this volume combined originally separate works by Beauchesne and by Master John Baildon, a curate of St Mildred in the Poultry. The book contains 42 woodblocks of sample alphabets and texts, covering the range of styles common in the day. \"A Book containing divers sortes of handes\" must have been a success – it was reissued by Vautrollier and his successor, Richard Field, in 1571, 1590, 1591, 1602, and 1615 (all within Beauchesne's lifetime).\n\nShortly after the appearance of his \"Booke\", Beauchesne travelled to Italy, studying under several masters. By 1579 he was resident in Lyon, where he published a second treatise in 1580, \"Le Tresor d' Escriture, au que I est contenu tout ce qui est requis et necessaire a taus amateurs dudict art. Par jehan de Beauchesne Parisien, Avec privilege du Roi\", which displays a sensitive Italian influence.\n\nHe returned to England by 1583 and about 1595 published a third treatise on handwriting, \"La Clef de l'Escriture\", dedicated to the three daughters of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. Taxpayer records of 1599 place him in the parish of St Ann Blackfriars. He was appointed writing master to the new King James I's daughter Elizabeth (to whom he dedicated a collection of manuscript examples around 1610), and her brother Charles, later King Charles I. Beauchesne was buried at Blackfriars 20 May 1620.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17254", "title": "Kashubian language", "text": "Kashubian language\n\nKashubian or Cassubian (Kashubian: ', ', '; , ', \"\") is a West Slavic language belonging to the Lechitic subgroup along with Polish and Silesian. Although commonly classified as a language in its own right, it is sometimes viewed as a dialect of Pomeranian or Polish.\n\nIn Poland, it has been an officially recognized ethnic-minority language since 2005. Approximately 108,000 people use mainly Kashubian at home. It is the only remnant of the Pomeranian language. It is close to standard Polish with influence from Low German and the extinct Polabian and Old Prussian.\n\nKashubian is assumed to have evolved from the language spoken by some tribes of Pomeranians called Kashubians, in the region of Pomerania, on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea between the Vistula and Oder rivers. The Pomeranians were said to have arrived before the Poles, and certain tribes managed to maintain their language and traditions despite German and Polish settlements. It first began to evolve separately in the period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century as the Polish-Pomeranian linguistic area began to divide based around important linguistic developments centred in the western (Kashubian) part of the area.\n\nIn the 19th century, Florian Ceynowa became Kashubian's first known activist. He undertook tremendous efforts to awaken Kashubian self-identity through the establishment of Kashubian language, customs, and traditions. He felt strongly that Poles were born brothers and that Kashubia was a separate nation.\n\nThe Young Kashubian movement followed in 1912, led by author and doctor Aleksander Majkowski, who wrote for the paper \"Zrzësz Kaszëbskô\" as part of the \"Zrzëszincë\" group. The group contributed significantly to the development of the Kashubian literary language.\n\nThe earliest printed documents in Kashubian date from the end of the 16th century. The modern orthography was first proposed in 1879.\n\nMany scholars and linguists debate whether Kashubian should be recognized as a Polish dialect or separate language. From the diachronic view it is a Lechitic West Slavic language but from the synchronic point of view it is a Polish dialect. Kashubian is closely related to Slovincian, while both of them are dialects of Pomeranian. Many linguists, in Poland and elsewhere, consider it a divergent dialect of Polish. Dialectal diversity is so great within Kashubian that a speaker of southern dialects has considerable difficulty in understanding a speaker of northern dialects. The spelling and the grammar of Polish words written in Kashubian, which is most of its vocabulary, is highly unusual, making it difficult to comprehend also written text by native Polish speakers.\n\nLike Polish, Kashubian includes about 5% loanwords from German (such as \"\" \"art\"). Unlike Polish, these are mostly from Low German and only occasionally from High German. Other sources of loanwords include the Baltic languages.\n\nThe number of speakers of Kashubian varies widely from source to source, ranging from as low as 4,500 to the upper 366,000. In the 2011 census, over 108,000 people in Poland declared that they mainly use Kashubian at home, of these only 10 percent consider Kashubian to be their mother tongue, with the rest considering themselves to be native speakers of both Kashubian and Polish. The number of people who can speak at least some Kashubian is higher, around 366,000. All Kashubian speakers are also fluent in Polish. A number of schools in Poland use Kashubian as a teaching language. It is an official alternative language for local administration purposes in Gmina Sierakowice, Gmina Linia, Gmina Parchowo, Gmina Luzino and Gmina Żukowo in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Most respondents say that Kashubian is used in informal speech among family members and friends. This is most likely because Polish is the official language and spoken in formal settings.\n\nDuring the Kashubian diaspora of 1855-1900, 115,700 Kashubians emigrated to North America, with around 15,000 emigrating to Brazil. Among the \"Polish\" community of Renfrew County, Ontario, Kashubian is widely spoken to this day, despite generations of Polonization at the hands of Polish parish priests. In Winona, Minnesota, which Ramułt termed the \"Kashubian Capital of America\", Kashubian was regarded as \"poor Polish,\" as opposed to the \"good Polish\" of the parish priests and teaching sisters. Consequently, Kashubian failed to survive Polonization and died out shortly after the mid-20th century.\n\nImportant for Kashubian literature was \"Xążeczka dlo Kaszebov\" by Doctor Florian Ceynowa (1817–1881). Hieronim Derdowski (1852–1902 in Winona, Minnesota) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Dr. Aleksander Majkowski (1876–1938) from Kościerzyna, who wrote the Kashubian national epic The Life and Adventures of Remus. Jan Trepczyk was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was Stanisław Pestka. Kashubian literature has been translated into Czech, Polish, English, German, Belarusian, Slovene and Finnish. Aleksander Majkowski and Alojzy Nagel belong to the most commonly translated Kashubian authors of the 20th century. A considerable body of Christian literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the New Testament, much of it by Fr. Adam Ryszard Sikora (OFM). Rev. Franciszek Grucza graduated from a Catholic seminary in Pelplin. He was the first priest to introduce Catholic liturgy in Kashubian.\n\nThe earliest recorded artifacts of Kashubian date back to the 15th century and include a book of spiritual psalms that were used to introduce Kashubian to the Lutheran church: \nThe next few texts are also religious catechisms but this time from the Catholic Church, because the majority of Kashubians were Roman Catholic and these texts helped them become more unified in faith:\n\nThroughout the communist regime in Poland, Kashubian and Polish greatly suffered in its spread and education. Kashubian was represented as folklore and prevented from being taught in schools. Following the collapse of communism, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It has been included in the program of school education in Kashubia although not as a language of teaching or as a required subject for every child, but as a foreign language taught 3 hours per week at parents' explicit request. Since 1991, it is estimated that there have been around 17,000 students in over 400 schools who have learned Kashubian. Kashubian has some limited usage on public radio and had on public television. Since 2005, Kashubian has enjoyed legal protection in Poland as an official regional language. It is the only language in Poland with that status, which was granted by the \"Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Language\" of the Polish Parliament. The act provides for its use in official contexts in ten communes in which speakers are at least 20% of the population. The recognition means that heavily- populated Kashubian localities have been able to have road signs and other amenities with Polish and Kashubian translations on them.\n\nFriedrich Lorentz wrote in the early 20th century that there were three Kashubian dialects. These include the\n\nOther researches would argue that each tiny region of the Kaszuby has its own dialect, as in \"Dialects and Slang of Poland\": \n\nA \"standard\" Kashubian language does not exist despite several attempts to create one; rather a diverse range of dialects takes its place. The vocabulary is heavily influenced by German and Polish and uses the Latin alphabet.\n\nThere are several similarities between Kashubian and Polish. For some linguists they consider this a sign that Kashubian is a dialect of Polish but others believe that this is just a sign that the two originate from the same location. They are nevertheless related to a certain degree and their proximity has made Kashubian influenced by Polish and its various dialects, specifically its northern ones.\n\nSome examples of similarities between languages:\n\nKashubian makes use of simplex and complex phonemes with secondary place articulation , , , and . They follow the Clements and Hume (1995) constriction model, where sounds are represented in terms of constriction. They are then organized according to particular features like anterior, implying the activation of features dominating it. Due to this model, the phonemes above are treated differently from the phonemes , , , and . The vocalic place node would be placed under the C-place node and V-place nodes interpolated to preserve well-forwardness.\n\n\nKashubian has simple consonants with a secondary articulation along with complex ones with secondary articulation.\n\n\nThe following digraphs and trigraphs are used:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The postal service would deliver to his store letters addressed simply to \"Mr. Typewriter, New York\". His customers included many notable authors and reporters, many of whom had clung to their manual typewriters long after personal computers became standard.\n\nTytell was born on December 20, 1913 to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, and grew up in Manhattan's Lower East Side. He worked in a hardware store in his youth and first learned about typewriters at age 15 after disassembling an Underwood 5 typewriter on his gym teacher's desk at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn and watching it being repaired. He had obtained a contract to maintain typewriters for Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital before graduating from high school. He received his bachelor's from St. John's University in Queens and earned an MBA from New York University, attending college primarily at night.\n\nTytell met his wife, Pearl, in 1938 after he sold her a typewriter at an office she managed. He died in the Bronx of cancer on September 11, 2008 while also suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe Tytell Typewriter Company opened in 1938 at 123 Fulton Street.\nIn 1941, Tytell created a patented process that allowed him to sell Remington and Underwood Noiseless typewriters that listed for as much as $135 and offer them for sale for $24.95 with a one-year guarantee, and aimed to sell 500 of these typewriters each week. That same year, Tytell developed a coin-operated typewriter that would be available for use in hotel lobbies and train stations for 10 cents per half-hour, modeled on a similar device used in Sweden.\n\nTytell enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, but was kept out of action due to his flat feet and knowledge of typewriters. In the military he created foreign language typewriters, including French language typewriters for paratroopers who were air-dropped as part of the Invasion of Normandy.\n\nHe was in the typewriter repair business for some 70 years, most of which was spent in his Tytell Typewriter Company, located on the second-floor store at 116 Fulton Street since 1963, which advertised itself as offering \"Psychoanalysis for Your Typewriter.\" He worked in a white lab coat and handled typewriters that could produce 145 different languages and dialects and claimed that he had 2 million typefaces in stock. He created typewriters that could print hieroglyphics or musical notes and invented models with carriages that operated in reverse for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew that are written right-to-left. An erroneously inverted character he placed on a Burmese language typewriter became the standard in Burma. Customers included David Brinkley, Dorothy Parker and Andy Rooney, as well as both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai E. Stevenson. In 1980, when David Brinkley needed a Great Primer discontinued by Royal a decade earlier, he was able to find two at Tytell. \"How many do you want?\" was Tytell's response after Brinkley called. Brinkley bought two, what he described as a lifetime supply.\n\nAlger Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 based on evidence that extensively relied on claims that documents passed to Soviet agent Whittaker Chambers had been created on a typewriter Hiss and his wife had owned, after the prosecution showed that the typewriter's unique combination of printing pattern and flaws matched those on the documents in question. Hiss's lawyers then hired Tytell to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hiss's owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter, which was used as one of the primary justifications for an unsuccessful appeal of the verdict in the case.\n\nThe senior Tytell retired from the typewriter business in 2000, and his son closed the repair shop in 2001, converting the Fulton Street space for use by the forensic document research business that the family operated.\n\nTytell's son Peter is a forensic document examiner, a practice that father and son developed to trace anonymous letters and documents such as wills to their source, using the unique \"fingerprint\" of each particular typewriter. Peter testified for the prosecution to help gain a conviction in a case that involved documents that were said to connect President John F. Kennedy to Marilyn Monroe and mobster Sam Giancana, and made use of typewriters owned by the Tytell's repair store. His son's expertise was utilized in the investigation of the Killian documents controversy, which involved six documents critical of President George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard and the use of four of these documents which were presented as authentic in a \"60 Minutes Wednesday\" broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004.\n\nMartin Tytell's daughter, Pamela, earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University in New York City. She lives in Paris, France where she publishes and teaches. Author of numerous articles on psychoanalysis which have appeared in \"Encyclopaedia Universalis\", \"Magazine Littéraire\", etc., her book \"La Plume sur le Divan: psychanalyse et littérature en France\" [Paris: Aubier-Montaigne, 1982] was translated into Japanese and Italian.

{"id": "447699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447699", "title": "Nigga", "text": "Nigga\n\nNigga () is a colloquial term used in African-American Vernacular English that began as an eye dialect form of the word \"nigger\", an ethnic slur against black people. In some dialects of English, the word is pronounced the same as \"nigger\" in non-rhotic speech.\n\nIn practice, its use and meaning are heavily dependent on context. Presently, the word \"nigga\" is used more liberally among younger members of all races and ethnicities in the United States. In addition to African America, other ethnic groups have adopted the term as part of their vernacular.\n\nThere is conflicting popular opinion on whether there is any meaningful difference between \"nigga\" and \"nigger\" as a spoken term. Many people consider the terms to be equally pejorative, and the use of \"nigga\" both in and outside black communities remains controversial. H. Lewis Smith, author of \"Bury that Sucka: A Scandalous Affair with the N-word\", believes that \"replacing the 'er' with an 'a' changes nothing other than the pronunciation\" and the \"African American Registry\" notes, \"Brother (Brotha) and Sister (Sistah or Sista) are terms of endearment. Nigger was and still is a word of disrespect.\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a civil rights group, condemns use of both \"nigga\" and \"nigger\".\n\nSome African-Americans only consider \"nigga\" offensive when used by people of other races, seeing its use outside a defined social group as an unwelcome cultural appropriation. Used by blacks, the term may indicate \"solidarity or affection\", similar to the usage of the words \"dude\", \"homeboy\", and \"bro\". Others consider \"nigga\" non-offensive except when directed from a non-African-American towards an African-American. Yet others have derided this as hypocritical and harmful, enabling white racists to use the word and confusing the issue over \"nigger\".\n\nThe term \"nigga, please\", used in the 1970s by comics such as Paul Mooney as \"a funny punctuation in jokes about Blacks\", is now heard routinely in comedy routines by African Americans. The growing use of the term is often attributed to its ubiquity in modern American hip hop music. Examples include:\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the term in a popular song was the 1983 song \"New York New York\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, although it had featured in some very early hip hop recordings such as \"Scoopy Rap\" and \"Family Rap\", both from 1979. Ol' Dirty Bastard uses the term 76 times in his \"Nigga Please\" album (not including repetitions in choruses).\n\nComedian Chris Rock's routine \"Niggas vs. Black People\" distinguishes a \"nigga\", which he defined as a \"low-expectation-having motherfucker\", from a \"black person\". In contrast, Tupac Shakur distinguished between \"nigger\" and \"nigga\": \"Niggers was the ones on the rope, hanging off the thing; niggas is the ones with gold ropes, hanging out at clubs.\" Tupac, who has been credited with legitimizing the term, said his song N.I.G.G.A. stood for \"Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished\".\n\nUntil a 2017 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Matal v. Tam\", the Lanham Act did not permit registration of trademarks containing terms that may disparage persons or bring them into disrepute. Registration by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) of terms that are historically considered disparaging to groups of people has been allowed in some circumstances. Self-disparaging trademarks have been allowed in some cases where the applicant has shown that the mark as-used is not considered by the relevant group to be disparaging.\n\nIn 1995, two Houston, Texas men filed a trademark application with the PTO for the words \"Naturally Intelligent God Gifted Africans\", and its acronym. The application was rejected, as were numerous subsequent applications for variations of the word \"nigga\". Most recently, comedian Damon Wayans twice attempted to trademark a brand name called Nigga, \"featuring clothing, books, music and general merchandise\". The PTO refused the application, stating \"the very fact that debate is ongoing regarding in-[ethnic]-group usage, shows that a substantial composite of African Americans find the term 'nigga' to be offensive\".\n\n\n"}

He also had two paternal half-brothers; Neythelloor Koikkal Makayiramnal Kerala Varma Thampuran (1846–1890) and Neythelloor Kottarathil Thrikkettanal Veera Kerala Varma Thampuran. Makayiramnal Kerala Varma Thampuran was the author of \"Bhoothanatholbhavam\" thullal and \"Aardra Maholsavam\" Sanskrit champu. Thrikkettanal Veera Kerala Varma Thampuran was the author of \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" Sanskrit poem and \"Banayuddham\" Sanskrit champu. He was also the logical reasoning guru of Pandalam Kerala Varma. Pandalam Kerala Varma's relative Malikathazhe Bharaninal Kerala Varma Thampuran (1823–1883) was an astrology and grammar expert. It is believed that he had predicted that Pandalam Kerala Varma would become famous one day. Another relative Vadakke Kottarathil Thiruvathiranal Raja Raja Varma Valiya Thampuran (1817–1902) was the author of the hymns \"Dharmasathru Sathakam\", \"Krishnaleela\", \"Devi Sthothram\", \"Sabarigireesa Sthothram\", and \"Pandalam Mahadeva Sathakam\". He took care of Pandalam Kerala Varma's poetic practice and grammatical studies. Thekkekkettil Kottarathil Athamnal Godavarma Valiya Thampuran (1840–1911) was the grammar guru of Pandalam Kerala Varma.\n\nKerala Varma started learning the alphabet at age 3 from Pandalam Achutha Warrier. After Warrier's death, Avittomnal Rama Varma Thampuran became his guru. Kerala Varma learnt \"Siddha Roopam\", \"Sree Ramodantham\", and \"Amara Kosam\" by age 10. Thereafter he studied the poems \"Sree Krishna Vilasam\", \"Naishadheeya Charitha\", \"Kiratharjuneeyam\" and plays like \"abhigijñānaśākuntalam\". From age 17 to 24, he studied \"Vyulpathi Vadaparyantham\" logical reasoning and \"Praudamanoramantham\" grammatical lessons. Kerala Varma's upanayana was completed at the age of 14. He started writing Sanskrit poems from age 12, and Malayalam poems from age 19. He was established as a poet by the age of 20. Beside poetry, he was also skilled in other activities. In his childhood, he made a striking clock and a cycle for use in water.\n\nKerala Varma married Ammukkutty Amma in 1905. The couple had two sons and three daughters. In 1914, he joined SMV High School, Thiruvananthapuram as language teacher. He also bought a house at Kaithamukku and settled in Thiruvananthapuram. During this period, he along with Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer learnt grammar and rhetorical figures under the guidance of Thuravoor Narayana Shastri. He was appointed a member on the expert panel of the Maharaja of Travancore by the then king Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma and was granted 10 rupees as salary. He was conferred \"Kavi Thilakan\" honour by the King of Cochin.\n\nKerala Varma used to visit Thiruvananthapuram every year during Navratri festival time and engage in literary discussions with Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran. His last journey with Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer was to Kochi to receive the \"Kavi Thilakan\" honour. Kerala Varma was friends with Kodungallur Kochunni Thampuran, Kochi Parikshith Thampuran, and Sahridaya Thilakan Rama Pisharody.\n\nKerala Varma was disturbed by the unexpected deaths of his relatives and close associates in a short period. His guru Avittomnal Rama Varma Thampuran, mother, father, and brother Veera Kerala Varma Thampuran died in a span of six years. Kerala Varma died in 1919 from fever known at that time as Bombay Fever. In 1979, a collection of his writings were reprinted and published in two volumes as 'selected works'.\n\nKerala Varma's initial works were \"Sreekrishna Sthothram\", an ashtakam on Dharmasastha, \"Kesadipada Sathakam\", and \"Rasavilasambhanam\". His first work was published in \"Subhashini\" newspaper, Changanassery in 1898. It was the completion of a poetic puzzle \"Kunnennu Cholvathinu Kuttamaseshamundo\" by Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer. Later he published his poems in \"Malayala Manorama\", \"Rasika Ranjini\", \"Kavitha Vilasini\", \"Dakshina Deepam\", \"Vijnana Ratnakaram\", \"Kerala Varma\", \"Kerala Kesari\", \"Bhasha Sarada\", \"Sumangala\", \"Aryakesari\", \"Mahila Ratnam\", \"Kerala Vyasan\", \"Mangalodayam\", and \"Vani Vilasam\". He used to engage two writers to note down his recitations. He never wanted to monetise his poems. Once he quipped that he did not want to publish poems immediately after writing, but wanted to review and correct it later before sending for publication.\n\nKerala Varma authored 16 major works, including two mahakavyas \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" and \"Vijayodayam\". Of these, \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" is considered his masterpiece. It was widely respected as an example of a typical mahakavya before Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer published \"Umakeralam\". Revealing Varma's command over the language and the medium of expression, \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" was meant for a scholarly audience. The book was first published in 1913 although it was completed five years before its publication. It contains 19 chapters.\n\nBoth mahakavyas are considered as representations of neoclassical style. Madasseri Madhava Warrier observed that \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" was a complete mahakavya in the old style and those who were familiar with that style would like it best. According to N. Krishna Pillai, Kerala Varma's mahakavyas would astonish everybody with their word control and effortless beauty. Kumaran Asan reviewed \"Rukmamgadacharitham\" in \"Vivekodayam\" magazine and described it as a great work, although his review contained praises and criticism alike. In the preface to the book, Kerala Varma wrote that he never felt any sense of pride in writing a mahakavya, but wanted to give a place to the mythological story in Kerala literature. \"Vijayodayam\" is Kerala Varma's second mahakavya. It is a relatively smaller work as it contained only eight chapters which is the minimum requirement for a mahakavya. It deals with the story of Kirata and Arjuna. While some critics do not consider it as a mahakavya, some others, most notably M. Leelavathy, T. P. Balakrishnan Nair, and T. G. Madhavan Kutty rate it as a mahakavya. It is believed that Bharavi's \"Kirātārjunīya\" was Kerala Varma's inspiration to write \"Vijayodayam\". Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer opined that the poem was quite enchanting.\n\nKerala Varma's narrative poems were based on either history, mythology, or pure imagination. \"Marthanda Devodayam\", \"Vancheesa Sathakam\", \"Sreemoola Prakasika\", and \"Sreemoolaraja Vijayam\" fall into the history based category. \"Saubhadra Niryanam\", \"Urmila\", \"Bheema Prabhavam\", \"Lakshmana Pravasam\", \"Ghatolkkachan\", \"Subhadra\", \"Marthya Vaibhavam\", \"Barbareekan\", \"Sayoojyam\", and \"Vibheeshaabhishekam\" can be categorised as mythology based. \"Bhageerathi\", \"Oru Kadha\", \"Lakshmi\", \"Oru Puravriththam\", \"Naanikkutty\", \"Chelapparambu\" are based on pure imagination.\n\nKerala Varma wrote 35 poems for children. Kerala Varma wrote the widely popular Malayalam prayer song for children \"Daivame Kai Thozham\". Some of his other poetry for children include \"Kalikkutty\", \"Maasangal\", \"Neram Veluthu\", \"Thathammayum Penkuttiyum\", \"Aana\", \"Ponnu Thampuran\", \"Nakshathrangal\", \"Nazhikamani\", \"Sundara Viddi\", \"Ammepaksham\", \"Kanduvo Nee\", \"Kadannalum Theneechayum\", \"Arivu\", \"Manthan Chanthayil Poyathu\", \"Jalam\", \"Oru Tharkkam\", \"Chinthikkaran\", \"Payyeppayye\", \"Kallane Killan Pidikkum\", \"Vaayu\", \"Oru Vanchippattu\", \"Kallanaya Eli\", \"Dinacharya\", \"Kakkayum Kurukkanum\", \"Pasu\", \"Palliyunarthal\", \"Prarthana\", \"Vallamkali\", and \"Ambili Ammavan\". His poems \"Kaliyum Karyavum\", \"Payyethinnal Panayum Thinnam\", and \"Othoruma\" contain advice for children.\n\nKerala Varma translated a drama and a vyayogam from Sanskrit to Malayalam. These are \"Veni Samharam\" by Bhatta Narayana and \"Dootha Vakyam\" by Bhasa. Kerala Varma later commented that he had only respected the original authors in his translations although he never translated the works word by word. According to Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, the translations were excellent and were comparable to Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran's translation of \"Ascharya Choodamani\". He further added that it required remarkable skills to translate the works of Bhatta Narayana at the same quality.\n\nAlthough his ancestral deity is Lord Ayyappa, Kerala Varma wrote majority of hymns in praise of Devi. \"Vani Panchakam\", \"Gauristhavam\", \"Devi Dasakam\", and \"Aryashtakam\" are such works. He also wrote hymns such as \"Ramesa Dasakam\" in praise of Lord Vishnu. Kerala Varma wrote essays rarely. Two of his essays are \"Loka Vaichithyam\" and \"Iravan\", which are noted for their humour content and the writer's observation. \"Loka Vaichithryam\" explains the strange aspects of the world and poetry. \"Iravan\" discusses the mythological story of the tactical self-sacrifice of Iravan planned by Sree Krishna to sustain the fame of Arjuna. Generally, Kerala Varma's works uplhold moral values.\n\nKerala Varma's narrative poem \"Sreemoolaraja Vijayam\" is essentially lyrics for an Ottamthullal, although it did not have the ease and rhythm of traditional thullal lyrics. This contains the chronological life events of Sree Moolam Thirunal, from birth to his 60th birthday. His \"Yathra Kavyam\" is a neoclassical work which narrates his personal experience of visiting Sabarimala along traditional route, following traditional custom and rituals. This is an incomplete work.\n\nKerala Varma had a vast vocabulary. According to his biographer A. D. Hari Sarma, Kerala Varma never faced an issue in finding the right choice of word and that once he started writing, apt words used to appear as the flow of river Ganges. Vallathol described him as \"Padam kondu panthaadunna Pandalam\" (One who juggles with words). Kerala Varma was severely criticised by Kumaran Asan in the literary periodical \"Vivekodayam\". Joseph Mundassery also criticised Kerala Varma for his poetic style. P. V. Krishna Warrier criticised Kerala Varma in a special issue of \"Kavana Kaumudi\".\n\nUlloor S. Parameswara Iyer called Kerala Varma \"Prithveesan\" for his uncanny ability to write poems in Prithvi metre. He also remarked that Kerala Varma had absolute control over all words in Malayalam and Sanskrit. Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker compared Kerala Varma to Garuda in his \"Kaviramayanam\".\n\nKerala Varma used to publish a fortnightly periodical \"Kavana Kaumudi\", which contained poetry and contemporary issues. The periodical was published from Pandalam. It was the first Malayalam periodical. The first issue of \"Kavana Kaumudi\" was published on 4 November 1904, which was 1 Vrischikam 1080 as per the Malayalam calendar. Kerala Varma was the owner and Chief Editor of the periodical and P. K. Narayanan Namboothiri was the publisher and manager. The editorials in the periodical discussed social, political, and contemporary issues. These were mainly targeted at corruption and inefficiency of administration. The periodical contained advertisements also. All contents in the periodical including advertisements were in poetic form. The periodical also contained a column \"Balopadesam\" for children. Poets like Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer opposed the idea of such a periodical initially, but later praised it and wrote in it.\n\n\"Kavana Kaumudi\" was printed on a broadsheet with eight pages and four columns on each page. It was published on the 1st and 15th of all Malayalam months. The earlier issues of the periodical were printed at Suvarnaratnaprabha Press, Kayamkulam. After the first three years, \"Kavana Kaumudi\" became a monthly publication. In 1905, the printing of the periodical was shifted to Kerala Kalpadrumam\nPress in Thrissur, which was managed by Vallathol Narayana Menon. In March 1910, the printing was further shifted to Lakshmisahayam Press at Kottakkal. The running of \"Kavana Kaumudi\" put Kerala Varma into financial crisis. Later, P. V. Krishna Warrier joined as the co-editor of \"Kavana Kaumudi\". Following the death of Kerala Varma, Warrier became the Chief Editor of the periodical. Warrier introduced a book review column in the periodical by the name \"Njangalude Vayanamuri\". Later, advertisements and book reviews started appearing in prose. Several poems from Vallathol's \"Sahitya Manjari\" and G. Sankara Kurup's \"Sahitya Kauthukam\" were first published in \"Kavana Kaumudi\". The periodical also carried several translations of English romantic poems.\n\nKerala Varma used to write poetic editorials in \"Kavana Kaumudi\". Among those who wrote on \"Kavana Kaumudi\" were Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran, A. R. Raja Raja Varma, Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma, Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran, K. C. Kesava Pillai, Vallathol Narayana Menon, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker, Kuttippuram, and Kochunni Thampuran. The earlier poems of Nalappattu Narayana Menon, G. Sankara Kurup, and V. C. Balakrishna Panicker were also published in this periodical. Among the famous poets of that time, only Kumaran Asan had not written in the periodical.\n\nBeside the regular issues, \"Kavana Kaumudi\" introduced special issues on nine different occasions. It was the first time a special issue was being printed for a Malayalam publication. The special issues were titled \"Bhasha Vilasam\". The first special issue was published in 1914 and the last in 1930. The special issues contained both poems and prose. The first special issue contained ashtakams by famous poets based on the subject train. The periodical was in print for 11 more years after the death of Kerala Varma, until it stopped in 1930.\n\n\"Kavana Kaumudi\" is considered to have served as a unifying factor, surpassing the regional differences and parochial discriminations that existed in the early 20th century. Poet O. N. V. Kurup observed that \"Kavana Kaumudi\" ushered the poets of Kerala who were split into three regions, to a single platform. Even Kumaran Asan who was reluctant to publish his poems through the periodical, wrote that it would not be a mistake to consider \"Kavana Kaumudi\" as a standard for understanding the prosperity of poetic skills in Malayalam. In the souvenir published during the birth centenary of Kerala Varma, poet Cherukunnam Purushothaman observed that none of the obstacles such as the complexity of the topic, demand for fast completion, or lack of time for revision or correction marred Kerala Varma's priceless editorials. Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi has published a Monograph of Pandalam Kerala Varma ( by P. Ravi Varma) in 2013\n\n\nThe Pandalam Kerala Varma Smaraka Samithi is an association set up in remembrance of the poet. The Samithi,with the sapport of Pandalathu Kottaram Nirvahaka Sanghom(Pandalam Palace Managing Commatte) offers two awards; a literary award to honour excellence in poetry and a media award to honour excellence in editorial.

His work on Proto-Basque focused mainly on the period between the 5th century BCE and the 1st century CE, the period just before and after initial contact with the Romans.\n\nThe main method he employed was that of internal reconstruction as Basque has no known genetic relatives, rendering comparative methods unworkable. By comparing variants of the same word in the modern dialects and the changes Latin loanwords had undergone, ancestral forms and the rules for historical sound changes were deduced.\n\nKoldo Mitxelena's groundbreaking work, which culminated with the publication of his book \"Fonética histórica vasca\" (1961) was mostly carried out before the Aquitanian inscriptions were found, which fully backed up Mitxelena's proposed Proto-Basque forms.\n\nSince then, a number of other prominent linguists such as Larry Trask, Alfonso Irigoien, Henri Gavel and most recently Joseba Lakarra, Joaquín Gorrotxategi and Ricardo Gómez have made further contributions to the field. Some of them, such as Lakarra, have focused their attention on even older layers of the language (Pre-Proto-Basque) preceding the Celtic invasion of Iberia.\n\nStudying the behaviour of Latin and early Romance loanwords in Basque, Koldo Mitxelena discovered that proto-Basque *n became lost between vowels, and similarly that proto-Basque had no *m. Both are relatively unusual changes cross-linguistically, although /n/ was also partially deleted between vowels in the history of the nearby Portuguese language.\n\nOne of the puzzles of Basque is the large number of words that begin with vowels, where the initial and second vowels are the same. Joseba Lakarra proposes that in pre-proto-Basque there was extensive reduplication, and that later certain initial consonants were deleted, leaving the VCV pattern in proto-Basque:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45194090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45194090", "title": "Proto-Min language", "text": "Proto-Min language\n\nProto-Min is a comparative reconstruction of the common ancestor of the Min group of varieties of Chinese.\nMin varieties developed in the relative isolation of the Chinese province of Fujian and eastern Guangdong, and have since spread to Taiwan, southeast Asia and other parts of the world.\nThey contain reflexes of distinctions not found in Middle Chinese or most other modern varieties, and thus provide additional data for the reconstruction of Old Chinese.\n\nJerry Norman reconstructed the sound system of proto-Min from popular vocabulary in a range of Min varieties, including new data on varieties from inland Fujian.\nThe system has a six-way manner contrast in stops and affricates, compared with the three-way contrast in Middle Chinese and modern Wu varieties and the two-way contrast in most modern Chinese varieties.\nA two-way contrast in sonorants is also reconstructed, compared with the single series of Middle Chinese and all modern varieties. Evidence from early loans into other languages suggests that the additional contrasts may reflect consonant clusters or minor syllables.\n\nThe Min homeland consists of most of the province of Fujian, and the adjacent eastern part of Guangdong.\nThe area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the South China Sea.\nAfter the area was first settled by Chinese during the Han dynasty, most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the Xiang and Gan rivers to the west.\nMin varieties have thus developed in relative isolation.\n\nAs described in rhyme dictionaries such as the \"Qieyun\" (601 AD), Middle Chinese initial stops and affricate consonants showed a three-way contrast between voiceless unaspirated, voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were four tones, with the fourth, the\"entering tone\", a checked tone comprising syllables ending in stops (\"-p\", \"-t\" or \"-k\").\n\nThis syllable structure was also found in neighbouring languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area – Proto-Hmong–Mien, Proto-Tai and early Vietnamese – and is largely preserved by early loans between the languages. Towards the end of the first millennium AD, all of these languages experienced a tone split conditioned by initial consonants. Each tone split into an upper (\"yīn\" 阴/陰) register consisting of words with voiceless initials and a lower (\"yáng\" 阳/陽) register of words with voiced initials. When voicing was lost in most varieties, the register distinction became phonemic, yielding up to eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables.\n\nThe traditional classification of varieties of Chinese distinguished seven groups according to the reflexes of Middle Chinese voiced initials in various tonal categories.\nFor example, voiced stops are preserved in the Wu and Old Xiang groups, have merged with aspirated or unaspirated stops depending on the tone in Mandarin, and have uniformly become aspirated stops in Gan and Hakka. The distinguishing characteristic of Min varieties is that voiced stops yield both aspirated and unaspirated stops in all tonal categories. Further, the distribution is consistent across Min varieties, suggesting a common ancestor in which two types of voiced stop were distinguished.\n\nMin must have diverged before two changes in other Chinese varieties (including Middle Chinese) that are not reflected in Min:\nHowever, the palatalization of dental stops, which had occurred in some dialects by the Eastern Han period, is common to Middle Chinese and Min.\nBaxter and Sagart suggest that the later part of the Proto-Min period may have overlapped with Early Middle Chinese.\n\nPointing to features of Min varieties that are also found in Hakka and Yue varieties, Jerry Norman suggests that the three groups are descended from a variety spoken in the lower Yangtze region during the Han period, which he calls Old Southern Chinese.\nHe argues that this dialect belonged to the group of dialects known as Wu (吳) or Jiangdong (江東) in the Western Jin period, when the writer Guo Pu (early 4th century AD) described them as quite distinct from other Chinese varieties.\nSome of the distinctive Jiangdong words mentioned by Guo Pu appear to be preserved in modern Min varieties, including Proto-Min *gi \"leech\" and *lhɑn \"young fowl\".\nThis language entered Fujian after the area was opened to Chinese settlement by the defeat of the Minyue state by the armies of Emperor Wu of Han in 110 BC.\nNorman argues that Hakka and Yue have resulted from overlays of this language by successive waves of influence from northern China.\n\nWhen Chinese soldiers and settlers moved south from their homeland in the North China Plain, they came into contact with speakers of Tai–Kadai, Hmong–Mien and Austroasiatic languages. Early loans from Chinese into these languages date from around Han times and thus contain evidence of the sounds of Chinese as spoken in the south at that time.\n\nNorman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:\nSince the two later layers can largely be derived from the \"Qieyun\", Norman sought to focus on the earlier layers.\n\nEarly classifications, such as those of Li Fang-Kuei in 1937 and Yuan Jiahua in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups.\nHowever, in a 1963 report on a survey of Fujian, Pan Maoding and colleagues argued that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups.\nThe inland varieties are distinguished by consistently having two distinct reflexes of Middle Chinese /l/.\nThe two groups also have differences in their vocabulary, including their pronoun systems.\n\nThe coastal dialects are divided into three subgroups:\nThey divided the inland dialects into two subgroups:\nSeveral varieties in the far west of Fujian include features of Min and the neighbouring Gan and Hakka groups, making them difficult to classify.\nIn the Shaojiang dialects, spoken in the northwestern Fujian counties of Shaowu and Jiangle, the reflexes of Middle Chinese voiced stops are uniformly aspirated, as in Gan and Hakka, leading some workers to assign them to one of these groups.\nPan et al. described them as intermediate between Min and Hakka.\nHowever, Norman showed that their tonal development could only be explained in terms of the same two classes of voiced initial assumed for Min dialects. He suggested that they were inland Min dialects that had been subject to heavy Gan or Hakka influence.\nNorman's student David Prager Branner argued that the varieties of Longyan and the township of Wan'an, in the southwestern part of the province, were coastal Min varieties, but outside of the three subgroups identified by Pan.\n\nIn a series of papers from 1973, Jerry Norman sought to reconstruct the initial consonants of proto-Min by applying the comparative method to pronunciations in modern Min varieties.\nFor this purpose, rather that the traditional approach of soliciting readings of character lists, he focussed on everyday vocabulary and excluded words of literary origin.\n\nThe inventory of proto-Min initials differs from that of Middle Chinese (as deduced from the \"Qieyun\" rhyme book and its successors) in several ways:\n\nThe most controversial have been the \"softened\" stops and affricates, so named because they have lateral or fricative reflexes in some Northern Min varieties centred on Jianyang.\nThese initials also have distinct tonal reflexes in the Northern Min and Shaojiang groups, but have merged with unaspirated stops and affricates in coastal varieties.\nOther scholars have suggested that the patterns observed in northwest Fujian can be explained as a mixture of forms from neighbouring Wu, Gan and Hakka varieties, though this does not explain the regularity of the correspondences.\nIn addition, the forms of many of the words in the proposed donor varieties do not match the Min reflexes, and some of the words occur only in Min.\n\nSince the pioneering reconstruction of Bernhard Karlgren, Old Chinese has been reconstructed by projecting the categories of Middle Chinese back onto the rhyming patterns of the \"Classic of Poetry\" and the shared phonetic components of Chinese characters. Thus Old Chinese is usually reconstructed with the same three-way manner distinction in obstruent initials found in Middle Chinese. However this does not preclude additional manner distinctions that merged in Middle Chinese, because rhyme gives no information about initials and sharing of phonetic components indicates initials with the same place of articulation but not necessarily the same manner.\nSeveral scholars have attempted to incorporate proto-Min data into their reconstructions of Old Chinese.\nThe most systematic attempt to date is the reconstruction of Baxter and Sagart, who derive the additional initials from a number of initial consonant clusters and minor syllables.\n\nAll modern Min varieties have a two-way contrast between unaspirated and aspirated voiceless stops and affricates.\nWhere these initials occur with upper register tones, they are projected back into proto-Min, and correspond to unaspirated and aspirated voiceless initials in Middle Chinese.\nHowever, some Middle Chinese voiceless unaspirated initials correspond to fricatives or laterals in Northern Min, and also have a special tonal development in Northern Min and Shao–Jiang.\nNorman called these initials voiceless \"softened\" stops and affricates.\n\nIn loans from southern Chinese into proto-Hmong–Mien, softened obstruents are often represented by prenasalized consonants.\nNorman suggests the proto-Min initials were also prenasalized, whereas Baxter and Sagart derive them from stops preceded by minor syllables, arguing that the intervocalic environment caused the stops to weaken to fricatives in some dialects.\n\nIn most varieties of Chinese that have lost the voicing of Middle Chinese initials, the aspiration of the resulting initials is conditioned by tone, though the relationship varies between dialect groups.\nIn Min varieties however, both aspirated and unaspirated voiceless initials are found in lower register tones.\nThese initials must therefore be distinguished in proto-Min as aspirated and unaspirated voiced consonants.\nIn Shao–Jiang these initials are uniformly aspirated, but the same distinction is reflected in the tonal development.\nAs with the voiceless initials, there is a third group of formerly voiced initials with fricative or lateral reflexes in some Northern Min varieties, which Norman called \"softened\" voiced initials.\nIn Eastern Min varieties, voiced unaspirated affricates typically yielded plain /s/.\n\nThere are several cases where an adjective or intransitive verb beginning with an unaspirated voiced stop is paired with a transitive verb differing only in aspiration of the voiced stop, suggesting that the contrast reflects an early morphological process.\n\nEarly loans from southern Chinese into proto-Hmong–Mien have prenasalized stops corresponding to both aspirated and softened voiced stops in proto-Min.\nBaxter and Sagart derive aspirated voiced stops from tightly bound nasal preinitials in Old Chinese, and softened voiced stops from voiced stops preceded by minor syllables.\n\nInland Min varieties are characterized by having two distinct reflexes of Middle Chinese /l/, which Norman labels as proto-Min *l and *lh.\nThe two have merged in coastal varieties.\nIn modern Southern Min varieties such as Hokkien, /l/ and /n/ comprise a single phoneme, realized as /n/ before nasalized vowels and as /l/ in other syllables.\nTwo series of nasals can also be distinguished based on their tonal reflexes in Eastern Min and Shao-Jiang.\nThey generally produce a single series of nasal initials in modern varieties except in Southern Min.\nIn those varieties, the proto-Min initials *nh and *ŋh have become /h/ before high front vowels, *m, *n and *ŋ denasalized to *b, *l and *g respectively before oral vowels, but *mh and other occurrences of *nh and *ŋh often yield nasals in that context.\n\nAs the initials *lh, *nh, etc. follow the same tonal development as voiced aspirated initials throughout Min, Norman suggests that they were characterized by breathy voice.\nIn Hakka dialects, nasals appear in both lower and upper register tones, suggesting a protolanguage with both voiced and voiceless nasals.\nMoreover, the occurrence of these initials corresponds to the plain and aspirated nasals of proto-Min.\nNorman suggests that they derive from voiced and voiceless nasals in Old Southern Chinese.\nFurther evidence for a voicing distinction comes from early loans into Vietnamese and the Mienic and Tai languages.\nNorman later abandoned the *ń initial, treating the dz-/z- initials in some Southern Min varieties as arising from *n followed by a high front vowel *i or *y.\n\nA different set of voiceless resonant initials is proposed in most recent reconstructions of Old Chinese, with fricative reflexes in Middle Chinese.\nNorman suggests that Old Southern Chinese voiceless sonorants derive from sonorants preceded by voiceless consonants.\nWilliam Baxter and Laurent Sagart have incorporated this proposal into their reconstruction of Old Chinese.\n\nFricatives in upper and lower registers are assumed to derive from voiceless and voiced fricatives respectively, broadly corresponding to the voiceless and voiced fricatives of Middle Chinese.\nZero initials show three distinct patterns of tonal development, reconstructed as initials *ɦ, *ʔ and a proto-Min zero initial.\nThe latter occurs only before the high front vowels *i and *y.\n\nIn Central Min, *s and *x merged as /ʃ/ before high front vowels.\n\nProto-Min had four tone classes, corresponding to the four tones of Middle Chinese: syllables with vocalic or nasal endings belonged to class *A, *B or *C, whereas class *D consisted of the syllables ending in a stop (/p/, /t/ or /k/). As with Middle Chinese and other languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, each of these classes split into upper and lower registers, depending on whether the original initial was voiceless or voiced. When voicing was lost, the register distinction became phonemic, yielding tone classes conventionally numbered 1 to 8, with tones 1 and 2 naming the upper and lower registers of proto-Min class A*, and so on. All 8 classes are retained by the Chaozhou dialect, but some have merged in other varieties. Some northern varieties, including the Jianyang dialect, have an additional tone class (tone 9), reflecting a partial merger of tone classes that cannot be predicted from Middle Chinese forms.\n\nStop and affricate initials at other points of articulation produce the same tonal reflexes as the dental examples in the above table.\nVoiceless fricatives have the same tonal reflexes as voiceless aspirated and unaspirated stops.\nVoiced fricatives are more varied:\nThe zero initial has the same tonal development as plain sonorants.\n\nNorman reconstructs proto-Min finals as consisting of:\nThe possible combinations were:\n\nThe close vowels *i, *u, *y, *e and *ə were short, with stronger following consonants, whereas the open vowels *o, *a and *ɑ were longer, with weaker following consonants.\n\nProto-Min also had a single word with a syllabic nasal, the usual negator *m (cognate with Middle Chinese \"mjɨjH\" \"not have\").\n\nMost inland varieties have reduced the nasal codas to a single category.\nCoastal varieties went through a series of changes that each affected part of the area, and interacted with nasal initials:\n\nIn most inland varieties stop codas have disappeared, but are marked with separate tonal categories.\nIn coastal varieties, stop codas underwent changes corresponding to those affecting nasal codas:\n\nMost Min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other Chinese varieties, but there is also a significant number of distinctively Min words that may be traced back to proto-Min.\nIn some cases a semantic shift has occurred in Min or the rest of Chinese:\n\n\nNorman and Mei Tsu-lin have suggested an Austroasiatic origin for some Min words:\n\n\nIn other cases, the origin of the Min word is obscure. Such words include *khau 骹 \"foot\", *-tsiɑm 䭕 \"insipid\" and *dzyŋ 𧚔 \"to wear\".\n\n\n"}

A pair of rafters is called a \"couple\". In home construction, rafters are normally made of wood. Exposed rafters are a feature of some traditional roof styles.\n\nIn recent buildings there is a preference for trussed rafters on the grounds of cost, economy of materials, off-site manufacture, and ease of construction, as well as design considerations including span limitations and roof loads (weight from above).\n\nThere are many names for rafters depending on their location, shape, or size (see below). The earliest surviving roofs in Europe are of common rafters on a tie beam, this assembly is technically called a \"closed couple\". Later principal rafters and common rafters were mixed which is called a major/minor or primary/secondary roof system.\nHistorically many rafters, including hip rafters, often taper in height 1/5 to 1/6 of their width, the larger end at the foot. Architect George Woodward discusses the purpose of this in 1860: \"The same amount of strength can be had with a less amount of lumber. There is an additional labor in sawing such rafters, as well as a different calculation to be made in using up a log to the best advantage. It is necessary always to order this special bill of rafters direct from the mill, and the result will be that the extra cost will, nine times out of ten, overbalance the amount saved.\" John Muller also discusses a one-sixth taper for rafters. Pieces added at the feet to create an overhang or change the roof pitch are called a sprocket or coyau in French. (The projecting piece on the gable of a building forming an overhang is called a lookout. A rafter can be reinforced with a strut, principal purlin, collar beam, or rarely an auxiliary rafter (see below).\n\nRafter types include:\n\n"}

While NLG is concerned with the conversion of non-linguistic information into natural language, REG focuses only on the creation of referring expressions (noun phrases) that identify specific entities called \"targets\".\n\nThis task can be split into two sections. The \"content selection\" part determines which set of properties distinguish the intended target and the \"linguistic realization\" part defines how these properties are translated into natural language.\nA variety of algorithms have been developed in the NLG community to generate different types of referring expressions.\n\nA referring expression (RE), in linguistics, is any noun phrase, or surrogate for a noun phrase, whose function in discourse is to \"identify\" some individual object (thing, being, event...) The technical terminology for \"identify\" differs a great deal from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably \"refer\", and a thing identified is a \"referent\", as for example in the work of John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to understand the nature of knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.\n\nVarious devices can be used for reference: determiners, pronouns, proper names... Reference relations can be of different kinds; referents can be in a \"real\" or imaginary world, in discourse itself, and they may be singular, plural, or collective.\n\nThe simplest type of referring expressions are pronoun such as \"he\" and \"it\". The linguistics and natural language processing communities have developed various models for predicting anaphor referents, such as centering theory, and ideally referring-expression generation would be based on such models. However most NLG systems use much simpler algorithms, for example using a pronoun if the referent was mentioned in the previous sentence (or sentential clause), and no other entity of the same gender was mentioned in this sentence.\n\nThere has been a considerable amount of research on generating definite noun phrases, such as \"the big red book\". Much of this builds on the model proposed by Dale and Reiter. This has been extended in various ways, for example Krahmer \"et al.\" present a graph-theoretic model of definite NP generation with many nice properties. In recent years a shared-task event has compared different algorithms for definite NP generation, using the TUNA corpus.\n\nRecently there has been more research on generating referring expressions for time and space. Such references tend to be imprecise (what is the exact meaning of \"tonight\"?), and also to be interpreted in different ways by different people. Hence it may be necessary to explicitly reason about false positive vs false negative tradeoffs, and even calculate the utility of different possible referring expressions in a particular task context.\n\nIdeally, a good referring expression should satisfy a number of criteria:\n\nREG goes back to the early days of NLG. One of the first approaches was done by Winograd in 1972 who developed an \"incremental\" REG algorithm for his SHRDLU program. Afterwards researchers started to model the human abilities to create referring expressions in the 1980s. This new approach to the topic was influenced by the researchers Appelt and Kronfeld who created the programs KAMP and BERTRAND and considered referring expressions as parts of bigger speech acts.\n\nSome of their most interesting findings were the fact that referring expressions can be used to add information beyond the identification of the referent as well as the influence of communicative context and the Gricean maxims on referring expressions. Furthermore, its skepticism concerning the naturalness of minimal descriptions made Appelt and Kronfeld's research a foundation of later work on REG.\n\nThe search for simple, well-defined problems changed the direction of research in the early 1990s. This new approach was led by Dale and Reiter who stressed the identification of the referent as the central goal.\nLike Appelt they discuss the connection between the Gricean maxims and referring expressions in their culminant paper in which they also propose a formal problem definition. Furthermore, Reiter and Dale discuss the Full Brevity and Greedy Heuristics algorithms as well as their Incremental Algorithm(IA) which became one of the most important algorithms in REG.\nAfter 2000 the research began to lift some of the simplifying assumptions, that had been made in early REG research in order to create more simple algorithms. Different research groups concentrated on different limitations creating several expanded algorithms. Often these extend the IA in a single perspective for example in relation to:\n\n\nMany simplifying assumptions are still in place or have just begun to be worked on. Also a combination of the different extensions has yet to be done and is called a \"non-trivial enterprise\" by Krahmer and van Deemter.\n\nAnother important change after 2000 was the increasing use of empirical studies in order to evaluate algorithms. This development took place due to the emergence of transparent corpora. Although there are still discussions about what the best evaluation metrics are, the use of experimental evaluation has already led to a better comparability of algorithms, a discussion about the goals of REG and more task-oriented research.\n\nFurthermore, research has extended its range to related topics such as the choice of \"Knowledge Representation(KR) Frameworks\". In this area the main question, which KR framework is most suitable for the use in REG remains open. The answer to this question depends on how well descriptions can be expressed or found. A lot of the potential of KR frameworks has been left unused so far.\n\nSome of the different approaches are the usage of:\n\nDale and Reiter (1995) think about referring expressions as distinguishing descriptions.\n\nThey define:\nEach entity in the domain can be characterised as a set of attribute-value pairs for example formula_1type, dogformula_2, formula_1gender, femaleformula_2 or formula_1age, 10 yearsformula_2.\n\nThe problem then is defined as follows:\n\nLet formula_7 be the intended referent, and formula_8 be the contrast set. Then, a set formula_9 of attribute–value pairs will represent a distinguishing description if the following two conditions hold:\nIn other words, to generate a referring expression one is looking for a set of properties that apply to the referent but not to the distractors.\n\nThe problem could be easily solved by conjoining all the properties of the referent which often leads to long descriptions violating the second Gricean Maxim of Quantity. Another approach would be to find the shortest distinguishing description like the Full Brevity algorithm does.\nYet in practice it is most common to instead include the condition that referring expressions produced by an algorithm should be as similar to human-produced ones as possible although this is often not explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe Full Brevity algorithm always finds a minimal distinguishing description meaning there is no shorter distinguishing description in regard to properties used.\n\nTherefore, it iterates over formula_24 and checks every description of a length of formula_25 properties until a distinguishing description is found.\n\nTwo problems arise from this way of creating referring expressions. Firstly the algorithm has a high complexity meaning it is NP-hard which makes it impractical to use. Secondly human speakers produce descriptions that are not minimal in many situations.\n\nThe Greedy Heuristics algorithm approximates the Full Brevity algorithm by iteratively adding the most distinguishing property to the description. The most distinguishing property means the property that rules out most of the remaining distractors. The Greedy Heuristics algorithm is more efficient than the Full Brevity algorithm.\n\nDale and Reiter(1995) present the following algorithm for the Greedy Heuristic:\n\nLet formula_9 be the set of properties to be realised in our description; let formula_27 be the set of properties known to be true of our intended referent formula_7 (we assume that formula_27 is non-empty); and let formula_8 be the set of distractors (the contrast set). The initial conditions are thus as follows:\n\nIn order to describe the intended referent formula_7 with respect to the contrast set formula_8, we do the\nfollowing:\n\nThe Incremental Algorithm (IA) by Dale and Reiter was the most influential algorithm before 2000. It is based on the idea of a \"preferential\" order of attributes or properties that speakers go by. So in order to run the Incremental Algorithm, first a preference order of attributes has to be given. Now the algorithm follows that order and adds those properties to the description which rule out any remaining distractors. Furthermore, Dale and Reiter stress the attribute type which is always included in their descriptions even if it does not rule out any distractors.\n\nAlso the type values are part of a \"subsumption hierarchy\" including some \"basic level values\". For example, in the \"pet\" domain \"chihuahua\" is subsumed by \"dog\" and \"dog\" by \"animal\". Because \"dog\" is defined as a basic level \"dog\" would be preferred by the algorithms, if \"chihuahua\" does not rule out any distractors.\n\nThe Incremental Algorithm is easy to implement and also computationally efficient running in polynomial time. The description generated by the IA can contain redundant properties that are superfluous because of later added properties. The creators do not consider this as a weakness, but rather as making the expressions less \"psycholinguistically implausible\".\n\nThe following algorithm is a simplified version of Dale and Reiter’s Incremental Algorithm by Krahmer and van Deemter that takes as input the referent \"r\", the \"D\" containing a collection of domain objects and a domain-specific ordered list \"Pref\" of preferred attributes. In the notation \"L\" is the description, \"C\" the context set of distractors and the function RulesOut() returns the set of objects which have a value different to V for attribute A.\n\nBefore 2000 evaluation of REG systems has been of theoretical nature like the one done by Dale and Reiter. More recently, empirical studies have become popular which are mostly based on the assumption that the generated expressions should be similar to human-produced ones. Corpus-based evaluation began quite late in REG due to a lack of suitable data sets. Still corpus-based evaluation is the most dominant method at the moment though there is also evaluation by human judgement.\n\nFirst the distinction between text corpora and experimental corpora has to be made. Text corpora like the GNOME corpus can contain texts from all kind of domains. In REG they are used to evaluate the \"realization\" part of algorithms. The \"content selection\" part of REG on the other hand requires a corpus that contains the properties of all domain objects as well as the properties used in references. Typically those fully \"semantically transparent\" created in experiments using simple and controlled settings.\n\nThese experimental corpora once again can be separated into \"General-Purpose Corpora\" that were collected for another purpose but have been analysed for referring expressions and \"Dedicated Corpora\" that focus specifically on referring expressions. Examples of General-Purpose Corpora are the Pear Stories, the Map Task corpus or the Coconut corpus while the Bishop corpus, the Drawer corpus and the TUNA corpus count to the Dedicated Corpora. \nThe TUNA corpus which contains web-collected data on the two domains furniture and people has been used in three shared REG challenges already.\n\nTo measure the correspondence between corpora and the results of REG algorithms several Metrics have been developed.\n\nTo measure the \"content selection\" part the Dice coefficient or the MASI (Measuring Agreement on Set-valued Items) metric are used. These measure the overlap of properties in two descriptions. In an evaluation the scores are usually averaged over references made by different human participants in the corpus. Also sometimes a measure called Perfect Recall Percentage (PRP) or Accuracy is used which calculates the percentage of perfect matches between an algorithm-produced and a human-produced reference.\n\nFor the \"linguistic realization\" part of REG the overlap between strings has been measured using metrics like BLEU or NIST. A problem that occurs with string-based metrics is that for example \"The small monkey\" is measured closer to \"The small donkey\" than to \"The little monkey\".\n\nA more time consuming way to evaluate REG algorithms is by letting humans judge the \"Adequacy\" (How clear is the description?) and \"Fluency\" (Is the description given in good and clear English?) of the generated expression. Also Belz and Gatt evaluated referring expressions using an experimental setup. The participants get a generated description and then have to click on the target. Here the extrinsic metrics reading time, identification time and error rate could be evaluated.\n"}

It replaced Hoffman's formula, which was the first statistical analysis of this type.\n\nThe method provides the answer to the question \"What would be the total of an athlete weighing \"x\" kg if he/she\nwere an athlete in the heaviest class of the same level of ability?\", given by the formula:\nACTUAL TOTAL × SINCLAIR COEFFICIENT = SINCLAIR TOTAL.\n\nThere are eight bodyweight categories for men: 56 kg, 62 kg, 69 kg, 77 kg, 85 kg, 94 kg, 105 kg and +105 kg, and eight for women: 48 kg, 53 kg, 58 kg, 63 kg, 69 kg, 75 kg, 90 kg and +90 kg.\n\nThere are two types of lifts: snatch, and clean and jerk. However, at most championships, medals are presented for both lifts and the total (the combined result of the best snatch and the best clean and jerk).\n\nTo compare and rank the results, especially between bodyweight categories, the International Weightlifting Federation uses the Sinclair Coefficients which are derived statistically and calculated for one Olympic cycle (for four years, starting in the Spring of each Olympic year).\n\nThe total for each bodyweight category is a projection of the Total for that weightlifter if he/she were a competitor in the heaviest bodyweight category with the same level of ability.\n\nThe Sinclair Coefficient is formula_1 if \"x\"<\"b\" where \"x\" is the weightlifter's bodyweight, \"b\" is the world record holder's bodyweight (in the heaviest category) and \"A\" is the coefficient for this Olympic cycle, or 1.0 if \"x\"≥\"b\".\n\nThen, the Sinclair Total is simply the obtained total multiplied by the Sinclair Coefficient.\n\nFor example, from 2017 to 2020, a calculation of the Sinclair Coefficient is as follows, given A=0.751945030 and b=175.508 kg for men, with A=0.783497476 and b=153.655 kg for women.\n\nAssume that we are assessing a male weightlifter weighing 61.9 kg with a total of 320 kg.\n\nTo understand the whole idea, here is the chart with the men's bodyweight categories (in kg) and its world record Totals, Sinclair Coefficients, and Sinclair Total.

Tshangla is primarily spoken in Eastern Bhutan and acts as a lingua franca in the country particularly among Sharchop/Tshangla communities; it is also spoken in Arunachal Pradesh, India, and Tibet. Tshangla is the principal pre-Tibetan (pre-Dzongkha) language of Bhutan.\n\nTshangla is frequently assumed to be close to the Tibetic languages. Bradley (2002) includes in among the East Bodish languages. Van Driem (2011), however, leaves it unclassified within Sino-Tibetan, pending further research. \n\nBodt (2012:188-189) classifies Tshangla as a Bodish language, but notes that Tshangla (like East Bodish) is related to, but not directly descended, from Classical Tibetan.\n\nTshangla is a dialect cluster consisting of a few mutually unintelligible language varieties, including (Gerber 2018):\n\nThe Tshangla variety of Trashigang town is used as a lingua franca. Dungsam is conservative, while Dirang and Bjokapakha are divergent.\n\nTshangla is primarily spoken in East and Southeast Bhutan, especially in the Trashigang district. The language is referred to as “Sharchopka” meaning 'the people in the east' in Dzongkha, the national language Bhutan. \n\nIt is also spoken in the Arunachal Pradesh of India, where it is sometimes referred to as “Central Monpa”, and in Southeast Tibet, where it is referred to as “Cangluo” (Andvik 2010: 4-6)\n\nThere are approximately 170,000 speakers of Tshangla, living in Bhutan (157,000), India (11,000) and Tibet (7000). It is not reported to be endangered in any way, as there are still many children learning it as their first language. Indeed, it is often described as being the majority language of eastern Bhutan, where it functions as something of a lingua franca. Andvic (2010: 4) reports that “most Bhutanese have at least some rudimentary knowledge of Tshangla”. In addition, it’s common for Western Bhutanese to learn some Tshangla through classmates in the school system (Yang Gyeltshen, p.c.). \nDespite its predominance in eastern Bhutan, Tshangla is described by Andvik (2010: 4) as “an unwritten language”, meaning that it “is not in any country standardized by governing fiat, taught in the schools, recognized as an official language, or even given status as a minority language.” However, Ethnologue reports that 47% of L1 speakers are literate, mainly using Uchen Tibtean script. Though there are no official publications in Tshangla, the language is used in radio and television broadcasts. (It remains undetermined what kind of orthography is used for writing copy for those broadcasts; Yang Gyeltshen, p.c.)\n\nThe official national language of Bhutan is Dzongkha, which is derived from the Tibetan spoken by Lama Shabdrung and his followers, who left Tibet to found the nation of Bhutan in the 1600s. Tshangla, however, is one of Bhutan’s many indigenous languages, and is the most widely spoken of the indigenous Sino-Tibetan languages.\n\nTshangla is found scattered throughout eastern Himalayan ridges as well as the southern regions, spoken by around 175,000 people. Most of the Tshangla populace live in Eastern Bhutan (Trashigang, eastern Pemagatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, eastern Mongar, and Trashiyangtse districts), where they formed an overwhelming major ethic group of the country probably accounting for 25-30% of the total population. Scatterred Tshangla speakers can also be found in neighbouring countries with different names.\n\nIn the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, they are called Kalaktang Monpa (and are lexically distinct). whereas about 7,000 Tshangla speaking people also live in Pemako (Bomê and Mêdog County) in southeastern Tibet, China and India. There are about 8,000 Kalaktang Monpa speakers in Khalaktang, Balimu, and Tomko villages, Kalaktang administrative center, West Kameng district, Arunachal Pradesh, India (\"Ethnologue\"). Good number of about 1000 to 15000 Tsangla speakers are also live in Tuting Town, Kopu, Bona, Gelling, Bishing along the Tsangpo (Siang) river and Nyering, Payingdem, Nyukong, Yortong, Mankota, Tashigong, Singa along the Yangsang Chu river, Upper Siang District, Arunachal Pradesh, India.\n\nThe distantly related 'Olekha language of the Black Mountains, also called \"Monpa\" and predating Dzongkha, belongs to the Sino-Tibetan East Bodish languages. 'Olekha is most closely related to the Bumthang language; both are East Bodish languages. Tshangla and related languages form a sister branch not to the East Bodish group, but to its parent Bodish branch. Thus the ambiguous term \"Monpa\" risks separating languages that should be grouped together, while grouping languages together that are quite separate.\n\nTshangla is traditionally an unwritten language and has no official status in any country. When written by native speakers, it is most often rendered in Tibetan script, however grammarians have devised a romanized transcription system.\n\nBelow appears a table of Tshangla consonants according to Andvik (2010). Non-native phonemes, in parentheses, are contrasted only marginally with native sounds: /ɬ/ is often nativized to /l/; /dz/ becomes /z/; and /ʑ/ becomes /y/.\n\nThe above table generally describes onset consonants. Consonant clusters in the onset position are limited to consonant plus /r/, with the exception of the syllable /pɕi/, used on only two contexts. Intervocalic positioning of aspirated onsets /pʰ/ /tʰ/, and /kʰ/ results in lenition to /ɸ/, /θ/, and /x/ or /h/, respectively, with some exceptions. Syllable-final consonants are limited to /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/, /m/, /n/, and /ŋ/.\n\nTshangla vowels appear in the chart below, following Andvik (2010). Vowels in parentheses appear in non-native words inherited from Tibetan, Dzongkha, and the latter's archaic liturgical form, Chöke. Non-native front rounded vowels may be nativized as front unrounded vowels.\nVowel clusters native to the Tshangla lexicon are /ai/ and /au/, and in derived contexts /oi/ and /ui/ also appear (e.g. a verbal ending: /bu-i/, take). In these native contexts, final /i/ and /u/ are pronounced as if they were /y/ or /w/, respectively. In loanwords /iu/ and /eu/ rarely appear, and tend to be realized as /iwu/ and /ewu/, respectively.\n\nMost dialects of Tshangla do not make lexical distinctions according to tone, however the language overall may be in the process of tonogenesis. Some dialects such as those of Central Monpa and Padma-bkod have replaced voiceless-voiced contrasts with a high-low tone distinction, respectively.\n\nTshangla grammar features nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. Word order is generally subject–object–verb (SOV). Its morphology is generally agglutinative, though most unmarked Tshangla lexicon comprises one or two syllables. Nouns are arranged into either head-first or head-last noun phrases. Demonstratives, relative clauses, and genitive phrases precede nouns, whereas markers for definiteness, number, topic, focus, case, and other particles follow the noun.\n\nWhile adjectives comprise a lexically distinct category in their own right, some adjectival words are grammatically nouns. This dichotomy is complicated by equally common relative clauses that function as adjectives. For example, \"dukpu waktsa\" means \"(the) badly poor child,\" and \"waktsa dukpu\" means \"(the) child who is badly poor.\" Some combinations are strictly noun-adjective, however.\n\nTshangla is a pro-drop language, with two otherwise notable features. First, multi-valent verbs drop objects even though they are not recoverable from context, through which verbs reduce their valency (i.e. become intransitive). In other situations where the argument is topically important, and where confusion is impossible, a \"zero\" (impersonal) pronoun is used. Otherwise, personal pronouns are extensively used. They appear below:\n\nWhen pronouns are followed by numbers, plurals is not used (e.g. \"ro nyiktsing\", \"the two of them\").\n\nNoun cases include absolutive (nominative), agentive (ergative)/instrumental (-\"gi\"), genitive (-\"ga-\"), ablative (-\"gai\"), and dative/locative (-\"ga\"). These suffices undergo devoicing in certain circumstances.\n\nVerbs are generally transitive or intransitive. The transitivity of some verbs corresponds to lexical distinctions: \"yekpa\" means \"to speak\" in a transitive sense, but \"to be called\" in an intransitive sense. Similarly, \"lekpe\" means \"to lick\" in a transitive sense, but \"to be licked\" in an intransitive sense, with the agent suppressed.\nThe copula, which has many forms, is used extensively in marking Tshangla verbs. Verbs are marked differently depending on whether they are predicate (finite), or relative or participial (non-finite). Only finite verbs take personal conjugations, while various non-finite forms take different suffices. Adverbs appear as suffices on non-final and participial verb forms.\n\nNegation of adjectives, nouns, and verbs take different forms. Sentence-final particles include interrogatory and non-declarative mood markers.\n\nTshangla dialects represent a continuum centered around the town of Trashigang, whose dialect is considered by Tshangla speakers to be the prestige dialect. Differences between dialects do not prevent mutual intelligibility, and many loanwords have come through Classical Tibetan (Chöke).\n\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, Tshangla is spoken in the Dirang area of West Kameng. The dialect there, called \"Central Monpa\", is spoken by some 6,000 people. More speakers of Tshangla dialects live in Kathmandu, Darjeeling and Assam.\n\nIn Bhutan, Tshangla is virtually identical to Cāngluò () of southeastern Tibet, also called \"Mòtuō (Bomê) Monpa\". The Bomê County region of Tibet, formerly known as Padma-bkod or Pemako, contains remnants of these Tshangla communities separated by hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\n"}

The rule is sensitive to pause, but not word boundary, so that (\"the house\") is realized as .\n\nIn a stressed syllable, , preceded by another stop, can occasionally be realized as true aspirates , especially if the stop is the same, for example (, \"note\"), (\"a casa\", \"at home\", with phonosyntactic strengthening due to the preposition).\n\nEstablishing a hierarchy of weakening within the class is not an easy task. Recent studies have called into question the traditional view that mutation of and is less widespread geographically than → , and in areas where the rule is not automatic, is often more likely to weaken than or .\n\nOn the other hand, deletion in rapid speech always affects first and foremost wherever it occurs, but reduces less often to , especially in the most common forms such as participles ( \"gone\"). Fricativisation of is by far the most perceptually salient of the three, however, and so it has become a stereotype of Tuscan dialects.\n\nThe phenomenon is more evident and finds its irradiation point in the city of Florence. From there, the gorgia spreads its influence along the entire Arno valley, losing strength nearer the coast. On the coast, and usually are not affected. The weakening of is a linguistic continuum in the entire Arno valley, in the cities of Prato, Pistoia, Montecatini Terme, Lucca, Pisa, Livorno.\n\nIn the northwest, it is present to some extent in Versilia. In the east, it extends over the Pratomagno to include Bibbiena and its outlying areas, where are sometimes affected, both fully occlusive and lenited (lax, unvoiced) allophones being the major alternates.\n\nThe Apennine Mountains are the northern border of the phenomenon, and while a definite southern border has not been established, it is present in Siena and further south to at least San Quirico d'Orcia. In the far south of Tuscany, it gives way to the lenition (laxing) typical of northern and coastal Lazio.\n\nThe \"Tuscan gorgia\" arose perhaps as late as the Middle Ages, as a natural phonetic phenomenon, much like the consonant voicing that affected Northern Italian dialects and the rest of Western Romance (now phonemicised as in \"friend\" (f.) > ), but it remained allophonic in Tuscany, as laxing or voicing generally does elsewhere in Central Italy and in Corsica.\n\nAlthough it was once hypothesised that the \"gorgia\" phenomena are the continuation of similar features in the language that predated Romanization of the area, Etruscan, that view is no longer held by most specialists. Instead, it is increasingly accepted as being a local form of the same consonant weakening that affects other speech in Central Italy, extending far beyond, to Western Romance. Support for that hypothesis can be found in several facts:\n\n\n"}
