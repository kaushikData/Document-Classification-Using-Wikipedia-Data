Accounting irregularities can consist of intentionally misstating amounts and other information in financial statements, or omitting information required to be disclosed. Accounting irregularities are commonly distinguished from unintentional mistakes or errors.\n\nAccounting irregularities are often committed as a means to an end, for example assets misappropriations may be concealed by using irregular accounting entries and profit overstatements may inflate the year end bonuses to perpetrators.\n"}

The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be \"always already\" present.\n\n\"Always already\" literally translates the German phrase \"immer schon\" that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\". The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that Dasein, the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.\n\nOn the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, Louis Althusser observed that \"individuals are always-already subjects\" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such — indeed, even before birth. During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include literary theory, hermeneutics and deconstruction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24981166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24981166", "title": "Ancient Greek verbs", "text": "Ancient Greek verbs\n\nAncient Greek verbs have four moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive and optative), three voices (active, middle and passive), as well as three persons (first, second and third) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).\n\nIn the indicative mood there are seven tenses: present, imperfect, future , aorist (the equivalent of past simple), perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect. (The last two, especially the future perfect, are rarely used). In the subjunctive and imperative mood, however, there are only three tenses (present, aorist, and perfect). The optative mood, infinitives and participles are found in four tenses (present, aorist, perfect, and future) and all three voices. The distinction of the \"tenses\" in moods other than the indicative is predominantly one of aspect rather than time.\n\nThe different persons of a Greek verb are shown by changing the verb-endings; for example () \"I free\", () \"you free\", () \"he or she frees\", etc. There are three persons in the singular (\"I\", \"you (singular)\", \"he, she, it\"), and three in the plural (\"we\", \"you (plural)\", \"they\"). In addition there are endings for the 2nd and 3rd persons dual (\"you two\", \"they both\"), but these are only very rarely used.\n\nA distinction is traditionally made between the so-called \"athematic\" verbs (also called \"mi\"-verbs), with endings affixed directly to the root, and the \"thematic\" class of verbs which present a \"thematic\" vowel or before the ending. The endings are classified into \"primary\" (those used in the present, future, perfect and future perfect of the indicative, as well as in the subjunctive) and \"secondary\" (used in the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect of the indicative, as well as in the optative).\n\nTo make the past tenses of the indicative mood, the vowel (), called an \"augment\", is prefixed to the verb stem, e.g. aorist () \"I freed\", imperfect () \"I was freeing\". This augment is found only in the indicative, not in the other moods or in the infinitive or participle. To make the perfect tense the first consonant is \"reduplicated\", that is, repeated with the vowel \"e\" ( () \"I have freed\", () \"I have written\"), or in some cases an augment is used in lieu of reduplication (e.g. () \"I have found\"). Unlike the augment of past tenses, this reduplication or augment is retained in all the moods of the perfect tense as well as in the perfect infinitive and participle.\n\nThe Ancient Greek verbal system preserves nearly all the complexities of Proto-Indo-European (PIE). Ancient Greek also preserves the PIE middle voice and adds a passive voice, with separate forms only in the future and aorist (elsewhere, the middle forms are used).\n\nAncient Greek verbs can be divided into two groups, the thematic (in which a thematic vowel or is added before the ending, e.g. () \"we free\"), and the athematic (in which the endings are attached directly to the stem, e.g. () \"we are\". Thematic verbs are much more numerous.\n\nThematic verbs, in the 1st person singular of the present tense active, end in (). These are very numerous, for example, () \"I say\", () \"I write\", () \"I send\", etc. The endings of these tend to be regular:\n\nThe forms in brackets are the dual number, used for two people, and which exists only in the 2nd and 3rd person; it is rather rare, but still used sometimes by authors such as Aristophanes and Plato:\n\nThe present infinitive active of thematic verbs is (), e.g. () \"to say\".\n\nThematic verbs are also found in the middle voice, with the 1st person singular ending () e.g. () \"I answer\", () \"I become\". The endings of the present tense go as follows:\n\nThe middle present infinitive is (), e.g. () \"to answer\".\n\nMany middle-voice verbs, such as () \"I answer\", are \"deponent\", that is to say, they have no corresponding active form. Other middle verbs, such as () \"I cease (doing something)\" (intransitive), have a corresponding active form: () \"I stop (something)\" (transitive).\n\nPassive verbs, in the present, imperfect, and perfect tenses, have exactly the same endings as middle verbs. Examples are () \"I am pursued\" and () \"I am ordered (by someone)\".\n\nIn the aorist tense, however, they differ from middle verbs in that they use the endings (), (), or (), for example () \"I was pursued\", () \"I was ordered\", () \"I was harmed\"; whereas middle verbs tend to have an aorist ending in (), (), or (), for example () \"I stopped\", () \"I answered\", () \"I became\".\n\nA special class of thematic verbs are the contracted verbs. In the dictionary these are entered as ending (), () or (), for example () \"I see\", () \"I do\", () \"I show\"; but in most cases when they are found in a text the vowel () contracts with the ending to make a single vowel. Thus the present tense of () \"I see\" goes as follows:\n\nWhile the present tense of () \"I do\" is as follows:\n\nAnd the present tense of () \"I show\" is as follows:\n\nThe present infinitive active of the three types of contracted verbs is () \"to see\", (), \"to do\", () \"to show\".\n\nContracted verbs are also found in the middle and passive voices, e.g. () \"I arrive\" and () \"I am honoured\".\n\nAthematic verbs have () in the 1st person singular of the present tense, e.g. () \"I am\", () \"I say\", () \"I give\", () \"I stand (transitive)\". In the middle voice they end in e.g. () \"I am able\". The present tense of () \"I (will) go\" is generally used with future meaning in the classical period.\n\nThese verbs present many irregularities in conjugation. For example, the present tense of () \"I am\" goes as follows:\n\nThe present tense of the verb () \"I (will) go\" is as follows:\n\nWhereas the present tense of () \"I give\" goes as follows:\n\nThe dual of this verb, theoretically (), is not found.\n\nThe active infinitive of athematic verbs ends in (), e.g. () \"to be\", () \"to go\", () \"to give\".\n\nAthematic verbs are also found in the middle voice, e.g. () \"I stand\" or () \"I am able\", with endings as follows:\n\nThe infinitive is ().\n\nThe verb () \"I know\", is irregular. Its endings are those of an athematic perfect tense, and go as follows:\n\nThe infinitive of () is () \"to know\".\n\nThe Ancient Greek verbal system has seven tense-aspect forms, traditionally called \"tenses\" (, , singular , ). The temporal distinctions only appear in the indicative mood as shown on the table below:\nIn the subjunctive and imperative moods, however, only three tenses are used, and they distinguish aspect only, not time:\nThe optative mood likewise uses these three tenses, but there is also a future optative, used mainly to report indirectly what would be a future indicative in direct speech.\n\nAncient Greek has no perfect progressive or past perfect progressive. Thus, the meaning \"he has been doing\" is typically expressed with the present tense, and \"he had been doing (earlier)\" is expressed with the imperfect tense:\n\nFor further information on the endings, see Ancient Greek grammar (tables).\n\nDictionaries of Ancient Greek usually give six principal parts for any verb. For example, for the verb () \"I teach, train\" the six parts are as follows:\n\nThe principal parts are these:\n\nOther tenses can be formed on the basis of these. For example, the imperfect tense () \"I was teaching\" is based on the present stem with the addition of the prefix () (called an \"augment\", see below), and the pluperfect () \"I had taught\" is formed from the perfect stem:\n\nNot all verbs have a future tense made with (). Some, particularly those whose stem ends in () such as () \"I announce\" and () \"I remain\", have a contracted future, with endings like the verb (). These same verbs also usually have an aorist without sigma:\n\nSome common verbs, instead of the ordinary (weak) aorist tense ending in , have an aorist ending in etc. exactly like the imperfect; this is known as a \"strong\" aorist or \"2nd\" aorist. However, it differs from the imperfect in that the stem of the verb is different. Thus the aorist of () \"I flee\" is () \"I fled\", with stem (), contrasting with the imperfect (), with stem ().\n\nOther strong aorists are () \"I came\", () \"I took\", () \"I said\", () \"I ate\"; and in the middle voice () \"I became\" and () \"I arrived\".\n\nMany verbs have an aorist without the sigma markers and characteristic endings of the regular aorist. Typically these verbs have present progressive markers added to the stem in the present system, so that the basic stem is used in the aorist and in the other aspects. One example is the verb (), \"I go\", which becomes ().\n\nHowever, by no means all Ancient Greek verbs are so regular in their principal parts as (). For example, the verb () \"I take\" has the following parts:\n\nAs can be seen, the stems used () () etc. vary from tense to tense. They all come from the same root, but the stem used in the present tense, (), has an extra () and (); in the other tenses the vowel in the root varies between () and (); and the final consonant, , changes by assimilation to () or (), or by aspiration to ().\n\nThe verb () () \"I lead\" goes:\n\nBoth of the above verbs have a \"strong aorist\" or \"2nd aorist\" ending in () rather than the usual (), and the perfect tense has an aspirated consonant () before the ending instead of ().\n\nThe tenses of () \"I give\" are as follows:\n\nThe aorist of this verb is irregular, since it ends in (). However, this () is found only in the singular, and disappears in the plural, e.g. 3rd () \"they gave\". The verbs () \"I put\" and () \"I send\" are similar, with aorists () 3rd () and () 3rd () respectively.\n\nHowever, () \"I stand (something)\" does not follow this pattern and has a different aorist:\n\nIn some verbs the principal parts are even more irregular than this, and like the English verb \"go, went, been/gone\", use different verbs for making different tenses. For example, the verb () \"I bring, I bear\" has the following principal parts using the stems of three different verbs:\n\nThis verb is made more complex by the fact that in Attic Greek (that is, the dialect of most of the major classical authors), the present tense (apart from the indicative mood), imperfect tense, and future are usually replaced by parts of the irregular verb () \"I (will) go\": The indicative of () is generally used with future significance in the classical period (\"I will go\") but the other parts such as the infinitive () \"to go\" are not future in meaning.\n\nThe three past tenses (imperfect, aorist, and pluperfect), in the classical period, are made by adding a prefix (\"e-\"), called an \"augment\", on the beginning of the verb. Thus from () \"I write\" are made:\n\nThis past-tense augment is found only in the indicative mood, not in the subjunctive, infinitive, participle, or other parts of the verb.\n\nWhen a verb starts with a vowel, the augment usually merges with the vowel to make a long vowel. Thus + > /ē/, + > /ē/ (sometimes ), + > /ī/, + > /ō/ and so on:\n\nWhen a verb starts with a prepositional prefix, the augment usually goes after the prefix (although there are some verbs where it goes before the prefix, or even in both places):\n\nIn Homer, and occasionally in Herodotus, the augment is sometimes omitted.\n\nThe perfect tense is formed by repeating the first consonant of the stem with the vowel (). This is known as \"reduplication\":\n\nWhen the first consonant of the verb is aspirated () (), the reduplication is made with the equivalent unaspirated consonant () ():\n\nWhen the verb starts with a vowel, () or with a combination of consonants such as () or (), instead of reduplication an augment is used:\n\nMore complex kinds of reduplication are found in:\n\nUnlike the past-tense augment, this reduplication or perfect-tense augment is found in every part of the perfect tense, including the infinitive and participles.\n\nThe meanings of the tenses are as follows:\nThe present tense (Greek () \"standing within\") can be imperfective or perfective, and be translated \"I do (now)\", \"I do (regularly)\", \"I am doing (now)\":\n\nThe present tense is frequently used in historical narrative, especially to describe exciting moments:\n\nThe imperfect tense (Greek () \"for prolonging\", from () \"prolong\") is used in the indicative mood only. It often indicates a continuing situation in the past, rather than an event. It can be translated as \"was doing\", \"used to do\", \"would do\", etc., referring to either a progressive, habitual, or continual situation:\n\nOften \"began doing\" is a possible translation:\n\nAs noted above, the imperfect can also mean \"had been doing\", referring to a situation which existed earlier than the time of the main verb:\n\nHowever, although the imperfect usually describes a situation, it is often used in narrative where English would use a simple past, especially with verbs meaning \"send\", \"go\", \"say\", and \"order\":\n\nThe distinction between imperfect and aorist in the above examples can be seen not so much in terms of perfectivity vs. imperfectivity, as in terms of telicity vs. atelicity. The aorist () would mean \"we finished dinner\" and would be a telic verb, implying that the action was carried through to its end, whereas the imperfect () would mean \"we began eating dinner\" and would be atelic, implying that the action was started but not necessarily completed. Similarly the aorist () means \"I successfully persuaded\", whereas the imperfect () means \"I urged\" or \"I attempted to persuade\":\n\nAnother meaning of the imperfect indicative is to refer to unreal (counterfactual) situations in present or past time. To give the meaning \"would\", the particle () is added:\n\nThe future tense (Greek () \"going to be\") describes an event or a state of affairs that will happen in the future. For example, it can be something promised or predicted:\n\nIt can also be used after () for strong commands and prohibitions:\n\nThe aorist tense (Greek () \"unbounded\" or \"indefinite\") describes a finished action in the past.\n\nOften in narrative it is found mixed with present and imperfect tenses:\n\nOften an aorist is equivalent to an English pluperfect tense, for example after () \"when\" or in relative clauses in sentences such as the following:\n\nAnother meaning of the aorist indicative is to refer to unreal (counterfactual) events in past time. To give the meaning \"would\", the particle () is added:\n\nThe perfect tense (Greek () \"lying nearby\"), much as the English perfect tense, often describes a recent event of which the present result is important:\n\nIt can also, like the English perfect, be used experientially, of something that has often or always happened in the past:\n\nIn some verbs the perfect tense can be translated by a present tense in English, e.g. () \"I remember\", () \"I am standing\"/\"I stand\", () \"I possess\", () \"I know\":\n\nThe pluperfect tense (Greek () \"more than completed\"), like the Imperfect, is used only in the indicative mood. It refers to a situation that existed due to events that had taken place at an earlier time:\n\nHowever, the pluperfect is much less frequently used in Greek than in English, since after conjunctions such as () \"when\", usually the aorist is used:\n\nThe future perfect tense (Greek () \"going to be completed\") is rarely used. In the active voice only two verbs ( () \"I will be dead\" and () \"I will be standing\") have a separate form for the future perfect tense, though a compound (\"periphrastic\") tense can be made with a perfect participle, e.g () \"he is going to have realised\"; but even this is extremely rare. It is more common in the passive. It describes a future state that will result from a finished action:\n\nThere are four moods ( \"bendings\" or \"leanings\"):\n\n(Greek \"for defining\", from \"I define\").\n\nThe indicative is the form of the verb used for ordinary statements of fact:\n\nTo make the negative of the indicative, () or, before a vowel, () is added before the verb:\n\nThe imperfect and aorist indicative can also sometimes refer to unreal (counterfactual) situations in present or past time (\"would be doing\", \"should be doing\", \"would have done\" etc.). (For further examples see above.)\n\n(Greek \"for arranging underneath\", from \"I arrange underneath\").\n\nThe subjunctive generally has the letters () or () in the ending.\n\nIt is often used when the meaning is \"may\", for example in purpose clauses, especially those referring to present or future time:\n\nThe above example uses the present subjunctive, but the aorist subjunctive is equally correct, with a slightly different shade of meaning:\n\nAnother very common use of the subjunctive is in indefinite subordinate clauses following a conjunction such as () \"if (it may be that)\", () \"whenever\", () \"whoever\", () \"until such time as\" etc., referring to present or future time. When used with the subjunctive, such conjunctions are always joined with the particle ἄν (\"an\"):\n\nThe subjunctive can also be used of something that it is suggested \"should\" happen, for example in exhortations, deliberative questions, and negative commands such as the following:\n\nThe negative of the subjunctive, as in the above example, is μὴ (\"mē\").\n\n(Greek: \"for wishing\", from \"I wish\").\n\nThe optative mood can generally be recognised because it has the letters οι (\"oi\"), αι (\"ai\") or ει (\"ei\") in the ending.\n\nOne use of the optative mood is in conditional sentences referring to a hypothetical situation in the future. The particle ἄν (\"an\") is added in the main clause to give the meaning \"would\":\n\nHowever, the optative mood is not used in sentences referring to a hypothetical situation in the present or past; in such sentences the optative is replaced by the imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect indicative, with (\"an\") in the main clause.\n\nThe optative mood is also used in reported speech in past time:\n\nJust as the subjunctive is used after a conjunction meaning \"whenever\", \"until such time as\" etc. referring to present or future time, so the optative can be used in similar clauses referring to repeated events in past time. However, in this case the particle ἄν (\"an\") is not added to the conjunction:\n\nThe optative can also be used for wishes:\n\nThe optative can also be used in purpose clauses in past time, and after verbs of fearing in past time:\n\nHowever, some authors, such as Herodotus and Thucydides, prefer to use the subjunctive in such clauses.\n\n(Greek: \"for commanding\", from \"I command\").\n\nThe present imperative is used for general commands:\n\nThe aorist imperative is used when the speaker wishes something done at once:\n\nIt is also possible in Greek to have a 3rd person imperative, as in the following examples:\n\nThe imperative mood can also be used in the perfect tense, as the following example shows:\n\n(Greek: \"aparémphatos\" \"not indicated\").\n\nThe infinitive is found in all three voices, and in the present, aorist, future, and perfect tenses. The four infinitives of the active voice of the verb λύω (\"lúō\") \"I free\" are as follows:\n\nMany commonly used verbs, instead of an aorist infinitive in (\"-sai\"), have one ending in (\"-eîn\") (with a circumflex accent) instead. This is called the \"strong aorist\" or \"2nd aorist\":\n\nRoot aorists take a different infinitive:\n\nContracting verbs have a present infinitive ending in (\"-ân\"), (\"-eîn\") or (\"-oûn\"):\n\nVerbs ending in -μι (\"-mi\"), such as (\"dídōmi\") \"I give\", have present and aorist infinitives which end in (\"-nai\"):\n\nThe irregular verb (\"oîda\") \"I know\" also has an infinitive ending in (\"-nai\"):\n\nThe infinitive is often used after verbs with meanings such as \"he wanted\", \"he ordered\", \"he tried\", \"it is necessary\", \"he is able\" etc. much as in English:\n\nIt can also be used for indirect speech after certain verbs such as ( ) \"I say\" or () \"I think\". The subject of the infinitive, if it is different from the subject of the main verb, is put in the accusative case. When the statement is negative, the word (\"ou\") \"not\" goes in front of ().\n\nIn Greek an infinitive is also often used with the neuter definite article in various constructions. In this case it is similar in meaning to the English verbal noun in \"-ing\":\n\nParticiples were given the name \"metokhḗ\" \"sharing\" by Greek grammarians, because they share the characteristics of both adjectives and verbs. Like adjectives, they have gender, case, and number and agree with the nouns that they modify, and, like verbs, they have tense and voice.\n\nParticiples exist for all three voices in the present, aorist, future, and perfect tenses. Typical endings for the , , and are as follows:\n\nActive:\n\nMiddle and Passive:\n\nParticiples are very frequently used in Greek. For example, in the following sentence from Plato's \"Phaedo\" there are six participles:\n\nThis example is analysed in the paragraphs below.\n\nAn aorist participle, such as () \"after going out\", usually refers to an action which preceded the time of the main verb:\n\nA present participle, such as () \"leading\", is used to refer to an action which is taking place simultaneously with the main verb:\n\nA perfect participle, such as () \"pounded\", generally refers to the state that something is in as a result of an earlier action, e.g. \"fallen\", \"dead\", \"broken\" etc., rather than to the action itself:\n\nA future participle refers to an action which is to take place after the time of the main verb, and is often used to indicate purpose:\n\nBecause it is an adjective as well as a verb, a participle has to agree in case, gender, and number with the noun it refers to. Thus in the first example above:\n\nA participle frequently describes the circumstances in which another action took place. Often it is translated with \"-ing\", e.g. () \"leading\" in the example above.\n\nIn some sentences it can be translated with a clause beginning \"when\" or \"since\":\n\nAnother frequent use is in a construction known as the \"genitive absolute\", when the participle and its subject are placed in the genitive case. This construction is used when the participle refers to someone or something who is not the subject, object, or indirect object of the main verb:\n\nBut if the verb is an impersonal one, it is put in the accusative, e.g. () \"it being possible\".\n\nSometimes a participle is used with the article, in which case it can often be translated with \"who\":\n\nAs well as being used in sentences such as the above, the participle can be used following verbs with meanings such as \"I know\", \"I notice\", \"I happen (to be)\", \"I hear (that)\" and so on. This use is known as the \"supplementary\" participle.\n\nThe Ancient Greek grammar has three voices. The middle and the passive voice are the same except in the future and aorists.\n\nAn active voice verb is any verb which has the endings of the -ω or -μι verbs described above. It can be intransitive, transitive or reflexive (but intransitive is most common):\n\nIn addition to the active endings ( \"-ō\" and \"-mi\") described above, many verbs also have a set of endings in (\"-omai\") or (\"-mai\") which can be either passive or non-passive in meaning. When the meaning of such a verb is not passive, it is known as a \"middle voice\" verb.\n\nMiddle voice verbs are usually intransitive, but can also be transitive. Often the middle endings make a transitive verb intransitive:\n\nSometimes there is a reflexive meaning or an idea of doing something for one's own benefit:\n\nSometimes there can be a reciprocal meaning:\n\nQuite a number of verbs which are active in the present tense become middle in the future tense, e.g.:\n\nA number of common verbs ending in () or ( ) have no active-voice counterpart. These are known as \"deponent\" verbs.\n\nDeponent middle verbs include verbs such as the following:\n\nSome middle deponent verbs have a weak aorist tense formed with (), e.g. (), but frequently they have a strong aorist middle such as () \"I arrived\" or ( ) \"I became\". ( () \"I come\" is irregular in that it uses a strong aorist active ( ) \"I came\" as its aorist tense.)\n\nAll the above, since they have an aorist in the middle voice, are known as middle deponents. There are also deponent passive verbs with aorists in (), such as the following:\n\nSome examples of deponent verbs in use are the following:\n\nOccasionally a verb ending in (\"-omai\") has a clear passive sense. If so, it is said to be in the passive voice:\n\nUsually when used passively, (\"-omai\") verbs have an aorist tense containing (\"-thē-\") in the ending:\n\nOccasionally, an aorist passive can have an ending with -η- (\"-ē-\"). This is known as the 2nd aorist or strong aorist passive, and uses a different verb-stem from the present. In the example below, the stem is instead of the present stem :\n\nDeponent middle verbs can also be made passive in some tenses. Thus αἱρέομαι (\"hairéomai\") \"I choose\" has an aorist passive ᾑρέθην (\"hēiréthēn\") \"I was chosen\":\n\nThe endings with -θη- (\"-thē-\") and -η- (\"-ē-\") were originally intransitive actives rather than passives and sometimes have an intransitive meaning even in Classical Greek. For example, ἐσώθην (\"esṓthē\") (from \"sōízō\" \"I save\") often means \"I got back safely\" rather than \"I was saved\":\n\n"}

He was born in Figueres on May 16, 1902. In Figueres' high school, he met Salvador Dalí, starting a friendship that would last all their lives.\n\nFages de Climent contributed to the literary mythification of his native region, taking the Empordà, the northern wind, the tramuntana and its people as a thematic basis of a multiple literary production (poetry, prose, theater and journalism). Thus, he created literary characters like the Cobbler of Ordis – comparable, according to Eugeni d'Ors to Don Quixote of Cervantes. He also contributed in a decisive way to conferring determinate attributions to certain villages of the Empordà like (Llers, land of witches; or Vila-sacra, capital of the world).\n\nHe collaborated several times with his friend and schoolmate Salvador Dalí, who, in 1924, being still almost unknown painter, illustrated a book for the first time. It was Fages' poem, in Catalan language \"Les bruixes de Llers (The Witches of Llers)\". He illustrated as well another book of Fages de Climent, \"La balada del Sabater d'Ordis (The Balad of the Cobbler of Ordis)\" (1954), writing also the epilogue. They finally worked together at the occasion of the homage that the city of Figueres paid, in 1961, to Salvador Dalí. They made an auca – a series of pictures with captions in rhyming couplets which tell a story – entitled in Catalan language \"El triomf i el rodolí de la Gala i en Dalí\" (\"The triumph and the couplet of Gala and Dalí\"). Fages put the verses and Dalí the drawings. The text is a poetic biography of the painter and the ilustracions provide a brilliant synthesis of all the Dalinian symbology. Thus, the soft watches, the ants, the Angelus of Millet, the shoemaker of Ordis, and some of the main Dalinian referents, like Picasso or Gaudí.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning Dalí's paintwork \"Christ of the Tramontana\", held in the Dalí Theatre and Museum – carried out by Salvador Dalí in homage to Fages de Climent on the occasion of his death, and that makes allusion to one of the most popular verses of Fages de Climent, \"The Prayer to the Christ of the Tramuntana\".\n\n"}

The letters that the ring rolled across and the one on which it halted were then consulted to form the answer to the question being divined.

{"id": "17846131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17846131", "title": "Echographies of Television", "text": "Echographies of Television\n\nEchographies of Television: Filmed Interviews () is a book by Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler. It was originally published in France in 1996, by Éditions Galilée. The English translation by Jennifer Bajorek was published by Polity Press in 2002.\n\n\"Echographies of Television\" discusses a number of subjects, but the overall theme concerns the impact of technological acceleration, and in particular the social, political and philosophical significance of the development of digital media.\n\nThe book consists of three parts.\n\nIn \"Artifactualities,\" Derrida begins by stating that \"to think one's time\" means, more than ever, thinking how this \"time\" is artificially produced, an artifact. He argues that \"actuality\" is always a matter of \"artifactuality,\" involving selection, editing, performativity, and thus amounting to a \"fictional fashioning\". Derrida therefore argues that we must develop a \"critical culture\" concerning this production of actuality, but he immediately appends three cautions to this statement:\nWhat is least acceptable in the media today, he argues, is to take one's time, or to waste time, and hence what is perhaps most required is to effect a change in the \"rhythm\" of the media.\n\nDerrida then asks what it means to be concerned with the present, or to do so as a philosopher. It may be a matter, he notes, of in fact being \"un\"timely, of \"not\" confusing the present with actuality. One must, on the one hand, take one's time, hold back, defer, while, on the other hand, one must rush into things headlong, urgently—one must be both hyperactual and anachronistic. Derrida has never thought there to be an opposition between urgency and \"différance\". If \"différance\" involves a relation to alterity which is a form of deferral, it is nevertheless also, and for this reason, a relation to \"what comes,\" to the unexpected, to the event as such, and therefore to the urgent. We cannot oppose the event, which is the very possibility of a future—we only oppose those particular events which bring things which are not good. The performativity of the event exceeds all anticipation or programming, and hence contains an irreducible element of messianism, linking it to justice (here distinguished from law), as well as to revolution.\n\nBetween the most general logics and the most unpredictable singularities comes \"rhythm\". If, for example, we could know in advance that the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe were doomed to failure, the pace and rhythm at which this occurred could only be understood retrospectively, taking into account causalities which had been previously overlooked, such as the way in which the fall of the Berlin Wall was immediately inscribed in a global telecommunications network.\n\nPolitics must retain a sense of the unanticipated, of the arrival of the absolutely unexpected, the absolute \"arrivant\". A politics which loses all reference to a principle of unconditional hospitality is a politics, Derrida argues, that loses its reference to justice. This may mean, for example, that it is necessary to distinguish a politics of immigration from a politics of the right to asylum, because the former presumes the equivalence of the political and the national (immigration policy is a matter for the nation-state), while the latter does not (since, for example, motives for immigration, such as unemployment, may fail to conform to immigration requirements, but nevertheless are a kind of dysfunction of the nation, if not indeed the indirect result on poor countries of decisions made by wealthy countries). On this basis, Derrida provides a critique of the way in which borders are conceived by Jean-Marie Le Pen and the French National Front.\n\nIt remains necessary, Derrida argues, to take up the battle fought by Enlightenment philosophy against the \"return of the worst\". As a struggle against return, it is a matter of a \"law of the spectral,\" of spectres, ghosts, and phantoms. It is a matter of understanding that what comes back is on the one hand what must be fought against, and on the other hand irreducible, originary, and necessary. Thus when we are striving to remember the worst (for example, the complicity of the French state for the treatment of Jews during World War II), we are striving to recall the victims, but this means also to call them \"back\", not just for the sake of a present, but for an \"ongoing\" struggle, and thus for a future.\n\nAll this is a question of spirit and of inheritance. There is more than one spirit, and thus when we speak of spirit, we \"choose\" one spirit over another, affirm one injunction or interpretation over another, and thus take up a responsibility. To inherit is to reaffirm an injunction, but to take it up as an assignation to be deciphered. In so doing, we are what we inherit. We must decide, and we can only decide, on the basis of what we inherit, but these decisions are also the transformation of what we inherit, and therefore always also involve invention.\n\nDerrida concludes by stating that he does not believe in the return of Communism in the form of the party, yet he does believe in the return of critiques which are Marxist in inspiration and spirit. This new International without party, which does not accept the imposition of a new world order, must be more, Derrida argues, than a matter of being able to take the time to read Marx slowly and carefully, now that \"Marx is dead\". In this sense, it is a question of more than simply the elaboration of critiques.\n\nIn \"Echographies of Television,\" Stiegler begins by noting that Derrida, in agreeing to record their interview, asked for a \"right of inspection\". He asks Derrida why he did so, and what this would mean in the era of television and \"teletechnologies\". Derrida responds that if he did so, he did not imagine such a right would be effective, and that it is difficult for intellectuals to adapt to the conditions of television, even if they must also not cut themselves off from a public sphere dominated by that medium. It may be a matter not of fighting today against teletechnologies but rather so that they are able to make more room for different norms, those of intellectuals, artists, scientists, etc. Today the \"right to inspection\" belongs, more than to anyone else, to those who show, edit, store, interpret and exploit images.\n\nStiegler points out that we learn from reading Derrida himself that writing is already a kind of teletechnology, and he therefore asks Derrida about the specificity of these more contemporary teletechnologies, especially television. Rather than immediately answering the question directly, Derrida first states that the answer \"cannot\" be a matter of opposing contemporary prostheses to some prior epoch of immediate or natural speech. If there \"is\" a specificity of modern teletechnology, then it has something to do with the directness of \"live\" recording and transmission, and the speed with which what is recorded can be made to travel the farthest distances. Nevertheless, however, we must also recognise that even the most \"live\" broadcasts are \"produced\".\n\nStiegler asks Derrida about his term, \"artifactuality,\" which indicates that the construction of \"actuality\" passes through the artifact or the artificial, that it involves a selection. Stiegler suggests that what is important about this is not so much that reality is \"artificially\" constructed on the basis of a selection, but rather what matters are the \"criteria\" of selection. He therefore asks Derrida if the problem today is that the selection criteria are overdetermined by the \"commercial character of industry,\" and thus if when Derrida speaks of a \"politics of memory,\" he is talking about regulating the effects of market pressure on the construction of actuality. Derrida responds by indicating that the concept of the market is complicated: the market cannot be opposed to state practice, insofar as, for example, public television channels, as soon as they are in competition with private channels, must themselves \"conquer the market,\" becoming concerned with ratings, etc. To address Stiegler's question would mean, Derrida says, knowing what one means by the market in a world in which there is an increasingly \"globalised\" circulation of televisual commodities.\n\n\"The Discrete Image\" is an essay by Stiegler about the significance of the invention of digital photography and digital cinema. He begins by stating that \"the image in general\" does not exist. The mental image (the image I see in my mind) cannot be separated from the image-object (a painting, photograph, etc.), and the latter is always inscribed in a technical history. Just as Derrida showed that there is no transcendental signified (no meaning) which can be shown to precede its inscription in a signifier, so too there is no \"transcendental imagery\" which precedes the image-object. If the mental image and the image-object cannot be opposed, however, they are nevertheless different, first of all because the image-object lasts while the mental image is ephemeral. But if there has never been an image-object without a mental image, even so, there has never been a mental image which is not, in some way, the \"return\" of an image-object.\n\nStiegler identifies three stages in the recent history of the image object:\nThis third stage is part of a \"systematic discretization of movement,\" a process of \"grammatisation of the visible\".\n\nGreat moments of technical innovation \"suspend\" a situation which previously appeared stable, and impose a new situation. Analogico-digital technology is one such moment, in which what is undergoing an intense evolution are the conditions by which we perceive and, therefore, the conditions by which we believe. This is because the digital photograph suspends a certain spontaneous belief which the analog photograph bore within itself: it calls into question what Roland Barthes called the \"this was\" of the photograph, its intentionality (in a phenomenological sense). Although it is possible to manipulate the analog photo, this is as it were an \"accidental\" possibility, whereas manipulation is the \"essence\" of the digital photo.\n\nNevertheless, the \"accidental\" possibility of manipulating the \"analog\" image is something which had already been increasingly undertaken by the mass media in recent years. The ability to do so derives from the fact that even the analog photo is a technical synthesis, and as such exposed to an irreducible potential for falsification. For this falsification to be effective, there must be an alteration of what was, but there must also be a \"belief\" on the part of the viewer in the \"this was\" of the photo. Today, however, with the analogico-digital photo, the conditions of this belief are diminished, leading to a general \"doubt\", and one which affects, for example, democracy. This doubt must be doubled by another doubt, a positive, resolute doubt leading to new forms of \"objective analysis\" and \"subjective synthesis,\" and therefore to a new kind of belief and of disbelief. The doubt and fear caused by the analogico-digital image is therefore \"also\" what would make possible this more \"knowing\" belief.\n\nThe destabilisation of knowledge caused by digitalisation may induce fear, but analog photography also caused people to be afraid: \"in the first photographs, we saw phantoms\". Analog photography is the result of a \"contiguity of luminances,\" that is, light reflecting from an object strikes photosensitive film, which is then developed with the use of light, producing a photograph which I see when light reflects from the photograph onto my retina. There is a definite chain of light events, connecting the moment the camera records an image and the moment the developed photograph is seen. This is, in a way, a matter of the past touching me in the present, of something coming to touch me from out of the night of the past. With the digital photo, this chain is broken, or decomposed: there is a \"treatment\" involved in the production of the digital image, reducing the image to binary code to be manipulated and adjusted, which does not require this contiguity of luminances.\n\nDigitalisation is a form of \"discretisation\": whereas the analog photo relies on the \"continuity\" of the chain of luminances, and the continuity of the way in which the spectrum is recorded, these two aspects become, in the digital photo, \"discontinuous\". Reducing the image to binary code means breaking the spectrum down into discontinuous elements which can be treated in any way whatsoever. Yet the analogico-digital photo does retain \"something\" of the chain of light events which characterised the analog photo: insofar as it remains a \"photo\". At the same time, however, there is no way for the viewer to \"know\" what aspects of the photo are actual records of a photographic event, and which parts have been altered, added, or subtracted, in a way completely disconnected from the photographic process.\n\nExtending the analysis conducted by Walter Benjamin, Stiegler delineates three kinds of reproducibility which constitute three great epochs of memory:\nThe difference between the analog and the digital has traditionally been understood in terms of an opposition between the continuous and the discontinuous. The fact that the image has been understood as continuous in this sense is why it has been thought to resist semiological interpretation, which depends on the discreteness of the sign. But with the advent of the analogico-digital image, combining two kinds of reproducibility, it becomes clear that the image was always in a way discrete.\n\nThe production and realisation of images by an artist or filmmaker is a form of analysis, which treats images as discrete elements to be edited and assembled. The work of the spectator who puts this together in imagination as a \"continuous\" whole is a form of synthesis. That we experience the progression of images in film as a continuous movement is less the result of retinal persistence than it is of the spectator's \"expectations\", which work to efface the editing. These expectations are always a question of the return of phantoms from the past: animation is always reanimation. Thus if the image is always discrete, it is so, as it were, discreetly, without drawing attention. But with digital technology it becomes possible not only to produce cinematic or televisual works in a new way, but to analyse and therefore interpret these in a new way—for example, to index images, camera movements, voices, etc.\n\nIn other words, digitisation \"opens the possibility of new knowledges of the image\". Discretising the continuous makes it possible to decompose the \"this was\", and thus the spectator may come to have not only a synthetic but an analytic relation to the image. That this is possible is because the synthesis we make in our minds when we view an image happens according to conditions related to the technical synthesis effected by the recording apparatus. To view an image is to engage with that technical synthesis, and implies a kind of knowledge of the apparatus by the spectator that determines the conditions of the experience of spectatorship. So a change in the technical conditions of reproducibility will mean a mutation in the way in which a spectator synthesises an image. To each of the epochs of reproducibility corresponds three different kinds of \"belief\". The fact that digitalisation makes very possible the representation of things which were never in front of a lens changes the conditions of belief, specifically the belief that photography is a matter of the return of the past in the present. As such, analogico-digital photography possesses a different spirit than previous photographic technology, because what the spectator \"knows\" about the image is that it has an uncertain relation to \"reality\": there is an irreducible non-knowledge inscribed in the spectator's knowledge.\n\nChanges to the \"analytic\" capacities of the spectator inevitably produce changes in the way the spectator \"intentionalises\" imagery, that is, changes in spectatorial \"synthesis\". This is similar to the way in which the alphabetisation of writing produced changes in the synthesis of language. It is the history and evolution of \"writing\" that made possible the critical and logical spirit which we attribute to language, and which we have until now \"not\" attributed to the apprehension of the image. Grammar claims to locate the rules of language, but as every language is always undergoing a process of becoming, and is never anything other than the sum of the \"use\" of that language by speakers, these grammatical rules can never be a matter of a \"competence\" which precedes those rules brought forth and invented in the course of linguistic \"performance\". What this means for the analogico-digital image is that, as increasing analytical possibilities emerge from the technologies of the image, the descriptions and rules which emerge from these possibilities will at the same time mean the \"transformation\" of what is being described. The question is to know how to take advantage of these opportunities for transformation which will emerge from technological advances.\n\nIn other words, \"the \"evolution of the technical synthesis\" implies the \"evolution of the spectatorial synthesis\"\". As Derrida showed in relation to the sign, language is always already writing, a system of traces, composed of discrete elements. Stiegler proposes a similar hypothesis in relation to the image: \"life (\"anima\" – on the side of the mental image) is always \"already\" cinema (animation – image-object)\". Thus the evolution of \"both\" forms of synthesis, technical and spectatorial, occurs as one \"composed\" process, in what \"Gilbert Simondon\" calls a \"transductive relation\". The massive changes which will follow from digitisation are a chance to develop a \"culture of reception\". This is in contrast to the way in which Hollywood has taken up these changes: by \"opposing\" production and consumption, keeping analysis in the hands of the producers, and synthesis a matter for consumers. Changing this relation means creating a situation more like that of literature: one cannot read a work of literature without, in a sense, knowing how to write. A world in which the spectator will see the image analytically will also be a world in which \"television\" and \"text\" are no longer opposed.\n\n"}

The word \"glossophobia\" derives from the Greek γλῶσσα \"glōssa\", meaning tongue, and φόβος \"phobos\", fear or dread. Some people have this specific phobia, while others may also have broader social phobia or social anxiety disorder.\n\nStage fright may be a symptom of glossophobia.\n\nSymptoms include:\nThe more specific symptoms of speech anxiety can be grouped into three categories: physical, verbal, and non-verbal. Physical symptoms result from the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responding to the situation with a \"fight-or-flight\" reaction. \n\nDuring the phobic response, adrenaline secretion produces a wide array of symptoms which enhances the \"fight or flight\" response. As Garcia-Lopez (2013) has noted, symptoms can include acute hearing, increased heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, increased perspiration and oxygen intake, stiffening of neck/upper back muscles, and dry mouth. Uncontrollable shaking is also common and often occurs prior to the phobia-eliciting stimulus. Symptoms may sometimes be alleviated or mitigated by medications such as beta-blockers.\n\nVerbal symptoms of the fight or flight response include (but are not limited to) a tense or quivering voice, and vocalized pauses (which tend to comfort anxious speakers). One form of speech anxiety is dysfunctional speech anxiety in which the intensity of the fight-or-flight response prevents an individual from performing effectively.\n\nMany people report stress-fueled speech disorders which are only present during public speech. Some individuals with glossophobia have been able to dance, perform in public, or even to speak (such as in a play), or sing if they cannot see the audience, or if they feel that they are presenting a character or stage persona other than themselves. Being able to blend in a group (as in a choir or band) has been reported to also alleviate some anxiety caused by glossophobia.\n\nIt has been estimated that 75% of all people experience some degree of anxiety/nervousness when it comes to public speaking. If untreated, public speaking anxiety can lead to serious detrimental effects on one's quality of life, career goals and other areas. For example, educational goals requiring public speaking might be left unaccomplished. However, not all persons with public speaking anxiety are necessarily unable to achieve work goals, though this disorder becomes problematic when it prevents an individual from attaining or pursuing a goal they might otherwise have – were it not for their anxiety.\n\nA recent study conducted by Garcia-Lopez, Diez-Bedmar, and Almansa-Moreno (2013) has reported that previously trained students could act as trainers to other students and help them to improve their public speaking skills.\n\nTraining courses in public speaking and/or organizations such as Australian Rostrum, Toastmasters International, POWERtalk International, and Association of Speakers Clubs can help people to reduce their fear of public speaking to manageable levels. Self-help materials that address public speaking are among the best selling self-help topics. To temporarily treat their phobia, some affected people have turned to certain types of medications, typically beta blockers.\n\nIn some cases, anxiety can be mitigated by a speaker not attempting to resist their anxiety, thus fortifying the anxiety/fight-or-flight loop. Other strategies involve using one's nervousness to enliven an otherwise fearful speech presentation.\nA speaker's anxiety can also be reduced if they know their topic well and believe in it. It has been suggested that people should practice speaking in front of smaller, less intimidating groups when they're getting started in public speaking. Additionally, focusing on friendly, attentive people in the audience has been found to help. \n\nTraditional advice has been to urge fearful speakers not to take themselves too seriously, and to be reminded that mistakes are often unnoticed by audiences. Gaining experience in public speaking often results in it becoming less anxiety-provoking over time. Recent studies suggest that there is a close link between fear of public speaking and self-efficacy and that attempts to help presenters improve their self-efficacy will also reduce this fear.\n\nLoosening up a \"tough crowd\" by asking questions promotes audience participation. A speaker may also find this exercise to be helpful when their mind \"goes blank\", as it gives them time to regain their train of thought.\n\nThe causes of glossophobia may vary. Often, it can be linked to traumatic experiences, or fearful events occurring during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in which the speaker endured a traumatic childhood experience related to the public speaking. Genetics may also play a role, as might evolutionary factors. In addition, other key causes of this anxiety have been identified as the novelty of the experience, the characteristics of the audience, the illusion of transparency and the degree to which the speaker identifies public speaking as a performance as opposed to an act of communication.\n\nAn uncommon cause for glossophobia may come from a medical condition or a health concern. A serious brain injury can lead to different phobias, including glossophobia.\n\n\n"}

It is most closely related to Bezhta and Khwarshi, according to the latest research. Other Tsezic languages include Tsez and Hinukh. Khwarshi was previously grouped together with Tsez and Hinukh instead of with Hunzib.\n\nHunzib is not an official language, nor is it written. It is spoken in the Tsunta and Kizilyurt districts of Dagestan and in two villages across the Russian border in Georgia.\n\nVowels in Hunzib may be short, long, or nasalized.\n\nHunzib has 35 consonants. Three consonants, , , and , are only found in loanwords.\n\nLike a number of other Northeast Caucasian languages, Hunzib has a grammatical gender system with five classes. The first classes, I and II mark male and female rationals, respectively, while the remaining classes mark non-humans. Gender marking is covert on nouns, but appears in agreement on verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbial constructions.\n\nNouns in Hunzib come in five noun classes: male, female, and three classes for inanimate objects. There are a number of cases in Hunzib, including the absolutive, ergative, genitive, instrumental. A number of other case-like markers indicate direction and include dative, adessive, superessive, contactive, comitative and allative declensions. The following are taken from Helma van den Berg's \"A Grammar of Hunzib\".\n\nHunzib has four basic grammatical cases, the absolutive, ergative, genitive, and instrumental. The absolutive case is formed from the base stem, and the other cases are formed from the oblique stem.\n\nHunzib also has a series of local cases, where localizations are combined with directional suffixes. The dative and adessive cases have syntactic functions as well, but are morphologically local.\n\n\nCases other than the absolutive are formed by attaching the relevant case marker to an oblique stem, which is often the base stem plus some lexically determined extension.\n\nSome nouns (around 7%) do not use any extension and the oblique and base stems are identical. These words generally end in a vowel, like \"father\" [ɑbu], [ɑbu-s]. A small number of Hunzib nouns exhibit stem alternation, like \"moon\" [boo], [bɨə].\n\nMost verbs agree in class and number with the noun in the phrase that is in the absolutive case. As Hunzib has ergative alignment, that equals the subject of intransitive sentences and the direct object of transitive sentences.\n\nHunzib usually follows a subject–object–verb word order.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8075025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8075025", "title": "Indication (medicine)", "text": "Indication (medicine)\n\nIn medicine, an indication is a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery. There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication. An indication can commonly be confused with the term diagnosis. A diagnosis is a particular [medical] condition while an indication is a reason for use. The opposite of an indication is a contraindication, a reason to withhold a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits.\n\nIn the United States, medication indications are determined by the FDA and are grouped into either labeled indications, which are FDA-approved or off-label indications which are not approved. Currently in the US, including the indication or purpose of use for a drug is not required on prescription labels. However, manufacturers of prescription drugs are required to include an \"Indications and usage\" section on the prescribing information or package insert. \n\nMost countries and jurisdictions have a licensing body whose duty is to determine whether to approve a drug for a specific indication, based on the relative \"safety\" of the drug and its \"efficacy\" for the particular use. In the United States, indications for medications are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and are included in the package insert under the phrase \"Indications and Usage\". The European Medicines Agency (EMA) holds this responsibility for centrally authorized drugs in the European Union.\n\nIn the United States there are label indications and off-label indications\n\n\"Label indications:\"\n\nMedication that have label indications mean that they were approved by the FDA. This means that they are clinically significant for the indication and manufacturers are allowed to market their drug for the indication. A drug can have more than one FDA labeled indication, this means they can be used for multiple medical conditions. As the evidence and consensus for use of the drug increases and strengthens, its class of indication is improved. Preferred drugs (and other treatments) are also referred to a \"first line\" or \"primary\" while others are called \"second line\", \"third line\" etc. A drug may be indicated as an \"adjunct\" or \"adjuvant\", added to a first line drug.\n\n\"Off-label:\"\n\nOff-label indications are drugs that are used for medical indications that have not been approved by the FDA. Off label indications often have some clinical significance to back the use, but they have not gone through the extensive testing required by the FDA to have an official labeled indication. Drug companies can not provide any official medication information (e.g package inserts) for off label indications. \n\nThe purpose for adding FDA-approved indications in the United States is to ensure that healthcare providers can easily identify appropriate use of drug therapy. Gaining FDA approval is based on the body of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of a drug treatment. The scientific evidence is gathered in the first 3 steps in the drug development process: discovery and development, pre-clinical research (testing safety), and clinical research (testing efficacy). After there is adequate completion of research and development phases by the drug companies, they send a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the proposed scientific evidence for use in an intended population is evaluated by a team of physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists. Essentially, if it is found that there is substantial evidence that benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, the proposed labeling in the package insert is appropriate, and the manufacturing process is safe and adequate, then the drug is approved to go to market under that now FDA-approved indication. Even after approval, the FDA CDER continues to do postmarking surveillance of the drug through MedWatch and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).\n\nIndications can impact pricing of medications through Value-based Pricing, also known as indication specific pricing or indication value-based pricing. Since drugs can be used for different indications, this form of pricing would set different prices for each indication based on the value the drug offers for whatever it is being used to treat. This pricing scheme is often discussed in relation to oncology drugs, which are costly and not always successful in treating patients. Oncology drugs can be used for multiple different types of cancers so by applying indication-specific pricing, the drug would be priced based on how effective it is for treating each type of cancer. If the drug is more effective for Cancer A than Cancer B, then the patient taking the drug to treat Cancer A will pay more than the person using it for Cancer B because they are getting more value out of it. \n\nCurrently, most medications in the United States are priced the same regardless of what they're being used for or how effective they are at improving outcomes. Companies like CVS and Express Scripts in the US have began implementing pricing based on indication and in countries like Italy, similar forms of pricing are already being used. For example, Express Scripts' \"Oncology Care Value Program,\" uses indication-based pricing for certain oncology medications and was launched in 2016. Italy on the other hand, uses a model similar to indication-based pricing where the amount the hospital pays for certain drugs varies based on what it's used for. Patients can receive reimbursements for treatments based on their response and either be fully or partially refunded. Italy's reimbursement system is run by AIFA, the Italian Medicines Agency, which is the national authority that regulates drugs in Italy.\n\nThere has been some thought on incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels as an approach to improve patient understanding of the medications they are on. This information can help healthcare providers reduce medication errors related to drugs that may look and sound alike. Knowing the indication of the drug can also help providers determine if the dose of the drug is appropriate per indication, and this can greatly improve patient safety and drug effectiveness.\n\nHowever, there are still some challenges with incorporating the indication of use on prescription drug labels. Revealing the indication of use on prescription drug labels can breach patient confidentiality since the label will disclose private information publicly. Some medications can also be used for multiple diseases and one disease may have multiple medications for its prevention or treatment, therefore adding an indication on prescription labels in these cases may cause some confusion and may not be able to actually fit onto the label. \n\nEach test has its own indications and contraindications, but in a simplified fashion, how much a test is indicated for an individual depends largely on its \"net benefit\" for that individual, which largely depends on the absolute difference between pre- and post-test probability of conditions (such as diseases) that the test is expected to achieve. Additional factors that influence a decision whether a medical test should be performed or not include: cost of the test, time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. The possible benefits of a diagnostic test may also be weighed against the costs of unnecessary tests and resulting unnecessary follow-up and possibly even unnecessary treatment of incidental findings. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful for the establishment of statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.\n"}
{"id": "2783668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2783668", "title": "Infraspecific name", "text": "Infraspecific name\n\nIn botany, an infraspecific name is the scientific name for any taxon below the rank of species, i.e. an infraspecific taxon. (A \"taxon\", plural \"taxa\", is a group of organisms to be given a particular name.) The scientific names of botanical taxa are regulated by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\" (ICN). This specifies a 'three part name' for infraspecific taxa, plus a 'connecting term' to indicate the rank of the name. An example of such a name is \"Astrophytum myriostigma\" subvar. \"glabrum\", the name of a subvariety of the species \"Astrophytum myriostigma\" (bishop's hat cactus).\n\nNames below the rank of species of cultivated kinds of plants and of animals are regulated by different codes of nomenclature and are formed somewhat differently.\n\nArticle 24 of the ICN describes how infraspecific names are constructed. The order of the three parts of an infraspecific name is:\nIt is customary to italicize all three parts of such a name, but not the connecting term. For example:\n\n\nThe recommended abbreviations for ranks below species are, for example:\n\nLike specific epithets, infraspecific epithets cannot be used in isolation as names. Thus the name of a particular species of \"Acanthocalycium\" is \"Acanthocalycium klimpelianum\", which can be abbreviated to \"A. klimpelianum\" where the context makes the genus clear. The species cannot be referred to as just \"klimpelianum\". In the same way, the name of a particular variety of \"Acanthocalycium klimpelianum\" is \"Acanthocalycium klimpelianum\" var. \"macranthum\", which can be abbreviated to \"A. k.\" var. \"macranthum\" where the context makes the species clear. The variety cannot be referred to as just \"macranthum\".\n\nSometimes more than three parts will be given; strictly speaking, this is not a name, but a classification. The ICN gives the example of \"Saxifraga aizoon\" var. \"aizoon\" subvar. \"brevifolia\" f. \"multicaulis\" subf. \"surculosa\"; the name of the subform would be \"Saxifraga aizoon\" subf. \"surculosa\".\n\nFor a proposed infraspecific name to be legitimate it must be in accordance with all the rules of the ICN. Only some of the main points are described here.\n\nA key concept in botanical names is that of a type. In many cases the type will be a particular preserved specimen stored in a herbarium, although there are other kinds of type. Like other names, an infraspecific name is attached to a type. Whether a plant should be given a particular infraspecific name can then be decided by comparing it to the type.\n\nThere is no requirement for a species to be divided into infraspecific taxa, of whatever rank; in other words, a species does not have to have subspecies, varieties, forms, etc. However, if infraspecific ranks are created, then the name of the type of the species must repeat the specific epithet as its infraspecific epithet. The type acquires this name automatically as soon as any infraspecific rank is created. As an example, consider \"Poa secunda\" , whose type specimen is in the Wisconsin State Herbarium.\n\nThe same epithet can be used again within a species, at whatever level, only if the names with the re-used epithet are attached to the same type. Thus there can be a form called \"Poa secunda\" f. \"juncifolia\" as well as the subspecies \"Poa secunda\" subsp. \"juncifolia\" if, and only if, the type specimen of \"Poa secunda\" f. \"juncifolia\" is the same as the type specimen of \"Poa secunda\" subsp. \"juncifolia\" (in other words, if there is a single type specimen whose classification is \"Poa secunda\" subsp. \"juncifolia\" f. \"juncifolia\").\n\nIf two infraspecific taxa which have different types are accidentally given the same epithet, then a homonym has been created. The earliest published name is the legitimate one and the other must be changed.\n\nWhen indicating authors for infraspecific names, it is possible to show either just the author(s) of the final, infraspecific epithet, or the authors of both the specific and the infraspecific epithets. Examples:\n\n\nIn zoological nomenclature, names of taxa below species rank are formed somewhat differently, using a trinomen or 'trinomial name'. No connecting term is required as there is only one rank below species, the subspecies.\n\nThe \"ICN\" does not regulate the names of cultivated plants, of cultivars, i.e. plants specifically created for use in agriculture or horticulture. Such names are regulated by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants\" (ICNCP).\n\nAlthough logically below the rank of species (and hence \"infraspecific\"), a cultivar name may be attached to any scientific name at the genus level or below. The minimum requirement is to specify a genus name. For example, \"Achillea\" 'Cerise Queen' is a cultivar; \"Pinus nigra\" 'Arnold Sentinel' is a cultivar of the species \"P. nigra\" (which is propagated vegetatively, by cloning).\n\n"}

It is the language of Kobaïa, a fictional planet invented by Vander and the setting for a musical \"space opera\" sung in Kobaïan by Magma on ten concept albums.\n\nFrench drummer and composer Christian Vander formed progressive rock band Magma in late 1969 in an attempt to fill the void left by the death of American jazz musician and composer John Coltrane. Magma's first album, \"Magma\" (later reissued as \"Kobaïa\"), told a story of refugees fleeing a future Earth and settling on a fictional planet called Kobaïa. The lyrics were all in Kobaïan, a language Vander constructed for the album, some sung by soloists and others by \"massive quasi-operatic choruses\". Over the next three decades Magma made a further nine albums that continued the mythology of Kobaïa, all sung in Kobaïan.\n\nVander (his Kobaïan name is Zëbëhn Straïn dë Ğeuštaah) said in an interview that he invented Kobaïan for Magma because \"French just wasn't expressive enough. Either for the story or for the sound of the music\". He said that the language developed in parallel with the music, that sounds appeared as he was composing on a piano. Vander based Kobaïan in part on elements of Slavic and Germanic languages and in part on the scat-yodeling vocal style of American avant garde jazz singer Leon Thomas. The subsequent expansion of the language became a group effort, and as Magma's personnel changed, so new ideas were incorporated into the language (and the music).\n\nBritish music critic Ian MacDonald said that Kobaïan is \"phonetic, not semantic\", and that it is based on \"sonorities, not on applied meanings\". One of Magma's singers, Klaus Blasquiz, described Kobaïan as \"a language of the heart\" whose words are \"inseparable from the music\". Magma expert Michael Draine said \"the abstraction provided by the Kobaïan verse seems to inspire Magma's singers to heights of emotional abandon rarely permitted by conventional lyrics\".\n\nThe Kobaïan lyrics on Magma's albums were generally not translated (though both Kobaïan lyrics and an English translation were provided for the first UK release on A&M of \"Mëkanïk Dëstruktïẁ Kömmandöh\"), but clues to the unfolding story of Kobaïa were given in French in the albums' liner notes. While the original intent of the language was to avoid over-scrutiny, unofficial Kobaïan online lexicons were created by Magma fans, and Vander himself has since translated many of the words.\n\nChristian Vander called Magma's music \"Zeuhl\" (Kobaïan for \"celestial\"), and it influenced a number of other (mostly French) bands, including Zao (France), Art Zoyd (France) and Univers Zero (Belgium). Zeuhl later became a music genre which was used to describe music similar to that of Magma. Several Japanese Zeuhl bands also sprang up, including Ruins and Kōenji Hyakkei, whose lyrics are also sung in a constructed language similar to Kobaïan.\n\n\n"}

It is the predominant language in the Buddhist-dominated district of Leh of the Jammu & Kashmir state and may be called \"Purigi\" or \"Balti\" in the adjacent Kargil district. Though a member of the Tibetic family, Ladakhi is not mutually intelligible with Standard Tibetan.\n\nLadakhi has approximately 200,000 speakers in India, and perhaps 12,000 speakers in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, mostly in the Qiangtang region. Ladakhi has several dialects: \"Lehskat\" after Leh, where it is spoken; \"Shamskat\", spoken in the northwest of Leh; \"Stotskat\", spoken in the Indus valley and which is tonal unlike the others; \"Nubra\", spoken in the north of Leh; \"Purigi\"/\"Balti\" spoken in the Kargil district. The significant difference in the dialects remain in the tone or way of speaking. The varieties spoken in Upper Ladakh and Zangskar have many features of Ladakhi and also western dialects of Central Tibetan.\n\nLadakhi has seen a huge drop in identification as a mother tongue, from 100,000 in the 2001 census to 14,000 in the 2011 census, despite positive language attitudes in the community and vigorous use of the language by all age groups in most contexts.\n\nNicolas Tournadre considers Ladakhi, Balti, and Purgi to be distinct languages on the basis of mutual intelligibility (Zangskari is not as distinct.) As a group they are termed Ladakhi–Balti or Western Archaic Tibetan, as opposed to Western Innovative Tibetan languages such as Spiti Bhoti (Lahuli–Spiti) spoken in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nZangskari is a dialect of Ladakhi and has four subdialects, Stod, Zhung, Sham, and Lungna. It is written using the Tibetan script.\n\nLadakhi is usually written using Tibetan script with the pronunciation of Ladakhi being much closer to written Classical Tibetan than most other Tibetic languages. Ladakhis pronounce many of the prefix, suffix and head letters that are silent in many other Tibetic languages, such as Amdo, Khams, and Central Tibetan. This tendency is more pronounced to the west of Leh, and on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control, in Baltistan. For example, a Tibetan would pronounce \"sta\" 'axe' as [tá], but a Lehpa would say [sta],and a purgi would pronounce [stare]. While a Tibetan would pronounce འབྲས་ (’bras) 'rice' as [ɳʈɛ́ʔ], Lehpa say [ɖas], and the purgii pronounce it as [bras].\n\nThe question of whether to write colloquial Ladakhi in the Tibetan script or to write only a slightly Ladakhified version of Classical Tibetan is controversial in Ladakh. Muslim Ladakhis speak Ladakhi but most do not read the Tibetan script and most Buddhist Ladakhis can sound out the Tibetan script but do not understand Classical Tibetan, but some Ladakhi Buddhist scholars insist that Ladakhi must be written only in a form of Classical Tibetan. A limited number of books and magazines have been published in colloquial Ladakhi.\n\nWritten Ladakhi is most often romanised using modified Wylie transliteration, with a \"th\" denoting an aspirated dental \"t,\" for example.\n\nThe medium of instruction in most schools in Ladakh is English, with either Hindi or Urdu as a compulsory second language, and a choice of Arabic or classical Tibetan as the compulsory third language. Government schools in Ladakh are under JK SBOSE, which calls the Tibetan subject Bodhi. Private schools under the CBSE and the Central Institute of Buddhist Studies, Leh call it Tibetan.\n\nA section of Ladakhi society has been demanding inclusion of a newly named language, Bhoti, to be added to the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution. They claim that Bhoti is spoken by Ladakhis, Baltis, Tibetans, and throughout the Himalayas from Baltistan to Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n"}

The intention is also for it to have something in common with the native languages of most of the people. With the various source languages from across the globe, its design is of the type worldlang, a class of a posteriori languages.\n\nDevelopment of the language began in 2006 in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, by a group of enthusiasts, with Dmitri Ivanov being the project leader. The basic version of the language was published in June 2010.\n\nThe official Lidepla alphabet is based on the Latin script and contains the following 25 letters, and their upper case equivalents:\n\nThe letter \"q\" is not used, and \"c\" occurs only in the digraph “ch”. The letter \"y\" represents the same vowel as “i”, but is never stressed. The following digraphs and letters are pronounced as follows, with examples:\n\n\n\n\"-ng-\" in the middle of a word is pronounced /ng/ (as is “ng” in \"finger\"). \"v\" and ending \"-ng\" may alternatively be pronounced as /w/ (as in \"wood\") and /n/ (\"nose\"), respectively. \"x\" between two vowels may be slightly voiced, and \"x\" before a consonant pronounced as /s/.\n\nSome learning material uses /h/ for the letter h. The grammar allows that pronunciation, but gives /x/ as \"ch\" in German \"Fach\" as the primary.\n\nFor more details on the phonology, see the section Phonology below.\n\nThe general rule regarding the stress is: \n\n\nLidepla tries to preserve the original sounding of the international words, though, so there are some exceptions, as follows, in short:\n\n\nThe main idea behind Lidepla was to create a harmonious whole on the base of the most widespread and influential national languages of the planet. That results in the Lidepla vocabulary containing a fairly significant amount of non-European words, which makes Lidepla a welttung. A general design principle for Lidepla was to have something in common with the native languages of most of the people on Earth.\n\nThe Lidepla grammar is based on 3 rules: the rule of the constant form, the rule of belonging to a word class, and the rule of direct word order.\n\nThe word form never changes. Special particles are used to express the grammatical meanings, for example:\n\n\nThe only two exceptions are: \n\n\nEvery Lidepla word belongs to a word class – noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc. Derivation takes place by means of affixes and particles:\n\n\nThere are no fixed endings for the word classes, there are preferable, though. Thus most verbs end in i, but there are some exceptions (for example: \"jan\" – to know, shwo\" – to talk, etc).\n\nBy means of affixes and particles new words can be made up, both of the same class and of the other. For example:\n\nThe use of special particle is optional if its meaning is clear from the context. For example:\n\n\nboth lack particles indicating time, because it is already obvious from “yesterday” and “tomorrow”. In the same manner: \n\n\nlacks the plural indicating ending \"-s\", because plural is already indicated by \"mucho\", in contrast to:\n\n\nthat uses the plural -s ending.\n\nThe word order in a sentence is usually direct, that is subject — predicate — object, attribute goes before the noun, prepositions are before the noun group they refer to.\n\nIf the word order is changed, it is shown by the use of special particles. For example, \"den\" is put before the object, like this:\n\n\nThe basic personal pronouns of Lidepla are:\n\nThere is a distinction in third person singular between animate and inanimate: \"ta\" is used for humans and animals (corresponding to he/him, she/her, and it when used about an animal), and \"it\" about things and objects. If the speaker wishes to distinguish gender, there is also third person singular ela (she, her) and lu (he, him).\n\nJust as in English, second person plural (you, you all) and singular (you) are both the same word: \"yu\". Lidepla also has an indefinite personal pronoun: oni (one, they as in “they say that...”, and “one does not...”).\n\nThe short form of the possessive pronouns looks like this:\n\nThe third person singular \"suy\" is universal and can be used as the possessive form for both \"ta\", \"it\", \"ela\" and \"lu\" – for \"ela\" and \"lu\" there's also the forms elay and luy.\n\nThe suffix \"-ney\" is used to form adjectives from nouns. Therefore, it is also possible to form longer possessive pronouns with the base form and the suffix \"-ney\": mi-ney, yu-ney, etc.\n\nVerb roots never change in Lidepla. Tense are formed by particles, or by suffixes.\n\nMost Lidepla vocabulary is made up of international words of Latin origin. The most frequent words, though, are of English, Russian, Chinese, Arabic and Hindi origin. There are not definite endings for different parts of speech, so nearly any word can be easily incorporated. The words are adapted to Lidepla phonology and don't preserve original orthography – the pronunciation is preserved in first hand, not the spelling.\n\nAs of 2014, the Lidepla vocabulary had about 4,000 entries, meaning about 10,000 individual words, with an increasing number. For a word to be incorporated, the following principles are taken into account:\n\nWhole Lidepla phrases sometimes sound very close to national languages ones, with the same meaning:\n\nThere are 17 basic consonants (b, d, g; p, t, k; w, f; s, ʃ; x; d͡ʒ, d͡z; m, n, r, l) and 3 optional ones (v; t͡ʃ; ŋ) in Lidepla.\n\nDistinction of the sounds w — v, d͡ʒ — t͡ʃ is not obligatory, that is they may be pronounced in the same way, as there are no minimal pairs for them. The ŋ sound is the same as in English (in -ing ending).\n\nThere are 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the language.\n\nThe project is led by the psychologist Dmitri Ivanov. He laid the foundation of the language, using mainly the ideas of Otto Jespersen on the Novial language, and also the facts of Creole language development and structure, while linguists A. Vinogradova and E. Ivanova helped a lot during the early period of development. In 2007 A. Lysenko joined and became the main linguist of the project.\n\nFrom the very beginning the project was open and widely discussed in a number of conlanger groups. As of 2014, more than 15 people contributed to the language considerably (that is, worked on vocabulary and grammar, translated and wrote original texts, including songs), not speaking about those who participated in discussions.\n\nThe basic version of the language was published on June 1, 2010. In some sources the date of creation of Lidepla is stated to be 2006. It is thus important to clarify that the “basic version” of the language – that is, the version after which the basics of the language is not to be changed – wasn't published until 2010.\n\nAt the moment the language is used mainly on the Internet, when it comes to direct communication. About 10–15 people have mastered the language, and about 50 can use it in communication. A lot of texts have been translated, including rather spacious texts like \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, and \"Sailor Ruterford in Maori captivity\" by (son of Korney Chukovsky; translated from Russian), and also some tales. There are songs both written and translated, including an album by musician , and subtitles made for cartoons and movies (like the popular Russian film \"\").\n\nPater Noster, the Lord's Prayer, in Lingwa de Planeta:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote more than 100 books, including works on original poems and dramas, but most famous are his books on his research into Tamil literature. Most of his literary works were on Saivism. He founded a Saivite institution called \"Podhunilaik Kazhagam\". He was an exponent of the Pure Tamil movement and hence considered to be the father of Tamil linguistic purism. He advocated the use of Tamil devoid of Sanskrit words and hence changed his birth name \"Vedhachalam\" to \"Maraimalai\".\n\nPolitically he was inclined towards non-Brahminism and hence he and his followers considered that the Self-respect movement was born out of his efforts.Though he is scholer of Tamil he has good scholestic study over Sanskrit as well as English Nevertheless, the atheist, anti-Hindu ideologies of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy were shunned by Maraimalai Adigal and caused years of differences between the two. Maraimalai Adigal spent most of his income on buying his books and after his death his collection were made into a library according to his will.\n\nMaraimalai Adigal was born on 15 July 1876 to Cokkanata Pillai and Cinnammai. His birth name was Vedhachalam. He did his early schooling at Wesley Mission High School in Nagappattinam, but had to abandon his formal education with Fourth Form after his father's death.\n\nHis stint as a student in Wesley Mission High School Nagapattiam made him proficient in English and Sanskrit.\n\nMaraimalai Adigal in spite of discontinuing his formal education after 9th grade, continued learning Tamil from the Tamil scholar Narayana Pillai, who was making his livelihood by selling Tamil palm-leaf manuscripts. He learnt Sanskrit and English through his own effort. He later authored several articles in Tamil monthly called \"Neelalochani\". He later studied Saiva philosophy under Somasundara Naicker. With the help of Sundaram Pillai, author of \"Manonmaniam\", he learned Tamil poetic dramas and thus acquired employment as a Tamil teacher in a school in Trivandrum.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, he got married to Soundaravalli and soon after his marriage, he moved to Madras to work as a sub-editor to a journal \"Siddantha Deepikai\". Later, in March 1898, he quit this job to work with V. G. Suryanarana Sastri as a teacher in Madras Christian College. In his time in Madras Christian College he toured throughout Tamil Nadu giving lectures on Saivam. At about the same time he started a society for Saivam called \"Saiva Siddhanta Maha Samajam\". As a young teacher he was popular with his students who would visit his house to listen to his lectures.\n\nIn 1910 a decision was made by the Madras University to make the vernacular Tamil language optional for graduation in Arts subjects, leaving English as a medium of education. This decision caused many Tamil teachers to lose their jobs. Realising the vast knowledge and his great capacity as a teacher, Miller, the then Head of Christian College Madras, and other friends insisted that Adigal be given a job in the college. As the opportunity to teach Tamil was considerably reduced and few students opted to study it, the need for a full-time teacher was not a required. Adigal refused the offer and resigned to lead an ascetic life in a serene atmosphere outside the city and to study and do research in Tamil.\n\nApart from being a good orator, Adigal composed several Tamil poems. He authored more than 100 books. Other than essays and novels he wrote books dealing with literary criticism, philosophy and religion, history, psychology and politics. His collections of poems to the Hindu god Sri Murugan, which he composed during the times of illness were published as \"Thiruvotri Muruhar Mummanikkovai\" in 1900. He also wrote poems from recollections of his teacher Somasundara Naiker in 1901 as \"Somasundarak Kaanjiaakkam\". This has been considered as one of his best works. He also released his research work on Tamil literature \"Mullaip Pattu Aaraichi\" for students of Tamil literature. He translated Kalidasa's 'Abhijñānaśākuntalam' into Tamil as \"Sakuntalai\".\n\nSome of his prominent works include:\n\nIn 1911, he published his first novel, \"Kumuthavalli allathu Naahanaattarasi\", an adaptation of English novel \"Leela\" by G. W. M. Reynolds.\n\nHe also wrote books on the subjects of self-improvement, self-help and personality development. These included \"Maranathin pin Manithar Nilai\" (Human Life stage After Death), \"Mesmerism and Hypnotism\" and \"Tholaivil unarthal\" (Telepathy).\n\nAfter quitting his teaching job on 10 April 1911, Adigal moved to Pallavaram, a suburb of Madras. There he began to dress as a \"Sanyasin\" from 27 August 1911 and became known as \"Swami Vedhachalam\". He became a devout follower of Saivam and started an institution named \"Podhunilaik Kazhagam\". The motto of the institution was set at \"Ondre Kulam, Oruvanae Devan\" (Mankind is one, and God is one). The Kazhagam made efforts to make people of all castes, creeds and religions to worship Sri Siva together. \nHe started the Thiru Murugan Press (TM Press) in his residence at Pallavaram and published a number of books and magazines. He also started a monthly called \"Gnaana Saaharam\" (Ocean of Wisdom).\n\nIn the year 1916 he became an expert of pure Tamil movement advocating the use of Tamil language devoid of loan words from Sanskrit. Thus he changed the name of \"Gnaana Saaharam\" to \"Arivukkadal\" and his title of Swami Vedhachalam to \"Maraimalai Adigal\" (where Adigal is Tamil for Swami). Thus he is referred to as the \"Father of Tamil Puritanism\".\n\nApart being the called as father of pure Tamil movement, Maraimalai Adigal is also considered as father of Non-Brahmin Tamil movements. Maraimalai Adigal himself claimed that the non-Brahmin stance of Self-respect movement was born out of his views and principles. Nevertheless, the atheist stance of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, who was heading the Self-respect movement, was observed by Maraimalai Adigal and his followers as counter productive. On this issue, Ilavalaganar, a student of Maraimalai Adigal wrote: \n\nAlthough initially a supporter of the Self-respect movement, which he saw as a non-Brahmin movement, he vehemently opposed the atheistic views of its leadership. At one stage he asked Ulaganatha Mudaliar, brother of Thiru. Vi. Kaliyanasundara Mudaliar (Thiru Vi. Ka as he was popularly known) and an eminent Saivite scholar himself, to arrange for a statewide tour to counter the propaganda of the Self-respect movement. Maraimalai Adigal looked upon the Self-respect movement as a handiwork of the Telugu Vaishnavites. On this Maraimalai Adigal wrote \n\nKalyanasundara Mudaliar, although a Saivite himself, disagreed with Maraimalai Adigal. Kalyanasundaram refused to publish Maraimalai Adigal's essay against Self-respect movement in his journal. The antipathy between Maraimalai Adigal and the members of Self-respect movement was also explicit with \"Kudiarasu\", the political organ of Self-respect movement claiming that Maraimalai Adigal was calling for Periyar to be murdered.\n\nEventually after years of disagreement, both Maraimalai Adigal and Periyar realised that the disagreement is harmful for their interest and worked towards a rapproachement. Periyar offered an unconditional apology to Maraimalai Adigal and in reply, Maraimalai Adigal wrote a series on the \"Ramayana\" in Periyar's English language weekly \"Revolt\". Although the apology and reconciliation were at a personal level between Periyar and Maraimalai Adigal, the difference in ideologies still made their followers to cross swords.\n\nMaraimalai Adigal spent most of his income on buying books. Research on the readership of his book collections show that between 20 April 1923 to 10 August 1930 a total of 1852 people had borrowed his books. The readership included people from Madras Presidency, Sri Lanka, Burma and Malaysia. Upon his death, on 15 September 1950, according to his will, the books were left for the people of Tamil Nadu and thus a library named after him was started in 1958 by the then MD, Padmashri V.Subbiah Pillai of South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society Ltd. at Linghi Street, Chennai. by adding more no of rare collection of Tamil books The library was a repertoire of books and journals, some printed way back in 1779. In May 2008, the Tamil Nadu Government helped by allocating a space at Connemara Public Library but the library management is still with the present MD Rajagopal Muthukumaraswamy of South India Saiva Siddhanta Works Publishing Society.\n\n"}

In practice, m is usually chosen to be greater than unity. In some literature, the name \"sensitivity\" is used for this concept.\n\nIn general it is clear that for a receiver to \"see\" a signal it has to be greater than the noise floor. To actually detect the signal however, it is often required to be at a power level greater than the noise floor by an amount that is dependent on the type of detection used as well as other factors. There are exceptions to this requirement but coverage of these cases is outside the scope of this article. This required difference in power levels of the signal and the noise floor is known as the signal to noise ratio (SNR). To establish the minimum detectable signal (MDS) of a receiver we require several factors to be known.\n\n\nTo calculate the minimum detectable signal we first need to establish the noise floor in the receiver by the following equation:\n\nAs a numerical example:\n\nA receiver has a bandwidth of 100 MHz and noise figure of 1.5 dB and the physical temperature of the system is 290 kelvins.\n\nSo for this receiver to even begin to \"see\" a signal it would need to be greater than −92.5 dBm. Confusion can arise because the level calculated above is also sometimes called the Minimum Discernable Signal (MDS). For the sake of clarity we will refer to this as the noise floor of the receiver. The next step is to take into account the SNR required for the type of detection we are using. If we need the signal to be 10 times more powerful than the noise floor the required SNR would be 10 dB. To calculate the actual minimum detectable signal is simply a case of adding the required SNR in dB to the noise floor. So for the example above this would mean that the minimum detectable signal is:\n\nMDS (dBm) = -92.5 + 10 = -82.5 (dBm)\n\nMDS (dBm) = 10Log(kTo*1e3) + NF + 10Log(BW) + SNR (dB)\n\nIn this equation:\n\n\"kT\" is the available noise power in a bandwidth BW = 1 Hz at \"T\", expressed in watts. \n\"kT\" x 1000 is the available noise power in a bandwidth BW = 1 Hz at \"T\", expressed in milliwatts. \"T\" is the system temperature in kelvins, and k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38×10 joules per kelvin = −228 dBW/(K·Hz)). If the system temperature and bandwidth is 290 K and 1 Hz, then the effective noise power available in 1 Hz bandwidth from a source is −174 dBm (174 dB below the one milliwatt level taken as a reference).\n\n1 Hz noise floor: calculating the noise power available in a one hertz bandwidth at a temperature of \"T\" = 290 K defines a figure from which all other values can be obtained (different bandwidths, temperatures). 1 Hz noise floor equates to a noise power of −174 dBm so a 1 kHz bandwidth would generate −174 + 10 log(1 kHz) = −144dBm of noise power (the noise is thermal noise, Johnson noise).\n\nMDS (dBm) = 10Log(kTo*1e3) + NF + 10Log(BW) + SNR (dBm)\n\nThe equation above indicates several ways in which the minimum detectable signal of a receiver can be improved. If one assumes that the bandwidth and SNR are fixed however by the application, then one way of improving MDS is by lowering the receivers physical temperature. This lowers the NF of the receiver by reducing the internal thermally produced noise. These type of receivers are referred to as Cryogenic Receivers.\n\nNoise figure (\"NF\") is noise factor (\"F\") expressed in decibels. \"F\" is the ratio of the input signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) to the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). \"F\" quantifies how much the signal degrades with respect to the noise because of the presence of a noisy network. A noiseless amplifier has a noise factor \"F\"=1, so the noise figure for that amplifier is \"NF\"=0 dB: a noiseless amplifier does not degrade the signal to noise ratio as both signal and noise propagate through the network.\n\nIf the bandwidth in which the information signal is measured turns out not to be 1 Hz wide, then the term 10 log(bandwidth) allows for the additional noise power present in the wider detection bandwidth.\n\nSignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is the degree to which the input signal power is greater than the noise power within the bandwidth B of interest. In the case of some digital systems a 10 dB difference between the noise floor and the signal level might be necessary; this 10 dB SNR allows a bit error rate (BER) to be better than some specified figure (e.g. 10 for some QPSK schemes). For voice signals the required SNR might be as low as 6 dB and for CW (Morse) it might extend, with a trained listener, down to 1 dB difference (tangential sensitivity). Usable in this context then means it conveys adequate information for decoding by a person or a machine with acceptable and defined levels of error.\n"}

Traill says that the ǀ’Auni call their language \"Nǀhuki,\" but others have recorded their name for their language as \"ǀ’Auo,\" and both Westphal and Köhler state that \"Nǀhuki (Nǀhuci, nǀɦuki)\" is a variety of Nǁng. It's not clear if both are correct or if languages have gotten mixed up in the literature.\n\nNǁng prospered through the 19th century, but encroaching non-ǃKwi languages and acculturation threatened it, like most other Khoisan languages. The language was mainly displaced by Afrikaans and Nama, especially after speakers started migrating to towns in the 1930s and found themselves surrounded by non-Nǁng-speaking people. In 1973 their language was declared extinct, and the remaining Nǁnǂe (\"ǂKhomani\") were evicted from the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park.\n\nIn the 1990s, linguists located 101-year-old Elsie Vaalbooi, who could still speak Nǁng. Anthony Traill interviewed her in 1997. The South African San Institute soon became involved in the pursuit of information on the Nǁng language, and with the help of Vaalbooi they tracked down 25 other people scattered by the eviction who were able to speak or at least understand the language. Thabo Mbeki handed over 400 km of land to the Nǁnǂe in 1999, and 250 km of land within the park in 2002. Vaalbooi came up with the Nǁng motto of \"Sa ǁ’a ǃainsi uinsi\" (also written \"Sa //a !aĩsi 'uĩsi)\" \"We move towards a better life\" for her rehabilitated people. This was also adopted as the official motto for the Northern Cape Province. At the time there were twenty elderly speakers, eight of whom lived in the Western Cape province signed over to them. As of 2007, fewer than ten are still alive in South Africa, and a few more in Botswana; none live with another speaker, and their daily languages are Khoekhoe and Tswana, respectively. The younger generations of ǂKhomani are proud Nama speakers, and have little affinity to Nǁng, so there is little chance of saving the language. Linguist Nigel Crawhall is heading a team to document what remains.\n\nRecent research on Nǁng led by Amanda Miller of Cornell University has helped describe the physics of its clicks, leading to a better understanding of click sounds in general.\n\nEfforts to perpetuate the N|uu language continue in 2017.\n\nNǁng has one of the more complex sound inventories of the world's languages. Most lexical words consist of a phonological foot with two moras (tone-bearing units). The first mora must start with a consonant (CV). The second mora may be a single vowel (V), a nasal consonant \"m\" or \"n\" (N), or one of a drastically reduced number of consonants plus a vowel (cV). That is, lexical roots, not counting sometimes lexicalized CV prefixes and suffixes, are typically CVcV, CVV, CVN, though there are also a few which are CV, as well as longer words of two phonological feet: CVCV, where the second C is not one of the reduced set of consonants but cannot be a click, CVCVN, CVVCV, CVNCV, CVVCVN, CVNCVN, CVcVCV, CVVCVcV. Grammatical words tend to be CV or V.\n\nThere are occasional exceptions to these patterns in ideophonic words such as 'Namaqua sandgrouse' (CVcVCVCVV + suffix) and historically reduplicated words with clicks such as 'to talk'.\n\nLike most languages in southern Africa, Nǁng has five vowel qualities. These may occur strident and nasalized. A word may have two adjacent vowels, which resemble a long vowel or diphthong.\n\nThe strident vowels are thought to have the phonation called harsh voice. They are strongly pharyngealized, and for some speakers involve low-frequency trilling that presumably involves the aryepiglottic fold. The four strident vowel qualities (there is no strident \"i\") are rather different from the non-strident vowels, as is common when a vowel is pharyngealized.\n\nNǁng is the only Khoisan language known to have a strident front vowel, , though this is rare, occurring in only two known words, 'to fly' and 'loincloth'. The lack of a nasalized equivalent is thought to be an accidental gap or simply unattested due to the small number of known words.\n\nThe tone-bearing segment may be a syllabic nasal, , rather than a vowel, as in the name Nǁng.\n\nOnly certain sequences of vowels may occur in a bimoraic foot, regardless of whether there is an intervening consonant. (That is, the permitted vowels are the same whether a word is CVcV or CVV.) If the first vowel is any variety (nasal, strident, etc.) of , then the second vowel must be identical. If the first vowel is , then the second may be anything but . If the first vowel is or , then the second may be either or a vowel of the same height: that is, \"oa, oo, oe; ua, uu, ui\". The vowels must be both oral or both nasal; nasal vowels cannot follow a nasal stop (though they may follow nasal clicks). Only the first vowel may be strident.\n\nFront vowels can only follow the click types and (the back-vowel constraint), with a single known exception, 'to go'. Front vowels and strident vowels may also not follow , whether an affricate release or a fricative, with the exception of three female kin terms where the second syllable is . As with the lack of strident front vowels, there are thus a small number of exceptions for these constraints with , but none with .\n\nNǁng moras may carry a high or low tone, /H/ or /L/. A typical lexical word consists of two moras, and so may have a high (HH), low (LL), rising (LH), or falling (HL) tone.\n\nMonomoraic lexical roots, such as 'mouth', are high- rather than low-tone by a 5–1 margin. CVV and CVN roots are HH, HL, and LH with about equal frequency, with LL slightly less common. However, half of all CVcV roots are LH, making it markedly frequent, while only 5% are HL. In an additional CV foot the distribution of H and L is approximately equal; an additional CVN or CVcV foot may pattern like an initial foot, but they are too infrequent to be sure.\n\nThe majority of Nǁng consonants are clicks. It was once thought that Khoisan languages distinguish velar and uvular clicks, but recent research into Nǁng, and reevaluation of the data on ǃXóõ, indicates that, for these languages at least, the distinction is one of pure clicks versus click–plosive contours.\n\"(?)\" marks possible accidental gaps; these consonants might be expected based on their occurrence in neighboring languages with similar phonologies, but are expected to be rare, and may occur in Nǁng words that have not been recorded.\n\nWhat were historically initial alveolar occlusives have become pre-palatal in lexical words. Among grammatical words in Nǀuu dialect there is a single exception, \"ná\" 'I'; in ǁ’Au dialect even that has merged, for \"ɲá\" 'I'.\nOnly sonorants may occur as the medial consonant of a phonological foot. is only known from three words. The oral sonorants do not occur in initial position.\n\nThese are simple clicks. The traditional term \"velaric\" is something of a misnomer, for the rear articulation is further back than the velum, and indeed further back than Nǁng . Miller et al. prefer the term \"lingual\" for this airstream mechanism; they also reject the existence of click \"accompaniments\", using the IPA symbols to represent both points of articulation rather than solely the anterior articulation. Besides being motivated phonetically, this has the benefit of better illustrating the parallels between clicks and pulmonic consonants.\n\nIn the above rubric, the first element of the name is the forward articulation, and the second is the rear articulation.\n\nThese are airstream contour consonants, which start off with a lingual (velaric) airstream mechanism and finish with a pulmonic airstream (whereas affricates are manner contour consonants, starting as plosives and finishing as fricatives). Traditionally, these were considered to be uvular clicks, because the uvular or pharyngeal closure is audible, but in fact the rear closure of all Nǁng clicks is uvular or pharyngeal. (The distinction between uvular and pharyngeal is not represented here.) Effectively, in these clicks the release of the rear articulation is delayed, so that there is a double release burst, the forward (lingual) release followed by the rear (pulmonic) release.\n\nThese differ from the previous consonants in that the second, rear release is an ejective.\n\n"}

{"id": "246070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246070", "title": "Predictability", "text": "Predictability\n\nPredictability is the degree to which a correct prediction or forecast of a system's state can be made either qualitatively or quantitatively.\n\nCausal determinism has a strong relationship with predictability. Perfect predictability implies strict determinism, but lack of predictability does not necessarily imply lack of determinism. Limitations on predictability could be caused by factors such as a lack of information or excessive complexity. \nIn experimental physics, there are always observational errors determining variables such as positions and velocities. So perfect prediction is \"practically\" impossible. Moreover, in modern quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle puts limits on the accuracy with which such quantities can be known. So such perfect predictability is also \"theoretically\" impossible. \n\nLaplace's Demon is a supreme intelligence who could completely predict the one possible future given the Newtonian dynamical laws of classical physics and perfect knowledge of the positions and velocities of all the particles in the world. In other words, if it were possible to have every piece of data on every atom in the universe from the beginning of time, it would be possible to predict the behavior of every atom into the future. Laplace’s determinism is usually thought to be based on his mechanics, but he could not prove mathematically that mechanics is deterministic. Rather, his determinism is based on general philosophical principles, specifically on the principle of sufficient reason and the law of continuity.\n\nAlthough the second law of thermodynamics can determine the equilibrium state that a system will evolve to, and steady states in dissipative systems can sometimes be predicted, there exists no general rule to predict the time evolution of systems distanced from equilibrium, e.g. chaotic systems, if they do not approach an equilibrium state. Their predictability usually deteriorates with time and to quantify predictability, the rate of divergence of system trajectories in phase space can be measured (Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, Lyapunov exponents).\n\nIn stochastic analysis a random process is a predictable process if it is possible to know the next state from the present time.\n\nThe branch of mathematics known as Chaos Theory focuses on the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. It suggests that a small change in an initial condition can completely alter the progression of a system. This phenomenon is known as the butterfly effect, which claims that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas. The nature of chaos theory suggests that the predictability of any system is limited because it is impossible to know all of the minutiae of a system at the present time. In principal, the deterministic systems that chaos theory attempts to analyze can be predicted, but uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time.\n\nIn the study of human–computer interaction, predictability is the property to forecast the consequences of a user action given the current state of the system.\n\nA contemporary example of human-computer interaction manifests in the development of computer vision algorithms for collision-avoidance software in self-driving cars. Researchers at NVIDIA Corporation, Princeton University, and other institutions are leveraging deep learning to teach computers to anticipate subsequent road scenarios based on visual information about current and previous states.\n\nAnother example of human-computer interaction are computer simulations meant to predict human behavior based on algorithms. For example, MIT has recently developed an incredibly accurate algorithm to predict the behavior of humans. When tested against television shows, the algorithm was able to predict with great accuracy the subsequent actions of characters. Algorithms and computer simulations like these show great promise for the future of artificial intelligence.\n\nLinguistic prediction is a phenomenon in psycholinguistics occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from eyetracking, event-related potentials, and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. Predictability has been shown to affect both text and speech processing, as well as speech production. Further, predictability has been shown to have an effect on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic comprehension.\n\nIn the study of biology – particularly genetics and neuroscience – predictability relates to the prediction of biological developments and behaviors based on inherited genes and past experiences.\n\nSignificant debate exists in the scientific community over whether or not a person's behavior is completely predictable based on their genetics. Studies such as the one in Israel, which showed that judges were more likely to give a lighter sentence if they had eaten more recently. In addition to cases like this, it has been proven that individuals smell better to someone with complementary immunity genes, leading to more physical attraction. Genetics can be examined to determine if an individual is predisposed to any diseases, and behavioral disorders can most often be explained by analyzing defects in genetic code. Scientist who focus on examples like these argue that human behavior is entirely predictable. Those on the other side of the debate argue that genetics can only provide a predisposition to act a certain way and that, ultimately, humans possess the free will to choose whether or not to act.\n\nAnimals have significantly more predictable behavior than humans. Driven by natural selection, animals develop mating calls, predator warnings, and communicative dances. One example of these engrained behaviors is the Belding's ground squirrel, which developed a specific set of calls that warn nearby squirrels about predators. If a ground squirrel sees a predator on land it will elicit a trill after it gets to safety, which signals to nearby squirrels that they should stand up on their hind legs and attempt to locate the predator. When a predator is seen in the air, a ground squirrel will immediately call out a long whistle, putting himself in danger but signaling for nearby squirrels to run for cover. Through experimentation and examination scientists have been able to chart behaviors like this and very accurately predict how animals behave in certain situations.\n\nThe study of predictability often sparks debate between those who believe humans maintain complete control over their free-will and those who believe our actions are predetermined. However, it is likely that neither Newton nor Laplace saw the study of predictability as relating to determinism.\n\nOne example of prediction techniques is tarot cards. Tarot cards have been used for hundreds of years to help in determining the future. \"Fortune tellers\" have been traced through history back to the Ancient Egyptians, however the earliest complete record dates only to the 18th century.\n\nTasseography is a divination method, typically utilizing tea leaves or coffee grounds. Western tasseography first started in medieval Europe, where fortune tellers would interpret splatters of wax, lead, and various other molten substances. When the Dutch brought tea from China in the seventeenth century, this evolved into tea tasseography. Tasseography is typically performed in a bright colored cup to contrast with the dark tea leaves or coffee grounds. The bright colors symbolize good fortunes while the dark color symbolizes misfortunes.\n\nAs climate change and other weather phenomenon become more common, the predictability of climate systems becomes more important. The IPCC notes that our ability to predict future detailed climate interactions is difficult, however, long term climate forecasts are possible.\n\nThe Spring Predictability Barrier refers to a period of time early in the year when making summer weather predictions about the El Niño–Southern Oscillation is difficult. It is unknown why it is difficult, although many theories have been proposed. There is some thought that the cause is due to the ENSO transition where conditions are more rapidly shifting.\n\nPredictability in macroeconomics refers most frequently to the degree to which an economic model accurately reflects quarterly data and the degree to which one might successfully identify the internal propagation mechanisms of models. Examples of US macroeconomic series of interest include but are not limited to Consumption, Investment, Real GNP, and Capital Stock. Factors that are involved in the predictability of an economic system include the range of the forecast (is the forecast two years \"out\" or twenty) and the variability of estimates. Mathematical processes for assessing the predictability of macroeconomic trends are still in development.\n\n"}

As a general rule, the rarer the letter, the more points it is worth.\n\nMany languages use sets of 102 tiles, since the original distribution of one hundred tiles was later augmented with two blank tiles. In tournament play, while it is acceptable to pause the game to count the tiles remaining in the game, it is not acceptable to mention how many tiles are remaining at any time. Several online tools exist for counting tiles during friendly play.\n\nDiacritical marks (such as \"é\" in words borrowed from French) are ignored.\nEnglish-language editions of Scrabble contain 100 letter tiles, in the following distribution:\n\n\nThe total number of points is 187.\n\nWhen Alfred Butts invented the game, he initially experimented with different distributions of letters. A popular story claims that Butts created an elaborate chart by studying the front page of \"The New York Times\" to create his final choice of letter distributions.\n\nIn 2004, Super Scrabble was launched. For international distribution outside the United States and Canada, and under license from Mattel, the game is manufactured by Leisure Tends' Tinderbox Games; and, for distribution within the United States and Canada, under license from Hasbro, the game is manufactured by Winning Moves. This set is composed of 200 tiles:\n\n\nSuper Scrabble contains more overlined and fewer underlined letters than would be obtained by combining two standard English sets.\n\nThe Afrikaans editions use these 102 tiles:\n\n\nCirca 1953, the Production and Marketing Company had provided license to the private company Leon Toys of Johannesburg, South Africa in the manufacture and production of Scrabble. Alongside the English language version of Scrabble the company also produced the first Afrikaans language version of the game under the name Krabbel, a Afrikaans translation of \"Scrabble\". This language set of the game had the following 100 tiles:\n\n\nAbsent in both the original and standard set of Afrikaans are the letters \"C\", \"Q\", \"X\", and \"Z\". The infrequent \"X\" and \"Z\" may still be represented by the use of a blank, yet the letters \"C\" and \"Q\", not used in Afrikaans but only in a few loanwords, may not be. \n\nThe Anglo-Saxon editions use these 101 tiles:\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon uses the letter \"K\", but it only occurs in one word (\"kyning\") and loanwords, so there is no tile for it. \"J\", \"V\", \"Q\", and \"Z\" are only used in loanwords. Anglo-Saxon uses the letter \"Ƿ\", but it was replaced by \"W\" in this set because it can be easily confused with P. Anglo-Saxon also uses the letter \"Ȝ\", but it is a typographic variant of G, so that is used instead. This version is hand-made and not an official edition by Mattel.\n\nArabic-language editions use the following 100 tiles:\n\n\nAlthough Arabic letters have up to four forms, Scrabble tiles use the isolated form. In some sets, as found in some Arabic-based alphabets that are not the standard modern Arabic, a dotless yeh (alif maqsura) may be used ى‎, and for the letter he the final form ‎ھ (heh doachashmee) may appear, as it is in some Arabic-based alphabets, as in Urdu, the isolated form of the letter. The pattern of using the isolated forms in composing words is also found in Arabic crosswords and is one of the rare situations when Arabic letters are not connected to each other.\n\nArmenian-language editions use the following 146 tiles. The board is 17x17 instead of 15x15. This version is called ԲԱՌ ԽԱՂ (\"bar khagh\", meaning \"words game\") and is not an official edition by Mattel.\n\n\nNotice that this distribution lacks \"և\", another Armenian letter, because:\nHowever, it can be formed as a ligature of ե/Ե and ւ/Ւ.\n\nBambara-language Scrabble sets use these 106 tiles:\n\n\nThe uncommon digraphic letters \"sh\" (sometimes represented with the IPA symbol ʃ; a regional variant of s) and \"kh\" (only used in loanwords) are absent as they are now considered obsolete.\n\n \nBasque-language Scrabble sets use these 100 tiles. Called Euskarbel, this is not an official edition by Mattel. \n\nDiacritical marks are ignored. \"C\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"W\" and \"Y\" are absent because they are only used in loanwords. Digraphs can be formed with two tiles.\n\n, an independently produced Bicolano language variant of Scrabble, uses these 102 tiles.\n\n\nThe games uses the Abakada alphabet; hence the foreign letters of the present Filipino alphabet, \"C\", \"F\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"X\", \"Z\", and even \"Ñ\", are absent. None of these letters can be played with a blank. Also, \"N\" and \"G\" being played in place of \"NG\" is not allowed.\n\nBreton-language Scrabble sets use these 100 tiles.\n\n\n\"C\", \"Q\", and \"X\" are absent because they are only used in loanwords or, in the case of \"C\", the digraphs \"CH\" and \"C'H\". However, these letters can be played with a blank. Diacritical marks are ignored.\n\nBulgarian-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, use the following 102 tiles:\n\n\nCatalan-language editions use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nAccents and diaereses are ignored; for example, \"À\" is played as \"A\". Nevertheless, there are special tiles for the \"C\" with cedilla \"Ç\" (\"ce trencada\"), the ligature \"L·L\" representing the geminated ell (\"ela geminada\"), as well as the digraph \"NY\". Playing an \"N\" tile followed by a blank tile to form the digraph \"NY\" is not allowed. Official rules treat the \"Q\" tile as just one letter, but usually Catalan players use the \"Q\" tile like the \"QU\" digraph and all Catalan Scrabble Clubs use this \"de facto\" rule. \"K\", \"W\", and \"Y\" are absent because they are only used in loanwords or, in the case of \"Y\", the digraph \"NY\". Blanks cannot be used to represent \"K\", \"W\", or \"Y\".\n\nThere is a Catalan Scrabble clone which uses the same 21x21 board as Super Scrabble.\n\nCroatian-language Scrabble sets use the following 103 tiles:\n\n\"Q\", \"W\", \"X\" and \"Y\" are not included, as Croatian does not use those letters.\n\nCzech-language sets use the following 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Ö\", \"Q\" and \"W\" are absent because they are only used in loanwords, though all three letters can be played with a blank. Arguably \"X\" does not exist in Czech either, but the manufacturer decided to include it, so that loanwords can be played. The digraphic letter \"CH\" does not appear in this edition and is not representable by the blank (joker); \"CH\" is instead played as two distinct letters C and H.\n\nThe old Czech distribution was as follows:\n\n\nNote that this distribution had no \"X\" tile because it was only used in loanwords. This distribution had a \"CH\" tile for the digraphic letter. \n\nDakelh-language Scrabble sets use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nThe letters \"F\" and \"R\" are used in Dakelh, but only in loanwords and are very infrequent. \"P\", \"Q\", \"V\", and \"X\" are also absent because these letters are not used in Dakelh.\n\nDanish-language Scrabble sets use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nThis distribution lacks \"Q\" and \"W\", which are rare in the Danish language.\n\nDutch-language editions consist of the following 102 tiles:\n\n\nBefore March 1998, there was a difference between the Dutch and the Flemish version: the Dutch version had 2 IJ tiles with a value of 4 points. Furthermore, it had only 1 F and only 4 S tiles; and the face value of the G was only 2 points. The Flemish version never had IJ tiles, it was as described above. The Dutch version is now in line with the Flemish one. Instead of the\nIJ letter a combination of the I and J is now used. \n\nAnother Dutch version before March 1998 consisted of these 100 tiles:\n\n\nThe original Dutch version consisted of these 102 tiles:\n\n\nEsperanto Scrabble exists as an Internet game (Rules for Esperanto scrabble) and as a commercially produced custom set.\n\nEsperanto-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Q\", \"W\", \"X\", and \"Y\" are not present, since Esperanto does not use those letters.\n\nEstonian-language editions consist of the following 102 tiles:\n\n\nEstonian uses the letters \"C\" and \"Y\" but so infrequently that there are no tiles for them. A blank may represent C because it is the most common out of the five foreign letters in Estonian. Y can also be played as a blank as it is sometimes used as a vowel. There are also no tiles for \"Q\", \"W\", and \"X\" as they are restricted to outside loanwords and are rare (Quivira, WC, Xerxes.) These letters, however, cannot be played even with a blank. Arguably \"F\", \"Š\", \"Z\", and \"Ž\" do not exist in Estonian either, but they are sometimes still included for adopted words.\n\nFaroese-language editions consist of the following 105 tiles:\n\n\nThe distribution lacks \"C\", \"Q\", \"W\", \"X\", and \"Z\", since these letters are not used in Faroese. This version is hand-made and is not an official edition by Mattel.\n\nFinnish-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\nThis distribution lacks \"Q\", \"Š\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Z\", \"Ž\", and \"Å\", since they are virtually absent in Finnish. Arguably \"B\", \"C\", \"F\", and \"G\" (outside the digraph \"NG\") do not exist in Finnish either, but they are included as they are used for borrowed words, and \"F\" in some western dialects.\n\nA variant called Alfapet (originally the name of Swedish Scrabble), contains 108 tiles:\n\n\nFrench-language editions of Scrabble contain these 102 tiles:\nDiacritical marks are ignored.\n\nGalician-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\nStress accents are disregarded. This is called Letrad@s.GZ (originally Scrabble.GZ), and is not an official edition by Mattel. Arguably \"J\", \"K\", \"W\", and \"Y\" do not exist in Galician, but they are included here as they are sometimes used in borrowed words. Blanks do not exist in this game.\n\nGerman-language editions of Scrabble contain 102 letter tiles, in the following distribution:\n\n\nBefore the current 102-tile set, German language sets had 119 tiles. With the larger sized tile pool, players had eight tiles at a time on their racks, as opposed to the standard seven. The letter distribution for this larger set is:\n\n\nGerman sets marketed as Foreign Language Editions produced by Selchow and Righter had 100 tiles with the following distribution:\n\n\nBefore the Foreign Language Editions produced by Selchow and Righter or the 119-tile distribution produced by J.W. Spear & Sons, James Brunot's Production and Marketing Company produced and outsourced, in the mid-1950s, its production of German sets with a different 100-tile distribution:\n\n\nIn 2008, a German edition of the Mattel-licensed product, Super Scrabble, was released by the game publisher Piatnik. The set is composed of the following 200 tiles:\nThe underlines indicate the distribution contains one tile fewer for the letter than would be if the 102 tiles of the current language set were simply doubled.\n\nNote that the letter ß \"(Eszett)\" is not used. This because it does not exist as a capital letter in German. While a majuscule ß \"(see Capital ß)\" has been established in the context of computing (Unicode), ß is replaced by SS when capitalizing, according to German orthography (e. g. \"Straße\" [street]: STRASSE). However, the umlauts Ä, Ö and Ü must not be replaced by AE, OE or UE when playing (as would usually be done in German crosswords where ß is also replaced by SS). Other diacritics which may occur in some foreign words are ignored (é = E, œ = OE etc.). \n\nGreek-language editions of Scrabble contain 104 tiles.\n\nGwich'in-language editions of Scrabble contain 200 letter tiles, in the following distribution:\n\nNote that \"GHW\", \"ND\", \"NH\", \"NJ\", and \"RH\" are not included, as these digraphs and trigraphs are very rare in Gwich'in. \"C\" is not included, as it is only used in the digraph \"CH\". \"P\", \"Q\", and \"X\" are absent because these letters are not used in Gwich'in. Arguably B, F, and M are not used in Gwich'in either, but they are included as these letters are used for borrowed words.\n\nHaitian Creole-language editions of Scrabble contain these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"X\" has no tile as it is only used in loanwords in Haitian Creole. \"Q\" has no tile as it is not used in Haitian Creole, while \"C\" is only used in the digraph \"CH\", and \"U\" in \"OU\" and \"UI\". This version is made for educational purposes and is not an official edition by Mattel.\n\nThere is no official Hawaiian-language edition of Scrabble, but one suggested fan version made for educational purposes contains these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"V\", \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" have no tiles as they are not used in Hawaiian. For the sake of the geocache this is connected to, the distribution had to be modified a bit. For example, there should be 30 A's and 11 K's. The diacritical mark and the okina \"'\" are ignored.\n\nFour different Hebrew language distributions were published by the owners or licensees of the Scrabble brand. In these sets the final form letters ך, ם, ן, ף and ץ are not available and the normal form is used.\n\nThe most recent edition for Hebrew was published in 2008 by JW Spears and Sons, a subsidiary of Mattel UK with 100 tiles in the following distribution:\n\n\nA version produced in the late 1980s by JW Spears and Sons under the Spears Games label has these 104 tiles:\n\n\nIn 1977 JW Spears and Sons published their original 97-tile Hebrew language version under the tradename נא‎-שבץ‎™ (Hebrew: \"Scrabble\"):\n\nJust two years earlier, in 1975, Selchow & Righter released their Foreign Language Edition of Hebrew with the following 98-tile distribution:\n\n\nHungarian-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"DZ\" and \"DZS\", which are fairly rare in Hungarian, have no tiles, nor do \"Q\", \"W\", \"X\" and \"Y\" (outside the digraphs \"GY\", \"LY\", \"NY\" and \"TY\"), which are only used in loanwords, as part of the extended Hungarian alphabet. You can still use a blank as a \"Q\", \"W\", \"X\" or \"Y\", but not as \"DZ\" or \"DZS\".\n\nIcelandic-language sets (known as Krafla) use these 100 tiles:\n\nThe letters C, Q, W, and Z are absent because they are only used in loanwords, or in the case of Z, obsolete letter. Blanks cannot be used to represent these.\n\nBefore 2016, Icelandic-language sets used these 104 tiles:\n\n\nOriginally, there was a 105-tile distribution with slightly different point values than the distribution before 2016 (and with 7 E's instead of 6):\n\n\nIndonesian-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Q\", and \"X\", are absent because they are only present in loanwords.\n\nIPA sets use these 106 tiles:\n\nɒ and a are not included as they are allophones of ɑ in varieties of English that have the father–bother merger, including most of the United States. e is an allophone of eɪ. ɫ is an allophone of l. ɱ is an allophone of m. o is an allophone of oʊ. ɾ and r are allophones of ɹ. ʌ is an allophone of ə. ʍ is an allophone of w. ʔ is not considered a phoneme in English. The affricates ts and dz do not have their own tiles, and so must be formed with two. But for a few exceptional cases, the sounds ɐ, β, ʙ, ɓ, c, cʼ, ɕ, ç, ɗ, ɖ, ɘ, ɣ, ɤ, ɠ, ɢ, ʛ, ħ, ʜ, ɦ, ɥ, ɧ, ɨ, ɟ, ʄ, ʝ, kʼ, ɭ, ɬ, ɮ, ʟ, ɯ, ɰ, ɲ, ɳ, ɴ, ø, ɵ, œ, ɶ, pʼ, q, qʼ, ɻ, ɽ, ɺ, ʀ, ʁ, ʂ, tʼ, ʈ, ʉ, ʋ, ⱱ, x, χ, y, ʏ, ʎ, ʐ, ʑ, ʡ, ʕ, and ʢ, ǀ, ǁ, ǃ, ʘ, and ǂ are not used in American English. An extended version has 1 ʙ worth 14, 1 ʛ worth 12, 1 ħ worth 9, 1 kʼ worth 11, 1 ɮ worth 11, 1 ɲ worth 13, 1 ʉ worth 11, 1 ⱱ worth 11, 1 ǃ worth 16, and 1 ʘ worth 18. The IPA English and its extended version are made for educational purposes and are not official editions by the licensors of the Scrabble® brand crossword game.\n\nAn alternative by Scrabble3D has this distribution (no combinations): \n\nIrish-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"J\", \"K\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are absent since they are rarely used in the Irish language.\n\nAn alternate set, proposed by Scrabble3D along with the official set, was proposed to have these 100 tiles:\n\nNote that \"H\" is not in this set because it is only used at the beginning of the words starting with vowels, which is against the rules there. Note: This set uses the old orthography. In the new orthography, the dotted letters are replaced by the digraph of the letter without the dot followed by H.\n\nShortly after, the Scrabble3D distribution underwent a major revision (still has 100 tiles):\n\nNote that \"H\" is not in this set because it is only used at the beginning of the words starting with vowels, which is against the rules there. Note: This set uses the old orthography. In the new orthography, the dotted letters are replaced by the digraph of the letter without the dot followed by H.\n\nItalian-language Scrabble (originally sold in Italy as \"Scarabeo\", but that became a different game) applied a special rule that when a player exchanges tiles on his turn, he could request opponent to pass his turn. Both players have one chance each for one game. The sets consist of these 120 tiles:\n\n\nDiacritic marks are ignored. The letters \"J\", \"K\", \"W\", \"X\", and \"Y\" are absent since these letters do not exist in the standard Italian alphabet, although they are sometimes used in loanwords.\nAnother set uses these 120 tiles:\n\n\n\"Scarabeo\" is an Italian variant of Scrabble that is much more popular in its native country than the original game. It is played with a 17×17 board, and uses these 130 tiles. It was\n\n\nAn unofficial Japanese Hiragana Scrabble set uses these 100 tiles:\n\nThe obsolete letters ゐ and ゑ, the letter を now exclusively used as a grammatical particle, and the lengthener ー have no tiles.\n\nWords are played in \"dictionary format\":\n\nThis version was created by a student from Japan, and is not in wide circulation.\n\nA more popular set by Scrabble3D uses these 206 tiles:\n\nThe obsolete letters \"ぇ\", \"ゐ\", \"ゑ\", \"ゎ\", \"ぃ\", \"ぁ\", \"ぅ\", and \"ぉ\", along with the marks \"ー\", \"゛\", and \" ゜\", have no tiles (with the first three letters and the marks being playable with a blank). The marks are included to make the letter distribution smaller.\n\nJapanese Romaji Scrabble sets use these 102 tiles:\n\n\"L\", \"Q\" and \"X\" are absent as they do not exist in Japanese. \"V\" does not exist though, created to be used in loanwords, is absent because of its rare frequency, can be used for a blank with 20 points reward for each play. - represents long vowel. Romaji scrabble games consist of all 3 scripts used in Japanese language - Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji in romanized form.\n\n\nThis version does not use the long vowel \"-\". For instance, 東京(Tokyo) is played as \"toukyou\", 優秀(excellent) is played as \"yuushuu\" and ユース(youth) is played as \"yuusu\".\n\nScrabble3D has a different distribution, released earlier:\n\nThe \"-\" for long vowels and the \"V\" tile are optional (not in the standard set). You can use the blank as a \"V\" tile.\n\nOne board game (Romeo) has a different distribution, released earlier:\n\nIn this version, note that C has no tile as it is used almost exclusively in the digraph CH.\n\nKlingon-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\nThe letter tiles may show Klingon symbols (pIqaD), their renderings in the English alphabet, or both. This is not an official version of the game, although Hasbro did create their own licensed \"Star Trek Scrabble\" game in which players can receive bonus points by playing Klingon words. \"Star Trek Scrabble\" uses standard English-language tiles.\n\nThere are three kinds of Latin-language Scrabble sets developed by three authorities in the language.\n\nThe first distribution, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto, uses these 100 tiles:\n\n\nAn extension of the first distribution for Latin Paleography, developed by the Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto, uses these 120 tiles:\n\n\nThe point value of \"Ↄ\" is unknown, but it is believed to be 3. \"Ↄ\", which represents con, can only be played as the first tile of a word. \"Ꝝ\", which represents rum, and \";\", which represents is or us, can only be played as the last tile of a word. \"Ę\" (e caudata), also written as \"æ\", represents ae. \"Ē\" represents em or en. \"&\" represents et. \"Ī\" represents im or in. \"œ\" represents oe. \"Ꝑ\" represents per, \"P̄\" represents prae. \"Ꝓ\" represents pro. \"V̄\" represents vm or vn (as there was no U at the time). Note that \"W\", unlike \"Ę\"/\"æ\" and \"œ\", which were created at the same time, has no tile because there is no vv digraph in Latin. \"ıı\" represents 2 minims: ii, v, or n. \"ııı\" represents 3 minims: iii, iv, in, vi, ni, or m.\n\nThe second distribution below was made \"in conjunction with scholars from the University of Cambridge and elsewhere, together with the Cambridge Schools Classics Project.\" This distribution distinguishes U from V, with the semi-vocalic V scoring five times the points.\n\n\nThe third distribution is as follows:\n\nHowever, with this set, according to the rules, if a blank is used as a \"Y\" it is worth 10 points, if a blank is used as a \"Z\" it is worth 15 points, and if a blank is used as a \"K\" it is worth 20 points. Each of those letters are so high in points, because they are used only in borrowed words. The score of 20 for a \"K\" is the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide. \"Y\" is absent in all sets except the paleographic extension of the first set because it is rare in Latin. \"K\" and \"Z\" are also absent in all sets because they are rare in Latin, while \"J\" is not considered separate from \"I\" in all sets except the third one, in which it is not included because it is rare in Latin. \"W\" is also absent in all sets because it did not exist in ancient times, and is used only in modern borrowed words.\n\nLatvian-language sets use these 104 tiles:\n\n\nThe letters \"Q\", \"W\", \"X\" and \"Y\" are absent, because they are not used in Latvian. Arguably \"F\" and \"H\" do not exist in Latvian either, but they are included as they are sometimes used for borrowed words.\n\nMarketed as L33t Tiles by the now defunct Wiremelon, LLC, editions of an English-L33tspeak variant of Scrabble contain 103 letter tiles in the following distribution:\n\n\nLithuanian-language sets (known as KrisKros Klasik) use these 104 tiles:\n\n\nThe letters \"Q\", \"W\" and \"X\" are absent, because they are not used in Lithuanian. Arguably \"F\" and \"H\" do not exist in Lithuanian either, but they are included as they are sometimes used for borrowed words.\n\nLojban-language sets use these 160 tiles:\n\n\nThe combination XO is absent as it is only used in 7 words (\"binxo\", \"ganxo\", \"jerxo\", \"sirxo\", \"xogji\", \"xotli\", and \"xo'u\"). The combination ZO is absent as it is only used in 7 words (\"brazo\", \"kinzo\", \"zo'a\", \"zo'e\", \"zo'i\", \"zo'o\", and \"zo'u\"). The combination ['Y] is absent as it is only used in 1 word (\".y'y\"). The letter . occurs in Lojban, but it is so infrequent that it has no tile. Blanks can be used to represent any of the above letters (including .) and digrams(including XO, ZO, and ['Y]). The letter ['] occurs in Lojban, but only in digrams and never as one letter. The letters \"H\", \"Q\", and \"W\" are absent, because these letters are not used in Lojban.\n\nLojban-language sets in the 1990s (which include lujvo) use these 100 tiles:\n\n\nLojban-language sets in the 1990s (which do not include lujvo) use these 100 tiles:\n\nY is absent because it is very rare outside lujvo.\n\nMalagasy-language sets use these 102 tiles:\n\n\n\"C\", \"Q\", \"U\", \"W,\" and \"X\" are absent because these letters are not used in Malagasy. Diacritical marks are ignored.\n\nMalaysian-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Q\", \"V\" and \"X\" are absent because they are only present in loanwords.\n\nMāori-language sets (known as Scramble) use these 225 tiles:\n\n\nDiacritical Marks are ignored. \"G\" is absent because this letter is only used in the \"NG\" digraph in Māori. \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"F\", \"J\", \"L\", \"Q\", \"S\", \"V\", \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are absent because these letters are not used in Māori. This set is made for educational purposes and is not an official version by Mattel.\n\nMath sets use these 100 tiles:\n\nTo play, you have to put in a true equation on the board.\n\nNorwegian-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nThe letters \"Q\", \"X\" and \"Z\" are absent since these letters are rarely used in Norwegian. These letters and the foreign letters \"Ä\", \"Ö\" and \"Ü\", which are used in a few Norwegian words, can be played with a blank.\n\n \nThe Nuxalk-language edition uses these 212 tiles. \n\nThis is a handmade set and not an official edition by Mattel. The letters B, D, E, F, G, J, O, R, V and Z are not used in Nuxalk and therefore have no tiles. The 7 is included in the set because it is an actual letter in Nuxalk. It is used to replace ' if you don't have a tile ending with '. Arguably \"H\" and \"7\" do not exist in Nuxalk, but they are included as they are used for borrowed words, or in the case of \"7\", optionally at the beginning of a word.\n\nIn the word game PinyinPal, a Pinyin version, these 100 tiles are used:\n\n\nThe V is used to represent Ü.\n\nPolish-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nThis set has been used since 2000. Before that year, a slightly different configuration was used: Ź was worth 7 points, F was worth 4 points, and there were 2 \"Fs\", and 8 \"As\".\nThe letters \"Q\", \"V\" and \"X\" have always been absent (since they are used in foreign words), and blank tiles cannot be used to represent these.\n\nPortuguese-language editions of Scrabble contain 120 tiles.\n\n\nWhile \"Ç\" is a separate tile, other diacritical marks are ignored. \"K\", \"W\", and \"Y\" are absent, since they are only present in loanwords in Portuguese, and were not even official letters until 2009.\n\nRomanian-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nSome amendment applied in updated version. Previously, the B was worth 8, and the O was worth 1. \n\nThe original (1982) distribution used the following 100 tiles:\n\n\nDiacritical marks are ignored, so for example \"Ă\" and \"Â\" are played as \"A\".\nBoth distributions lack \"K\", \"Q\", \"W\" and \"Y\", since they are only used in foreign words. You can still use a blank to play these letters. Arguably \"X\" does not exist in Romanian either, but it is included as it is used for borrowed words.\n\nRussian-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, contain 104 tiles using this distribution:\n\n\nThe former Soviet distribution had 126 tiles and was as follows:\n\n\nAnother Russian version, called Эрудит (Erudit), has 131 tiles:\n\n\nThis distribution has no Ë tile. In \"Erudit\", only nominative singular and \"pluralia tantum\" nouns are allowed.\n\nScottish Gaelic-language sets originally were planned to use these 104 tiles:\n\n\nThe distribution was modified a bit (Dropping \"NG\" because it is too rare, but adding more \"A\", \"E\", and \"I\" tiles, and changing the number of tiles to 100)\nScottish Gaelic-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"PH\" and \"SH\" being worth 1 is probably an error; these letters should be worth 10. \"H\" is absent because it is only used in the digraphs above. \"Á\", \"É\", and \"Ó\" are absent since they are rarely used in the Scottish Gaelic language. \"J\", \"K\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are absent since they are not used in the Scottish Gaelic language. This version is used by Scrabble3D and is not an official edition by Mattel.\n\nSlovak-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Q\", \"W\", \"Ě\", \"Ö\", \"Ř\", and \"Ü\" are absent because they are only used in loanwords. Arguably \"X\" does not exist in Slovak either, but the designer included it as it is used in loanwords.\n\nSince 2013, a new 112-tile set was introduced:\n\n\nArguably the \"Q\", \"W\", and \"X\" tiles should still not be included, but the manufacturer decided to include them, so that loanwords can be played. However, the Slovak Scrabble dictionary contains 4 words with W (not including their declensions) and no words with Q - Q is always transcribed as KV in loanwords.\n\nSlovenian-language sets use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Q\", \"W\", \"X\" and \"Y\" are absent, because Slovenian does not use those letters.\n\nSpanish-language sets sold outside North America use these 100 tiles:\n\n\nStress accents are disregarded. The letters \"K\" and \"W\" are absent since these two letters are rarely used. According to FISE (\"Federación Internacional de Scrabble en Español\") rules, a blank cannot be used to represent \"K\" or \"W\".\n\nUsing one \"C\" and one \"H\" tile in place of the \"CH\" tile, two \"L\" tiles for the \"LL\" tile, or two \"R\" tiles for the \"RR\" tile is also not allowed in Spanish Scrabble (see rules in Spanish provided by the FISE).\n\nSpanish-language sets sold within North America (known as \"Scrabble – Edición en Español\") use - including \"K\" and \"W\" but without \"CH\" - these 103 tiles:\n\n\nStress accents are still disregarded. Arguably the \"K\" and \"W\" tiles should not be included in this Scrabble set, but they are anyway, so that loanwords can be played.\n\nIn Spanish Scrabble, the tile Q can be played as with or without a U, which means the Q-without-U stuck in most Scrabble variants in other languages does not exist in Spanish Scrabble.\n\nSwedish-language Scrabble sets (until 1990 sold in Sweden as \"Alfapet\", but that became a different game) use these 100 tiles:\n\n\n\"Å\", \"Ä\" and \"Ö\" have separate tiles; other diacritics like that on \"É\" are ignored (except \"Ü\"). \"Q\" and \"W\", found only in loanwords, are absent but can be played with a blank. \"Ü\" and \"Æ\" require a blank, and as of 2010 only occur in one and three playable words respectively: müsli and three forms of Laestadianism (\"læstadianism\" in Swedish).\n\nOriginally (starting in 1954), Swedish Scrabble sets (called Alfa-pet, made by the Swedish company Alga, a member of the BRIO Group) used a slightly different distribution:\n\nNote that Z was absent in this distribution as it is almost exclusively used in loanwords. However, it could be played with a blank.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1961, the makers of Alfa-pet revised the distribution, altering the number of tiles for the letters \"B\", \"E\", \"N\", \"O\", \"P\", \"S\", and \"U\". The letter \"C\" was reduced in value to 5 and the \"X\" was increased to 10:\n\n\nCirca 1961, the hyphen was dropped from the game's name, and the original Swedish distribution of the game had been restored. Sometime later, produced under BRIO's subsidiary, Joker, the number of \"T\"s in the set were reduced by one and an 8-point \"Z\" tile was added.\n\nIn 2002, under the ownership of Mattel and its brand name Scrabble, the Swedish language set tile values of the \"C\" and \"Z\" were changed, respectively, to 8 and 10.\n\nThough Alga had lost its license to Mattel Europa in the early 1990s in the production of the game, the company held onto its ownership of the name Alfapet. ssubsequently it produced a different yet similar crossword board game. Played on a different grid layout, this game is played with a distribution which contains these 120 tiles, with \"Q\" but not \"W\":\n\n\nThe black tile may be put in front of a word to create another word adjacent to the black tile and thus diagonally away from the original word. The arrows lets the player change the direction of a word anywhere between the first and last letter of the word, and are always placed under letters. Anyway, \"Q\" is only used in loanwords in modern Swedish, so it is included.\n\nThe Tswana editions use these 104 tiles:\n\n\nThe letters \"C\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"X\", and \"Z\" have no tiles as these letters are rarely used in Tswana. However, they can still be played with a blank. Diacritical marks are ignored. This is a hand-made edition and not an official one.\n\nTurkish-language sets use these 100 tiles (including distinct dotted and dotless I tiles):\n\n\nThe letters \"Q\", \"W\", and \"X\" are not used in Turkish and therefore do not appear in the set. Blanks may not represent these letters, meaning loanwords that may use them may not appear in the game at all.\n\nTuvan-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, use these 125 tiles:\n\n\nThe distribution lacks four letters used only in loanwords: Ф, Ц, Щ, and Ь.\n\nThis version is made for educational purposes and is not an official edition by Mattel.\n\nAn optimum Ukrainian-language Scrabble sets, which use Cyrillic letters, contain 104 tiles using this distribution:\n\n\nThe apostrophe sign is also included, even though it is not a letter in the Ukrainian alphabet.\n\nWelsh-language Scrabble sets use these 105 tiles:\n\n\nSince there are specific tiles for the digraphs that are considered to be separate letters in Welsh orthography (such as \"DD\"), it is not permissible to use the individual letters to spell these out. Diacritics on letters are ignored.\n\nThe digraph \"PH\" also exists in Welsh, but is omitted because it is used almost exclusively in mutated words, which the rules disallow. \"K\", \"Q\", \"V\", \"X\" and \"Z\" also do not exist in Welsh. \"J\" does not exist in traditional Welsh either, but it is included as it is used in some borrowed words.\n\nZhuyin Chinese-language editions of Scrabble use these 100 tiles.\n\n\nThe letter ㄙ (\"S)\" has no tile as it is almost exclusively used in the letter ㄕ (SH) in this edition. The letters ㄘ (\"C)\", ㄔ (\"CH\"), ㄈ (\"F)\", ㄎ (\"K)\", and ㄆ (\"P)\" are used in Zhuyin, but so infrequently that they have no tiles.\n\n"}

It is most often used in lieu of listing separately the separate components or providing a convenient \"label\" for a collection of disciplines.\n\nNonspecific fields of study are identified by umbrella titles such as \"physics\", \"physical education\", and \"medicine\", to distinguish them from specialized fields of study such as exercise physiology.\n\nMany scientific and academic conferences use umbrella titles as unifying themes for the activities scheduled in the course of the conference.\n\nUmbrella titles in common use involve either general job descriptions of a group of workers with similar responsibilities (like \"teacher\") or rank (military or nonmilitary).\n\nCollections of organizations with a common legal or legislative interest are often \"united\" under an umbrella title for the purposes of lobbying or participating in a lawsuit.\n\nUmbrella titles are widely used in music, literature, television, and theater. Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study.\n\nUmbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: classical music, jazz, rock music, hip hop, rhythm and blues and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar \"structure\" can be found in the field of dance.\n\nPrior to the sale of the long playing record in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from \"Oklahoma\", for example). It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and compact discs are \"umbrella\" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as Chip Davis' \"Day Parts\" series) as well.\n\nWhile it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like \"NBC Monday Night at the Movies\") is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of anthology series, series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of \"90 Bristol Court\"), wheel series, and other series under a common heading (such as \"Crimetime After Primetime\" and \"Four in One\").\n\nWhile it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in American broadcast network television (for example, \"The Jack Benny Show\" shared a time slot with, first \"Private Secretary\" and then \"The George Gobel Show\"), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when NBC presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, \"90 Bristol Court\".\n\nWhile the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with \"Four in One\" and \"The Bold Ones\", then with \"NBC Mystery Movie\". Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The expirement was revived in 1979 with \"Cliffhangers\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running \"Doctor Who\" used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called \"An Unearthly Child\" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect stories with a common enemy or theme (Daleks stories, Cybermen stories, UNIT stories, and season-long \"Key to Time\" and \"Trial of a Time Lord\").\n\nThe use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as \"Lord of the Rings\" and the \"Three Colors\" trilogy (\"a.k.a.\" \"Red, White, and Blue trilogy\") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as John Dos Passos' \"U.S.A.\"). Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the James Bond and \"Star Wars\" films and Marcel Proust's multi-volume \"Remembrance of Things Past\"). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars (\"Marx Brothers movies\") or common characters (\"Dirty Harry movies\"), as is the case for novels or comics (\"Perry Mason novels\", for example). In literature, sometimes an umbrella title is used for a collection of stories with a common locality, such as the Wessex novels of Thomas Hardy.\n"}

It is now only remembered by a single passive speaker, who lives in the village of Aplow — the new name of what was previously known as Volow.\n\nThe similarity of Volow with Mwotlap is such that the two communalects may be considered dialects of a single language.\n\nVolow, like Mwotlap, has 7 phonemic vowels, which are all short monophthongs:\nThe language also has a typologically rare consonant: a rounded, prenasalised voiced labial-velar plosive : e.g. “woman” (spelled \"n-leq̄evēn\" in the local orthography).\n\n\n"}
