However, in Germany, both fonts coexisted until the first half of the 20th century.\n\nDuring that time, both typefaces gained ideological connotations in Germany, which led to long and heated disputes on what was the \"correct\" typeface to use. The eventual outcome was that the Antiqua-type fonts won when the Nazi Party chose to phase out the more ornate-looking Fraktur.\n\nHistorically, the dispute originates in the differing use of these two typefaces in most intellectual texts—for Latin texts, Antiqua-type typefaces were normally used, whereas Fraktur was favoured for works written in German. This extended even to English–German dictionaries, for example, where the English words were all written in Antiqua and the German words in Fraktur. Originally this was simply a convention.\n\nConflict over the two typefaces first came to a head after the occupation of Germany and dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire by Napoleon in 1806, which led to a period in the history of Germany in which nationalists began to attempt to define what cultural values were common to all Germans. There was a massive effort to canonize the German national literature—for example, the Grimm Brothers' collection of fairy tales—and to create a unified German grammar.\n\nIn the context of these debates, the two typefaces became increasingly polarized: Antiqua typefaces were seen to be \"un-German\", and they were seen to represent this by virtue of their connotations as \"shallow\", \"light\", and \"not serious\". In contrast, Fraktur, with its much darker and denser script, was viewed as representing the allegedly German virtues such as depth and sobriety.\n\nDuring the Romantic Era, in which the Middle Ages were glorified, the Fraktur typefaces additionally gained the (historically incorrect) interpretation that they represented German Gothicism. For instance, Goethe's mother advised her son, who had taken to the clear Antiqua typefaces, to remain—\"for God's sake\"—German, even in his letters.\n\nOtto von Bismarck was a keen supporter of German typefaces. He refused gifts of German books in Antiqua typefaces and returned them to sender with the statement ' (I don't read German books in Latin letters!).\n\nThe dispute between Antiqua and Fraktur continued into the 20th century. The arguments in favour of Fraktur were based not only on historical and cultural perceptions but also on the claim that Fraktur was more suited for printing German and other Germanic languages, being more readable than Antiqua for this purpose.\n\nA 1910 publication by , \"\", claims the following advantages for using Fraktur as the German script:\n\n\nOn 4 May 1911, a peak in the dispute was reached during a vote in the . The \" (\"Association for Antiqua\") had submitted a proposition to make Antiqua the official typeface (Fraktur had been the official typeface since the foundation of the German Empire) and no longer teach German (blackletter cursive) in the schools. After a long and, in places, very emotional debate, the proposition was narrowly rejected 85–82.\n\nThe Fraktur typefaces were particularly heavily used during the time of Nazism, when they were initially represented as true German script, the press scolded for its frequent use of \"Roman characters\" under \"Jewish influence\" and German émigrés urged to use only \"German script\". However, in 1941, Fraktur was banned in a ' (edict on script) signed by Martin Bormann as so-called ' (\" Jewish letters\").\n\nThe edict mentions publications destined for foreign countries, so one possible reason for the reversal of policy was that Antiqua would be more legible to those living in the occupied areas; the impetus for a rapid change in policy probably came from Joseph Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry. Readers outside German-speaking countries were largely unfamiliar with Fraktur typefaces. Foreign fonts and machinery could be used for the production of propaganda and other materials in local languages, but not so easily in German as long as the official preference for Fraktur remained. \n\nIn any case, Adolf Hitler personally disliked the Fraktur typeface, as demonstrated by a declaration made in the in 1934:\nYour alleged Gothic internalisation does not fit well in this age of steel and iron, glass and concrete, of womanly beauty and manly strength, of head raised high and intention defiant ... In a hundred years, our language will be the European language. The nations of the east, the north and the west will, to communicate with us, learn our language. The prerequisite for this: The script called Gothic is replaced by the script we have called Latin so far ...\nBormann's edict of 3 January 1941, at first forbade only the use of blackletter typefaces. A second memorandum banned the use of , including , which had only been introduced in the 1920s. From the academic year 1941/42 onwards, only the so-called \" (\"normal script\"), which had hitherto been taught alongside under the name of \"Latin script\", was allowed to be used and taught. However, remained in use until 1945 on SS insignia (names of SS-Divisions, etc.) and in some other cases.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Sütterlin script was once again taught in the schools of some German states as an additional script, but it could not hold for long against the Latin cursive scripts. Since few people remain who can read Kurrent, most old letters, diaries, etc. remain inaccessible for all but the most elderly German speakers. As a consequence, most German-speaking people today find it difficult to decipher their own parents' or grandparents' letters, diaries, or certificates.\n\nThe Fraktur script remains present in everyday life in some pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticity and oldness. However, the letterforms used in many of these more recent applications deviate from the traditional letterforms, specifically in the frequent untraditional use of the round \"s\" instead of the long s (ſ) at the beginning of a syllable, the omission of ligatures, and the use of letter-forms more similar to Antiqua for certain especially hard-to-read Fraktur letters such as \"k\". Books wholly written in Fraktur are nowadays read mostly for particular interests. Since many people have difficulty understanding blackletter, they may have trouble accessing older editions of literary works in German.\n\nA few organizations such as the \" continue to advocate the use of Fraktur typefaces, highlighting their cultural and historical heritage and their advantages when used for printing Germanic languages. But these organizations are small, somewhat sectarian, and not particularly well known in Germany.\n\nIn the United States, Mexico, and Central America, Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Old Colony Mennonite schools still teach the Kurrent handwriting and Fraktur script. German books printed by Amish and Mennonite printers use the Fraktur script.\n\n\n\n\"This article incorporates text translated from the as of December 2005.\"\n"}

One of the striking developments of the past decade has been an erosion of this non-intervention norm and the rise of a nascent doctrine of “contingent sovereignty.”\n\nThis school of thought holds that sovereign rights and immunities are not absolute. They depend on the observance of fundamental state obligations. These include the responsibility to protect the citizens of the state. When a regime makes war on its people or cannot prevent atrocities against them, it risks forfeiting its claim to non-intervention. In such circumstances, the responsibility to protect may devolve to the international community.\n\nThis emerging consensus reflects the traumas of the twentieth century. The seminal event was the Holocaust, but it was hardly the last to shock the conscience of humankind. From the killing fields of Cambodia to the bloody hills of Rwanda, a litany of atrocities has mocked our earnest, repeated pledges of 'Never Again.'\n\nFollowing the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan described what he termed a \"developing international norm ... that massive and systematic violations of human rights wherever they may take place ... should not be allowed to stand.\" No longer should frontiers be considered an absolute defense behind which states can commit crimes against humanity with \"sovereign impunity.\"\n\nThe concept of contingent sovereignty is evolving and currently not codified in international law.\n\nCritics argue that the concept of contingent sovereignty allows powerful countries, such as the United States, too much scope to invade other countries based in their own judgements about the human rights abuses or other wrongdoing of the government of the country concerned.\n\n"}

Every September, a large number of incoming freshmen would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, taking time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and \"netiquette\". After a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' social norms or tire of using the service.\n\nWhereas the regular September freshman influx would quickly settle down, the influx of new users from AOL did not end and Usenet's existing culture did not have the capacity to integrate the sheer number of new users. The influx was exacerbated by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer Jan Brandt, which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials of AOL.\n\nSince then the popularity of the Internet has brought on a constant stream of new users. Hence, from the point of view of the early Usenet, the influx of new users in September 1993 never ended.\n\nDave Fischer appears to have coined the term in a January 1994 post to alt.folklore.computers: \"It's moot now. September 1993 will go down in net history as the September that never ended.\"\n\nIn homage to the term, one news server, formerly named \"Motzarella.org\", calls itself \"Eternal September\" and gives the date as a running tally of days since September 1993.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek program called \"sdate\" outputs the current date, formatted using the Eternal September calendar (September \"X\", 1993, with \"X\" an unbounded counter for days since that epoch).

{"id": "21464374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21464374", "title": "Facesitting", "text": "Facesitting\n\nFacesitting, also known as queening or kinging, is a sexual practice in which one partner sits on or over the other's face, typically to allow or force oral–genital or oral–anal contact. In addition to oral-genital and oral-anal contact, the position also leaves the bottom partner's hands free to stimulate other erogenous zones (e.g., anus, nipples, etc.). The top partner may be facing either direction in this position. It is common for this position to form part of BDSM, involving dominance and submission, though this need not be the case. Within a BDSM or D/s context, facesitting can be a form of erotic humiliation.\n\nFacesitting is common among dominant and submissive individuals, for demonstrating superiority and for sexual gratification. Unlike smothering, in facesitting the bottom partner is not deprived of air. The full-weight body-pressure, moisture, body odors, and darkness can be perceived as powerful sexual attractions or compulsions. The person sat upon may be in bondage, sexually submissive, or simply held down by the body-weight of the other person. In some cases, the submissive will consume the dominant's bodily waste(s) (urolagnia and coprophilia).\n\nSometimes special furniture is used, such as a \"queening stool\" or \"smotherbox\". A \"queening stool\" is a low seat which fits over the submissive's face and contains an opening to allow oral-genital and/or oral-anal stimulation of the domme while seated. \n\nThe position allows the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) to relax and therefore partly exposing the labia minora to intimate touch. The gluteus maximus and levator ani muscles, the major muscles of the crotch, can relax and sag allowing easy access to the vagina and anus. Additionally, the stool allows for greater comfort and allows for the activity to be done for a longer period of time. \n\nA smotherbox (or \"smothering box\") is a special form of queening stool which also allows the person under the seat to be locked in place, restrained by the neck as in a set of stocks. A smotherbox has two openings. One is in a vertical side of the box for the neck of the person who has his or her head inside the smotherbox. The other is in the top of the box to expose his or her face. The inside of a smotherbox is often padded to provide support for his or her neck and prevent his or her head from moving. The padding may also muffle noises from the outside, causing a relaxation effect and heightening his or her other senses. Smotherboxes are usually custom made pieces of furniture that may have a special significance for their users. They are sometimes made out of precious woods, with leather used for the seat.\nThe smotherbox is placed on a stable surface. The cover (top half of the smotherbox) is open while the submissive lies down on his or her back and places his or her head in the box. When he or she is in position the cover is closed. The cover can have hinges or be a separate part. Locks may be used to emphasize the submissive position or the submissive's hands may be fastened above his or her head to the box. Smotherboxes may be more permanently mounted to tables or other stable objects, and the submissive restrained to that surface instead. A Queening Chair or Facesitting Throne is another variation that is popular, designed to emphasize the relative place of the domme and submissive. They can be elegant and more formal than the smotherbox.\n\nIn 1980, Monty Python recorded a humorous song, \"Sit on My Face\", about the pleasures of facesitting. Written by Eric Idle, the song's lyrics are sung to the melody of \"Sing As We Go\" by Gracie Fields. The opening gives way to multiple male voices singing \"Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.\" The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to fellatio and cunnilingus, such as \"when I'm between your thighs you blow me away\" and \"life can be fine if we both 69\".\n\nIn 2014, the British government announced a ban on the production of hardcore pornography for the Internet. Ostensibly, the bill sought to protect women from sex acts that were violent or unsafe, and banned a wide variety of sex practices, including facesitting, strangulation and fisting. This law impacts only the production of pornographic videos as opposed to acts performed privately. Protests against the law were held outside the Palace of Westminster, with protesters saying the law does not reflect the wishes of the public.\n\n"}

{"id": "4174573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4174573", "title": "Four discourses", "text": "Four discourses\n\nFour discourses is a concept developed by French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. He argued that there were four fundamental types of discourse. He defined four discourses, which he called Master, University, Hysteric and Analyst, and suggested that these relate dynamically to one another. \n\nLacan's theory of the four discourses was initially developed in 1969, perhaps in response to the events of social unrest during May 1968 in France, but also through his discovery of what he believed were deficiencies in the orthodox reading of the Oedipus Complex. The Four Discourses theory is presented in his seminar \"L'envers de la psychanalyse\" and in \"Radiophonie\", where he starts using \"discourse\" as a social bond founded in intersubjectivity. He uses the term discourse to stress the transindividual nature of language: speech always implies another subject.\n\nPrior to the development of the Four Discourses, the primary guideline for clinical psychoanalysis was Freud's Oedipus Complex. In Lacan's Seminar of 1969-70, Lacan argues that the terrifying Oedipal father that Freud invoked was already castrated at the point of intervention. The castration was symbolic rather than physical. In an effort to stem analysts' tendency to project their ownimaginary readings and neurotic fantasies onto psychoanalysis, Lacan worked to formalise psychoanalytic theory with mathematical functions with renewed focus on the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. This would ensure only a minimum of teaching is lost when communicated and also provide the conceptual architecture to limit the associations of the analyst.\n\nDiscourse, in the first place, refers to a point where speech and language intersect. The four discourses represent the four possible formulations of the symbolic network which social bonds can take and can be expressed as the permutations of a four-term configuration showing the relative positions — the agent, the other, the product and the truth — of four terms, the subject, the master signifier, knowledge and objet petit a.\n\nThe four positions in each discourse are :\n\nAgent = Upper left. This is the speaker of the discourse\n\nOther = Upper right. This is what the discourse is addressed to\n\nProduct = Lower right. This is what the discourse has created\n\nTruth = Lower left. This is what the discourse attempted to express\n\nThe four variables which occupy these positions are :\n\nS1 = the master signifier\n\nS2 = knowledge (\"le savoir\")\n\n$ = the subject (barred)\n\na = the objet petit a or surplus-\"jouissance\"\n\nS1 refers to \"the marked circle of the field of the Other,\" it is the Master-Signifier. S2 is the \"battery of signifiers, already there\" at the place where \"one wants to determine the status of a discourse as status of statement,\" that is knowledge (\"savoir\"). S1 comes into play in a signifying battery conforming the network of knowledge. $ is the subject, marked by the unbroken line (\"trait unaire\") which represents it and is different from the living individual who is not the locus of this subject. Add the \"objet petit a\", the object-waste or the loss of the object that occurred when the originary division of the subject took place — the object that is the cause of desire: the \"plus-de-jouir\".\n\nDiscourse of the Master:\n\nIt is the basic discourse from which the other three derive. The dominant position is occupied by the master signifier, S1, which represents the subject, S, for all other signifiers: S2. In this signifying operation there is a surplus: \"objet a\". All attempts at totalisation are doomed to fail. This discourse masks the division of the subject, it illustrates the structure of the dialectic of the master and the slave. The master, S1, is the agent who puts the slave, S2, to work: the result is a surplus, \"objet a\", that the master struggles to appropriate.\n\nDiscourse of the University:\n\nIt is caused by an anticlockwise quarter turn of the previous discourse. The dominant position is occupied by knowledge (\"savoir\"). An attempt to mastery can be traced behind the endeavors to impart neutral knowledge: domination of the other to whom knowledge is transmitted. This hegemony is visible in modernity with science.\n\nDiscourse of the Hysteric:\n\nIt is effected by a clockwise quarter turn of the discourse of the master. It is not simply \"that which is uttered by the hysteric,\" but a certain kind of articulation in which any subject may be inscribed. The divided subject, $, the symptom, is in the pole position. This discourse points toward knowledge. \"The cure involves the structural introduction of the discourse of the hysteric by way of artificial conditions\": the analyst hystericizes the analysand's discourse.\n\nDiscourse of the Analyst:\n\nIt is produced by a quarter turn of the discourse of the hysteric in the same way as Freud develops psychoanalysis by giving an interpretative turn to the discourse of his hysterical patients.

He studied music as a child and, at the age of eighteen, was admitted to the \"Conservatoire de Paris\" on 12 May 1806, where he studied violin under François Habeneck and harmony under Charles Simon Catel.\n\nHe created a group of musicians who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music. Sudre trained Édouard Deldevez and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet. A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet. The trio toured France, answering questions from the audience using Sudre's violin. A military application quickly presented itself. A bugler on a battlefield could transmit orders to a regiment by playing an appropriate tune. This promising hypothesis came to nothing because the system was too vulnerable to wind and weather.\n\nClearly grasping at straws, Sudre then offered the military a set of musical canons, but they declined the suggestion. In 1829 Sudre began to develop the system that is now known as the Do Re Mi method of notating music. \n"}

It resembles Antillean Creole, but there are some lexical and grammatical differences between them. Antilleans can generally understand French Guianan Creole, though the notable differences between the French creole of French Guiana and those of the rest of the Atlantic may cause some instances of confusion. The differences consist of more French and Brazilian Portuguese influences (due to the proximity of Brazil and Portuguese presence in the country for several years). There are also words of Amerindian and African origin. There are Guianan communities in Suriname and Guyana who continue to speak Guianan Creole.\n\nIt should not be confused with the Guyanese Creole language, based on English, spoken in nearby Guyana.\n\nGuianan Creole was a language spoken between slaves and settlers. But the conditions of Guianan Creole's constitution were quite different from the Creole of the West Indies, on the one hand because of the conflicts between French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish, and French dialects such as the Caen Have greatly influenced Guianan Creole, which has made it significantly different from the Creoles of Martinique, Haiti, St. Lucia and Guadeloupe.\n\nThere are, therefore, in Guianan Creole a few words in common with the Creoles of the West Indies, however, a number of words differentiate them significantly.\n\nIn addition, the Guianan pronounce the letter \" 'r' \".

The first part of his life was full of struggles and hardships. After having associated for many years with the Hasidim, he settled at Lemberg; and through the efforts of some of his friends, such as Rapoport, Krochmal, and others, he obtained pupils whom he instructed in Hebrew language and other subjects. This comparatively happy state lasted for only three years (1813–16). Jacob Orenstein, chief rabbi of Lemberg, having been apprised of the existence among his flock of a small band occupied with the study of secular subjects, excommunicated them all. Deprived thus of his pupils, the only means of his subsistence, he settled in the neighboring town of Brody. There he struggled for a while, until he resolved to study medicine.\n\nErter entered (1825) the University of Budapest, where he studied medicine for five years and passed all the prescribed examinations; he then practised his new profession in various Galician towns, including Brody, where he made himself especially popular among the poor and needy, who found in him a kindly benefactor. He died at Brody.\n\nHe composed a number of Hebrew satires, which have procured for him a prominent place among modern Hebrew satirists. For a time he edited a Hebrew periodical entitled \"He-Halutz,\" which was intended chiefly to promote culture and enlightenment among the Galician Jews. The periodical also advocated the establishment in Galicia of agricultural colonies for the employment and benefit of young Jews, and received some support from Vienna.\n\nErter's fame rests chiefly on his satires, published under the title \"Ha-Tzofeh le-Bet Yisrael\" (Vienna, 1858; ib. 1864), with a biography of the author and introduction by Max Letteris. They are six in number, and are admirable in form and style. Their titles are: \"Mozne Mishqal\"; \"Ha-Tzofeh be-Shubo mi-Karlsbad\"; \"Gilgul ha-Nefesh\"; \"Tashlikh\"; \"Telunat Sani we-Sansani we-Samangaluf\"; \"Ḥasidut we-Ḥokmah.\" The most attractive of these is \"Gilgul ha-Nefesh,\" the story of the many adventures of a soul during a long earthly career; how it frequently passed from one body into another, and how it had once left the body of an ass for that of a physician. The soul gives the author the following six rules, by observing which he might succeed in his profession:\n\nErter also wrote some Hebrew verse; but this won little acclaim compared to his prose, which Heinrich Grätz described as comparable in many points to that of Heinrich Heine.\n\n\n"}

The son of a cap maker, he attended the Baron Hirsch school and then gymnasium.\n\nAround 1920, he moved to Dresden, Germany, where, in 1925, he co-published a short-lived German-language literary and art magazine, \"Mob: Zeitschrift der Jungen\" (Mob: Journal of youths). He subsequently lived in France, Switzerland, and Austria, before returning to Dresden.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1933, he operated an art gallery in Dresden, called \"Galerie junge Kunst\" (Gallery of young art). After the rise of the National Socialist regime in Germany, he moved to Belgrade (then in Yugoslavia), where he opened another gallery and mounted exhibitions, in 1933-1934.\n\nIn 1935, he moved to Poland; he spent time in Vilna (Vilnius) and Warsaw, and published articles on art in Yiddish-language periodicals, including \"Literarishe bleter\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he fled to the Soviet Union, and survived the war in Kazakhstan, where he taught German in a middle school.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Poland and settled in Warsaw, in 1946. There he became the leader of the Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts (Polish: Żydowskie Towarzystwo Krzewienia Sztuk Pięknych; Yiddish: Yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst), or ZTKSP, a revival of an organization that had been active in Poland before the war. The Society provided material assistance to Jewish artists, helped to promote their work, and fostered art education for Jewish youth. It mounted some 98 exhibitions in Warsaw, and four exhibitions that were presented throughout Poland – two devoted to the work of individual artists, Rafael Mandelzweig, in 1946, and Lea Grundig, in 1949; and two, in 1948, in honor of the fifth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, featuring works of Jewish artists who were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the ZTKSP, in September 1949, the art works that Sandel and his colleagues had assembled were integrated into the collections of the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw. From 1950 to 1953 the institute operated a Gallery of Jewish Art, with Sandel serving as director.\n\nSandel subsequently devoted himself to the writing of several art historical works concerning Jewish artists in Poland. Among his works, all written in Yiddish, is a two-volume biographical reference work on Jewish artists who perished in the Holocaust, \"Umgekumene yidishe kinstler in Poylen\" (Jewish artists in Poland who perished; Warsaw, 1957).\n\nSandel married Ernestyna Podhorizer (1903-1984), who was also originally from Galicia and worked for a time as the secretary of the ZTKSP. Sandel-Podhorizer was born in Dembits (Dębica), and before the war had been a biology teacher in Lemberg (Lviv); she was later a curator at the museum of the Jewish Historical Institute, and also worked at the Biology Institute in Warsaw.\n\n"}
{"id": "34331496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34331496", "title": "Kill zone", "text": "Kill zone\n\nIn military tactics, the kill zone, also known as killing zone, is an area entirely covered by direct and effective fire, an element of ambush within which an approaching enemy force is trapped and destroyed. The objective of the ambush force is to quickly kill or capture all enemy soldiers inside the kill zone. The trapped soldiers may respond by counterattacking.\n\nThe term is used in the analogous non-lethal sense in paintball and airsoft tactics.\n\nThe kill zone is an element of point ambush in which a military unit targets a single area with offensive fire such as mines, demolitions and section-level weapons. The kill zone may be bordered by obstacles, traps or indirect fire (artillery or mortars) to keep the enemy from escaping. In an area ambush, related multiple kill zones will be covered by multiple kill teams. The weapons of the kill team are not fired until the majority of the enemy unit is within the kill zone, ideally all of the targeted unit. Direct and effective fire is initiated by the kill team leader who orders simultaneous targeted firing by all members of the kill team. The attack is often initiated by remote-controlled charges such as Claymore mines or other explosives. The ambushed unit may be prevented from advancing or retreating by explosions at the front and rear of their column. Individual kill team members are to choose targets within the kill zone using machine gun and small arms fire but may be augmented by indirect fire. Ideally, the action is completed so quickly that the enemy force has no time to report the engagement. A successful ambush may result in a patrol in the kill zone being destroyed in seconds. The ambush of a kill zone carries high risk in that forces not in the zone may maneuver around the flanks of the attackers, limiting their escape. For this reason a properly executed ambush employs covering teams and relief teams in addition to the kill team(s). Nearby forces may also come to the assistance of those caught in the attack. Therefore, a well-executed attack may be over in under a minute and should rarely extend beyond a few minutes.\n\nA military unit that finds itself suddenly under fire in an enemy kill zone must immediately take action against the ambushers. Such action may include soldiers assuming a prone position to minimize themselves as targets. Prone soldiers will return fire toward the ambushers. Other responses may include the targeted soldiers immediately assaulting suspected defensive positions. Soldiers outside of the kill zone may direct suppressive fire at the ambushers in support of the assault, and they may advance upon the flanks of the ambushers.\n\nVehicles in the kill zone will likely attempt to leave it, while vehicle gunners fire toward the ambushers. Disabled vehicles may create cover for ambushed soldiers. Soldiers able to leave their disabled vehicles are expected to join the assault against the ambushers.\n\nThe kill zone should isolate and trap the enemy. The selection of a likely kill zone involves evaluating the terrain and making up for any inadequacies. First and foremost, the kill zone must be where the enemy is expected to travel, or where the enemy can be attracted with \"bait\". If the potential kill zone terrain restricts vehicle movement to one vehicle width at a time, then a suddenly disabled vehicle will help to isolate the enemy. Terrain that keeps the enemy from moving out of the kill zone is useful for isolation, otherwise the ambushers will wish to place obstacles or munitions at the borders of the selected area. Especially important is separation between the enemy and the ambushing units, to prevent a counterattack.\n\nMilitary units on the move are vulnerable to ambush. To avoid the kill zone, a patrol may \"fan out\" and travel with elements spread out left and right, rather than staying solely on a road or track. Soldiers who take point must keep an eye out for signs of a kill zone, such as disturbed ground, obstacles and restrictive terrain. Night vision and thermal imaging equipment may help to discover hidden weapons, or enemy soldiers under cover.\n\nThe term \"kill zone\" is used in paintball tactics to designate an area that is heavily defended by enemy paintball players. Advancing players may know the location of the potential kill zone but be uncertain whether it is well-defended. Responses vary to being caught in a paintball kill zone. If the kill zone is too large and the enemy forces relatively far away, the ambushed players often retreat to cover. If the kill zone is small, the ambushed players are likely to charge forward and assault the defensive players. Fellow players who are not caught in the kill zone are likely to attack the flanks of the defensive players.\n"}

Conversely, every context-sensitive language which does not generate the empty string can be generated by a grammar in Kuroda normal form.\n\nA straightforward technique attributed to György Révész transforms a grammar in Kuroda's form to Chomsky's CSG: \"AB\" → \"CD\" is replaced by four context-sensitive rules \"AB\" → \"AZ\", \"AZ\" → \"WZ\", \"WZ\" → \"WD\" and \"WD\" → \"CD\".

{"id": "8934858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8934858", "title": "Lampung language", "text": "Lampung language\n\nLampung is the language of the Indonesian province of Lampung at the southern tip of Sumatra. It is a dialect cluster with two main dialects, perhaps distinct enough to be considered distinct languages: Abung/Pepadun (Lampung Nyo) and Pesisir/Say Batin (Lampung Api). A third, Komering, is sometimes considered part of Lampung Api, by others a distinct language. Lampung Api is the prestige variety.\n\nBefore the introduction of the Roman script, Lampung was written in a script called \"\"Aksara Lampung\" or \"Had Lampung\"\", which is a variant of the Ulu scripts used throughout central and south Sumatra. The script is seldom used today but is taught in schools throughout Lampung as a means of preserving its linguistic history.\n\nVoiceless stops occur in word-initial, word-medial, and word-final position. Word-final stops are generally unreleased. Voiced stops generally do not occur word-finally.\nThere seems to be only moderate evidence for a phonemic glottal stop.\n/r/ has a range of phonetic realizations but is most often a velar or uvular fricative [x],[ɣ], [χ],[ʁ].There is minor disagreement between the two earlier phonologies about /r/, described as an apical trill by Abdurrahman and as a voiceless velar fricative by Walker. Walker stated that this phoneme (written as /x/ in 1976 and as /r/ in his 1975 word \nlists) occurs in all major environments and is sometimes voiced intervocalically. Walker (1976:3) noted that [r] (apical trill) ‘occurs in unassimilated loanwords’ and alternates with [x] in many cases.\n\nThe nasals occur in word-initial, word-medial and word-final positions, with the exception of /ɲ/, which does not occur word-finally.\n/l/ occurs in word-initial, word-medial, and word-final position.\n/w/ and /j/ occur word-initially and word-medially and, depending on one's analysis, word-finally as part of diphthongs discussed below. Both phonemes occur word-medially in positions where they are not considered as transitions from [u] and [i] respectively.\n\nGemination, particularly consonant gemination, is a prominent feature in Lampung.It is not easy to generalize except to say that gemination happens most frequently in Nyo, less so but still frequently in Api, and almost never (at least as we and others have transcribed it) in Komering. Lampung people often did not agree among themselves which lexemes exhibit gemination but one can see that the phenomenon as we documented it clusters around specific lexemes. Several cases each of gemination are recorded for every consonant in medial only position (either between vowels or as part of a consonant \ncluster) except /ɲ/, /ŋ/, /s/, /w/ and /j/. Gemination is most frequently associated with one of two related environments: 1) penultimate schwa; and 2) reduction of voiceless nasal-stop clusters to the stop component. In this case other vowels are in some isolects neutralized to schwa. Gemination therefore can be significant for reconstruction.\n\nMetathesis seems to have been a fairly common process in Lampungic. From the correspondence sets can be counted at least twenty lexemes in which metathesis occurred in one or more of the Lampungic isolects. It most frequently occurred with consonants, \ne.g. *rihuʔ ‘cloud’ → \"hiruk\" and *gǝlar ‘name’ → \"gǝral,\" but also with vowels, often with some fairly complex transformations, e.g. *siwa ‘nine’ → \"suay\" and *lahia ‘ginger’ → \"liha.\"\n\nAbdurrahman posits the phoneme /o/ for Komering. However, we submit that most if not all occurrences of [o] in Komering can be more accurately analyzed as allophones of /ə/.\n\nWalker posits the phoneme /e/ in addition to /i/ and /ə/ for Way Lima. However, is to reanalyze most occurrences of [e] as allophones of /i/. Walker apparently did not preserve the distinction between [ə] and [e] in his word lists, as both phones are written using e. In addition, the examples he gives in his phonology for /e/ are likely all borrowed words.\nVowel sequences do occur, but a syllable break always occurs between them in our data. Such sequences are distinguished from the diphthongs /aw/, /ay/, and /uy/.\n\nThe Lampung language is written in an abugida, or alphasyllabary, called \"Aksara Lampung\" or \"Had Lampung\". It has 20 \"induk surat\" (19 consonants and one vowel), and 13 \"anak surat\" (diacritics). Had Lampung has been influenced by the Pallava script and the Arabic script. Belonging to the Brahmic family of scripts, it shares similarities with the Rejang alphabet, Rencong alphabet, Sundanese alphabet, and the Kawi script of Java.\n\nThe Lampung script which is used and taught today is the result of a revision of the old Lampung script.\n\nBingkai Perisai Bersegi Lima\nPerisai bersegi lima adalah mengambarkan tantang kesanggupan untuk mempertahankan dan menjalankan cita-cita dan tujuan luhur membangun daerah lampung untuk mencapai masyarakat yang adil dan makmur berdasarkan pancasila.\n\nThis is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (\"Pernyataan seduniya tentang Hak Dasar Jelema\")\n\n\n"}

The Kangean dialect may be a separate language. It was traditionally written in the Javanese script, but the Latin script and the Pegon script (based on Arabic script) is now more commonly used.

The word \"misnomer\" does \"not\" mean \"misunderstanding\" or \"popular misconception\", and a number of misnomers remain in common usage — which is to say, the fact of a word being a misnomer does not necessarily make usage of the word incorrect.\n\nSome of the sources of misnomers are:\n\n\nThe term \"anachronym\" (note well \"-chron-\") as defined in Garner's Modern English Usage refers to this type of misnomer. Examples cited by Garner include the persistence of the word \"dial\" in its telephoning sense after the rotary dial era and the persistence of the term \"tin foil\" in the aluminum foil era. Anachronyms should not be homophonously confused with anacronyms (note well \"-acro-\"), which are words such as \"laser\" and \"sonar\" that have acronymic origin but are generally no longer treated like conventional acronyms (that is, they are used syntactically like any other words, without obligate reference to their original expansions).\n\n"}
{"id": "70174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70174", "title": "Moral", "text": "Moral\n\nA moral (from Latin \"morālis\") is a message that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a story or event. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.\n\nAs an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of Aesop's fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is \"slow and steady wins the race\". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.\n\nThe use of stock characters is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in Shakespeare's plays, the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the Prologue to \"Romeo and Juliet\").\n\nThroughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In classical drama, for example, the role of the chorus was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the novels of Charles Dickens are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of Victorian Britain.\n\nMorals have typically been more obvious in children's literature, sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: \"The moral of the story is …\". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for ironic purposes.\n\nSome examples are: \"Better to be safe than sorry\" (precautionary principle), \"The evil deserves no aid\", \"Be friends with whom you don't like\", \"Don't judge people by the way they look\", \"Slow and steady wins the race\", \"Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny\", and \"Your overconfidence is your weakness\". Aesop's Fables are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.\n\nMorals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in children's literature. Part of the reason for this was the writings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, Thomas Day (1748–1789) wrote \"Sandford and Merton\", elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. Maria Edgeworth (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is \"The Purple Jar\". During this time, the theme of \"a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers\" (p. 93).\n\nThe ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.\n\n"}

These problems include abandoned calls, initial call delays, government regular, consumer dissatisfaction, and host of other problems.\n\nUnlike other types of dialers, natural predictive dialers insert agents before the automation component of the dialer (such as call progress analysis) has completed. For example, a standard predictive dialer will (1) first determine if a live person has answered the phone call and then (2) transfer that call to an agent that is deemed to be available to take the call. Conversely, natural predictive dialers connect the agent prior to the completion of the automation process, which allows the agent to hear the called party say \"hello\" while the automation is still working.\n\nAt its core, natural predictive dialing technologies are based on the concept that call automation should work with agents, instead of call automation working before agents are connected, and then agents being connected to calls that have been determined to be 'live' people. In natural predictive dialing the call automation (sometimes called Call Progress Analysis (CPA)) can work before during or after an agent has interfaced with a call. This interweaving of automation and human agents provides productivity increases traditionally associated with automation technologies, while working to eliminate the unnatural affect that many call automation technologies have on the human-interaction aspects of the call.\n\nThe core benefit of natural predictive dialing is the more pleasant human interactions that occur during calls that are actually being made by an automated system connected to agents. In natural predictive dialing, the agents hear the called party say \"hello\" and can respond accordingly. The technology works well on small and large scales (one user up to thousands). Contact centers that require a natural calling experience and wish to also have the productivity benefits associated with predictive dialing can utilize this technology to obtain both benefits.\n\nThe only commercially available natural predictive dialer is provided by a single vendor. Additionally, patents protecting the technology make it more expensive than many other systems, such as those available for free based on the Asterisk platform. Many contact centers and other organizations don't necessarily need the \nbenefits associated with the natural predictive dialing technology and can save money by using a more inexpensive or less-proprietary system.\n\n"}

{"id": "10378060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10378060", "title": "Scriptment", "text": "Scriptment\n\nA scriptment is a written work by a movie or television screenwriter that combines elements of a script and treatment, especially the dialogue elements, which are formatted the same as in a screenplay. It is a more elaborate document than a standard draft treatment. Some films have been shot using only a scriptment.\n\nThe term \"scriptment\" was originally coined by filmmaker James Cameron, possibly during his early involvement in the development of the \"Spider-Man\" film series. In that effort, after the success of his 1984 film \"The Terminator\", Cameron wrote a 57-page scriptment for the first proposed \"Spider-Man\" film, which was used by screenwriter David Koepp to write the first draft, incorporating it nearly word for word.\n\nCameron's scriptment for \"Titanic\" (1997) was 131 pages. The term became more widely known when Cameron's 1994 scriptment for the 2009 film \"Avatar\" was leaked on the internet during pre-production, although other directors, such as John Hughes and Zak Penn, had written scriptments before. The scriptment for \"Avatar\" (2009) and its notoriety caused the spread of the term.\n\nA scriptment borrows characteristics from both a regular screenplay and a film treatment and is comparable to a step outline: the main text body is similar to an elaborate draft treatment, while usually only major sequences receive scene location headings (slug lines), which is different from the extensive slug line formatting in standard screenplays, where every new scene or shot begins with an INT./EXT. DAY/NIGHT slug line set above the description or dialogue. However, just as a treatment can be short or long, a scriptment can exist in various degrees of completion depending on how much time the writer has devoted to it and a more fully developed one could have all slug lines in place, a great deal of dialogue, and only require the producer's (or a writing partner's) okay on the direction the finished script should take before proceeding further.\n\nIn a scriptment, scenes and shots may be separated as paragraphs or sentences and, if it is the writer's style, can also include an occasional explanatory note, such as might be important in an adaptation or a sequel. As with standard treatments, much of the dialogue is summarized in action. The longer the scriptment, however, the more likely it contains dialog scenes that are fully developed. Single words or brief phrases of dialogue can be included within the description and lengthier exchanges are formatted exactly as a regular screenplay, which is the main reason for the \"script\" part of the term.\n\nThe longer the scriptment, the more likely it is written shot to shot as opposed to scene by scene; thus, a long, detailed scriptment does not necessarily equate to a longer movie, as a typical 90-120 page screenplay written with master scenes contains many more individual shots than are immediately apparent.\n\nA scriptment can begin with FADE IN: top left and conclude with a centered THE END. It can have a title page like a script and lengthier treatment. It is written single spaced with an empty space between paragraphs and other elements and the pages are numbered in the upper right corner, just as in a screenplay.\n\nDirectors and screenwriters write scriptments as an intermediate stage in development from the draft treatment to the first draft of the screenplay. Like a draft treatment, a scriptment can be anywhere from 20 to 80 or more pages, while regular presentation treatments or outlines only summarize the plot, typically in not more than 30 pages.\n\n\n\n\n\nA scriptment can also be a presentation document; that is, one that is sold or handed in as the finished work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6392374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6392374", "title": "Sea captain", "text": "Sea captain\n\nA sea captain, ship's captain, captain, master, or shipmaster, is a high-grade licensed mariner who holds ultimate command and responsibility of a merchant vessel. The captain is responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the ship and its people and cargo, including its seaworthiness, safety and security, cargo operations, navigation, crew management, and legal compliance.\n\nThe captain ensures that the ship complies with local and international laws and complies also with company and flag state policies. The captain is ultimately responsible, under the law, for aspects of operation such as the safe navigation of the ship, its cleanliness and seaworthiness, safe handling of all cargo, management of all personnel, inventory of ship's cash and stores, and maintaining the ship's certificates and documentation.\n\nOne of a shipmaster's particularly important duties is to ensure compliance with the vessel's security plan, as required by the International Maritime Organization's ISPS Code. The plan, customized to meet the needs of each individual ship, spells out duties including conducting searches and inspections, maintaining restricted spaces, and responding to threats from terrorists, hijackers, pirates, and stowaways. The security plan also covers topics such as refugees and asylum seekers, smuggling, and saboteurs.\n\nOn ships without a purser, the captain is in charge of the ship's accounting. This includes ensuring an adequate amount of cash on board, coordinating the ship's payroll (including draws and advances), and managing the ship's slop chest.\n\nOn international voyages, the captain is responsible for satisfying requirements of the local immigration and customs officials. Immigration issues can include situations such as embarking and disembarking passengers, handling crew members who desert the ship, making crew changes in port, and making accommodations for foreign crew members. Customs requirements can include the master providing a cargo declaration, a ship's stores declaration, a declaration of crew members' personal effects, crew lists and passenger lists.\n\nThe captain has special responsibilities when the ship or its cargo are damaged, when the ship causes damage to other vessels or facilities. The master acts as a liaison to local investigators and is responsible for providing complete and accurate logbooks, reports, statements and evidence to document an incident. Specific examples of the ship causing external damage include collisions with other ships or with fixed objects, grounding the vessel, and dragging anchor. Some common causes of cargo damage include heavy weather, water damage, pilferage, and damage caused during loading/unloading by the stevedores.\n\nAll persons on board including public authorities, crew, and passengers are under the captain's authority and are his or her ultimate responsibility, particularly during navigation. In the case of injury or death of a crew member or passenger, the master is responsible to address any medical issues affecting the passengers and crew by providing medical care as possible, cooperating with shore-side medical personnel, and, if necessary, evacuating those who need more assistance than can be provided on board the ship.\n\nThere is a common belief that ship captains have historically been, and currently are, able to perform marriages. This depends on the country of registry, however most do not permit performance of a marriage by the master of a ship at sea.\n\nIn the United States Navy, a captain’s powers are defined by its 1913 Code of Regulations, specifically stating: \"The commanding officer shall not perform a marriage ceremony on board his ship or aircraft. He shall not permit a marriage ceremony to be performed on board when the ship or aircraft is outside the territory of the United States.\" However, there may be exceptions \"in accordance with local laws and the laws of the state, territory, or district in which the parties are domiciled\" and \"in the presence of a diplomatic or consular official of the United States, who has consented to issue the certificates and make the returns required by the consular regulations.\"\n\nFurthermore, in the United States, there have been a few contradictory legal precedents: courts did not recognize a shipboard marriage in California's 1898 \"Norman v. Norman\" but did in New York's 1929 \"Fisher v. Fisher\" (notwithstanding the absence of municipal laws so carried) and in 1933's \"Johnson v. Baker\", an Oregon court ordered the payment of death benefits to a widow because she had established that her marriage at sea was lawful. However, in \"Fisher v. Fisher\" the involvement of the ship's captain was irrelevant to the outcome. New Jersey's 1919 \"Bolmer v. Edsall\" said a shipboard marriage ceremony is governed by the laws of the nation where ownership of the vessel lies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the captain of a merchant ship has never been permitted to perform marriages, although from 1854 any which took place had to be reported in the ship's log.\n\nFilipino and Spanish law, as narrow exceptions, recognise a marriage \"in articulo mortis\" (on the point of death) solemnized by the captain of a ship or chief of an aeroplane during a voyage, or by the commanding officer of a military unit.\n\nJapan allows ship captains to perform a marriage ceremony at sea, but only for Japanese citizens. Malta and Bermuda permit captains of ships registered in their jurisdictions to perform marriages at sea. Princess Cruises, whose ships are registered in Bermuda, has used this as a selling point for their cruises, while Cunard moved the registration of its ships \"Queen Mary 2\", \"Queen Victoria\" and \"Queen Elizabeth\" from Southampton to Bermuda in 2011 to allow marriages to be conducted on their ships.\n\nSome captains obtain other credentials (such as ordination as ministers of religion or accreditation as notaries public), which allow them to perform marriages in some jurisdictions where they would otherwise not be permitted to do so. Another possibility is a wedding on a ship in port, under the authority of an official from that port.\n\nIn works of fiction, ship captains have performed marriages in various media, including the 1951 film \"The African Queen\", and episodes of \"The Love Boat\", \"How I Met Your Mother, The Office (U.S. TV series)\" and various \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nTo become a \"master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans\" in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a chief mate's license. The chief mate's license, in turn, requires at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a second mate's license, passing a battery of examinations, and approximately 13 weeks of classes. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 360 days (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) to have become a second mate.\n\nThere are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \"sea time\" and take a series of training classes and examinations.\n\nTraining institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), and the six state maritime academies in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, or California or the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. Furthermore, third mate's licenses can be obtained through the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and the U.S. Naval Academy with approved courses and requisite sea time as an Officer in Charge of a Navigational Watch.\n\nA seaman may start the process of obtaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a third mate's license.\n\nAn alternate method of obtaining a license as a master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans, without sailing as a third, second, or chief mate, is to obtain one year of sea service as a \"1st class pilot of any gross tons\" or \"mate of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters\". Then pass an examination for the license of \"master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters\". A master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters may, without any additional sea service, take the examination for \"master of vessels of any gross tons upon near coastal waters\". If the candidate does not already have sufficient deep sea experience he may with six months of additional sea service, in any licensed capacity, take a partial examination consisting primarily of celestial navigation and have the near coastal restriction removed.\n46CFR 11.403\n\nA master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.\n\nSome employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. A Chief Mate to Master formal training generally takes about 12 weeks and provides the knowledge, skills and other soft skills training to take on the duties and responsibilities.\n\nVarious US states require and issue shipmaster or captain licenses in order to be employed in operating a vessel for hire, while navigating within \"non-federal\" waters. (Such as a lake or river charter boat \"skipper\"). Most states honor a USCG master's certificate as an alternative to their state licensing. These state licenses certify that the captain has given satisfactory evidence that he/she can safely be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of operating or navigating passenger carrying vessels of the tonnage and upon the waters specified. The state licensed captains command vessels that range from small uninspected vessels to large excursion vessels that carry over 100 passengers, so the licenses are not issued haphazardly. For example, see Washington State's Certification of Charter Boats and Operators licenses.\n\nAs of 2008, the U.K. Learning and Skills Council lists annual salaries for senior deck officers as ranging from £22,000 to over £50,000 per year. The Council characterizes job opportunities for senior deck officers as \"generally good\" and expects a \"considerable increase\" in the job market over the next few years.\n\nAs of 2013, captains of U.S.-flagged deep sea vessels make up to US$1500 per day, or US$80,000 to US$300,000 per year. Captains of smaller vessels in the inland and coastal trade earn between US$350 and US$700 per day, or US$65,000 to $180,000 per year. Captains of large ferries average US$56,794 annually.\n\nIn 2005, 3,393 mariners held active unlimited master's licenses. 87 held near-coastal licenses with unlimited tonnage, 291 held unlimited tonnage master's licenses on inland and Great Lakes waters, while 1,044 held unlimited licenses upon inland waters only. Some 47,163 active masters licenses that year had tonnage restrictions, well over half of those being for near-coastal vessels of up to 100 tons gross tonnage.\n\nAs of 2006, some 34,000 people were employed as captains, mates, and pilots of water vessels in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 18% growth in this occupation, expecting demand for 40,000 shipmasters in 2016.\n\nUniforms are worn aboard many ships, or aboard any vessels of traditional and organized navigation companies, and are required by company regulation on passenger and cruise vessels.\n\nIn the passenger-carrying trade a unified corporate image is often desired and it is useful for those unfamiliar with the vessel to be able to identify members of the crew and their function. Some companies and some countries use an executive curl similar to that of the Royal Navy.\n\nIn the United States, and in numerous other maritime countries, captains and officers of shipping companies may wear a merchant navy or merchant marine regular uniform in conjunction with their employment.\n\nIn a few countries, such as UK, USA and Italy, some captains with particular experience in navigation and command at sea, may be named commodore or senior captain or \"shipmaster senior grade\".\n\nThe term \"master\" is descended from the Latin \"magister navis\", used during the imperial Roman age to designate the nobleman (patrician) who was in ultimate authority on board a vessel. The \"magister navis\" had the right to wear the \"laurus\" or \"corona laurèa\" and the \"corona navalis\". Carrying on this tradition, the modern-day shipmaster of some nations wears golden laurel leaves or golden oak leaves on the visor of his cap.\n\nA skipper is a person who has command of a boat or seacraft or tug, more or less equivalent to \"captain in charge aboard ship.\" At sea, or upon lakes and rivers, the skipper as shipmaster or captain has command over the whole crew. The skipper may or may not be the owner of the boat.\n\nThe word is derived from the Dutch word \"schipper\"; \"schip\" is Dutch for \"ship\". In Dutch \"sch-\" is pronounced and English-speakers rendered this as .\n\nThe word \"skipper\" is used more than \"captain\" for some types of craft, for example fishing boats.\n\nIt is also more frequently used than captain with privately owned noncommercial or semi-commercial vessels, such as small yachts and other recreational boats, mostly in cases where the person in command of the boat may not be a licensed or professional captain, suggesting the term is less formal. In the U.S., a \"skipper\" who is in command of a charter vessel that carries paying passengers must be licensed by a state or the USCG. If the vessel carries over six paying passengers, it must be an \"inspected vessel\" and a higher class license must be obtained by the skipper/master depending on the vessel's gross tons.\n\nIn the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and merchant naval slang, it is a term used in reference to the commanding officer of any ship, base, or other command regardless of rank. It is generally only applied to someone who has earned the speaker's respect, and only used with the permission of the commander/commanding officer in question.\n\nSkipper RNR was an actual rank used in the British Royal Naval Reserve for skippers of fishing boats who were members of the service. It was equivalent to Warrant Officer. Skippers could also be promoted to Chief Skipper RNR (equivalent to Commissioned Warrant Officer) and Skipper Lieutenant RNR.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "780587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=780587", "title": "Soft hyphen", "text": "Soft hyphen\n\nIn computing and typesetting, a soft hyphen (ISO 8859: 0xAD, Unicode , HTML: &#173; &shy;) or syllable hyphen (EBCDIC: 0xCA), abbreviated SHY, is a code point reserved in some coded character sets for the purpose of breaking words across lines by inserting visible hyphens. Two alternative ways of using the soft hyphen character for this purpose have emerged, depending on whether the encoded text will be broken into lines by its recipient, or has already been preformatted by its originator.\n\nThe use of SHY characters in text that will be broken into lines by the recipient is the application context considered by the post-1999 HTML and Unicode specifications, as well as some word-processing file formats. In this context, the soft hyphen may also be called a discretionary hyphen or optional hyphen. It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line. The soft hyphen's Unicode semantics and HTML implementation are in many ways similar to Unicode's zero-width space, with the exception that the soft hyphen will preserve the kerning of the characters on either side when not visible. The zero-width space, on the other hand, will not, as it is considered a visible character even if not rendered, thus having its own kerning metrics.\n\nTo show the effect of a soft hyphen in HTML, the following words have been separated with soft hyphens:\n\nOn HTML browsers supporting soft hyphens, resizing the window will re-break the above text only at word boundaries, and insert a hyphen at the end of each line.\n\nHTML4 describes it as a \"hyphenation hint\", though it suggests that that interpretation is not universal:\n\nIn HTML, there are two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the soft hyphen. The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a user agent as just another character. The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break can occur. Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics. If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen, the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as searching and sorting, the soft hyphen should always be ignored.\n\nThe SHY character is also used in text where paragraphs have already been broken into lines, such as certain plain text files, text sent to VT100-style terminal emulators or printers, or pages represented in page description languages. This is the application context originally considered by the EBCDIC and ISO 8859-1 standards and implemented in many VT100 terminal emulators.\n\nHere, SHY is a visible hyphen that is usually visually indistinguishable from a regular hyphen, but has been inserted solely for the purpose of line breaking. The purpose of the soft hyphen here is to distinguish it from any regular hyphen that might have been part of the original spelling of the word. This distinction helps re-use of already formatted text, when line breaks and soft hyphens inserted during word wrapping have to be removed to convert the text back into its unformatted form. For example, the copy or paste function of a terminal emulator can offer to replace line breaks with a space character, and remove any soft hyphens including any immediately following whitespace characters.\n\nAn example application that outputs soft hyphens for this reason is the groff text formatter as used on many Unix/Linux systems to display man pages.\n\nSHY characters in coded characters sets, roughly in chronological order:\n\nOther commands for marking hyphenation opportunities in text formatting languages (similar to the HTML 4 and Unicode 4.0 interpretation of SHY):\n\nSoft hyphens have been used to obscure malicious domains or URLs in e-mail spam.\n\n"}

Subba Rao (1920–1984) (Taluku Ramaswami Subba Rao (), popularly known as TaRaSu) was a novelist and a scholar in Kannada language. He is considered as a harbinger of the Navya movement of Kannada literature. He is well known for his novels like \"Durgashtamana\", which won him the Sahitya Akademi award posthumously in 1985.\n\nTaRaSu was born on 21 April 1920 in Malebennur in the Karnataka state of India. His father Ramaswamaiah was a lawyer in the town of Harihar and his mother was Seethamma. His ancestors were from the village of Taluku in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka. He wrote his first story called \"Puttana Chendu\" (Putta's ball) to win a bet against his uncle TS Venkannaiah who made self-less contribution to Kannada language through promoting many prominent authors. When he was 17 years old, he joined the Indian freedom movement and went around the villages in the Chitradurga district, singing patriotic songs and giving speeches for independence. He was arrested and jailed when he was giving one of the speeches in Bagur village.\n\nFearing that his son would lose out on education by joining the freedom movement, Ramaswamaiah admitted his son to the National School in Bangalore. After completing his secondary education, TaRaSu joined a college in Shimoga. After completing his junior intermediate education, he joined a college in Tumkur to complete senior intermediate education. However, the students started boycotting the classes due to the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and others during the Quit India movement. He and his friends started making plans to join the movement. This came to the notice of the police, who arrested TaRaSu and jailed him. He was released in the month of December 1942. He decided that he was not going to study further unless India attains independence. He was an atheist in early life but converted into a believer in the later stages.\n\nTaRaSu's came from a literary family. His niece Vishalakshi Dakshinamurthy, is a notable Kannada Novelist and writer famous for his novel based film Jeevana Chaitra which starred Dr.Rajakumar, well known Kannada Actor. TaSu Sham Rao, was also related to TaRaSu.\n\nIn 1942, TaRaSu went to Bangalore and joined as a sub-editor for the Kannada newspaper, \"VishwaKarnataka\", earning a paltry sum of Rs. 25 as salary per month. During this period, he married \"Ambuja\". He later worked for the \"Prajamatha\", \"Vahini\" and \"Navodaya\" newspapers. His career in journalism also included a stint with \"Prajavani\", \"Mysuru\", \"Kaladoota\" and \"Vicharavani\" newspapers.\n\nTaRaSu was initially influenced by the Pragatisheela writings of the Kannada scholar A. N. Krishna Rao. Hence, his initial writings belong to the pragatisheela style and contain novels like \"Purushavatara\" and \"Munjavininda Munjavu\". These writings mainly deal with the issues faced by the downtrodden and the lower caste society. Occasionally, he also came up with novels that were not of this genre, like \"Chandavalliya Thota\" which was based on a Gandhian theme of rural life in India. Some of his most celebrated novels include \"Masanada Hoovu\", which talks about the plight of prostitutes and \"Hamsa Geethe\", which talks about the life of a musician in the context of Chitradurga being passed from the hands of the Palaiyakkarars to Hyder Ali. Both of these novels have been made into films in Kannada. \"Hamsageethe\" was chosen as a text book for graduation classes and a Hindi film, Basant Bahar, was based on it.\n\nTaRaSu has also written many historical novels, the most famous being Durgaastamana (fall of the Durga fort), which won him the Sahitya Akademi award in 1985. This was the last novel that he wrote and it talks of the fall of Chitradurga Palaiyakkarars under the hands of Hyder Ali. His another historical novel based on Chitradurga's history is \"Kambaniya Kuyilu\" and its sequels \"Tirugubana\" and \"Raktaratri\". He also wrote a novel called \"Shilpashree\" which is based on Chavundaraya, the person who commissioned the statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola. For nearly two decades, much of the historical source material for his numerous novels were sufficed by the eminent Indian historian S. Srikanta Sastri. S. Srikanta Sastri even wrote an erudite and scholarly foreword to one of Ta. Ra. Su.'s famous novels – \"Nrupatunga\". TaRaSu experimented with various narrative styles and was the first author to introduce the stream-of-consciousness literary technique in Kannada. He also used the Indian independence movement as a background in his novels, like \"Rakta Tarpana\". When the Navya (modernist) movement of Kannada literature was in its infancy, TaRaSu contributed to its growth by coming up with various books belonging to this genre, like his collection of short stories, \"Girimalligeya Nandanadalli\" which shows the confusion during the shift from progressive to modernist form of literature.\n\nTaRaSu had planned to write many more books but they remained incomplete. This includes his autobiography, \"Hindirugi Nodidaaga\" (As I look back). He died on 10 Apr 1984. The autobiography was completed by his wife and released in 1990.\n\n\nThe novels Kambaniya Kuyilu, Rakta Ratri, Tirugu BaaNa, Hosahagalu, Vijayotsava, Rajyadaaha, Kasturi KankaNa and Durgaastamaana are part of his historical saga of Chitradurga.\n\n"}
{"id": "1824656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1824656", "title": "Temple Entry Proclamation", "text": "Temple Entry Proclamation\n\nThe Temple Entry Proclamation was issued by Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma in 1936 and abolished the ban on the so called 'low caste people' or \"avarnas\" from entering Hindu temples in the Princely State of Travancore, now part of Kerala, India.\n\nThe proclamation was a milestone in the history of Travancore and Kerala. Today, Temple Entry Proclamation Day is considered to be a social reformation day by the Government of Kerala.\n\nFollowing the campaign to introduce social reform in Travancore inspired by the teachings of Narayana Guru and others, a deputation of six leaders appointed by the Harijan Sevak Sangh toured the princely state to obtain support from caste Hindus for so called untouchable people to be allowed to enter state-operated temples.\n\nAccording to historian Romila Thapar, protests in 1924–25 against the prohibition of untouchables using a public road near a temple in Vaikom were a significant precursor to the temple entry movement. Known as the Vaikom Satyagraha, the protests sought equal rights of access in areas previously restricted to members of upper castes. The protests expanded to become a movement seeking rights of access to the interior of the temples themselves. These peaceful protests inspired the future \"satyagrahas\" of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn 1932, Chithira Thirunal appointed a committee to examine the question of temple entry. This opened the possibility of reversing the opposition to the practice that had been shown by his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal and Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. Subsequent to a meeting with Gandhi, Bayi had released those who had been imprisoned by Moolam Thirunal for involvement with the Vaikom Satyagraha and had opened the north, south and west public roads that provided access to Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes. She refused to open the eastern road to the temple because it was used by Brahmins. She avoided acting on Gandhi's advice by pointing out that she was a regent for her minor nephew, Chithira Thirunal and so had no power to do so.\n\nAnnoyed with this response Gandhi asked the 12-year-old prince, who immediately promised that it would happen during his reign. This incident was later quoted by K. R. Narayanan, the former President of India, in his speech referring to the progressive mind of Chithira Thirunal. \n\nThe Regent's refusal to act on temple entry rights attracted criticism from people such as Mannathu Padmanabhan, who accused her of being under the influence of the Brahmins and said that her excuse that she had no power to decide was a lie.\n\nChithira Thirunal signed the Proclamation on the eve of his 24th birthday in 1936. C. P. Ramaswami Aiyer said of the decision that: \n\nIn an open letter addressed to the maharajah, Gandhi said: \n\nHistorians believe that it was Aiyar's legal skill that overcame the practical difficulties posed by the orthodox Hindus before the proclamation. He foresaw the objections that could be raised against temple entry and dealt with them one by one. He was also able to ensure that the actual declaration was known beforehand to few people.\n\nThe Universities of Andhra and Annamalai conferred D.Litt degrees on the Maharajah and life-size statues of him were erected in Trivandrum and Madras.\n\nSociologists believe that the Proclamation struck at the root of caste discrimination in Travancore and that by serving to unite Hindus it prevented further conversions to other religions. The Proclamation was the first of its kind in a princely state as well as in British India. Even though there were agitations in various parts of India as well as rest of Kerala for temple entry, none managed to achieve their aim.\n\nThe Travancore Temple Entry Proclamation did not have a serious influence in Cochin or British Malabar as the Maharajah of Cochin and the Zamorin were staunch opponents of temple entry for dalits. The Cochin Maharajah went to the extent of declaring the whole people of Travancore as untouchables and forbade any Travancore citizen from entering temples under the control of the Cochin government. The Cochin ruler even forbade rituals like \"Arattu\" (holy bathing) and \"Para\" (holy procession) in Tripunithura and Chottanikkara temples.\n\nEven when universal temple entry was granted in 1947 the Cochin maharajah made an exemption in the bill so as to keep his family temple, \"Sree Poornathrayeesha\", out of the purview of temple entry. The Zamorin of Malabar had no wish to change the existing customs and usages in temples; on hearing the news of the Travancore Temple Entry proclamation he said that the Travancore Maharajah had freedom to give temple entry right to his subjects but he was unable to do so as he was only a trustee of the temples which were under the supervision of Hindu Religions Endowment Board. He also sent a memorandum to the authorities claiming no one had the authority to take decisions regarding temple entry as they were private properties. Universal temple entry was only granted in Malabar region in 1947 after India's independence.\n\n"}
{"id": "38532369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38532369", "title": "Text to speech in digital television", "text": "Text to speech in digital television\n\nText to speech in digital television refers to digital television products that use speech synthesis (computer generated speech providing a product that “talks” to the end user) to enable access by blind or partially sighted people. By combining a digital television solution (a television, set-top box, personal video recorder or other type of receiver) with a speech synthesis engine, blind and partially sighted people are able to access information that is displayed to other users visually on the screen and therefore can operate the menus and electronic program guides of the receiver.\n\nUsing an audiovisual medium involves obvious problems for certain groups of people with disabilities, notably individuals with sight or hearing loss. These problems can be split between interface accessibility barriers and impediments in using the content itself. Text-to-speech in television products is a feature that addresses interface accessibility barriers for blind and partially sighted people who are unable to use in the standard visual interface even where this has special features such as large fonts, magnifiers, adjustable colour schemes, etc.\n\nDigital television solutions are often more complicated products compared to their analogue ancestors. The ability to navigate many menus, to see on-screen program information and to browse electronic program guides or on-screen content listings to find out what is available to watch – these are all essential to using digital TV.\n\nPolicy makers across the world have recognized the importance of access to (digital) television:\n\nText-to-speech software has been widely available for desktop computers since the 1990s and Moore’s Law increases in CPU and memory capabilities have contributed to making their inclusion in software and hardware solutions more feasible. In the wake of these trends in information technology, text-to-speech is finding its way into everyday consumer electronics. In addition to text-to-speech solutions for computers, there are now talking watches and clocks, calendars, thermometers, kitchen aids and many other products. Talking books have also been around for some time, and GPS navigation systems have become widely used as well.\n\nOrganisations representing blind and partially sighted people are long-standing supporters of text-to-speech technology in consumer electronics. In the UK, the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has been arguing for speaking radio and television products since the early years of the century and has supported manufacturers in creating such solutions.\n\nThe Digital TV Group, the UK Industry association for Digital TV, first discussed the topic in 2007 and subsequently brought the industry together to write a technical specification for Text to Speech in the horizontal market in 2009. This formed part of the UK Government BERR Usability Action Plan. When complete, this was submitted to Digital Europe for ETSI standardisation and also published as a White Paper. Subsequently this was incorporated in the U-Book - UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines, including Text to Speech.\n\nIn 2010, two talking products for digital television came onto the market in the UK. The Sky Talker is an add-on for the Sky set top box. It provides talking features for programme and channel information and play back control. The Sky Talker is operated through the standard Sky remote control. In the same year, the Smart Talk Freeview (terrestrial digital broadcasting) set-top box was also launched onto the UK market. This is a Goodmans branded Freeview set top box, developed by a partnership between Harvard International Ltd and the RNIB. It was the first complete talking solution for digital television in the UK, including speaking of the Electronic Programme Guide, menus and providing spoken assistance during setup.\n\nIn Japan, both Panasonic and Mitsubishi Electric have been producing television and Blu-ray products since 2010. According to information compiled by the Japanese blindness organisation Lighthouse for the Blind there are some 70-odd products from Mitsubishi and a similar amount from Panasonic with talking features.\n\nAround 2011, in Spain a talking, Linux-based, set-top box solution using the free Festival text-to-speech engine, was distributed to blind and visually impaired people free of charge by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. This product is however no longer available.\n\nIn 2012, Panasonic launched its Voice Guidance solution on the UK market. This is a set of talking features for their 2012 Viera range (and beyond). Voice Guidance announces on-screen information and the most important menus and has support for reminders, recording and playback functions. It is available for Freesat and Freeview receivers. In creating its solution, Panasonic took into account advice from RNIB experts.\n\nAlso in 2012, TVonics, a former UK digital video recorder maker, launched its talking PVR solution, a twin-tuner Freeview HD recorder based on the Ivona TTS engine which is widely lauded by disability groups for its high quality voice. The TVonics solution was essentially a software addition for its existing platform and can be deployed as a software upgrade to customers of existing products. TVonics went into administration in June 2012. The RNIB acquired the core DVR IP including the text-to-speech system. The TVonics brand was bought by Peterborough-based Pulse-Eight.\n\nAs a primary purpose of text-to-speech in television products is to render these accessible to blind and partially sighted people, talking features ideally should cover all television operations, from the initial setup, over basic and advanced receiver functions to programming and playback. In practice, there are significant technical challenges, in particular with regard to dynamic information, interactive applications, catch-up and on-demand functions in Connected TVs and dialogue handling that mean that none of the current text-to-speech products cover 100% of all features through their talking interface.\n\nThe main principle in developing text-to-speech solutions for digital television products should be to create a talking interface that achieves functional equivalence of what a sighted user can do using the default (visual) interface. Specifically, the intention is that a person operating the solution via the text-to-speech system gets the same feedback and can perform the same tasks as someone doing this via the default interface (commonly the screen in combination with a remote control).\n\nInteraction with interactive services and widgets.\n\nDifferent consumers have different profiles of abilities and preferences. This is also true for blind and partially sighted people using text-to-speech enabled television products. In addition, novice users tend to require more guidance in the early stages of using a product, whereas more advanced users will prefer to be able to navigate the system as efficiently as possible. Consequently, the text-to-speech part of a talking television solution should allow user control and customisation options over its functions:\n\nAs blind and partially sighted users are the main target group for text-to-speech in digital television, particular attention should be given to supporting those features of the product that are of most value to this consumer group.\n\nIn particular, the ability to control the Audio Description/Video Description related settings of the product is of great importance to these users in those countries where such services are available. Audio Description/Video Description provides an additional narrative describing visual actions or elements that a blind or partially sighted person would not see, but which are important in order to follow the story. Typically, the narration includes characters, scene changes, on screen text and other visual clues not otherwise included in the default sound stream.\n\nTalking features in the product should support in full the menus and other controls relating to Audio Description/Video Description (which also includes advertising the availability of this access service for content when browsing the Electronic Programme Guide and other content inventories).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn early effort to capture the user requirements and define a functional specification was undertaken by the Digital TV Group (DTG) in the UK, who published a White Paper on the subject. This White Paper has since been subsumed into the publication UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines (known as the U-Book). The same White Paper was also used as the basis for a discussion between disability user groups and DigitalEurope, a European industry body for manufacturers of consumer equipment, on the topic of text-to-speech for television.\nThe DigitalEurope work stream led to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) setting up a project group (IEC 62731) to create an International Standard for text-to-speech in digital television. The first edition of the standard, IEC 62731:2013 was published officially as an International Standard in January 2013. The Standard does not dictate implementation, but provides a functional description on how a text-to-speech enabled television product should behave and what should be spoken when.\n\n"}
{"id": "42037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42037", "title": "Unconscious mind", "text": "Unconscious mind\n\nThe unconscious mind (or the unconscious) consists of the processes in the mind which occur automatically and are not available to introspection, and include thought processes, memories, interests, and motivations.\n\nEven though these processes exist well under the surface of conscious awareness they are theorized to exert an impact on behavior. The term was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that unconscious phenomena include repressed feelings, automatic skills, subliminal perceptions, thoughts, habits, and automatic reactions, and possibly also complexes, hidden phobias and desires.\n\nThe concept was popularized by the Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. In psychoanalytic theory, unconscious processes are understood to be directly represented in dreams, as well as in slips of the tongue and jokes.\n\nThus the unconscious mind can be seen as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (the things that we have learned so well that we do them without thinking).\n\nIt has been argued that consciousness is influenced by other parts of the mind. These include unconsciousness as a personal habit, being unaware, and intuition. Phenomena related to semi-consciousness include awakening, implicit memory, subliminal messages, trances, hypnagogia, and hypnosis. While sleep, sleepwalking, dreaming, delirium, and comas may signal the presence of unconscious processes, these processes are seen as symptoms rather than the unconscious mind itself.\n\nSome critics have doubted the existence of the unconscious.\n\nThe term \"unconscious\" () was coined by the 18th-century German Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling (in his \"System of Transcendental Idealism\", ch. 6, § 3) and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge (in his \"Biographia Literaria\"). Some rare earlier instances of the term \"unconsciousness\" (\"\") can be found in the work of the 18th-century German physician and philosopher Ernst Platner.\n\nInfluences on thinking that originate from outside of an individual's consciousness were reflected in the ancient ideas of temptation, divine inspiration, and the predominant role of the gods in affecting motives and actions. The idea of internalised unconscious processes in the mind was also instigated in antiquity and has been explored across a wide variety of cultures. Unconscious aspects of mentality were referred to between 2500 and 600 BC in the Hindu texts known as the Vedas, found today in Ayurvedic medicine.\n\nParacelsus is credited as the first to make mention of an unconscious aspect of cognition in his work \"Von den Krankheiten\" (translates as \"About illnesses\", 1567), and his clinical methodology created a cogent system that is regarded by some as the beginning of modern scientific psychology. William Shakespeare explored the role of the unconscious in many of his plays, without naming it as such. In addition, Western philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Eduard von Hartmann, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche used the word unconscious.\n\nIn 1880, Edmond Colsenet supports at the Sorbonne, a philosophy thesis on the unconscious. Elie Rabier and Alfred Fouillee perform syntheses of the unconscious \"at a time when Freud was not interested in the concept\".\n\nPsychologist Jacques Van Rillaer points out that, \"the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. In 1890, when psychoanalysis was still unheard of, William James, in his monumental treatise on psychology (\"The Principles of Psychology\"), examined the way Schopenhauer, von Hartmann, Janet, Binet and others had used the term 'unconscious' and 'subconscious'\". Historian of psychology Mark Altschule observes that, \"It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance.\"\n\nVan Rilliaer could have also mentioned that Eduard von Hartmann published a book dedicated to this topic, \"Philosophy of the Unconscious,\" in 1869 -- long before anybody else.\n\nFurthermore, 19th century German psychologists, Gustav Fechner and Wilhelm Wundt, had begun to use the term in their experimental psychology, in the context of manifold, jumbled sense data that the mind organizes at an \"unconscious\" level before revealing it as a cogent totality in conscious form.\"\n\nSigmund Freud and his followers developed an account of the unconscious mind. It plays an important role in psychoanalysis.\n\nFreud divided the mind into the conscious mind (or the ego) and the unconscious mind. The latter was then further divided into the id (or instincts and drive) and the superego (or conscience). In this theory, the unconscious refers to the mental processes of which individuals make themselves unaware. Freud proposed a vertical and hierarchical architecture of human consciousness: the conscious mind, the preconscious, and the unconscious mind—each lying beneath the other. He believed that significant psychic events take place \"below the surface\" in the unconscious mind, like hidden messages from the unconscious. He interpreted such events as having both symbolic and actual significance.\n\nIn psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what a person is averse to knowing consciously. Freud viewed the unconscious as a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of psychological repression. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the symptom. In a sense, this view places the conscious self as an adversary to its unconscious, warring to keep the unconscious hidden. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary introspection, but are supposed to be capable of being \"tapped\" and \"interpreted\" by special methods and techniques such as meditation, free association (a method largely introduced by Freud), dream analysis, and verbal slips (commonly known as a Freudian slip), examined and conducted during psychoanalysis. Seeing as these unconscious thoughts are normally cryptic, psychoanalysts are considered experts in interpreting their messages.\n\nFreud based his concept of the unconscious on a variety of observations. For example, he considered \"slips of the tongue\" to be related to the unconscious in that they often appeared to show a person's true feelings on a subject. For example, \"I decided to take a summer curse\". This example shows a slip of the word \"course\" where the speaker accidentally used the word curse which would show that they have negative feelings about having to do this. Freud noticed that also his patient's dreams expressed important feelings they were unaware of. After these observations, he came to the conclusion that psychological disturbances are largely caused by personal conflicts existing at the unconscious level. His psychoanalytic theory acts to explain personality, motivation and mental disorders by focusing on unconscious determinants of behavior.\n\nFreud later used his notion of the unconscious in order to explain certain kinds of neurotic behavior. The theory of the unconscious was substantially transformed by later psychiatrists, among them Carl Jung and Jacques Lacan.\n\nIn his 1932/1933 conferences, Freud \"proposes to abandon the notion of the unconscious that ambiguous judge\".\n\nCarl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, developed the concept further. He agreed with Freud that the unconscious is a determinant of personality, but he proposed that the unconscious be divided into two layers: the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. The personal unconscious is a reservoir of material that was once conscious but has been forgotten or suppressed, much like Freud's notion. The collective unconscious, however, is the deepest level of the psyche, containing the accumulation of inherited psychic structures and archetypal experiences. Archetypes are not memories but images with universal meanings that are apparent in the culture's use of symbols. The collective unconscious is therefore said to be inherited and contain material of an entire species rather than of an individual. Every person shares the collective unconscious with the entire human species, as Jung puts it: [the] \"whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual\".\n\nIn addition to the structure of the unconscious, Jung differed from Freud in that he did not believe that sexuality was at the base of all unconscious thoughts.\n\nThe notion that the unconscious mind exists at all has been disputed.\n\nFranz Brentano rejected the concept of the unconscious in his 1874 book \"Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\", although his rejection followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre offers a critique of Freud's theory of the unconscious in \"Being and Nothingness\", based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. Philosopher Thomas Baldwin argues that Sartre's argument is based on a misunderstanding of Freud.\n\nErich Fromm contends that, \"The term 'the unconscious' is actually a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There is no such thing as \"the\" unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, \"of which we are unconscious\". If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious.\"\n\nJohn Searle has offered a critique of the Freudian unconscious. He argues that the Freudian cases of shallow, consciously held mental states would be best characterized as 'repressed consciousness,' while the idea of more deeply unconscious mental states is more problematic. He contends that the very notion of a collection of \"thoughts\" that exist in a privileged region of the mind such that they are \"in principle never accessible\" to conscious awareness, is incoherent. This is not to imply that there are not \"nonconscious\" processes that form the basis of much of conscious life. Rather, Searle simply claims that to posit the existence of something that is like a \"thought\" in every way except for the fact that no one can ever be aware of it (can never, indeed, \"think\" it) is an incoherent concept. To speak of \"something\" as a \"thought\" either implies that it is being thought by a thinker or that it could be thought by a thinker. Processes that are not causally related to the phenomenon called thinking are more appropriately called the nonconscious processes of the brain.\n\nOther critics of the Freudian unconscious include David Stannard, Richard Webster, Ethan Watters, Richard Ofshe, and Eric Thomas Weber.\n\nDavid Holmes examined sixty years of research about the Freudian concept of \"repression\", and concluded that there is no positive evidence for this concept. Given the lack of evidence for many Freudian hypotheses, some scientific researchers proposed the existence of unconscious mechanisms that are very different from the Freudian ones. They speak of a \"cognitive unconscious\" (John Kihlstrom), an \"adaptive unconscious\" (Timothy Wilson), or a \"dumb unconscious\" (Loftus & Klinger), which executes automatic processes but lacks the complex mechanisms of repression and symbolic return of the repressed.\n\nIn modern cognitive psychology, many researchers have sought to strip the notion of the unconscious from its Freudian heritage, and alternative terms such as \"implicit\" or \"automatic\" have come into currency. These traditions emphasize the degree to which cognitive processing happens outside the scope of cognitive awareness, and show that things we are unaware of can nonetheless influence other cognitive processes as well as behavior. Active research traditions related to the unconscious include implicit memory (see priming, implicit attitudes), and nonconscious acquisition of knowledge (see Lewicki, see also the section on cognitive perspective, below).\n\nIn terms of the unconscious, the purpose of dreams, as stated by Freud, is to fulfill repressed wishes through the process of dreaming, since they cannot be fulfilled in real life. For example, if someone were to rob a store and to feel guilty about it, they might dream about a scenario in which their actions were justified and renders them blameless. Freud asserted that the wish-fulfilling aspect of the dream may be disguised due to the difficulty in distinguishing between manifest content and latent content. The manifest content consists of the plot of a dream at the surface level. The latent content refers to the hidden or disguised meaning of the events in the plot. The latent content of the dream is what supports the idea of wish fulfillment. It represents the intimate information in the dreamer's current issues and childhood conflict.\n\nIn response to Freud's theory on dreams, other psychologists have come up with theories to counter his argument. Theorist Rosalind Cartwright proposed that dreams provide people with the opportunity to act out and work through everyday problems and emotional issues in a non-real setting with no consequences. According to her cognitive problem solving view, a large amount of continuity exists between our waking thought and the thoughts that exist in dreams. Proponents of this view believe that dreams allow participation in creative thinking and alternate ways to handle situations when dealing with personal issues because dreams are not restrained by logic or realism.\n\nIn addition to this, Allan Hobson and colleagues came up with the activation-synthesis hypothesis which proposes that dreams are simply the side effects of the neural activity in the brain that produces beta brain waves during REM sleep that are associated with wakefulness. According to this hypothesis, neurons fire periodically during sleep in the lower brain levels and thus send random signals to the cortex. The cortex then synthesizes a dream in reaction to these signals in order to try to make sense of why the brain is sending them. However, the hypothesis does not state that dreams are meaningless, it just downplays the role that emotional factors play in determining dreams.\n\nWhile, historically, the psychoanalytic research tradition was the first to focus on the phenomenon of unconscious mental activity, there is an extensive body of conclusive research and knowledge in contemporary cognitive psychology devoted to the mental activity that is not mediated by conscious awareness.\n\nMost of that (cognitive) research on unconscious processes has been done in the mainstream, academic tradition of the information processing paradigm. As opposed to the psychoanalytic tradition, driven by the relatively speculative (in the sense of being hard to empirically verify) theoretical concepts such as the Oedipus complex or Electra complex, the cognitive tradition of research on unconscious processes is based on relatively few theoretical assumptions and is very empirically oriented (i.e., it is mostly data driven). Cognitive research has revealed that automatically, and clearly outside of conscious awareness, individuals register and acquire more information than what they can experience through their conscious thoughts. (See Augusto, 2010, for a recent comprehensive survey.)\n\nFor example, an extensive line of research conducted by Hasher and Zacks has demonstrated that individuals register information about the frequency of events automatically (i.e., outside of conscious awareness and without engaging conscious information processing resources). Moreover, perceivers do this unintentionally, truly \"automatically,\" regardless of the instructions they receive, and regardless of the information processing goals they have. The ability to unconsciously and relatively accurately tally the frequency of events appears to have little or no relation to the individual's age, education, intelligence, or personality, thus it may represent one of the fundamental building blocks of human orientation in the environment and possibly the acquisition of procedural knowledge and experience, in general.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered an early example of a paper analog computer. Volvelles have been produced to accommodate organization and calculation in many diverse subjects. Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of astronomy books. They can be traced back to \"certain Arabic treatises on humoral medicine\" and to the Persian astronomer, Abu Rayhan Biruni (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the volvelle had many diverse uses. In \"Reinventing the Wheel\", author Jessica Helfand introduces twentieth-century volvelles with this:\n\nThe rock band Led Zeppelin employed a volvelle in the sleeve design for the album \"Led Zeppelin III\" (1970).\n\nTwo games from the game company Infocom included volvelles inside their package as \"feelies\": \"Sorcerer\" (1983) and \"A Mind Forever Voyaging\" (1985). Both volvelles served to impede copying of the games, because they contained information needed to play the game.\n\n\n"}

A language isolate, it is spoken by about 33,000 people primarily in northern Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname. It is notable for its unusual object–subject–verb word order. The 2015 Venezuelan film \"Gone with the River\" was spoken in Warao.\n\nThe language had an estimated 28,100 speakers in Venezuela as of 2007. The Warao people live chiefly in the Orinoco Delta region of northeastern Venezuela, with smaller communities in southwestern Trinidad (Trinidad and Tobago), western Guyana and Suriname. The language is considered endangered by UNESCO.\n\nThe language's basic word order has been analyzed as object–subject–verb, a very rare word order among nominative–accusative languages such as Warao.\n\nWarao phonology is similar to that of Japanese. The Warao consonant inventory is relatively simple:\n\n/b/ and /d, l̆/ are allophones of // and /ɾ/. There are five oral vowels and five nasal vowels . /u/ after /k/ within the beginning of words has a sound as /ɨ/.\n\nWarao appears to be a language isolate, unrelated to any recorded language in the region or elsewhere. Terrence Kaufman (1994) included it in his hypothetical Macro-Paezan family, but the necessary supporting work was never done. Julian Granberry connected many of the grammatical forms, including nominal and verbal suffixes, of Warao to the Timucua language of North Florida, also a language isolate. However, he has also derives Timucua morphemes from Muskogean, Chibchan, Paezan, Arawakan, and other Amazonian languages, suggesting multi-language creolization as a possible explanation for these similarities. This notion has met with skepticism and described by Lyle Campbell as \"in no way convincing\".\n\nGranberry also finds \"Waroid\" vocabulary items in Guajiro (from toponymic evidence it seems that the Warao or a related people once occupied Goajiro country) and in Taino (\"nuçay/nozay\" [nosái] \"gold\" in Ciboney — cf. Warao \"naséi símo\" \"gold\" (lit. \"yellow pebble\") — and \"duho\" \"ceremonial stool\" in Classic Taino — cf. Warao \"duhu\" \"sit, stool\"). Granberry & Vescelius (2004) note that toponymic evidence suggests that the pre-Taino Macorix language of Hispaniola and Guanahatabey language of Cuba may have been Waroid languages as well.\n\n"}
