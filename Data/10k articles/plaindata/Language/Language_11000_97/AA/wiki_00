The phrase was also used in French () by Auguste Forel, a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his (\"English\": \"Ants of Switzerland\") (1920). In 1922, the of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist \"protective\" organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase .\n\nThe slogan was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps. The slogan's use was implemented by SS officer Theodor Eicke at Dachau concentration camp and then copied by Rudolf Höss at Auschwitz.\n\nThe slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to Auschwitz I where the sign was erected by order of commandant Rudolf Höss. The Auschwitz I sign was made by prisoner-labourers including master blacksmith Jan Liwacz, and features an upside-down \"B\", which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.\n\nIn 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a \"wild camp\" in the city of Oranienburg, which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as Sachsenhausen). It can also be seen at the Dachau, Gross-Rosen, and Theresienstadt camps, as well as at Fort Breendonk in Belgium. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over the entrance gates of the Monowitz camp (also known as Auschwitz III). The slogan appeared at the Flossenbürg camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists. Primo Levi describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) at Monowitz.\n\nIn 1938 the Austrian political cabaret writer Jura Soyfer and the composer Herbert Zipper, while prisoners at Dachau Concentration Camp, wrote the \"Dachaulied\", or \"The\" \"Dachau\" \"Song\". They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily forced labour, and considered the motto over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a \"lesson\" taught by Dachau.\n\nIn \"The Kingdom of Auschwitz\", Otto Friedrich wrote about Rudolf Höss, regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:\n\nThe signs are prominently displayed, and were seen by all prisoners and staff—all of whom \nknew, suspected, or quickly learned that prisoners confined there would likely only be freed by death. The signs' psychological impact was tremendous.\n\nThe sign over the Auschwitz I gate was stolen in December 2009 and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish former neo-Nazi, and two Polish men were jailed as a result. The original sign is now in storage at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and a replica was put over the gate in its place.\n\nOn 2 November 2014, the sign over the Dachau gate was stolen. It was found on 28 November 2016 under a tarpaulin at a parking lot in Ytre Arna, a settlement north of Bergen, Norway's second-largest city.\n\n\n"}

Bimal Kar had gone by of Bihar like Jabalpur, Hazaribagh, Gomoh and Dhanbad. He died on 26 August 2003.\n\nBimal Kar has written many Bengali classics. He also wrote dramas depicting society.\n\nThe special ability of Kar was that he had many completely different narration styles. For example, he has written superb stories without any dialogue, and he has also written noteworthy ones almost entirely comprising dialogue. His mastery of the Western Bengal and Chhota Nagpur locales matched well his in-depth association with modern Calcutta. Another special strength was his willingness to think when necessary like a woman.\n\nHe was involved in myriad professions that later helped him write on varied subjects. His writings reflect a modern mind and have inspired many young writers whom he also supported at the start of their literary careers.\n\nFor children, He created the retired magician Kinkar Kishore Ray, alias Kikira who solved mysteries with his two assistants. He created another detective character called Victor.\n\nAfter moving to Kolkata, Bimal Kar worked as a journalist with Parag, Paschimbanga and Satyajug.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1982, he was associated with Desh where his novel Grahan was published in 1964. Asamay, also published in Desh, won him the Sahitya Akademi award in 1975. Kar won the Ananda Puraskar in 1967 and the Saratchandra Award from Calcutta University in 1981, among other honours.\n\nApart from Desh, the other magazines he was associated with were Shiladitya and Galpapatro.\n\nKar’s other works include novels like Dewal, Purna Apurna, Jadubansa and Balika Badhu. He introduced a new trend in Bengali short stories with his lucid language. He could win over the heart of the average reader of Bengali literature with his ability to craft characters and the fine art of storytelling. Many of his novels were made into films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also has to his credit several novels that were successfully adapted for the screen.

It is spoken by around 7,400 people mostly in Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil. The language is currently classified as \"highly endangered\".\n\nThe language is known by several names to both its speakers and outsiders. Traditionally it has been known as \"Carib\" or \"Carib proper\" in English, after its speakers, called the \"Caribs\" in English. It is known \"Caribe\" in Spanish, \"Galina\" in French, and \"Karaïeb\" in Dutch. However, the speakers call themselves \"Kalina\" or \"Karìna\" (variously spelled), and call their language \"Karìna auran\" . Other variants include \"Kali'na\", \"Kari'nja, Cariña\", \"Kariña\", \"Kalihna\", \"Kalinya\"; other native names include \"Maraworno\" and \"Marworno\".\n\nKari'nja is classified as part of the Cariban languages but also as a Guianan language.\n\nDue to contact with Kari'nja invaders, some languages have Kari'nja words incorporated into them, despite being Arawakan languages linguistically.\n\nIn Suriname, there is an area called Konomerume which is located near the Wajambo River. With about 349 people living there, a majority identify as ethnically Kari'nja and as for who knows the language, the adults are reported to at least have a decent knowledge of it. Those above the age of 65 use the language as a primary language among the members of the community. Speakers between the ages of 45 and 65 tend to use the language only when speaking with older residents or elder members of their family, while for the most part using the official languages: Dutch and Sranan Tongo. Younger adults between the ages of 20 to 40 for the most part understand the language but do not speak it, and children learn bits about Kari'nja in school.\n\nCarib dialects (with number of speakers indicated in parentheses):\n\nThe Carib alphabet consists of 15 letters: a, e, i, j, k, `, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y.\n\nIn the Kari'nja language, there are four syllable patterns: V, CV, VC, CVC; C standing for consonants while V means a vowel. Regarding phonemes, consonants are divided into two groups: obstruents (voiceless stops—p, t, k) and resonants (voiced stops—b, d, g, s).\n\nKari'nja has a typical 6 vowel system after *ô merged with *o, being \"a e i o u ï.\" Compared to past Kari'nja, the modern day Kari'nja has replaced the \"e\" in many words to \"o\".\n\nThere are 17 particles within Kari'nja which include the \"ky-\" prefix and the \"-ng\" suffix.\n\nAllophones for /r w t/ include sounds as /ɽ β,v tʃ/. /s/ before /i/ may be pronounced as /ʃ/. /n/ before a consonant may be pronounced as /ŋ/ and also /ɲ/ elsewhere. Another sound, ranging /h~x/, often occurs before a voiced or voiceless consonant, and succeeding a vowel, it can also be an allophone of /ʔ/.\n\nAll four dialects of Kari'nja have loan words from the primary language of the area (Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana). For example, the Kari'nja spoken in Suriname borrows words from Dutch and Sranantongo.\n\nSome of the words show instances in which the \"e\" has been replaced with \"o\" in present-day Kari'nja. The two statements beneath the singular words show examples of two suffixes.\n\n"}
{"id": "25487915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25487915", "title": "Charnel ground", "text": "Charnel ground\n\nA charnel ground (Devanagari: श्मशान; Romanized Sanskrit: śmaśān; Tibetan pronunciation: durtrö; ), in concrete terms, is an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered. Although it may have demarcated locations within it functionally identified as burial grounds, cemeteries and crematoria, it is distinct from these as well as from crypts or burial vaults.\n\nIn a religious sense, it is also a very important location for sadhana and ritual activity for Indo-Tibetan traditions of Dharma particularly those traditions iterated by the Tantric view such as Kashmiri Shaivism, Kaula tradition, Esoteric Buddhism, Vajrayana, Mantrayana, Dzogchen, and the sadhana of Chöd, Phowa and Zhitro, etc. The charnel ground is also an archetypal liminality that figures prominently in the literature and liturgy and as an artistic motif in Dharmic Traditions and cultures iterated by the more antinomian and esoteric aspects of traditional Indian culture.\n\nThroughout Ancient India and Medieval India, charnel grounds in the form of open air crematoria were historically often located along rivers and many ancient famous charnel sites are now 'sanitized' pilgrimage sites (Sanskrit: tirtha) and areas of significant domestic income through cultural tourism. However, proper \"charnel grounds\" can still be found in India, specially near large rivers banks and areas where abandoned people (without family) are cremated or simply left to decompose. These areas are often frequented by Aghoris, a Kapalika sect, that follows similar meditation techniques, as those thought by the 84 Mahasiddhas. A typical Aghori sadhana (at the charnel ground) lasts for 12 years.\n\nIn the Himalaya where tillable topsoil for burial and fuel for cremation is scarce and a valuable commodity, the location of a so-called sky burial is identified with a charnel ground.\n\nIn the Pali Canon discourses, the Buddha frequently instructs his disciples to seek out a secluded dwelling (in a forest, under the shade of a tree, mountain, glen, hillside cave, charnel ground, jungle grove, in the open, or on a heap of straw). \nThe Sutrayana tradition of the 'Nine Cemetery Contemplations' (Pali: nava sīvathikā-manasikāra) of the \"Satipatthana Sutta\" demonstrate that charnel ground meditations were part of Early Buddhism.\n\n'Cemetery contemplations', as described in \"Mahasatipatthana Sutta\" (DN: 22) and the \"Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta\" (MN: 10):\n\nOn the face of it or alternatively the cosmetic level, the charnel ground is simply a locality often chthonic where bodies are disposed of, either by cremation or burial. Though the charnel ground is to be understood as a polysemy and metaphor it must be emphasized that holy people as part of their sadhana and natural spiritual evolution grappling with death, impermanence and transition did historically in both India, China and Tibet as well as in other localities, frequent charnel grounds, crematoriums and cemeteries and were often feared and despised by people who did not understand their 'proclivities' (Sanskrit: anusaya).\n\nFrom a deeper structural significance and getting to the substantive bones of the Vajrayana spiritual point of view however, the charnel ground is full of profound transpersonal significance. It represents the 'death of ego' (Sanskrit: atmayajna), and the end of: \nIt is worth noting that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above cited in bold font are somewhat standardized and hence less-rich lexical choices for the semantic field represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha klesha) they denote.\n\nPrior to spiritual realization, charnel grounds are to be understood as terrifying places, full of 'roaming spirits' (Sanskrit: gana) and 'hungry ghosts' (Sanskrit: pretas) indeed localities that incite consuming fear. In a charnel ground there are bodies everywhere in different states of decomposition: freshly dead bodies, decaying bodies, skeletons and disembodied bones.\n\nSimmer-Brown (2001: p. 127) conveys how the 'charnel ground' experience may present itself in the modern Western mindstream situations of emotional intensity, protracted peak performance, marginalization and extreme desperation:\n\n\nTibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent or richly different depictions of him. In one Tibetan form he is shown being trodden under foot by Mahākala, a popular Tibetan deity. Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, sometimes dancing. This play of Ganesha as both the \"creator and remover of obstacles\" as per his epithet as well in the two Vajrayana iconographic depictions of him as that which consumes (Maha Rakta) and that which is consumed (danced upon by Vignantaka) is key to the reciprocity rites of the charnel ground.\n\n\"Ganapati, Maha Rakta\" (Tibetan: tsog gi dag po, mar chen. English: The Great Red Lord of Hosts or Ganas) is a Tantric Buddhist form of Ganapati (Ganesha) related to the Chakrasamvara Cycle of Tantras. The Sanskrit term 'rakta' holds the semantic field of \"blood\" and \"red\". This form of Ganapati is regarded as an emanation of Avalokiteshvara.\n\n\"...beside a lapis lazuli rock mountain is a red lotus with eight petals, in the middle a blue rat expelling various jewels, [mounted on his rat 'steed' (Sanskrit: vahana)] Shri Ganapati with a body red in colour, having an elephant face with sharp white tusks and possessing three eyes, black hair tied in a topknot with a wishing-gem and a red silk ribbon [all] in a bundle on the crown of the head. With twelve hands, the six right hold an axe, arrow, hook, vajra, sword and spear. The six left [hold] a pestle, bow, khatvanga, skullcup filled with blood, skullcup filled with human flesh and a shield together with a spear and banner. The peaceful right and left hands are signified by the vajra and skullcup filled with blood held to the heart. The remaining hands are displayed in a threatening manner. Wearing various silks as a lower garment and adorned with a variety of jewel ornaments, the left foot is extended in a dancing manner, standing in the middle of the bright rays of red flickering light.\" (Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup, 1497-1557).\nThis form of Ganapati belongs to a set of three powerful deities known as the 'mar chen kor sum' or the Three Great Red Deities included in a larger set called 'The Thirteen Golden Dharmas' of Sakya. The other two deities are Kurukulle and Takkiraja.\n\nIn depictions of the six-armed protector Mahakala (Skt: Shad-bhuja Mahakala, Wylie: mGon po phyag drug pa), an elephant-headed figure usually addressed as Vinayaka is seen being trampled by the Dharma Protector, but he does not appear distressed. In Vajrayana and cognate Buddhist art, He is depicted as a subdued god trampled by Buddhist deities like Aparajita, Parnasabari and Vignataka.\n\nThe Tibetan Ganesha appears, besides bronzes, in the resplendent Thangka paintings alongside the Buddha. In \"\"Ganesh, studies of an Asian God\",\" edited by Robert L. BROWN, State University of New York Press, 1992, page 241-242, he wrote that in the Tibetan Ka'gyur tradition, it is said that the Buddha had taught the \"Ganapati Hridaya Mantra\" (or \"Aryaganapatimantra\") to disciple Ananda. The sutra in which the Buddha teaches this mantra can be found here .\n\nThe 'pastime' and 'play' (Sanskrit: \"lila\") of dancing and its representation in charnel ground literature and visual representations is endemic: Ganapati as son of Shiva, Ganapati as Lord of Gana, the demonic host of Gana, dancing ganesha, dancing gana, the dance of life and death, what is dance but a continuum of forms, dancing is energetic, dancing is symbolic of spiritual energy in iconography, particularly chthonic imagery of Dharmic Traditions. Energy moves (and cycles) between forms as does dance. The 'wheel' (Sanskrit: chakra, mandala) in all its permutations and efflorescence is a profound Dharmic cultural artifact enshrining the energetic dance of the Universe. This is particularly applicable in the iconography of Nataraja and the 'wrathful deities' (Sanskrit: Heruka) of Vajrayana which are depicted with a flaming aureole, a flaming wheel. This resonates with the deep symbolism of the mystery rite and folklore and folk custom and high culture of circle dances which approaches a human cultural universal. Namkhai Norbu, a famed Dzogchen master in the Bonpo tradition and the Dharmic Traditions of esoteric Buddhism has revealed a number of terma (Tibetan) of circle dances such as the 'Dance of the Six Lokas of Samantabhadra'. The dance is a restricted initiatory rite and its process may not be disclosed as so doing would be a contravention of 'commitments ' (Sanskrit: samaya) but it may be affirmed that the rite is enacted on a colourful mandala of the Five Pure Lights and the 'central point' (Sanskrit: bindu) of the dance mandala is illuminated with a sacred candle known as the 'garbha' (Sanskrit) within the International Dzogchen Community. This terma dance is all clearly applicable to the charnel ground when taken as the 'wheel of becoming' (Sanskrit: bhavachakra) which generally is demarcated by six distinct 'places' (Sanskrit: loka).\n\nDattatreya the avadhuta, to whom has been attributed the esteemed nondual medieval song, the\" Avadhuta Gita\", was a sometime denizen of the charnel ground and a founding deity of the Aghor tradition according to Barrett (2008: p. 33):\n\nBarrett (2008: p. 161) discusses the sadhana of the 'Aghora' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: अघोर) in both its left and right-handed proclivites and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality, a view uncultured, undomesticated:\n\n\nBeer (2003: p. 102) relates how the symbolism of the khatvanga that entered esoteric Buddhism (particularly from Padmasambhava) was a direct borrowing from the Shaivite Kapalikas who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds and cross roads etcetera as a form of 'left-handed path' (Sanskrit: vamamarga) 'spiritual practice' (Sanskrit: sadhana):\n\nSadhana in the charnel ground within the Dharmic Traditions may be traced to ancient depictions of the chthonic Shiva and his chimeric son Ganapati (Ganesha) who was decapitated and returned to life with the head of an elephant. In certain narratives, Shiva made the Ganesha 'lord of the gana' (Sanskrit: Ganapati). Such depictions of Shiva, Ganesha and the ganas are evident in literature, architectural ornamentation and iconography, etc. In the Indian traditions of Tantra the charnel ground is very important. In must be remembered that the seat of Shiva and his locality of sadhana is the sacred Mount Kailasha in the Himalaya. In some non-Buddhist traditions of Ganachakra such as the Kaula the leader of the rite is known as 'ganapati', which is a title of respect. The Eight Great Charnel Grounds are important in the life of Padmasambhava. This is one definite way the importance of the charnel ground in sadhana entered and became replicated in the Himalayan Dharmic Tradition. The charnel ground is a particular place that holds powerful teachings on impermanence and is important for slaying the ego. In this, the charnel ground shares with the tradition of dark retreat that was foregrounded in some Himalayan practice lineages.\n\nSimmer-Brown (2001: p. 127) conveys how great Mahasiddha's in the Nath and Mantrayana Buddhadharma traditions such as Tilopa (988–1069) and Gorakṣa (fl. 11th - 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the 'ground' (Sanskrit: āśraya; Wylie: gzhi) of realization - worthy case-studies for those with spiritual proclivity:\n\nDyczkowski (1988: p. 26) holds that Hāla's Prakrit literature poem the \"Gāthāsaptaśati\" (third to fifth century CE) is one of the first extant literary references to a Kapalika where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover. This is a literary allusion to the anointing of 'sacred ash' (Sanskrit: bhasma; vibhuti) especially associated with Shiva who applies it all over his body.\n\nDyczkowski (1988: p. 26) relates how Kṛṣṇa Miśra (c 1050-1100) casts the character of a Kāpālika in his play, the \" Prabodhacandrodaya\" and then quotes verbatim a source that renders the creed of this character into English:\nIn Vajrayana poetry, literature and song, particularly that of the 'songs of realization', charnel grounds are often described as containing \"rivers of blood\", \"poisonous waterfalls\", and depicted as localities containing dangerous wild beasts. The two truths doctrine though iterates this view and when perceived differently, charnel grounds are peaceful places of beatific solitude and this chthonic symbolism and the twilight language and iconography accrues a rich polysemy. When perceived differently, the charnel grounds are places of 'peace' (Sanskrit: \"shanti\"), pleasant groves, populated by wildflowers and fruit. Songbirds, tame lions and tigers, and the vast open vault of the sky, fruit and flowers are often used in Vajrayana iconography and poetry and Beer (1999) explains their symbolism and how they are understood in the tradition in fine detail. They are all included in depictions of the charnel ground.\n\nThe Upa-yoga scriptures first appeared in 'Mount Jakang Chen' (alternate names: Riwo Jakang, Mount Jizu) and the charnel ground of Cool Grove . Cool Grove is also known as 'Śītavana' (Sanskrit).\n\nGray (undated: c2009) provides an excellent survey of chthonic charnel ground accoutrement motif such as skull imagery in the textual tradition of the Yogini tantras.\n\n\nIn the charnel grounds of Vajrayana, there are no social conventions to conform to and no distractions to be seduced by for the siddha. Dakas and dakinis gather there to celebrate ceremonial tsok 'feasts' (Sanskrit: ganachakra). The lion's roar of Dharma discourse resound as do the liturgy and the specific 'hourglass drums' (Sanskrit: damaru) of the chödpa and the light of the inner 'joy of bliss' (Sanskrit: ananda) radiates and this dynamic movement is represented iconographically by the 'bliss-whirling' (Sanskrit: ananda-chakra).\n\nIn his \"Manual\" on the practice of the \"Longchen Nyingtik\", Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche holds that:\n\"Right now, our minds are very fickle. Sometimes you like a certain place, and it inspires, and yet with that same place, if you stay too long, it bores you. […] As you practice more and more, one day this kind of habit, this fickle mind will just go. Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, and according to the classic tantric texts, that is usually what they call the “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, you have to go to a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a kapāla and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your bindu will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance.\" \n\nIn the life in which a pratyekabuddha attains the fruit of their 'path' (Wylie: lam), they are naturally drawn to charnel grounds. \"When reflecting on the bones found there, the pratyekabuddha inquire \"Where do these bones come from?\" This samyama (Sanskrit) on the bones awakens knowledge of their many lifetimes of investigation into the 'Twelve Links of Dependent Origination'. These twelve links then unfold in their mindstream as a 'blessing' (Sanskrit: adhishthana), in both forward and reverse sequence and on that foundation they yield 'realisation' (Sanskrit: siddhi).\n\nThe charnel ground, cremation ground and cemetery is evident as a specific region within wrathful Indo-Tibetan sand mandala iconography. As the anthropologist Gold (1994: p. 141) relates in his comparative study drawn from his professional fieldwork into the symbolic universals of the sacred circles and sand-paintings of the Navajo and Tibetan peoples, parses the sacred precinct and motif of the charnel ground as a locality in the symbolic grammar of the Indo-Tibetan 'fierce yidam' or 'wrathful deity' (Sanskrit: heruka) sand mandala:\n\nThe region of the charnel grounds in many wrathful mandala often hold eight specific charnel grounds where certain key events take place in the life of Padmasambhava.\n\nThe Vajrayana yidam Citipati is said to be the Lord of Charnel Grounds.\n\nBlood is thematic in Charnel Ground iconography where it may be understood as lifeblood, a symbol of viscous 'compassion' (Sanskrit: karuna) of 'sacrifice' (Sanskrit:yajna), and attendant with the symbolism of blood, bones ground our shared humanity and solidarity in the wider Mandala of life and the ancient lineage of 'ancestors' from which all sentient beings are of lineal descent.\n\nThe tradition and custom of the 'sky burial' (Tibetan: \"jhator\") afforded Traditional Tibetan medicine and \"thangka\" iconography such as the 'Tree of physiology' with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the human skeleton were employed in ritual tools such as the skullcup, thigh-bone trumpet, etc.\n\nThe 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: ; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as \"mudra\" or 'seals' are also known as 'charnel ground ornaments'. The \"Hevajra Tantra\" identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the Five Wisdoms and Jamgon Kongtrul in his commentary to the \"Hevajra Tantra\" explains this further.\n\nThe important Varnamala (or 'garland of bija phonemes' in twilight language is iconographically represented by a 'garland of severed heads or skulls' (Sanskrit: Mundamala).\n\nBeer (1999: pp. 277–278) relates how Padmasambhava received the siddhi of the kīla transmission from a gigantic scorpion at the charnel ground of Rajgriha:\n\nThe 'Eight Great Charnel Grounds (Sanskrit: aṣṭamahāśmāśāna; )\n\n'The Most Fierce' ()\n\n'Dense Thicket' ()\n\n'Dense Blaze' ()\n\n'Endowed with Skeletons' ()\n\n'Cool Forest' or 'Cool Grove' (Sanskrit: Śītavana; Devanagari: शीतवन; )\n\n'Black Darkness' ()\n\n'Resonant with \"Kilikili\"' ()\n\n'Wild Cries of \"Ha-ha\"' ()\n\nDudjom \"et al.\" (1991: p. 626 History) relates how \"earth, stone, water, and wood\" gathered from The Eight Great Charnel Grounds and auspicious objects such as the flesh of a seven-times-born Brahmana and 'relics' (Sanskrit: Śarīra) of the Tathagatha amongst other items were used to sculpt a statue of 'Yangdak Heruka' (Wylie: yang dag heruka; Sanskrit: Viśuddhaheruka) modelled on Zurcungpa (1014CE - 1074CE; alt.

{"id": "53019832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53019832", "title": "Chichewa tenses", "text": "Chichewa tenses\n\nChichewa (also but less commonly known as Chinyanja, Chewa or Nyanja) is the main lingua franca of central and southern Malawi and neighbouring regions. Like other Bantu languages it has a wide range of tenses. In terms of time, Chichewa tenses can be divided into present, recent past, remote past, near future, and remote future. The dividing line between near and remote tenses is not exact, however. Remote tenses cannot be used of events of today, but near tenses can be used of events earlier or later than today.\n\nThe Chichewa tense system also incorporates aspectual distinctions. Except for the Present Simple, nearly every tense in Chichewa is either perfective or imperfective in aspect; for example the Recent Past \"ndinapíta\" \"I went\" is perfective, describing a simple action, while the Past Imperfective \"ndimapíta\" \"I was going, I used to go\" is imperfective, describing a continuing or habitual action. In the imperfective tenses for the most part there is no distinction between habitual and progressive aspect; however, in the present tense there is such a distinction; for example, \"ndímapíta\" \"I go (every day)\" (habitual) vs \"ndikupíta\" \"I am going (now)\" (progressive).\n\nAnother aspectual distinction in Chichewa is that between perfect and past. A perfect tense is one which carries an implication that the result of a past action still holds at the present time; for example, \"wabwera\" \"he has come\" implies that the person is still here. The past tenses in Chichewa carry exactly the opposite implication, namely that the result of the past action no longer holds; for example the Recent Past tense \"anabwéra\" \"he came\" implies that the person has now gone. This kind of tense is known in modern linguistics as discontinuous past. It differs from the English Past Simple, which is generally neutral in implication.\n\nThe distinction between one tense and another in Chichewa is made partly by changing the tense-marker, which is an infix such as \"-ku-\", \"-na-\", \"-ma-\" etc. added to the verb, and partly by the use of tone. Often two different tenses, such as \"ndimapíta\" \"I was going\" and \"ndímapíta\" \"I go\", have the same tense-marker but are distinguished by their tonal pattern.\n\nCompound tenses are also found in Chichewa to express more complex meanings, such as \"ndimatí ndipité\" \"I was about to go\" or \"ndakhala ndíkúpíta\" \"I have been going\".\n\nIn addition to ordinary tenses, Chichewa also has tenses to express obligation (\"I should go\"), potentiality (\"I might go\"), and persistence (\"I am still going\"), participle-like tenses with meanings such as \"while going\", \"having gone\", \"before going\", and a number of tenses meaning \"when...\" or \"if...\" such as \"akapita\" \"when he goes\", \"átápíta\" \"if he were to go\", and \"ákadapíta\" \"if he had gone\".\n\nChichewa verbs in their basic form are made with a subject-marker (\"ndi-\" \"I\", \"u-\" \"you (sg)\", etc.), which is followed by a tense-marker (if present), and then the verb stem. The Present Continuous (Present Progressive) tense, which has tense-marker \"-ku-\", goes as follows:\n\nOther subject-markers are possible, e.g. \"chi-\" (referring to \"chímanga\" \"maize\"), \"i-\" (referring to \"nkhúku\" \"chicken\"), \"zi-\" (referring to \"mbálame\" \"birds\") and so on.\n\nFreestanding pronouns such as \"ine\" \"I\", \"iwe\" \"you\", \"iyé\" \"he, she\" are available and may be added for emphasis: \"ine ndikuthándiza\" \"I am helping\".\n\nThe Present Simple, Present Subjunctive, and Basic Imperative have no tense-marker; all the rest have a tense-marker.\n\nIn modern standard Chichewa except in the Perfect tense there is no difference between the 3rd person singular \"he/she\" and the 3rd person plural \"they\", although there are some dialects such as the Town Nyanja spoken in Lusaka, Zambia where the 3rd person plural is still \"βa-\" and thus different from the singular.\n\nThe Perfect tense is exceptional in that the subject-marker is shortened when followed by the tense-marker \"-a-\". It is also exceptional in that the 3rd person singular has \"w-\" instead of \"a-\", and is thus different from the 3rd person plural:\n\nOther elements can be added between the tense-marker and the verb-stem, such as aspect-markers and object-markers. So for example the object-marker \"-mu-\" \"him\" or \"her\" can be added to any of the above verbs: \"nd-a-mú-thandiza\" \"I have helped him\".\n\nThe main tenses used in independent clauses in Chichewa are as follows:\nCertain tenses in Chichewa, such as those with \"-ná-\", \"-nká-\" and \"-dzá-\", are used for events remote in time, while others are used mainly for events of today (including last night). However, although the remote tenses are never used for events of today, the opposite is not true. As one scholar Jack Mapanje puts it: \"Although traditional and other grammarians have latched on to the idea of immediate, near or remote past or future time, this is not a hard and fast rule for our languages. Usually the decision as to how immediate, near or remote past or future time is from the speech time is dependent on subjective factors.\"\n\nThe tense \"ndinábwera\" or \"ndidábwera\" \"I came\" can be made with either \"-na-\" or \"-da-\". The difference is partly regional, since \"-da-\" is heard mainly in parts of the Central Region, especially in the area around Lilongwe. \"-da-\" was also chosen as the correct form to be used in written Chichewa by the first President of Malawi, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, in his wish to standardise the language and to make the Central Region variety the basis of that standard. Banda is said to have declared: \"The real Chichewa is what is spoken by the villagers in Dowa, Lilongwe, Dedza, Salima; in the Southern Region, Namkumba's area in Fort Johnston [Mangochi]\". Thus \"-da-\" has come to be used as the standard form in written Chichewa. In the older 1922 translation of the Bible, \"-na-\" is more commonly used than \"-da-\" (although \"-da-\" is used occasionally), whereas in the more recent translation of 1998, \"-da-\" is the usual past tense marker. Books describing the language prescriptively for Malawian schools therefore allow only \"-da-\" as the Remote Perfect tense-marker. Colloquially, however, \"-ná-\" seems to be more common, and is the form given in most books describing Chichewa grammar.\n\nFor the Recent Past tense is involved, as a rule only \"-na-\" is used, rarely \"-da-\". \"-da-\" is regarded as incorrect by Malawian teachers, the only form allowed for events of today being \"-na-\".\n\nFor the Remote Past tense, similarly some dialects use \"-na:-\" and others \"-da:-\". In some books, such as the 1998 Bible translation, \"Buku Loyera\", this tense-marker is always spelled with a double \"a\" (\"-daa-\"), but frequently the spelling \"-na-\" or \"-da-\" with a single \"a\" is used, so that only the context makes it clear whether the Past Simple or the Remote Past is intended.\n\nTones (the rises and falls in pitch of the voice) play an important part in the grammar of the Chichewa verb. Each tense has its own tonal pattern, although often the same pattern is used by more than one tense. For instance, the Present Continuous, Recent Past, and Imperfect all have a high tone on the syllable following the tense-marker:\n\nThe Present Habitual, on the other hand, has two high tones, one on the subject-marker and the other on the penultimate syllable:\n\nThe Past Simple (Remote Perfect) has a tone on the tense-marker itself, which in some dialects spreads to the following syllable:\n\nFurther tonal patterns are noted in the table above.\n\nThe same tonal pattern is used whether the verb is short or long. However, when the verb is a short one of one or two syllables only, certain adjustments may be made. For example, a penultimate tone may move to the final or sometimes disappear:\n\n\nThe addition of an aspect-marker or object-marker to a verb can cause an extra tone on the verb-stem:\n\nIn negative tenses different tonal patterns are used. For example:\n\nSome tenses have two different negative intonations, depending on the shade of meaning. For example, the Remote Perfect \"ndi-ná-gula\" \"I bought\" has the following negatives with different meanings:\n\nAnother factor causing a change of tone is whether a verb is being used in a relative clause or certain other types of clause. For example, there is a difference in meaning between:\n\nAnother factor affecting the tones of a verb is that when a verb is followed by an object or a place-argument, the tone usually spreads:\n\nFor further details see Chichewa tones.\n\nFollowing the tense-marker it is possible to add one or more aspect-markers, which are infixes which modify the meaning of the tense. There are four different aspect-markers, which usually are added in the order: \"-ma-\", \"-ka-\", \"-dza-\", \"-ngo-\".\n\n\"-Ma-\" can be used in its own right as a tense-marker, or can be added to other tense-markers to make the tense habitual:\n\nThe meaning of \"-ka-\" is usually \"go and...\". Sometimes it can mean \"go in order to\":\n\n\"-Dza-\" has two meanings. The first meaning is \"come and...\". With an Infinitive or Subjunctive after a verb of coming, it can mean \"in order to\":\n\nThe second meaning is or \"at a later time, in future\":\n\nThe aspect-marker \"-ngo-\" means \"just\". As it is derived from the Infinitive, the tone, as in the Infinitive itself, goes on the syllable following \"-ngo-\", and the final vowel is always \"-a\", never \"-e\":\n\nThe Present Simple tense is formed without any tense-marker, but with a tone on the subject-prefix: \"ndíthandiza\" \"I help, I will help\" (the first tone can spread, making \"ndíthándiza\"). The Present Simple of the verb \"-li\" (\"is\") is irregular, in that it has no tone on the subject prefix: \"ndili\" \"I am\". The negative has two different intonations depending on whether it has a future meaning: \"síndíthandiza\" \"I don't help\", \"sindithandíza\" \"I won't help\".\n\nThe Present Simple tense can be both perfective and imperfective in aspect. When the Present Simple is perfective, the meaning is usually immediate future:\n\nIt can sometimes, however, be used perfectively referring to the present, for example in chapter headings or newspaper headlines.\n\nWhen the Present Simple is imperfective, it refers to present time, and is usually habitual. In earlier Chichewa the simple tense was more widely used than today, and there are many places in the 1922 Bible translation (\"Búkú Lópátuliká\") where the Present Simple is replaced in the more modern 1998 version by the Present Habitual or Present Continuous, for example:\n\nThe modern tendency is to use the Present Habitual or Present Continuous even for stative verbs such as \"I love\", \"I know\", \"I want\", \"I believe\", \"I hope\" and so on, although the simple form can also sometimes be used. Certain verbs, such as \"ndíkhoza\" \"I might (do)\" and \"ndili\" \"I am\", however, are always used in the simple form.\n\nThe Present Simple tense is more commonly used in an imperfective sense when negative. Often it is used for the negative of a stative verb:\n\nAt other times it has a habitual meaning, and some authors see it as being the negative of the Present Habitual. In the following example, the Present Habitual is used for the positive, but the Present Simple for the negative:\n\nWith negative monosyllabic verbs when negative, the Present Continuous is sometimes used, even though the meaning is habitual:\n\nHowever, \"sámwá\" and \"sámámwá\" are also possible here.\n\nThe Present Habitual tense (\"ndí-ma-thandíza\" \"I help, habitually\") is formed by adding \"-ma-\" to the Present Simple tense. The tones are on the subject-marker and penultimate; the first tone never spreads. It is typically used for situations in the present which are repeated habitually or which are continuous and expected to continue indefinitely:\n\nAs noted above, the negative of this tense usually omits \"-ma-\". However, the infix \"-ma-\" (with a tone) can be added especially if the meaning is emphatic:\n\nThe tense-marker \"-ma-\" appears to derive from an earlier \"-mba-\". (-mba- is also used as a habitual marker in the Malawian variety of Chisena.) Kanerva (1990) records forms like \"ndíímaphíika\" \"I cook\", showing a long vowel in the first syllable in the Nkhotakota dialect; however, other dialects have a short vowel.\n\nThe Present Continuous (or Present Progressive) tense uses the tense-marker \"-ku-\", with the tone on the syllable immediately after \"-ku-\": \"ndi-ku-thándiza\" \"I am helping\". The negative also has a tone in the same place: \"sí-ndí-ku-thándiza\" \"I am not helping\". (Note that since \"-ku-\" can also mean \"you (sg.)\" these words, with the intonation \"ndíkúthandiza\" and \"sindikuthandíza\", can also mean \"I will help you\" and \"I won't help you\", assuming that the person being addressed is younger than or a close friend of the speaker.) \n\nIt is used much like the English Present Continuous for temporary situations which are not expected to continue for long. It can also be used, as in English, for events which are already planned, e.g. \"I'm going to Zambia next week\" or which are still incompleted but under way:\n\nThis tense is used in a wider range of contexts than the English equivalent, since it is also often used with stative verbs such as \"know\", \"want\", \"remember\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"think\", \"see\":\n\nIt is also used for performative verbs, such as \"ndikulónjeza\" \"I promise\", although some older speakers use the Present Simple in such contexts.\n\nIn some contexts the Present Continuous can be used where English uses the Perfect Continuous:\n\nThe longer form of this tense, \"ndinalí kuthándiza\" or \"ndínalí kuthándiza\", mentioned in some older books, is not often used nowadays, the simpler form being much more common.\n\nA Present Frequentative tense can be made by combining the Present Progressive \"-ku-\" and the aspect-marker \"-má-\". It is generally used for situations which the speaker disapproves of. Again, the addition of \"-ma-\" is emphatic. The tones are on \"-ma-\" and the penultimate:\n\nThis tense is formed with the tense-marker \"-kada-\", \"-kana-\", or \"-daka-\" and a single tone on the penultimate syllable: \"ndikadathandíza\" or \"ndidakathandíza\" \"I am still helping\". (This tone moves to the final in monosyllabic verbs.) It is most often used with the verb \"-li\" \"be\". With other verbs the tendency is to replace this tense with the suffix \"-be\" \"still\": \"ndikuthándizábe\" \"I am still helping\", but this suffix is not available with the verb \"-li\", since \"ndilíbe\" has a different meaning, namely \"I do not have\".\n\nSometimes the tense-marker \"-kada-\" is shortened to \"-ka-\".\n\nAnother way of expressing \"still\" is a form in \"chi-...-re\"; but this is used only for a few verbs:\n\nFor the participial form of the persistive tense, see below.\n\nA perfect tense is usually defined as one which indicates the continuing present relevance of a past situation. Thus the use of the Perfect tense in the sentence \"I have lost my penknife\" indicates that the penknife is still missing.\n\nSeveral different typical uses of perfect tenses are distinguished in linguistics textbooks: the Perfect of Result (e.g. \"I have lost my penknife\"); the Experiential Perfect (e.g. \"Bill has been to America (at least once)\"); the Perfect of Persistent Situation (e.g. \"I've been waiting for hours\"); and the Perfect of Recent Past (e.g. \"I've seen her this morning\"). All of these uses can be found in the Chichewa Perfect.\n\nIn English, the use of the Perfect is incompatible with a time adverb referring to a time completely in the past (e.g. \"yesterday\"). However, this is not necessarily the case in all languages; in Spanish, for example, the Perfect is compatible with an adverb such as \"ayer\" \"yesterday\". As will be seen below, Chichewa may also combine the Perfect with a past time adverb.\n\nThe Perfect Simple tense in Chichewa is formed as described above with the tense-marker \"-a-\", e.g. \"nd-a-gula\" \"I have bought (some)\". It is toneless, unless the verb-stem itself has a tone (e.g. \"nd-a-topá\" \"I am tired\"). There is no exact negative, although a particular intonation of the negative past with the tone on the penultimate only is often regarded as the equivalent of a negative Perfect (\"si-ndi-na-gúle\" \"I haven't bought it yet\").\n\nAs with the English Perfect, the Perfect tense is often used as a perfect of result, usually referring to very recent events:\n\nUnlike the English Perfect, it is possible to combine it with an adverb of time such as \"at ten o'clock\":\n\nAs in English also it can be used as a Perfect of experience to describe something which has happened once or more and which may happen again:\n\nA usage less familiar from English but common in other Bantu languages such as Swahili is to express a present state resulting from a recent event. For example, \"he is wearing a suit\" is expressed in Chichewa as \"he has put on a suit\"; \"he is sitting on a chair\" is expressed as \"he has sat down on a chair\"; \"I am tired\" is expressed as \"I have become tired\", and so on.\n\nTo express the past version of such situations (\"he was wearing a suit\") the Recent Past or Remote Past is used.\n\nThe Perfect tense of the verb \"-khala\" (\"stay\" or \"be\") either by itself or combined with another verb is used as the equivalent of the English Perfect Continuous to express a situation which began some time ago but which is still continuing now:\n\nThis construction is not mentioned in any of the early writers on Chichewa grammar.\n\nThis tense is formed with the tense-marker \"-ná-\" or \"-dá-\" (see above for the distinction between these). The tone is on the tense-marker itself. In longer verbs in some dialects this tone spreads forward one syllable: \"ndi-ná-landira\" / \"ndi-ná-lándira\" 'I (have) received'.\n\nThis tense is sometimes referred to as the \"Past\" or \"Simple Past\". However, the descriptions given by several authors make it clear that, except in its use in narrative, it should be classified as one of the perfect tenses, since like the Perfect it usually carries the implication that the effect of the action still holds. Watkins calls it the \"Remote Past With Present Influence\". It refers to events of yesterday or earlier.\n\nOne common use is as a perfect of result, referring to an event whose result is still true at the time of speaking:\n\nIt can be used with a past time adverb such as \"yesterday\" or \"last year\". \"When this happens the 'perfect meaning' of the utterance is not lost\" (Mapanje). \n\nAs Watkins noted, this is the appropriate tense to use to describe the creation of the world, since the result of the creation is still evident:\n\nLike the Perfect tense it can also be used with the adverb \"masíkú ano\" \"these days\" to describe a change that has come about, but not recently:\n\nLike the Perfect, it can also be used experientially. In this sense, often \"-po\" or \"-ko\" is added to the verb.\n\nAnother use is in narrative: \n\nThe narrative Remote Perfect is typically used for the action in novels and short stories and in narratives such as the 1998 Bible translation. In this usage, it has the meaning of a simple past tense, and the implication that the result of the action still holds does not apply.\n\nThe negative of this tense has the final vowel \"-e\". The tones of the ordinary negative are on the negative marker (which may spread) and the penultimate; but when it has the meaning of an experiential perfect there is a single tone on the penultimate:\n\nThe negative of the Recent Past is rarely used in modern Chichewa, and the Remote Perfect negative is used instead. When negative therefore this tense can refer to events of today as well as events in the more remote past.\n\nThe past tenses in Chichewa differ from the perfect tenses in that they all describe situations which were true in the past but of which the results no longer apply at the present time. Thus Maxson describes the Recent Past and the Remote Past as both implying that the situation has been \"reversed or interrupted by another action\". According to Watkins, the Remote Past tense would be appropriate in a sentence such as \"Jesus Christ died (but rose again)\"; whereas it would not be appropriate in the sentence \"God created the world\" since it would imply that the creation was cancelled and \"a second creator did a more enduring piece of work\". Similarly, according to Kulemeka, the Recent Past would be inappropriate in a sentence such as \"our cat died\", since it would imply that the act of dying was not permanent but would allow the possibility that the cat could come to life again at some future time.\n\nThese two tenses, therefore, appear to differ from the English past tense (which is neutral in implication), and would seem to belong to the category of past tenses known in modern linguistics as discontinuous past. Just as the Perfect and the Past Simple both carry the implication that the action had an enduring effect which continues to the present time, so the Recent Past and Remote Past carry the opposite implication, that the action was not permanent but was reversed or cancelled by a later action.\n\nThe Recent Past tense can also be used for narrating events that occurred earlier on the day of speaking. (The use of the Perfect tense for narrative as described by Watkins is now apparently obsolete). However, for narrating a series of events of yesterday or earlier, the Remote Perfect tense is used.\n\nThe Recent Past is made with the tense-marker \"-na-\". The tone comes on the syllable immediately after \"-na-\": \"ndinathándiza\" \"I helped (but...)\".\n\nThe Recent Past is most often used for events of today, but it can also be used of earlier events. Although it can be used for simple narrative of events of earlier today, it usually carries the implication that the result of the action no longer holds true:\n\nWith the same verbs in which the Perfect tense describes a state in the present, the Recent Past describes a state in the recent past:\n\nIt can also be used, however, as a simple past tense for narrative of events of earlier today:\n\nAlthough the tenses with \"-na-\" are usually perfective, the verb \"-li\" \"be\" is exceptional since the Recent Past and Remote Past in this tense usually have an imperfective meaning:\n\nA negative form of this tense (\"síndínafótókoza\" \"I didn't explain\", with a tone following \"na\", and with the ending -\"a\") is recorded by Mtenje. However, the negative seems to be rarely if ever used in modern standard Chichewa, and it is not mentioned by most other writers. Instead, the negative of the Remote Perfect (\"síndínafotokóze\", with tones on the first and penultimate, and with the ending \"-e\") is generally used.\n\nThe tense-marker is \"-dáa-\" or \"-náa-\" (which are, however, usually written \"-da-\" and \"-na-\"). There are tones on the 1st, 2nd, and penultimate syllables. The first tone or the second tone can be omitted: \"ndi-ná-a-gúla\"; \"ndí-na-a-gúla\" \"I (had) bought (but...)\". This tense is a remote one, used of events of yesterday or earlier. The \"a\" of the tense-marker is always long, even though it is often written with a single vowel.\n\nAs might be expected of a tense which combines the past tense marker \"-na-\" or \"-da-\" and the Perfect tense marker \"-a-\", this tense can have the meaning of a Pluperfect:\n\nIt can also be used to describe a situation in the distant past, using the same verbs which are used in the Perfect tense to describe a situation in the present:\n\nAnother common use of this tense is as a discontinuous past, expressing a situation in the past which later came to be cancelled or reversed:\n\nThe usual Past Imperfective tense (or simply the Imperfect tense) is made with the tense-marker \"-ma-\". The tones are the same as for the Present Continuous and the Recent Past, that is, there is a tone on the syllable immediately after \"-ma\". The negative also has a tone after \"-ma-\": \"síndímathándiza\" \"I wasn't helping\". This tense can refer either to very recent time or to remote time in the past.\n\nIt can be used for progressive events in the past:\n\nIt can also be used for habitual events in the past:\n\nThis tense is formed with the tense-marker \"-nka-\". There are tones on \"nká\" and on the penultimate: \"ndinkáthandíza\" \"I was helping/ used to help\". It refers to events of yesterday or earlier. Since the Past Imperfective with \"-ma-\" can be used of both near and remote events, whereas \"-nka-\" can be used only for remote ones, the \"-nka-\" tense is perhaps less commonly used.\n\nThis tense is used for both habitual events in the distant past, and progressive events in the distant past:\n\nThe tense-marker \"-nká-\", which is pronounced with two syllables, is possibly derived from the verb \"muká\" or \"mká\" 'go'.\n\nThe Present Simple, as noted above, is often used for events in the near or immediate future:\n\nUsually it refers to events of today, but it can also be used for tomorrow or even later times:\n\nThe negative of this tense has a single tone on the penultimate syllable:\n\nFor events in a \"general or more distant future (not today)\" the Future Tense with \"-dza-\" is used. Some dialects put a tone on the first two syllables (e.g. \"ndídzáthándiza\" \"I will help\"); more frequently authors report a tone on \"-dza-\" only (\"ndidzáthandiza\") The tone of \"-dza-\" may spread. In the negative, as with most negative future tenses, there is a single tone on the penultimate: \"sindidzathandíza\" \"I won't help\".\n\nAnother future tense is formed with \"-ka-\", with the same tones as \"-dza-\". It usually refers to events in the near future. Maxson characterises this tense as follows: \"The sense sometimes seems to be that the action will take place in relation to or dependent on something else. It might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause.\" The name \"Contingent Future\" was suggested by Henry (1891), as opposed to the \"-dza-\" Future, which he called the \"Indefinite Future\".\n\nThe future tense-marker \"-ka-\" is not to be confused with the aspect-marker \"-ka-\" \"go and\", which can be used combined with various tenses, for example:\n\nAnother future tense can be made with the tense-marker \"-zi-\", with tones on the initial syllable and penultimate. This usually refers to a situation in the near future, and has an imperfective meaning:\n\nIn the negative, the tones are on \"-zi-\" and on the penultimate syllable:\n\nIn some dialects, \"-zi-\" in this tense and the Imperfect Subjunctive becomes \"-dzi-\".\n\nThe \"-zidza-\" Future is an imperfective tense referring to events that will regularly take place in the distant future. The tones are on the initial syllable (which may spread) and the penultimate:\n\nThe tense-marker \"-zika-\" is sometimes used in place of \"-zidza-\", perhaps with the implication that the events will take place elsewhere:\n\nAnother tense referring to events in the distant future is \"-madza-\", which means \"it will usually happen\". The tones are on the initial and penultimate syllables:\n\nThe Present Potential is made with the tense-marker \"-nga-\" and the final vowel \"-e-\". It is toneless, unless the verb-stem itself has a tone. The negative has tones on the tense-marker and penultimate: \"sindingáthandíze\" \"I can't help\"; there is an alternative pronunciation: \"síndíngathandíze\".\n\nAlthough sometimes referring to the present, this tense more often refers to something that might happen in the future. It can be translated \"can\", \"could\", \"may\", or \"might\":\n\nFrequently this tense is used with the verb \"-tha\" \"be able\":\n\nThe aspect-marker \"-dza-\" can be added to this tense: \"angadzáthandize\" \"he might one day help\".\n\nIn conditional clauses referring to a hypothetical situation in the future, \"-nga-\" can mean \"would\". (See below.)\n\nThis tense is made with \"-kada-\", \"-kana-\", or \"-daka-\". There is a tone on the second syllable of the tense-marker, which is often also found in the negative (\"síndíkadáthandiza\" or \"síndikadathandíza\" \"I would not have helped\"). The meaning is \"I would have done\", \"I could have done\".\n\nSometimes the aspect-marker \"-ma-\" is added to this tense to make it imperfective: \"ndikanámathandíza\" \"I would be helping; I could be helping\". The aspect markers \"-ka-\" and \"-dza-\" may also be added: \"ndikadádzáthándiza\" \"I would have helped later\".\n\nFurther information is given under Conditional Clauses below.\n\nThe Present Subjunctive has no tense-marker; the final vowel changes to \"-e\", which has a tone: \"ndithandizé\" \"I should help\". When an object-marker is added to the subjunctive, there is another tone following the object-marker, e.g. \"mundifótokozeré\" \"please explain to me\". In shorter verbs the tones are: \"mundithándízé\" \"please help me\", \"mundipátse\" \"please give me\", \"muzídye\" \"please eat them\".\n\nThe Subjunctive usually expresses \"either an order, or a wish, or an invitation to do something.\" It can be a polite form of the imperative, or be used as the imperative of the 3rd person, or make suggestions for the 1st person:\n\nWhen the aspect-marker \"-ká-\" or \"-dzá-\" is added, there are tones on \"-ka-\" and the penultimate:\n\nThe negative, which has the negative-marker \"-sa-\" after the subject-marker, has a single tone on the penultimate:\n\nThe Subjunctive can also be used in various subordinate clause constructions, for example to express purpose or a wish or an indirect command:\n\nOther clauses where the Subjunctive can be used are those where the meaning is \"such as\", and, as an alternative to an Infinitive, after \"m'maló mótí\" \"instead of\":\n\nIt can also be used, with the relative clause intonation, after \"ngati\" \"if\" and \"ngakhále\" \"even if\" when the meaning is \"if it should be the case that...\":\n\nAn imperfective form of the Subjunctive is made by adding the tense-marker \"-zi-\". There are tones on \"-zi-\" and on the penultimate. The final vowel is \"-a\": \"ndizíthandíza\" \"I should be helping\".\n\nThis tense can express an obligation that should be carried out regularly or at all times, or as a \"habit or general requirement\":\n\nJust as with the ordinary subjunctive, it can also be used in purpose clauses after \"kutí\" \"that\":\n\nAnother of its uses is to express a \"strong obligation equivalent to an order\" (Salaun):\n\nThis tense has no negative. As with the Imperfective Future, in some regions \"-zi-\" can be replaced with \"-dzi-\".\n\nAnother kind of subjunctive, much less common than the two described above, is a tense with the aspect-marker \"-ba-\" (pronounced \"-baa-\" and with tones similar to the remote past tense), which means \"while waiting for something else to happen\":\n\nIt seems possible that \"-ba-\" has developed by contraction from the construction \"yamba\" \"begin\" plus the Perfect participle described above.\n\nA form of the verb with \"-ta-\" can be used to express sentences of the kind \"Let me do it\" or \"May I do it\", referring to an action which the speaker would like to see done at once. There is a tone on the syllable after \"-ta-\":\n\nThese same three prefixes, \"zi-\", \"ba-\", and \"ta-\" can also be added to the Imperative, with similar meanings (see below).\n\nThe imperative is the command form of the verb. In Chichewa its basic form consists of the verb stem and final vowel \"-a\". The suffix \"-ni\" is added to make it plural or more respectful. The imperative is toneless unless the verb-stem itself has a tone:\n\nIf the verb-stem is monosyllabic, however, such as \"-dya\" \"eat\", a supporting \"i-\" is added before it: \n\nAn idiom \"very widespread\" among Bantu languages, according to Meeussen, is that if a series of commands is given, usually only the first is imperative, the second and third being subjunctive:\n\nIf an object-marker is added to the Imperative, the final vowel changes to \"-e\", and the tones are similar to those in the Subjunctive, that is, the tone of the object-marker goes on the syllable which follows, and there is a second tone on the final \"-e\":\n\nBut in verbs of one or two syllables, there is a single tone on the penultimate:\n\nThe Imperative can be made less direct by adding the suffix \"-ko\", which puts a tone on the syllable before it:\n\nThe Imperative can also take the aspect-markers \"-ka-\" \"go and\" and \"-dza-\" \"come and\". In this case although \"-ka-\" and \"-dza-\" are toneless, the final vowel becomes \"-e\" with a tone:\n\n\"-Ngo-\" \"just\" can also be added, with the supporting vowel \"i\". In this case the final vowel is \"-a\" and there is a tone on the syllable after \"-ngo-\":\n\nLike the Subjunctive, the Imperative can have the prefixes \"ta-\", \"ba-\" \"meanwhile\", and \"zi-\" (imperfective). \"-Ta-\" is fairly common and is used when the speaker wishes something to be done straightaway. It puts a tone on the following syllable:\n\n\"Ba-\" (pronounced \"baa\") and \"zi-\" put a tone on the penultimate syllable (not counting the plural suffix \"-ni\"). These are less commonly used:\n\nTo make a negative command, either the negative subjunctive is used or a form (derived from the negative Infinitive) starting with \"ósa-\" (with tones on \"o-\" and the penultimate):\n\nAdding the aspect-marker \"-ma-\" to either of these gives the meaning \"don't keep on doing...\". The final vowel is usually \"-e\":\n\nThere are several verbs used for expressing different tenses of the verb \"to be\".\n\nThe verb \"-li\" is used mainly for temporary states and for location:\n\nIt is irregular and has very few tenses. These are:\n\nSome authors describing Southern Region Chichewa write tones ndináli for the Remote Past, perhaps a regional variation.\n\nIn this verb there is no distinction between perfective and imperfective. Like the Past Imperfective with \"-ma-\", the tense \"-na-lí\" can be used equally of situations of today or of the remote past:\n\nNegative forms also exist except for the persistive tense: \"síndili\" \"I am not\", \"síndinalí\" \"I was not\", \"ndísalí\" \"without my being\". \n\nThere is also an applied form ending in \"-lílí\" used in phrases of manner:\n\nThe phrase \"ndili ndí\" (lit. \"I am with\") means \"I have\". The negative is \"ndilíbe\" \"I do not have\".\n\nThe forms \"kuli\", \"pali\", \"muli\" mean \"there is\". The negative is \"kulíbe\", \"palíbe\", \"mulíbe\" \"there isn't\":\n\nThese forms can be strengthened to \"-liko\", \"-lipo\", \"-limo\". Of these, \"-lipo\" is the most common:\n\nAnother word for expressing \"is\" or \"are\" is \"ndi\" (negative \"sí\"), used in the present tense only. This word is used for permanent states or identity:\n\nThe toneless \"ndi\" \"is\" is to be distinguished from \"ndí\" \"with\", \"and\", which has a tone.\n\n\"Ndi\" can have pronominal endings attached to it, e.g. \"ndine\" \"I am\", \"ndiwe\" \"you are\". The first and second persons are toneless; all the other endings have a tone, e.g. \"ndiwó\" \"they are\":\n\n\"Ndi\" has no past tense, so the past tense of \"-li\" is used instead:\n\nFor all other tenses of \"to be\", including the Immediate Future, Future, Perfect, Infinitive, Subjunctive, Imperative, and so on, the verb \"-khala\" (\"sit\" or \"stay\") is used:\n\nThe Infinitive is formed with the prefix \"ku-\", which is proclitic, that is, it puts a tone on the syllable following itself: \"kuthándiza\" \"to help\". The negative is made by adding \"-sa-\" after \"-ku-\", and has a single tone on the penultimate: \"kusathandíza\" \"not to help\".\n\nThe Infinitive can be used as the subject of a verb, in which case it is translated as a gerund:\n\nIt can also be the object of verbs such as \"want\", \"be able\", \"like\", \"know how to\" and so on:\n\nWith the infix \"-ka-\" or \"-dza-\" the Infinitive can be used to express purpose, following a verb of going or coming respectively:\n\nBut \"-dza-\" with the Infinitive can also simply have a future meaning, referring to an event or situation in the distant future:\n\nAnother idiomatic use of the Infinitive is to represent the second of two verbs in the same tense which have the same subject. The Infinitive is preceded by \"ndí\" \"and\" (or after a negative \"koma\" \"but\"). The word \"ndí\" is often shortened to \"ń\"':\n\nThere was formerly another idiom of using the prefix \"na-\", \"ni-\" or \"nu-\" (depending on the class concord) to represent the second of two past or perfect tenses; however, it is not much used in modern Chichewa:\n\nSometimes the Infinitive can be used as a tense in its own right, to represent actions happening right now:\n\nThe Infinitive can also follow the preposition \"pa\" \"on\", which combines with \"ku\" to make \"po-\" (with a low tone):\n\nThe Infinitive is frequently combined with \"á\" \"of\" to make a verbal adjective or adverb. The syllables \"á\" and \"ku\" usually merge to become a high-toned \"ó\", except when the verb is monosyllabic, when they usually remain separate. Thus \"ákuthándiza\" \"of helping\" is shortened to \"óthándiza\", but \"ákúbá\" \"of stealing\" remains unshortened. Since \"á\" \"of\" changes to \"wá\", \"yá\", \"chá\" etc. according to the noun it refers to, the verbal adjective changes similarly.\n\nFrequently this form of the Infinitive is used as an adjective or adjectival participle:\n\nIt can also be used as a noun, with the noun it agrees with understood:\n\nAnother use is in combination with the prefix \"mwá-\", contracted to \"mó-\", to make an adverb:\n\nThe prefix \"pó-\" (with a high tone) can also sometimes be used as an adverb:\n\nThe verb \"ganiza\" \"think\" combined with the \"zó-\" form of the Infinitive is a common way of saying \"decide to\":\n\nThe negative Infinitive with \"ósa-\" has various uses:\n\nThe word \"ósatí\" (from the irregular verb \"-ti\" \"say\") is frequently used to mean \"not\":\n\nThese tenses occur only in dependent clauses. They generally have relative clause intonation, that is, with a high tone on the subject-marker. In their usage they resemble participles in European languages, but differ from them in that they have a personal subject.\n\nThis tense is resembles a present participle in meaning: \"ndíkúthándiza\" \"while (I am/was) helping\". It is formed like the Present Continuous, but with a tone on the first syllable as well as the third (the two tones link into a plateau). It can refer to the subject, object, or another noun in the sentence:\n\nThe verb \"-li\" is again an exception, since in this tense it has no \"-ku-\", but merely a tone on the first syllable:\n\nA negative of this tense is sometimes found, made with the negative-marker \"-sa-\", which follows the subject-marker:\n\nThe negative is often replaced by the negative verbal adjective starting with \"ósa-\": \"ósazindikíra\" \"without realising\".\n\nThe Persistive Present with \"-kada-\" etc. can also be used in a dependent form, especially with the verb \"-li\". In this case there is also a tone on the initial syllable:\n\nA frequent use is in the phrase \"pákádalí pano\" \"at the present time\" (lit. \"it still being now\"). \n\nThis tense is formed in the same way, but with \"-ta-\" instead of \"-ku-\". The meaning is usually \"after doing something\":\n\nHowever, it can also be used with the meaning \"when\" of an event simultaneous with the main verb:\n\nCombined with the aspect-marker \"-ngo-\", it can mean \"as soon as\":\n\nIt can also be combined with the verbs \"-li\" and \"khala\" \"be\" to make compound tenses:\n\nAnother idiomatic use is after the word \"n'kutí\" in sentences such as the following:\n\nOften the Past Participial tense is used following a verb of wishing, especially when the thing wished for is unrealisable:\n\nAnother use is in conditional sentences (see below).\n\nIt appears from Watkins (1937) that the tense-marker \"-ta-\" derives from a compound tense formed with the verb \"-ti\" \"say\" which has fused into a single verb. Thus \"átákhúta\" \"after his hunger was satisfied\" derives from an earlier \"wátí wákhúta\".\n\nThe opposite of \"-ta-\" is \"-sana-\" or \"-sada-\", which means \"not yet having done\", i.e. \"before doing\". It can be used of past or future time:\n\nIt can also mean \"since\":\n\nThe relative clause intonation of the Perfect Simple has a tone on the first syllable (which may link or spread) and another on the penultimate (which may shift). As well as being used in relative, conditional, and concessive clauses, it also has several other idiomatic uses in some of which is resembles a participial tense.\n\nIt may be used as an adjective:\n\nIt can also be used as a noun, with the noun it describes being understood:\n\nThirdly it can be used in a construction with any tense of the verb \"yamba\" \"begin\" to mean \"begin by doing\":\n\nAdverbial clauses of time (temporal clauses) are clauses such as those which begin with \"when\" or \"after\". One way of making them is to use a participial verb, as described above. But there are also other ways of expressing time, as follows.\n\nThe tense \"-ka-\", which is toneless, refers to a possibility, usually in the future. It can be translated \"when\" or \"if\":\n\nSometimes \"-ka-\" is used in the place of \"-kama-\" to refer to a past habitual situation:\n\nThe same tense with \"-kadza-\" refers to a time \"far in the future\":\n\nThis tense means \"if ever\" or \"whenever\" and unlike \"-ka-\" it refers to past or present time according to context. The tones are on \"-ma-\" and the penultimate syllable:\n\nTo refer to a situation in the future, the aspect-marker \"-dza-\" can be added:\n\nAnother way of expressing a temporal clause is to use \"paméne\" or \"m'méne\" \"when\", which are followed by the relative clause intonation of the verb. If two events happened or are going to happen at the same time, the Chichewa idiom is that the verb in the \"when\" clause usually uses an imperfective tense, as in the examples below:\n\nHowever, other tenses are possible; for example, the following uses a form of the Subjunctive with \"-dza-\":\n\nA way of expressing \"since\" is to use a nominalised form of the verb beginning with \"chi-\" and ending in \"-íre\" or \"-íreni\" (in some verbs \"-ére\" or \"-éreni\"). There is a single tone on the penultimate syllable (not counting \"-ni\"):\n\nThe same form of the verb with \"chi...-ire\" can also mean \"still\" or \"always\".\n\nAnother way of expressing \"since\" is to use \"kuyámbira\" \"to begin from\" followed by a dependent clause verb:\n\nFor a third way of expressing \"since\", see \"-sana-\" above.\n\nConditional clauses are those which begin with a word such as \"if\".\n\nOne way of making a condition is to use the conjunction \"ngati\" \"if\", followed by the relative clause intonation. (This is in fact the only way conditions can be expressed with the verb \"-li\".) \"Ngati\" can also be used to make indirect questions:\n\nA simple conditional clause about the future can be made with the toneless \"-ka-\" tense:\n\nThere is no negative, but a negative meaning can be expressed with the verb \"panda\" \"be without\":\n\nThe infix \"-dza-\" can be added to refer to the distant future:\n\nThe participial tense \"-ta-\" can also have the meaning \"if\", referring to a hypothetical situation in the future. The main clause will often use \"-nga-\" or \"khoza\" \"be able\":\n\nAnother possibility is to use \"ndítátí\" (lit. \"if I say\") with the subjunctive:\n\nTo make a condition about a hypothetical situation in the past, \"-kada-\" or \"-kana-\" or \"-daka-\" is used in both halves of the sentence, with the relative clause intonation in the \"if\" clause:\n\nThe \"if\" clause alone can also mean \"should have\" or \"if only\":\n\nThe same tense can be used when wishing for some past hypothetical situation:\n\nFor a negative conditional, the verb \"-panda\" (\"be without\") is used in the \"if\" clause:\n\nSometimes, instead of using \"-kada-\" in the main clause, the word \"bwenzi\" \"it would be the case that\" or \"síbwenzi\" \"it would not be the case that\" is used, followed by a participial verb:\n\nThe following example, instead of \"-kada-\", uses the relative clause intonation of \"-li\" in the \"if\" clause:\n\nSince \"-kada-\" is a perfective tense, sentences with \"-kada-\" usually refer to the past. However, sometimes if \"-khala\" is used, the reference can be to a hypothetical situation in the present:\n\nA present situation can also be expressed with \"bwenzi\" \"it would be the case that\" and a Present Participial tense:\n\nIn some varieties of Chichewa the tense-marker \"-chi-\" can be used instead of \"-kada-\" in the \"if\" clause in hypothetical conditional sentences, but this is rare except in the word \"pachipanda\" \"were it not for\":\n\nIn English, as in some other languages, a verb in an indirect statement usually goes into the past tense when the main verb is in the past tense. However, in Chichewa this rule does not apply and sentences such as the following, in which there is no change of tense in the dependent clause, are common:\n\nIn the same way, the participial tenses can refer to a present, past, or future situation according to the tense of the main verb which they are used:\n\nCompound tenses are also found in Chichewa. Among them are the following:\n\n\"-li\" can be followed by an infinitive:\n\nBut a participial tense is also sometimes used:\n\n\"-khala\" is generally combined with one of the participial tenses:\n\nThe verb \"-ti\" \"say\", followed by one of the subjunctive tenses, makes a future in the past:\n\nThe literal meaning of \"timatí tikádye\" is \"we were saying we should go and eat\". Other ways of expressing the future in the past are to add \"-dza-\" to the Past Imperfective tense (\"ndimadzáthandizá\" \"I was about to help\") or to use \"-funa\" \"want\" with the Infinitive (\"ndinkáfuná kuthándiza\" \"I was wanting to help\").\n\nThe verb \"-chita\" \"do\" can be used in various tenses followed by an Infinitive, e.g.:\n\nThe difference in meaning, if any, between this and the simple form of the verb is not clear.\n\nA further auxiliary verb, \"yenda\" \"walk, go\", is mentioned by Watkins in the form Present Simple plus Infinitive; it was used in narrative with the meaning \"and then\" (\"ayéndopíta\" \"he then went\"). However, this verb is no longer used as an auxiliary in current standard Chichewa.\n\n"}

{"id": "6199530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6199530", "title": "Czech conjugation", "text": "Czech conjugation\n\nCzech conjugation is a term denoting Czech language verb conjugation, or system of grammatically-determined modifications, in verbs in the Czech language.\n\nCzech is a null-subject language, i.e. the subject (including personal pronouns) can be omitted if known from context. The person is expressed by the verb:\n\nThe infinitive is formed by the ending -t, formerly also \"-ti\"; on some words -ct (-ci):\n\nSomewhat archaically:\n\nParticiples are used for forming the past tense, conditionals and the passive voice in Czech. They are related to the short forms of adjectives. Therefore unlike other verb forms, they also express gender which must correspond with the gender of the subject.\n\n(more precisely \"active participle\") is also called \"l-participle\" and is used for forming the past tense and the conditionals.\n\nis also called \"n/t-participle\" and is used for forming the passive voice. There are two types of endings:\n\nThe predicate must always be in accordance with the subject in the sentence – in number and person (personal pronouns), and with past and passive participles also in gender. This grammatical principle affects the orthography (see also Czech orthography) – it is especially important for the correct choice and writing of plural endings of participles.\n\nExamples:\nThe example mentioned shows both past (byl, byla ...) and passive (koupen, koupena ...) participles. The accordance in gender takes effect in the past tense and the passive voice, not in the present and future tenses in active voice.\n\nIf the complex subject is a combination of nouns of different genders, masculine animate gender is prior to others and the masculine inanimate and feminine genders are prior to the neuter gender.\n\nExamples:\n\nPriority of genders:\n\nThe transgressive (\"přechodník\") expresses an action which happens coincidentally with or foregoing some other action.\n\nThe transgressive (\"přechodník\") is an archaic form of the verb in the Czech and Slovak languages. Nowadays, it is used only occasionally for artistic purposes or in unchanging expressions. Transgressives were still used quite widely in Czech literature in the beginning of the 20th century (not in the spoken language). For example, Jaroslav Hašek's The Good Soldier Švejk contains a lot of them.\n\nThe Czech language recognizes present and past transgressives. The present transgressive can express present or future action according to the aspect of the verb it is derived from. The past transgressive is usually derived from perfective verbs.\n\nExamples:\n\nCzech verbs are distinguished by aspect, they are either perfective or imperfective. Perfective verbs indicate the finality of the process. Therefore, they cannot express the present tense.\n\nPerfective verbs are usually formed adding prefixes to imperfective verbs:\n\nSome perfective verbs are not formally related to imperfective ones:\n\nCzech verbs express three absolute tenses - past, present and future. Relativity can be expressed by the aspect, sentence constructions and participles.\n\nThe present tense can be expressed in imperfective verbs only.\n\nThe present tense is formed by special endings:\n\nVerbs are divided into 5 classes according to the way of forming the present tense. They are described in more detail below.\n\nThe past tense is formed by the past participle (in a proper gender form) and present forms of the verb být (to be) which are omitted in the 3rd person. The following example is for the male gender (animate in plural):\n\n\"Dělat\" - to do\n\nFor the choice of past tense form when the number or gender of the subject may not be clear, see .\n\nIn imperfective verbs, it is formed by the future forms of the verb být (to be) and the infinitive:\n\n\"Dělat\" – to do\n\n\"Budu, budeš, ...\" with infinitive has the same meaning as “(I, you, ...) will” in English. If not followed by an infinitive, it means “(I, you, ...) will be” (i.e. I will be = \"budu\", not \"budu být\").\n\nIn some verbs of motion, the future tense is formed by adding the prefix po-/pů- to the present form:\n\nIn perfective verbs, the present form expresses the future. Compare:\n\nThere is no sequence of tenses in Czech. The types of clauses like in the indirect speech use tenses that express the time which is spoken about. The tense of the subordinate clause is not shifted to the past even though there is the past tense in the main clause:\n\nThe imperative mood is formed for the 2nd person singular and plural and the 1st person plural.\n\nIn the 2nd person singular, it takes either null ending or -i/-ej ending, according to the verb class.\n\nThe 2nd person plural takes the ending -te/-ete/-ejte and the 1st person plural takes -me/-eme/-ejme.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe conditionals are formed by the past participle and special forms of the verb být (to be). Following example of the present conditional is for the male gender (animate in plural):\n\n\"dělal bych\" - I would do\n\nThere is also the past conditional in Czech but it is usually replaced by the present conditional.\n\n\"byl bych dělal\" - I would have done\n\n\"By\" also becomes a part of conjugations \"aby\" (so that) and \"kdyby\" (if). Therefore, these conjunctions take the same endings:\n\nThere are two ways to form the passive voice in Czech:\n\n1. By the verb být (to be) and the passive participle (as in English):\n\n2. By adding the reflexive pronoun se:\n\nHowever, the use of \"se\" is not exclusive to the passive voice.\n\nReflexive pronouns se and si are components of reflexive verbs (\"se/si\" is not usually translated into English):\n\nNegation is formed by the prefix ne-. In the future tense and the passive voice it is added to the auxiliary verb \"být\" (to be).\n\nUnlike English, a negative pronoun must be used with a negative verb (using a positive verb is ungrammatical):\n\nIn imperative, \"0/-te/-me\" endings are in most verbs, -\"i/-ete/-eme\" or \"-i/-ěte/-ěme\" if two consonants are at the end of the word-stem.\n\nIn imperative, \"0/-te/-me\" endings are in most verbs, -\"i/-ete/-eme\" or \"-i/-ěte/-ěme\" if two consonants are at the end of the word-stem.\n\nIrregular future tense:\n\nIrregular negation:\n\n"}

{"id": "2746622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2746622", "title": "Deadeye", "text": "Deadeye\n\nA deadeye is an item used in the standing and running rigging of traditional sailing ships. It is a smallish round thick wooden (usually lignum vitae) disc with one or more holes through it, perpendicular to the plane of the disc. Single and triple-hole deadeyes are most commonly seen. The three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep's skull.\nSingle deadeyes (or bull's eyes) are used to guide and control a line and, particularly in older vessels, to change its direction. More modern systems would use a block for this purpose but in traditional rigs with many lines to deal with, designed when blocks were relatively expensive to make, a deadeye provided an acceptable compromise. When blocks came into common use for adjusting running rigging, deadeyes continued to be used for tensioning standing rigging.\nTriple deadeyes are used in pairs; a line called a lanyard is run back and forth between them, through the holes, so that they function again much as a block and tackle would. This provides a mechanical advantage, pulling harder on whatever the deadeyes are attached to. Pairs of deadeyes are placed in the shrouds (the lines that hold up the mast), where they are used to create greater tension in the shrouds. To set up the lanyards used with dead-eyes, a suitable grease such as tallow is first applied to the holes. After reeving the lanyard through the deadeyes, the end is hooked to a handy purchase in the rig above, such as the throat halyard. By hauling on the halyard the lanyard in the deadeyes is drawn up taut. A small wooden wedge is knocked into the last hole, to prevent the lanyard sliding back, and the end is unhooked from the purchase and made up on the shroud above the upper deadeye. The wedge can then be removed ready for the next shroud. As an alternative the tackle on the lanyard can be made fast to the shroud well above the upper deadeye so that it compresses the deadeyes. The last part of the lanyard can then be seized to an adjacent part between the deadeyes. When this is finished the tackle is cast off and the lanyard made off. \n\nIn recent decades, as steel wire became the prevalent material for sailboat rigging, deadeyes and laynards gave way to metal turnbuckles for tensioning the wires. More recently, however, with the advent of high-strength and low-stretch synthetic fibres, some sailboats are using synthetic rope for standing rigging, and deadeyes and lanyards are coming back into use as tensioning devices.\n\n"}

A boyhood friend, and later political adversary, of Joseph Stalin, he is primarily known for his book \"Stalin und die Tragödie Georgiens\" (\"Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia', Berlin, 1932), the first memoir of Stalin's childhood.\n\nBoth Stalin and Iremashvili grew up in Gori, Georgia (then part of the Tiflis Governorate, Imperial Russia), where they attended a local church school. Later, they studied together at Tiflis Theological Seminary. A member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, Iremashvili was involved in the revolutionary activities in Transcaucasia and joined the Menshevik faction which quickly became a dominant political force in Georgia. After 1917, he worked as a teacher at Tiflis and was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Georgia in 1919. In February 1921, the Soviet Russian Red Army invaded Georgia and put an end to its three-year independence. Iremashvili, like several other Georgian Mensheviks, was placed in the Metekhi prison, but was then released through the efforts of his sister who negotiated with Stalin during his visit to Tiflis in July 1921. In October 1921, sixty-two arrested Mensheviks, including Iremashvili, were deported to Germany where he was granted a political asylum. Having settled in Berlin, he engaged in Georgian émigré activities aimed at enlisting Europe’s support to the Georgian independence cause.\n\nIn 1932, he published, in German, his memoirs, \"Stalin und die Tragödie Georgiens\" (\"Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia\"). Published in emigration and immune to Soviet censure, the book, although hostile to Stalin, is considered the only independent contemporary account of Stalin's youth and his early years in Georgia, and has proven a vital source for Stalin biographers. In his memoirs, Iremashvili relates many details of the Gori life of Soso (Stalin's childhood name), with particular emphasis of his brutal treatment at the hands of his father, Vissarion Dzhugashvili. The primary deduction made by Iremashvili based upon his account was followed by several psychobiographers, most notably by Gustav Bychowski and Daniel Rancour-Lafferiere, which consider beatings the key psychological determination of the future dictator. Iremashvili also reports that the young Stalin voluntarily terminated his studies at the Seminary, and was not expelled for his revolutionary activity as stated in the Soviet leader’s official biography. In addition, he claims that Soso’s parents were ethnic Ossetians, thus explaining Stalin’s particularly hard-line policy towards independent Georgia and his excessive harshness in suppressing anti-Soviet opposition in the Georgian SSR in the 1920s.\n\n"}

Covey, who spoke Mende and possibly other African languages as well as English, allowed the African passengers of the \"Amistad\" to communicate with the court and to defend themselves successfully against the charges of mutiny and murder.\n\nCovey was born \"circa\" 1825 or 1826 in the southwestern highlands of what is now Sierra Leone, in West Africa. His African name, Kaweli, means \"war road\" in Mende. At the age of five or six he was kidnapped and sold to the wife of a chief of the Bulom tribe. Three years later he was sold to a European slaver and probably taken to the Lomboko slave camp. At a time when the Atlantic slave trade had already been officially outlawed, Covey was illegally shipped to Cuba on board the Spanish ship \"Segundo Socorro\". That ship was intercepted by the British fleet and the captives, including Covey, were freed.\n\nCovey was then put into the care of the Rev. John William Weeks, of the Freetown branch of the Church Missionary Society. He spent five years at school in Freetown before joining the British Royal Navy and embarking on the HMS \"Buzzard\" in 1838, where he served under Captain Charles Fitzgerald. Covey arrived to New York City on board the \"Buzzard\" in June 1839.\n\nJosiah Gibbs, a professor of linguistics at Yale University who was personally committed to the abolition of slavery, sought to assist the legal defense of the Africans who had come into the custody of the U.S. federal courts after their uprising on board \"La Amistad\". To that end, Prof. Gibbs learned to count to ten in the language spoken by most of the Africans, which turned out to be Mende, and then paced the harbor in New Haven and later in New York, until he was approached by sailors who recognized the words. In this way, Gibbs came into contact with Covey and fellow British sailor Charles Pratt in New York, in October 1839.\n\nGibbs took both Covey and Pratt to New Haven, where they were housed under the protection of Lewis Tappan and the committee for the defense of the captives of the \"Amistad\". Covey stayed in New Haven for four months, until he had translated the testimonies of three Mende-speaking captives in the Amistad civil trial in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1841. Because of his own experience, Covey was instrumental in interpreting and communicating the details of the kidnapping, terror, and eventual rebellion. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in \"United States v. The Amistad\" that the captives were not slaves, but freeborn men.\n\nTwo years after the trials, in November 1841, Covey, along with the 35 surviving Africans of the \"Amistad,\" boarded the ship \"Gentleman\" and returned to Africa. The Africans were accompanied by an American missionary, William Raymond. Covey then drifted in and out of the Christian missionary communities in Sierra Leone. There is some evidence that he became involved with a local warlord and may even have participated in a slaving expedition in 1845. After falling ill, he was shuffled back and forth between the village of Kaw-Mendi and the main mission compound, \"America\". Covey died on 12 October, 1850 and was given a Christian burial.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg's film \"Amistad\", Covey is played by actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.\n\n"}

His works made clean break from the neo-realism that dominated Malayalam literature through the 1950s and 1960s. He is often credited with laying the foundation of modernism in Malayalam literature. He is a recipient of Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and Kerala Sahitya Akademi Awards in addition to numerous other awards and recognitions.\n\nBorn in Thiruvalla as the second son of evangelist George Kakkanadan and Rosamma, George Varghese Kakkanadan spent most of his childhood at Kollam and Kottarakkara. Though Kakkanadan's father was closely associated with the church, he was a Left sympathiser. Their house in Kottarakkara was a refuge for prominent Communist leaders of the past, who were forced to go hiding. After completing BSc Chemistry from SN College, Kollam, Kakkanadan started his career as a school teacher in Kerala. He quit the job to join Southern Railway in Tamil Nadu in 1957. In 1961 shifted to Ministry of Indian Railways in New Delhi where he worked till 1967. He went to Germany in 1967 on a scholarship to pursue research in literature but abandoned it midway and returned to Kerala to become a full-time writer. Kakkanadan also worked as an editorial member in S. K. Nair's \"Malayalanadu\" weekly published from Kollam, between 1971 and 1973.\n\nArtist Rajan Kakkanadan and writers Thampi Kakkanadan and G. Ignatius Kakkanadan are his brothers. Ignatius Kakkanadan, his elder brother, was a journalist and was an editorial board member of \"Janayugom\" and Malayalam magazine \"Soviet Nadu\". He was also a noted translator and had translated the works of B. R. Ambedkar and Amartya Sen under a Kerala Bhasha Institute Project. Kakkanadan's younger brother Thampi Kakkanadan was also a writer who authored several short stories and published a novel- \"Kalapathinte Orma\". Kakkanadan also has two sisters Ammini, wife of the former Member of Parliament P. A. Solomon, and Annie. Kakkanadan married Ammini in 1965. They have three children: Radha, Rajan and Rishi.\n\nKakkanadan died on 19 October 2011 aged 76 at Bishop Benziger's hospital in Kollam. He was battling cancer for the past few years. He was laid to rest with full state honours at the Polayathode public crematorium complex. He is survived by his wife and three children - two sons (Rajan & Rishi) and a daughter (Radha).\n\nThough he had started writing much before the railway stint and even wrote the novel \"Vasoori\", it was his second novel \"Sakshi\" that brought him laurels. The book had a great impact on the younger generation of Malayalam readers and was credited with breaking new grounds in Malayalam literature. In early 1960s, he shot into prominence as one of the most promising writers in Malayalam and was among the pioneers of the modernist trend in Malayalam literature. Kakkanadan's early works broke new ground in Malayalam fiction on account of their earnest exploration of deeper realities of life by employing a new diction and narrative methods. Though vast majority of readers initially found it hard to accept the modern trends ushered in by Kakkanadan and some of his contemporaries, their works soon created a new sensibility marking a radical break from the past.\n\nHe was one of the harbingers of modernism in the genres of Malayalam novel and short story. Though labelled by his readers as a formidable ultramodern Malayalam writer, Kakkanadan himself was of the view that modernism in literature has no convincing rationale. Several of his works are considered landmarks in the history of literary modernism in Malayalam. Moving with ease from apocalyptic visions to tantric imagery, he made his works representative of an important strand in the larger modernist trends in arts, literature and culture in India.\nKakkanadan was a rebel, both in life and literature. His rebellion extended from his selection of themes and use of subversive language to his careful crafting of the philosophy of angst into the writing. He often traversed the sweat zones of life and spoke of the valleys of the unknowing. With a stunningly violent style, he shook the very roots of the progressive literary sensibilities of the 1960s and 1970s and its innocent certainties. His was a world of dark tones and darker people, many of them social rejects. He often spoke of the seamy side, the world of puss and blood. Each of his works was an act of rebellion against accepted elitist social mores and codes. Sex, like violence, was a leitmotif in many of his works; at times as a resonant chant, at others as an explosive outpouring of raw human power that transcends both the demonic and the divine. Kakkanadan's major novels are \"Sakshi\" (1967), \"Ezham Mudra\" (1968), \"Vasoori\" (1968), \"Ushnamekhala\" (1969), \"Kozhi\" (1971), \"Parankimala\" (1971), \"Ajnathayude Thaazhvara\" (1972), \"Innaleyude Nizhal\" (1974), \"Adiyaravu\" (1975), \"Orotha\" (1982), \"Ee Naaykkalute Lokam\" (1983) and \"Barsaathi\" (1986). His most noted short story collections are \"Yuddhaavasaanam\" (1969), \"Purathekkulla Vazhi\" (1970), \"Aswathamaavinte Chiri\" (1979), \"Sreechakram\" (1981), \"Alwar Thirunagarile Pannikal\" (1989), \"Uchayillaatha Oru Divasam\" (1989) and \"Jaappaana Pukayila\" (2005). He has other novels, short story collections, travelogues and essay collections to his credit. Director Bharathan adapted the novels \"Parankimala\" and \"Adiyaravu\" for the films \"Parankiala\" (1981) and \"Parvathi\" (1981). K. G. George's \"Onappudava\" (1978) was based on Kakkanadan's novel of the same name. Kakkanadan's short story \"Chithalukal\" was made into a film by Kamal, titled \"Unnikrishnante Adyathe Christmas\" (1988).\n\nHe won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for his short-story collection \"Aswathamavinte Chiri\" in 1980 and for his novel \"Orotha\" in 1984. In 2005 he won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award for \"Jappana Pukayila\" and in 2008 he was bestowed with the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto. She was born on 29 January 1904 in Warsaw, then in partitioned Poland. She was an active promoter of Esperanto as well as of Homaranismo, a form of religious humanism first defined by her father.\n\nAround 1925 she became a member of the Bahá'í Faith. In late 1937 she went to the United States to teach that religion as well as Esperanto. In December 1938 she returned to Poland, where she continued to teach and translated many Bahá'í writings. The date on which she was murdered is unclear. In The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names, three conflicting testimonies are given for her date of her death: July 5, October, and September 5 in 1942. Hence, her murder date was in the latter part of 1942. She was murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp during the Holocaust in Poland.\n\nLidia Zamenhof learned Esperanto as a nine-year-old girl. At the age of fourteen she had already done translations from Polish literature; her first publications appeared several years thereafter. Having completed her university studies in law in 1925, she dedicated herself totally to working for Esperanto. In the same year during the 17th World Congress in 1925 in Geneva she became acquainted with the Bahá'í Faith. Lidia Zamenhof became secretary of the homaranistic Esperanto-Society Concord in Warsaw and often made arrangements for speakers and courses. Starting at the Vienna World Congress of Esperanto in 1924 she attended every World Congress. (She did not attend the 1938 Universala Kongreso in England, as she was in the United States at the time.) As an instructor of the Cseh method of teaching Esperanto she made many promotional trips and taught many courses in various countries.\n\nShe actively coordinated her work with the student Esperanto movement — in the International Student League, in the UEA, in the Cseh Institute, and in the Bahá'í Faith. Additionally, Lidia wrote for the journal \"Literatura Mondo\" (mainly studies on Polish Literature), and also contributed to \"Pola Esperantisto\", \"La Praktiko\", \"Heroldo de Esperanto\", and \"Enciklopedio de Esperanto\". Her translation of \"Quo Vadis\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz was published in 1933 and is very well known.\n\nIn 1937 she went to the United States for a long stay. In December 1938 she had to leave the United States because that country's Immigration Service declined to extend her tourist visitor's visa because of her allegedly illegal \"paid labor\" of teaching Esperanto. She refused offers of marriage that could have permitted her to remain or eventually to naturalize. After returning to Poland, her homeland, she travelled around the country teaching Esperanto and the Bahá'í Faith.\n\nUnder the German occupation regime of 1939, her home in Warsaw became part of the Warsaw Ghetto. She was arrested under the charge of having gone to the United States to spread anti-Nazi propaganda, but after a few months, she was released and returned to her home city where she and the rest of her family remained confined. There she endeavored to help others get medicine and food. She was offered help and escape several times by Polish Esperantists but refused in each case. To one Pole, well-known Esperantist Józef Arszennik, who had offered her refuge on several occasions, she explained, \"you and your family could lose your lives, because whoever hides a Jew perishes along with the Jew who is discovered.\" To another, her explanation was contained in her last known letter: \"Do not think of putting yourself in danger; I know that I must die but I feel it is my duty to stay with my people. God grant that out of our sufferings a better world may emerge. I believe in God. I am a Bahá'í and will die a Bahá'í.

Their use is strategic for the rapid expansion of cellular networks putting into service point-to-point radio connections, as well as supporting sudden increases of mobile traffic in case of extraordinary events (trade fairs, sports events and concerts, emergencies, catastrophic events, etc.). Mobile cell sites are also used by law enforcement organizations to gather intelligence.\nMobile cell sites require neither civil works nor foundations, just minimal requirements like commercial power and grounding. The mobile units have been designed to be a temporary solution, but if requested, they can be transformed into a permanent station.\n\nThere are several different kinds of mobile cell sites, every one of which has different usage characteristics.\n\nRDUs are mobile radio base stations transportable on trucks. Their use is strategic for the rapid expansion of cellular networks.\nA rapid deployment flanged pole is a mobile radio base station infrastructure transportable on truck, allowing fast and easy installation in restricted spaces. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 30 meters. \nThe flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete, including lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in checkered plate.\n\nA radio station kit is an integrated radio base station RDU in which the equipment housing is a special 20” container equipped to contain, during transportation, all the station infrastructures, assembly accessories, radiant systems, storage batteries, electrical and radio equipment. It is a structure which can be quickly and easily transported and assembled on site, without the need of civil works or foundations and suitable for any environment.\n\nA rapid deployment compact kitstat is a flanged pole RDU which allows easy and fast erection in narrow sites, without any need of foundation or civil works. The antenna supporting structure supplied complete with climbing ladder and anchored to the steelwork base frame, is a flanged pole composed by tubular flanged sections with a height up to 30 m and two or three steel guys series.\n\nA quickrawland with polygonal pole is an RDU which allows an easy and fast erection in narrow sites, without any need of foundation or civil works. It is provided with a polygonal pole with a height up to 30 m; it has a climbing ladder with rigid anchor line (EN353-1) and vertical fixing system for feeders and service cables.\n\nCells on wheels (COW), or site on wheels, are telecom infrastructures, placed on trailer approved for road use, towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 3500 kg. These mobile radio base stations guarantee full operation in just one day and in restricted spaces. COWs provide fully functional service, via vehicles such as trailers, vans and trucks, to areas affected by natural disaster or areas with large user volume, such as major events. The backhaul to the network can be via terrestrial microwave, communication satellite, or existing wired infrastructure.\n\nMobile radio base stations with flanged pole are mobile support structures composed of a special trailer with retracting stabilizers approved for road use. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and it is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 20 meters. The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete of lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in checkered plate.\n\nA rapid deployment self-mounting pole is a mobile supporting structure corresponds to a special two-axle trailer with telescopic stabilizers approved for road traffic.\nThe antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy and fast, and is carried out with manual winches.\n\nAnother RDU is a mobile cell site with self-mounting pole; that can be towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 7500 kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out by means of manual winches.\n\nMobile station on trailer is a mobile stations with telescopic mast are portable structures, towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 12000 kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 30 m, is made of steel and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with manual or electric winches.\n\nCOWs are used to provide expanded cellular network coverage and/or capacity for short-term demands, such as at special events such as major sporting events (Super Bowl, World Series, Rose Bowl), major conventions, or in disaster areas where cellular coverage either was minimal, never present (e.g., in a wilderness area where firefighters have set up a command center during a major forest fire) or was compromised by the disaster (e.g., in the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina).\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks on New York City in 2001, 36 cellular COWs were deployed by September 14, 2001 in Lower Manhattan to support the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and provide critical phone service to rescue and recovery workers.\n\nCOWs provided cellular service in Southwest Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Charley in 2004 when most of the area's stationary cell towers were destroyed. In January 2009, 26 cell-on-wheels units were put in place in Washington, D.C. for the inauguration of Barack Obama to handle the millions of extra people and their calls in the city, especially on and near the National Mall. In January 2017 additional COWs, both temporary, and permanent, have been installed at the National Mall for the inauguration of Donald Trump as well as for future inaugurations and other events due to the steady rise in LTE-based smartphones and other devices in the later half of the 2010s. \n\nMany telecommunications companies also use COWs for long-term placement when financing or infrastructure considerations prevent building a permanent site at the location. For instance, a carrier may have approved the placement of a cell site for coverage reasons, but the remaining budget is inadequate to fund the construction for a fiscal quarter or even longer. An engineering team may be able to place a COW on location to provide immediate coverage with few costs other than leasing, electricity, and backhaul. The decision to use a COW for an extended period of time may also be driven by the property owner. Installations on government or military facilities may be granted only on a temporary basis and may require the use of non-permanent facilities.\n\nA cell on truck is a particular kind of mobile cell site that is composed of mobile trucks with container and with self-mounting telescopic mast. They are portable structures that guarantee full operation in three hours and in restricted spaces.\nThe steel interface frame is made of galvanized steel beams and is provided with four retracting stabilizers that can be retracted under the container for transport. The equipment and power container, which has a reinforced special 20' box container with two access doors, divided by an intermediate partition to create two separate rooms (E and A). Room A is used for housing the electrical and radio equipment. Room E is used as a power room for housing the generating set; and also, during transport, to contain the radiant systems and accessory components.\nThe antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with manual winches.\n\n\n"}

He supervised the pratishtha consecration ceremony of many—perhaps most—of the Jain idols carved on the hill side in the Gwalior Fort during the rule of Tomara rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha.\n\nRaidhu was born in the Padmavati Purval Jain community, as he himself acknowledged. His birth place is uncertain, but he appears to have spent most of his life in or around Gwalior. He was a lay disciple of the Jain leader Bramha Shripal, who was a disciple of Bhattaraka Yashahkiriti of Kashtha Sangha.\n\nRaidhu was an important figure in the Gwalior court, where he stayed at the invitation of the Tomara king Dungarasimha. He was also a close associate of the Digambara ascetics (Bhattarakas) who were influential in the Tomara court. Besides, Raidhu was patronized by several wealthy Jain merchants. Raidhu played a central role in connecting these different groups together: he authored religious books for the wealthy merchants, and encouraged them to donate money towards religious causes.\n\nRaidhu's powerful and wealthy sponsors helped disseminate his literary works, some of which are lavishly illustrated (e.g. \"Jasodharacariu\"). These patrons included Kamalasimha, Yashahkirti, Khelha Brahmachari, Sanghadhipati Nemadasa and Asapati. Kamalasimha started the development of Gwalior as a Jain holy place, with support from the Tomara rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha. The Digambara monk Yashahkirti and Khelha Brahmachari encouraged Raidhu to write \"Sammaijiṇacariu\", a biography of Mahavira. Khelha also commissioned the colossal image of Chandraprabha. Sanghadhipati Nemadasa was a patron of Raidhu's poem \"Puṇṇāsavakahākosa\", and also built a Jain shrine on his recommendation. Asapati was a minister of the Tomara king Dungarasimha.\n\nRaidhu was also responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carvings inside the fort, as attested by multiple inscriptions. These include the two colossal images of Adinatha (57 feet) and Chandraprabha. Medieval Jain texts state that certain sacred mountains covered with images of Jinas would survive the destruction of the world. Raidhu's poems often mention the end times (\"kaliyuga\"), and several near-contemporary poets also allude to the end times amid the Muslim conquests. Therefore, it appears that the colossal Jain images were intended to ensure the survival of Gopalagiri (the Gwalior fort hill) in the end times.\n\nRaidhu composed several poems in Apabhramsha, many of which have survived. He composed many of these poems while living in the Jain temples of Gopalagiri. Raja Ram Jain translated Raidhu's poems into Hindi language.\n\nRaidhu's known works include:\n\n\nSome of his texts are still being discovered in Jain libraries. A Raidhu Award, named after him, of Rs. 21,000 is given every year by the Shyamlal Shastri Trust in Firozabad.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10516775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10516775", "title": "Russian language in Ukraine", "text": "Russian language in Ukraine\n\nThe Russian language is the most common first language in the Donbass and Crimea regions of Ukraine, and the predominant language in large cities in the East and South of the country. The usage and status of the language (currently Ukrainian is the only state language of Ukraine) is an object of political disputes within Ukrainian society. Nevertheless, Russian is a widely used language in Ukraine in pop culture and informal and business communications.\n\nThe East Slavic languages originated in the language spoken in Rus. Significant differences in spoken language in different regions began to be noticed after the division of the Rus lands between the Golden Horde (from about 1240) and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania eventually allied with the Kingdom of Poland in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Muscovites under the Golden Horde developed the modern Russian language, people in the northern Lithuanian sector developed Belorussian, and in the southern Polish sector Ukrainian.\n\nIt is worth noting that the ethnonym \"Ukrainian\" for the people was not well established until the 19th century, although their land was known as \"Ukraine\" in English since before the 18th century. The land was known in the West as Ruthenia, and the people as Ruthenians. (The Oxford English Dictionary traces the word \"Ukrainian\" in English back as far as 1804.) The Russian imperial centre, however, preferred the names \"Little\" and \"White\" Russias for the Ukrainian and Belarusian lands respectively, as compared to Great Russia.\n\nNo definitive geographical border separated people speaking Russian and those speaking Ukrainian - rather gradual shifts in vocabulary and pronunciation marked the areas between the historical cores of the languages. Since the 20th century, however, people have started to identify themselves with their spoken vernacular and to conform to the literary norms set by academics.\n\nAlthough the ancestors of a small ethnic group of Russians - Goriuns resided in Putyvl region (what is modern northern Ukraine)\nin the times of Grand Duchy of Lithuania or perhaps even earlier, the Russian language in Ukraine has primarily come to exist in that country through two channels: through the migration of ethnic Russians into Ukraine and through the adoption of the Russian language by Ukrainians.\n\nThe first new waves of Russian settlers onto what is now Ukrainian territory came in the late 16th century to the empty lands of Slobozhanshchyna that Russia gained from the Tatars, although Ukrainian peasants from the west escaping harsh exploitative conditions outnumbered them.\n\nMore Russian speakers appeared in the northern, central and eastern territories of modern Ukraine during the late 17th century, following the Cossack Rebellion (1648–1657) which Bohdan Khmelnytsky led against Poland. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to a massive movement of Ukrainian settlers to the Slobozhanshchyna region, which converted it from a sparsely inhabited frontier area to one of the major populated regions of the Tsardom of Russia. Following the Pereyaslav Rada of 1654 the modern northern and eastern parts of Ukraine entered into the Russian Tsardom. This brought the first significant, but still small, wave of Russian settlers into central Ukraine (primarily several thousand soldiers stationed in garrisons, out of a population of approximately 1.2 million non-Russians). Although the number of Russian settlers in Ukraine prior to the 18th century remained small, the local upper classes within the part of Ukraine acquired by Russia came to use the Russian language widely.\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, large numbers of Russians settled in newly acquired lands in what is now southern Ukraine, a region then known as Novorossiya (\"New Russia\"). These lands had been largely empty prior to the 18th century due to the threat of Crimean Tatar raids, but once St Petersburg had eliminated the Tatar state as a threat, Russian nobles were granted large tracts of fertile land that was worked by newly arrived peasants, most of whom were ethnic Ukrainians but many of whom were Russians.\n\nThe 19th century saw a dramatic increase in the urban Russian population in what is now Ukraine, as ethnic Russian settlers moved into and populated the newly industrialised and growing towns. At the beginning of the 20th century the Russians were the largest ethnic group in almost all large cities within Ukraine's modern borders, including the following: Kiev (54.2%), Kharkiv (63.1%), Odessa (49.09%), Mykolaiv (66.33%), Mariupol (63.22%), Luhansk, (68.16%), Kherson (47.21%), Melitopol (42.8%), Dnipro, (41.78%), Kropyvnytskyi (34.64%), Simferopol (45.64%), Yalta (66.17%), Kerch (57.8%), Sevastopol (63.46%). The Ukrainian migrants who settled in these cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu (particularly with Russian-speaking administration) and needed to adopt the Russian language.\n\nThe Russian Empire promoted the spread of the Russian language among the native Ukrainian population by actively refusing to acknowledge the existence of the Ukrainian language.\n\nAlarmed by the threat of Ukrainian separatism (in its turn influenced by 1863 demands of Polish nationalists), the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Pyotr Valuev in 1863 issued a secret decree that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language as non-grammatical, but allowed all other texts, including fiction. The Emperor Alexander II expanded this ban by issuing the Ems Ukaz in 1876 (which lapsed in 1905). The Ukaz banned all Ukrainian language books and song lyrics, as well as the importation of such works. Furthermore, Ukrainian-language public performances, plays, and lectures were forbidden. In 1881, the decree was amended to allow the publishing of lyrics and dictionaries, and the performances of some plays in the Ukrainian language with local officials' approval. Ukrainian-only troupes were, however, forbidden. Approximately 9% of population spoke Russian at the time of the Russian Empire Census of 1897.\n\nThe Soviet Union in 1918, decreed that all nationalities in the Soviet Union had the right to education in their own language. Thus Ukrainians since that time were entitled to study and learn in the Ukrainian language. During the Soviet times, the attitude to Ukrainian language and culture went through periods of promotion (policy of \"korenization\"), suppression (during the period of Stalinism), and Ukrainization (with the epoch of Khrushchev). Ukrainian cultural organizations, such as theatres or the Writers' Union, were funded by the central administration. While officially there was no state language in the Soviet Union until 1990, Russian in practice had an implicitly privileged position as the only language widely spoken across the country. In 1990 Russian became legally the official all-Union language of the Soviet Union, with constituent republics having rights to declare their own official languages. The Ukrainian language, despite official encouragement and government funding, like other regional languages, was often frowned upon or quietly discouraged, which led to a gradual decline in its usage.\n\nSince the Euromaidan, Ukrainian government issued several laws aimed at enforced Ukrainization in media, education and other spheres.\n\nIn February 2017 the Ukrainian government banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Ukrainian parliament approved the law that most of the broadcast content should be in Ukrainian (75% of national carriers and 50% of local carriers).\n\nThe new 2017 law on education says that Ukrainian language is the language of education at all levels except for one or more subjects that are allowed to be taught in two or more languages, namely English or one of the other official languages of the European Union (i.e., excluding Russian). The law does state that \"persons belonging to indigenous peoples of Ukraine are guaranteed the right to study in public facilities of preschool and primary education in the language of instruction of the respective indigenous people, along with the state language of instruction\" in separate classes or groups. PACE describes this as a significant curtailing of the rights of indigenous peoples carried out without consultations with their representatives.. On July 2018 The Mykolaiv Okrug Administrative Court liquidated the status of the Russian language as a regional one, on the suit (bringing to the norms of the national legislation due to the recognition of the law \"On the principles of the state language policy\" by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine as unconstitutional) of the First Deputy Prosecutor of the Mykolaiv Oblast.\n\nThere is a large difference between the numbers of people whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday communication language. Another thing to keep in mind is that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.\n\nAccording to official data from the 2001 Ukrainian census, the Russian language is native for 29.6% of Ukraine's population (about 14.3 million people). Ethnic Russians form 56% of the total Russian-native-language population, while the remainder are people of other ethnic background: 5,545,000 Ukrainians, 172,000 Belarusians, 86,000 Jews, 81,000 Greeks, 62,000 Bulgarians, 46,000 Moldovans, 43,000 Tatars, 43,000 Armenians, 22,000 Poles, 21,000 Germans, 15,000 Crimean Tatars.\n\nTherefore, the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine forms the largest linguistic group in modern Europe with its language being non-official in the state. The Russian-speaking population of Ukraine constitutes the largest Russophone community outside the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to July 2012 polling by RATING 50% of the surveyed adult residents over 18 years of age considered their native language to be Ukrainian, 29% said Russian, 20% identified both Russian and Ukrainian as their native language, 1% gave another language. 5% could not decide which language is their native one. Almost 80% of respondents stated they did not have any problems using their native language in 2011. 8% stated they had experienced difficulty in the execution (understanding) of official documents; mostly middle-aged and elderly people in South Ukraine and the Donets Basin.\n\nAccording to a 2004 public opinion poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, the number of people using Russian language in their homes considerably exceeds the number of those who declared Russian as their native language in the census. According to the survey, Russian is used at home by 43–46% of the population of the country (in other words a similar proportion to Ukrainian) and Russophones make a majority of the population in Eastern and Southern regions of Ukraine:\n\n\nRussian language dominates in informal communication in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev. It is also used by a sizeable linguistic minority (4-5% of the total population) in Central and Western Ukraine. 83% of Ukrainians responding to a 2008 Gallup poll preferred to use Russian instead of Ukrainian to take the survey.\n\nAccording to data obtained by the \"Public opinion\" foundation (2002), the population of the oblast centres prefers to use Russian (75%). Continuous Russian linguistic areas occupy certain regions of Crimea, Donbass, Slobozhanshchyna, southern parts of Odessa and Zaporizhia oblasts, while Russian linguistic enclaves exist in central Ukraine and Bukovina.\n\nThe Russian language in Ukraine is recognized as the language of a national minority but not as a state language. It is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine adopted by the parliament in 1996. Article 10 of the Constitution reads: \"In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed\". The Constitution declares Ukrainian language as the state language of the country, while other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. The Ukrainian language was adopted as the state language by the Law on Languages adopted in Ukrainian SSR in 1989; Russian was specified as the language of communication with the other republics of Soviet Union. Ukraine signed the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages in 1996, but ratified it only in 2002 when the Parliament adopted the law that partly implemented the charter.\nThe issue of Russian receiving the status of second official language has been the subject of extended controversial discussion ever since Ukraine became independent in 1991. In every Ukrainian election, many politicians, such as former president Leonid Kuchma, used their promise of making Russian a second state language to win support. The recent President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych continued this practice when he was opposition leader. But in an interview with Kommersant during the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election-campaign he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine \"is too politicized\" and said that if elected President in 2010 he would \"have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the European Charter of regional languages\". He implied these law would need 226 votes in the Ukrainian parliament (50% of the votes instead of the 75% of the votes needed to change the constitution of Ukraine). After his early 2010 election as President Yanukovych stated (on March 9, 2010) \"Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language\". At the same time he stressed that it also necessary to develop other regional languages.\n\nIn 1994 a referendum took place in the Donetsk Oblast and the Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the (central) Ukrainian government.\n\nFormer president Viktor Yushchenko, during his 2004 Presidential campaign, also claimed a willingness to introduce more equality for Russian speakers. His clipping service spread an announcement of his promise to make Russian language proficiency obligatory for officials who interact with Russian-speaking citizens. In 2005 Yushchenko stated that he had never signed this decree project. The controversy was seen by some as a deliberate policy of Ukrainization.\n\nIn 2006, the Kharkiv City Rada was the first to declare Russian to be a regional language. Following that, almost all southern and eastern oblasts (Luhansk, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts), and many major southern and eastern cities (Sevastopol, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Yalta, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, Kryvyi Rih, Odessa) followed suit. Several courts overturned the decision to change the status of the Russian language in the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Mykolaiv while in Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts it was retained.\n\nIn August 2012, a law on regional languages entitled any local language spoken by at least a 10% minority to be declared official within that area. Russian was within weeks declared as a regional language in several southern and eastern oblasts and cities. On 23 February 2014, a bill repealing the law was approved by 232 deputies out of 450 but not signed into law by acting-president Oleksandr Turchynov. On 28 February 2018 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled this legislation unconstitutional.\n\nIn December 2016 the importation \"anti-Ukrainian\" books from Russia was restricted. In February 2017 the Ukrainian government completely banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Research and Branding Group (June 2006), the majority of respondents supported the decisions of local authorities: 52% largely supported (including 69% of population of eastern oblasts and 56% of southern regions), 34% largely did not support the decisions, 9% - answered \"partially support and partially not\", 5% had no opinion. According to an all-Ukrainian poll carried out in February 2008 by \"Ukrainian Democratic Circle\" 15% of those polled said that the language issue should be immediately solved, in November 2009 this was 14.7%; in the November 2009 poll 35.8% wanted both the Russian and Ukrainian language to be state languages.\n\nAccording to polling by RATING the level of support for granting Russian the status of a state language decreased (from 54% to 46%) and the number of opponents increased (from 40% to 45%) between 2009 and May 2012; in July 2012 41% of respondents supported granting Russian the status of a state language and 51% opposed it. (In July 2012) among the biggest supporters of bilingualism were residents of the Donets Basin (85%), South Ukraine (72%) and East Ukraine (50%). A further poll conducted by RATING in September–October 2012 found 51% opposed granting official status to the Russian language, whereas 41% supported it. The largest regions of support were Donbass (75%), southern (72%) and eastern (53%), whereas nearly 70% of northern and central Ukraine, and 90% of western Ukraine were in opposition. A survey conducted in February 2015 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that support for Russian as a state language had dropped to 19% (37% in the south, 31% in Donbass and other eastern oblasts). 52% (West: 44%, Central: 57%; South: 43%; East: 61%) said that Russian should be official only in regions where the majority wanted it and 21% said it should be removed from official use.\n\nAlthough officially Russian speakers comprise about 30% (2001 census), 39% of Ukrainians interviewed in a 2006 survey believed that the rights of Russophones were violated because the Russian language is not official in the country, whereas 38% had the opposite position.\n\nA cross-national survey found that 0.5% of respondents felt they were discriminated against because of their language. According to a poll carried out by the Social Research Center at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in late 2009 ideological issues were ranked third (15%) as reasons to organize mass protest actions (in particular, the issues of joining NATO, the status of the Russian language, the activities of left- and right-wing political groups, etc.); behind economic issues (25%) and problems of ownership (17%). According to a March 2010 survey, forced Ukrainization and Russian language suppression are of concern to 4.8% of the population.\n\nHistorically, many famous writers of Russian literature were born and lived in Ukraine. Nikolai Gogol is probably the most famous example of shared Russo-Ukrainian heritage: Ukrainian by descent, he wrote in Russian, and significantly contributed to culture of both nations. Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov was born in Kiev, as well as poet Ilya Erenburg. A number of notable Russian writers and poets hailed from Odessa, including Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov, Anna Akhmatova, Isaak Babel. Russian child poet Nika Turbina was born in Yalta, Crimea.\n\nA significant number of contemporary authors from Ukraine write in Russian. This is especially notable within science fiction and fantasy genres. Kharkiv is considered the \"capital city\" of Ukrainian sci-fi and fantasy, it is home to several popular Russophone Ukrainian writers, such as H. L. Oldie (pen name for Oleg Ladyzhensky and Dmitry Gromov), Alexander Zorich, Andrei Valentinov, and Yuri Nikitin. Science fiction convention \"Zvezdny Most\" (Rus. for \"Star Bridge\") is held in Kharkiv annually. Russophone Ukrainian writers also hail from Kiev, those include Marina and Sergey Dyachenko and Vladimir Arenev. Max Frei hails from Odessa, and Vera Kamsha was born in Lviv. Other Russophone Ukrainian writers of sci-fi and fantasy include Vladimir Vasilyev, Vladislav Rusanov, Alexander Mazin and Fyodor Berezin. \"RBG-Azimuth\", Ukraine's largest sci-fi and fantasy magazine, is published in Russian, as well as now defunct \"Realnost Fantastiki\".\n\nOutside science fiction and fantasy, there is also a number of Russophone realist writers and poets. Ukrainian literary magazine \"Sho\" listed Alexander Kabanov, Boris Khersonsky, Andrey Polyakov, Andrey Kurkov and Vladimir Rafeyenko as best Russophone Ukrainian writers of 2013.\n\nAccording to H. L. Oldie, writing in Russian is an easier way for Ukrainian authors to be published and reach a broader audience. The authors say that it is because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian publishers are interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on grant givers. Many Ukrainian publishers agree and complain about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.\n\nA 2012 study showed that:\n\nRussian-language programming is sometimes subtitled in Ukrainian, and commercials during Russian-language programs are in Ukrainian on Ukraine-based media.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, amidst pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting shut down the broadcast of Russian television channels Rossiya 24, Channel One Russia, RTR Planeta, and NTV Mir in Ukraine. Since 19 August 2014 Ukraine has blocked 14 Russian television channels \"to protect its media space from aggression from Russia, which has been deliberately inciting hatred and discord among Ukrainian citizens\".\n\nIn early June 2015 162 Russian movies and TV series were banned in Ukraine because they were seen to contains popularization, agitation and/or propaganda for the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine (this military intervention is denied by Russia). All movies that feature \"unwanted\" Russian or Russia-supporting actors were also banned.\n\nRussian is by far the preferred language on websites in Ukraine (80.1%), followed by English (10.1%), then Ukrainian (9.5%). The Russian language version of Wikipedia is five times more popular within Ukraine than the Ukrainian one, with these numbers matching those for the 2008 Gallup poll cited above (in which 83% of Ukrainians preferred to take the survey in Russian and 17% in Ukrainian.)\n\nWhile government organizations are required to have their websites in Ukrainian, Ukrainian usage of the Internet is mostly in the Russian language. According to DomainTyper, the top ranking .ua domains are google.com.ua, yandex.ua, ex.ua and i.ua, all of which use the Russian language as default. According to 2013 UIA research, four of the five most popular websites (aside from Google) in Ukraine were Russian or Russophone: those are Vkontakte, Mail.ru, Yandex, and Odnoklassniki. The top Ukrainian language website in this rank is Ukr.net, which was only the 8th most popular, and even Ukr.net uses both languages interchangeably.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, Ukrainian president Poroshenko issued a decree than demanded all Ukrainian internet providers to block access to all most popular Russian social media and websites, including VK, Odnoklassniki, Mail.ru, Yandex citing matters of national security in the context of War in Donbass and explaining it as a response to \"massive Russian cyberattacks across the world\". On the following day the demand for applications that allowed to access blocked websites skyrocketed in Ukrainian segments of App Store and Google Play. The ban was condemned by Human Rights Watch that called it \"a cynical, politically expedient attack on the right to information affecting millions of Ukrainians, and their personal and professional lives\", while head of Council of Europe expressed a \"strong concern\" about the ban.\n\nAmong private secondary schools, each individual institution decides whether to study Russian or not. All Russian-language schools teach the Ukrainian language as a required course.\n\nThe number of Russian-teaching schools has reduced since Ukrainian independence in 1991 and now it is much lower than the proportion of Russophones,\nbut still higher than the proportion of ethnic Russians.\n\nThe \"Law on Education\" formerly granted Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies. This was changed by a new law in 2017 that only allows the use of Ukrainian in secondary schools and higher.\n\nHigher education institutions in Ukraine generally use Ukrainian as the language of instruction.\n\nAccording to parliamentarians of the Supreme Council of Crimea, in 2010 90% students of Crimea were studying in Russian language schools. At the same time, only 7% of students in Crimea study in Ukrainian language schools. In 2012, the only Ukrainian boarding school (50 pupils) in Sevastopol was closed, while children who would not study in Russian language were to be transferred to a boarding school for children with retarded development (see Intellectual disability).\n\nSince January 1, 2010 it is allowed to hold court proceedings in Russian on mutual consent of parties. Citizens who are unable to speak Ukrainian or Russian are allowed to use their native language or the services of an interpreter.\n\n, business affairs in Ukraine were mainly dealt with in Russian, Advanced technical and engineering courses at the university level in Ukraine are taught in Russian, which is about to be changed according to the 2017 law \"On Education\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6895481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6895481", "title": "Sarala Das", "text": "Sarala Das\n\nSarala Dasa or Sarala Das was a 15th-century poet and scholar of Odia literature. Best known for three Odia books — \"Mahabharata\", \"Vilanka Ramayana\" and \"Chandi Purana\" — he was the first scholar to write in Odia. As an originator of Odia literature, his work has formed an enduring source of information for succeeding generations.\n\nThe life of Sarala Dasa is obscure. He was born at \"Kanakavati Patana\", known as Kanakapura, one of the \"Sidhikshetras\" in Jagatsinghpur District. Though the date of his birth cannot be accurately determined, he can safely be placed to the 15th century AD.\n\nSarala Dasa had no systematic early education, and what he achieved through self-education was attributed to the grace of Sarala, goddess of devotion and inspiration. Though his early name was Siddheswar Parida, he was later known as \"Sarala Dasa\", or 'by the boon of Sarala'. (The title \"Dasa\" means a slave or a servant of a particular god or goddess: a long list of poets, preceding and succeeding Sarala Dasa, have names ending this way: for example, Vatra Dasa, Markanda Dasa, Sarala Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Balarama Dasa, and Yasovanta Dasa.) A story - similar to those told of other Indian poets, such as Kali Dasa, supposedly illiterate in early life until helped by the goddess Saraswati - tells that Siddheswar as a boy was once ploughing his father's field and singing so melodiously that the goddess Sarala stopped and listened to his song and endowed him with her power of composing beautiful poems.\n\nThere are several indications in his \"Mahabharata\" that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha.\n\nSarala Dasa spent his last time at \"Bila Sarala\" but the native place \"Kanakavati Patana\" known as \"Kanakapura\" at \"Tentuliapada\" with a religious establishment known as \"Munigoswain\", which marks as the traditional spot, where he composed his works. This period of his lifetime was known as the medieval period.\n\nAs well as the three books for which he is best known - \"Mahabharata\", \"Vilanka Ramayana\" and \"Chandi Purana\" - Sarala Dasa also wrote the book \"Laxmi Narayana Vachanika\". The \"Adi Parva Mahabharata\" opens with a long invocation addressed to the Lord Jagannatha of Puri, from which it is known that Sarala Dasa started writing his \"Mahabharata\" in the reign of Kapileswar, otherwise known as Kapilendra, the famous Gajapati king of Odisha (AD 1435–67). He tells us that Maharaja Kapilesvara with innumerable offerings and many a salute was serving this great deity and hereby destroying the sins of the Kali age.\n\nThough Sarala Dasa followed the main outline of the Sanskrit \"Mahabharata\" in writing the Odia \"Mahabharata\", he made numerous deviations and added to it copiously the stories of his own creation and various other matters known to him. In the final form Sarala Dasa's \"Mahabharata\" is a new creation analogous to \"Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa\" based on the Ramayana.\n\nMahabharata brought to light about the eighteen \"parvas\" like:\n\nThe \"Chandi Purana\" was based on the well-known story of Durga killing \"Mahishasura\" (the buffalo headed demon) given in Sanskrit literature but here also the Odia poet chose to deviate from the original at several points. His earliest work, \"Vilanka Ramayana\", was a story of the fight between Rama and Shahasrasira Ravana (thousand headed Ravana).\n\nThe verse of Sarala Dasa is simple, forceful and musical, without artificiality. Applying colloquial words for his poetical purpose, his writing was free from Sanskritisation. His work can be seen as adapting the popular oral conventions of earlier Odia folk songs which were used in folk dances such as the \"Ghoda-nacha\" (Horse Dance), \"Dandanacha\" and \"Sakhinacha\" (Puppet Dance). One metrical peculiarity of these songs is that both the lines of a verse do not contain an equal number of letters though the last letters of both the lines produce the same sound. All Sarala Dasa's wors were composed with this metrical peculiarity, and so the metre used by him can be regarded as a direct descendant of that used in the folk songs. By the fifteenth century the Odia language had assumed almost its modern form and had become ripe for literary compositions.\n\nThe predominant sentiment in Sarala Dasa's poem is not love but war. He was also motivated by a strong religious zeal to compose religious books in a language intelligible to all and to make them available to the general public in Odisha. He tells in no uncertain words that he composed his poems for the benefit of \"human beings\". There are several indications in his Mahabharata that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha and his association with the army brought to him a variety of experiences. The stories he heard the battle scenes which he witnessed, the places that he visited with the company of the army the historical incidents and names that he could know all remained stored up in his mind to be utilized in his writings.\n\n"}
{"id": "8310995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8310995", "title": "Shrinking cities", "text": "Shrinking cities\n\nShrinking cities or urban depopulation are dense cities that have experienced notable population loss. Emigration (migration from a place) is a common reason for city shrinkage. Since the infrastructure of such cities was built to support a larger population, its maintenance can become a serious concern. A related phenomenon is counter urbanization.\n\nThe phenomenon of shrinking cities generally refers to a metropolitan area that experiences significant population loss in a short period of time. The theory is also known as counterurbanization, metropolitan deconcentration, and metropolitan turnaround. It was popularized in reference to Eastern Europe post-socialism, when old industrial regions came under Western privatization and capitalism. Shrinking cities in the United States, on the other hand, has been forming since 2006 in dense urban centers while external suburban areas continue to grow. Suburbanization in tandem with deindustrialization, human migration, and the 2008 Great Recession all contribute to origins of shrinking cities in the U.S. Scholars estimate that one in six to one in four cities worldwide are shrinking in countries with expanding economies and those with deindustrialization. However, there are some issues with the concept of shrinking cities, as it seeks to group together areas that undergo depopulation for a variety of complex reasons. These may include an aging population, shifting industries, intentional shrinkage to improve quality of life, or a transitional phase, all of which require different responses and plans.\n\nThere are various theoretical explanations for the shrinking city phenomenon. Hollander et al. and Glazer cite railroads in port cities, the depreciation of national infrastructure (i.e., highways), and suburbanization as possible causes of de-urbanization. Pallagst also suggests that shrinkage is a response to deindustrialization, as jobs move from the city core to cheaper land on the periphery. This case has been observed in Detroit, where employment opportunities in the automobile industry were moved to the suburbs because of room for expansion and cheaper acreage. Bontje proposes three factors contributing to urban shrinkage, followed by one suggested by Hollander:\n\n\nThe shrinking of urban populations indicates a changing of economic and planning conditions of a city. Cities begin to 'shrink' from economic decline, usually resulting from war, debt, or lack of production and work force. Population decline affects a large number of communities, both communities that are far removed from and deep within large urban centers. These communities usually consist of native people and long-term residents, so the initial population is not large. The outflow of people is then detrimental to the production potential and quality of life in these regions, and a decline in employment and productivity ensues.\n\nShrinking cities experience dramatic social changes due to fertility decline, changes in life expectancy, population aging, and household structure. Another reason for this shift is job-driven migration. This causes different household demands, posing a challenge to the urban housing market and the development of new land or urban planning. A decline in population does not inspire confidence in a city, and often deteriorates municipal morale. Coupled with a weak economy, the city and its infrastructure begin to deteriorate from lack of upkeep from citizens.\n\nHistorically, shrinking cities have been a taboo topic in politics. Representatives ignored the problem and refused to deal with it, leading many to believe it was not a real problem. Today, urban shrinkage is an acknowledged issue, with many urban planning firms working together to strategize how to combat the implications that affect all dimensions of daily life.\n\nFormer Socialist regions in Europe and Central Asia have historically suffered the most from population decline and deindustrialization. East German cities, as well as former Yugoslavian and Soviet territories, were significantly affected by the weak economic situation they were left in after the fall of socialism. The reunification of European countries yielded both benefits and drawbacks. German cities like Leipzig and Dresden, for example, experienced a drastic population decline as many people emigrated to western cities like Berlin. Hamburg in particular experienced a population boom with record production yields in 1991, after the unification of Germany. Conversely, Leipzig and Dresden suffered from a failing economy and a neglected infrastructure. These cities were built to support a much larger population. However, both Dresden and Leipzig are now growing again, largely at the expense of smaller cities and rural areas. Shrinking cities in the United States face different issues, with much of the population migrating out of cities to other states for better economic opportunities and safer conditions. Advanced capitalist countries generally have a larger population, so this shift is not as dangerous as it is to post-socialist countries. The United States also has more firms willing to rehabilitate shrinking cities and invest in revitalization efforts. For example, after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco in 1989, the dynamics between the city and its residents provoked change and plans achieved visible improvements in the city. By contrast, cities in Germany have not gotten the same attention. Urban planning projects take a long time to be approved and established. As of now, Leipzig is taking steps toward making the city more nature-oriented and 'green' so that the population can be first stabilized, and then the country can focus on drawing the population back into the city.\n\nThe observable demographic out-migration and disinvestment of capital from many industrial cities across the globe following World War II prompted an academic investigation into the causes of shrinking cities or, urban decline. Serious issues of justice, racism, economic and health disparity, as well as inequitable power relations, are consequences of the shrinking cities phenomenon. The question is, what causes urban decline and why? While theories do vary, three main categories of influence are widely attributed to urban decline: deindustrialization, globalization, and suburbanization.\n\nOne theory of shrinking cities is deindustrialization or, the process of disinvestment from industrial urban centers. This theory of shrinking cities is mainly focused on post-World War II Europe. Following World War II, global economic power shifted from Western Europe to the United States. At this moment, manufacturing declined in Western Europe as it increased within the United States. The result was a shift away from Western European industrialization and a movement towards alternative industries. This economic shift is clearly seen through the United Kingdom's rise of a service sector economy. With a shift in industry, however, many jobs were lost or outsourced. The result was urban decline and the massive demographic movement from former industrial urban centers into suburban and rural locals.\n\nRapid privatization incentives encouraged under the United States sponsored post-World War II economic aid policies such as the Marshall Plan and Lend-Lease program, motivated free-market, capitalist approaches to governance across the Western European economic landscape. The result of these privatization schemes was a movement of capital into American manufacturing and financial markets and out of Western European industrial centers. American loans were also used as political currency contingent upon global investment schemes meant to stifle economic development within the Soviet-allied Eastern Bloc. With extensive debt tying capitalist Europe to the United States and financial blockades inhibiting full development of the communist Eastern half, this Cold War economic power structure greatly contributed to European urban decline.\n\nGreat Britain, widely considered the first nation to fully industrialize, is often used as a case study in support of the theory of deindustrialization and urban decline. Political economists often point to the Cold War era as the moment when a monumental shift in global economic power structures occurred. The former \"Great Empire\" of the United Kingdom was built from industry, trade and financial dominion. This control was, however, effectively lost to the United States under such programs as the Lend-Lease and Marshall Plan. As the global financial market moved from London to New York City, so too did the influence of capital and investment.\n\nWith the initial decades following World War II dedicated to rebuilding or, readjusting the economic, political and cultural role of Britain within the new world order, it wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that major concerns over urban decline emerged. With industry moving out of Western Europe and into the United States, rapid depopulation of cities and movement into rural areas occurred in Great Britain. Deindustrialization was advanced further under the Thatcherite privatization policies of the 1980s. Privatization of industry took away all remaining state protection of manufacturing. With industry now under private ownership, \"free-market\" incentives (along with a strong pound resulting from North Sea Oil) pushed further movement of manufacturing out of the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Tony Blair, the United Kingdom effectively tried to revamp depopulated and unemployed cities through the enlargement of service sector industry. This shift from manufacturing to services did not, however, reverse the trend of urban decline observed beginning in 1966, with the exception of London.\n\nLeipzig serves as an example of urban decline on the Eastern half of post-World War II Europe. Leipzig, an East German city under Soviet domain during the Cold War era, suffered to receive adequate government investment as well as market outlets for industrial goods. With the stagnation of demand for production, Leipzig began to deindustrialize as the investment in manufacturing stifled. This deindustrialization, demographers theorize, prompted populations to migrate from the city center and into the country and growing suburbs in order to find work elsewhere. Since the 2000s, Leipzig reindustrializes and turned back into a growing urban realm.\n\nAlthough most major research on deindustrialization focuses on post-World War II Europe, many theorists also turn to the case of Detroit, Michigan as further evidence of the correlation between deindustrialization and shrinking cities. Detroit, nicknamed Motor City because of its expansive automobile manufacturing sector, reached its population peak during the 1950s. As European and Japanese industry recovered from the destruction of World War II, the American automobile industry no longer had a monopoly advantage. With new global market competition, Detroit began to lose its unrivaled position as \"Motor City\". With this falling demand, investment shifted to other locations outside of Detroit. Deindustrialization followed as production rates began to drop.\n\nAs evident from the theory of deindustrialization, political economists and demographers both place huge importance on the global flows of capital and investment in relation to population stability. Many theorists point to the Bretton Woods Conference as setting the stage for a new globalized age of trade and investment. With the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in addition to the United States' economic aid programs (i.e., Marshall Plan and Lend-Lease), many academics highlight Bretton Woods as a turning point in world economic relations. Under a new academic stratification of developed and developing nations, trends in capital investment flows and urban population densities were theorized following post-World War II global financial reorganization.\n\nThe product life-cycle theory was originally developed by Raymond Vernon to help improve the theoretical understanding of modern patterns of international trade. In a widely cited study by Jurgen Friedrichs, \"A Theory of Urban Decline: Economy, Demography and Political Elites,\" Friedrichs aims to clarify and build upon the existing theory of product life-cycle in relation to urban decline. Accepting the premise of shrinking cities as result of economic decline and urban out-migration, Friedrichs discusses how and why this initial economic decline occurs. Through a dissection of the theory of product life-cycle and its suggestion of urban decline from disinvestment of outdated industry, Friedrichs attributes the root cause of shrinking cities as the lack of industrial diversification within specific urban areas. This lack of diversification, Friedrichs suggests, magnifies the political and economic power of the few major companies and weakens the workers' ability to insulate against disinvestment and subsequent deindustrialization of cities. Friedrichs suggests that lack of urban economic diversity prevents a thriving industrial center and disempowers workers. This, in turn, allows a few economic elites in old-industrial cities such as St. Louis, Missouri and Detroit in the United States, to reinvest in cheaper and less-regulated third world manufacturing sites. The result of this economic decline in old-industrial cities is the subsequent out-migration of unemployed populations.\n\nRecent studies have further built upon the product life-cycle theory of shrinking cities. Many of these studies, however, focus specifically on the effects of globalization on urban decline through a critique of neoliberalism. This contextualization is used to highlight globalization and the internationalization of production processes as a major driver causing both shrinking cities and destructive development policies. Many of these articles draw upon case studies looking at the economic relationship between the United States and China to clarify and support the main argument presented. The neoliberal critique of globalization argues that a major driver of shrinking cities in developed countries is through the outflow of capital into developing countries. This outflow, according to theorists, is caused by an inability for cities in richer nations to find a productive niche in the increasingly international economic system. In terms of disinvestment and manufacturer movement, the rise of China's manufacturing industry from United States outsourcing of cheap labor is often cited as the most applicable current example of the product life-cycle theory.\n\nThe migration of wealthier individuals and families from industrial city centers into surrounding suburban areas is an observable trend seen primarily within the United States during the mid to late 20th century. Specific theories for this flight vary across disciplines. The two prevalent cultural phenomenons of white flight and car culture are, however, consensus trends across academic disciplines.\n\nWhite flight generally refers to the movement of large percentages of Caucasian Americans out of racially mixed United States city centers and into largely homogenous suburban areas during the 20th century. The result of this migration, according to theorists studying shrinking cities, was the loss of money and infrastructure from urban centers. As the wealthier and more politically powerful populations fled from cities, so too did funding and government interest. The result, according to many academics, was the fundamental decline of urban health across United States cities beginning in the 20th century.\n\nThe product of white flight was a stratification of wealth with the poorest (and mostly minority) groups in the center of cities and the richest (and mostly white) outside the city in suburban locations. As suburbanization began to increase through to the late 20th century, urban health and infrastructure precipitously dropped. In other words, United States urban areas began to decline.\n\nMid-20th-century political policies greatly contributed to urban disinvestment and decline. Both the product and intent of these policies were highly racial oriented. Although discrimination and racial segregation already existed prior to the passage of the National Housing Act in 1934, the structural process of discrimination was federally established with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The result of the establishment of the FHA was redlining. Redlining refers to the demarcation of certain districts of poor, minority urban populations where government and private investment were discouraged. The decline of minority inner city neighborhoods was worsened under the FHA and its policies. Redlined districts could not improve or maintain a thriving population under conditions of withheld mortgage capital.\n\nIn combination with the racial drivers of white flight, the development of a uniquely American car culture also led to further development of suburbanization and later, urban sprawl. As car culture made driving \"cool\" and a key cultural aspect of \"American-ness,\" suburban locations proliferated in the imaginations of Americans as the ideal landscape to live during the 20th century. Urban decline, under these conditions, only worsened.\n\nThe more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl across American cities such as Phoenix and Los Angeles, were only made possible under the conditions of a car culture. The impact of this car culture and resulting urban sprawl is, according to academics, threefold. First, although urban sprawl in both shrinking and growing cities have many similar characteristics, sprawl in relation to declining cities may be more rapid with an increasing desire to move out of the poor, inner-city locations. Second, there are many similarities in the characteristics and features of suburban areas around growing and declining cities. Third, urban sprawl in declining cities can be contained by improving land use within inner city areas such as implementing micro-parks and implementing urban renewal projects. There are many similarities between urban sprawl in relation to both declining and growing cities. This, therefore, provides similar intervention strategies for controlling sprawl from a city planning point of view.\n\nDifferent interventions are adopted by different city governments to deal with the problem of city shrinkage based on their context and development. Governments of shrinking cities such as Detroit and Youngstown have used new approaches of adapting to populations well below their peak, rather than seeking economic incentives to boost populations to previous levels before shrinkage and embracing growth models.\n\nResearch from Europe proposes \"retirement migration\" as one strategy to deal with city shrinkage. The idea is that abandoned properties or vacant lots can be converted into green spaces for retiring seniors migrating from other places. As older individuals migrate into cities they can bring their knowledge and savings to the city for revitalization. Retiring seniors are often ignored by the communities if they are not actively participating in community activities. The green retirement city approach could also have benefits on social inclusion of seniors, such as urban gardening. The approach could also act as a \"catalyst in urban renewal for shrinking cities\". Accommodations, in the meanwhile, have to be provided including accessibility to community facilities and health care.\n\nEstablishing a green retirement city would be a good approach to avoid tragedies like the 1995 Chicago heat wave. During the heat wave, hundreds of deaths occurred in the city, particularly in the inner neighborhood of the city. Victims were predominantly poor, elderly, African American populations living in the heart of the city. Later research pointed out that these victims were socially isolated and had a lack of contact with friends and families. People who were already very ill in these isolated, inner neighborhoods were also affected and might have died sooner than otherwise. The high crime rate in the inner decaying city also accounted for the high rate of deaths as they were afraid to open their windows. Therefore, a green retirement city with sufficient community facilities and support would accommodate needs for elderly population isolated in the poor, inner city communities.\n\nThe idea of \"right-sizing\" is defined as \"stabilizing dysfunctional markets and distressed neighborhoods by more closely aligning a city's built environment with the needs of existing and foreseeable future populations by adjusting the amount of land available for development.\" Rather than revitalize the entire city, residents are relocated into concentrated or denser neighborhoods. Such reorganization encourages residents and businesses in more sparsely populated areas to move into more densely populated areas. Public amenities are emphasized for improvement in these denser neighborhoods. Abandoned buildings in these less populated areas are demolished and vacant lots are reserved for future green infrastructure.\n\nThe city of Detroit has adopted right-sizing approaches in its \"Detroit Work Project\" plan. Many neighborhoods are only 10–15% occupied. and the plan encourages people to concentrate in nine of the densest neighborhoods. Under the plan, the city performs several tasks including: prioritizing public safety, providing reliable transportation and demolition plans for vacant structures.\n\nAlthough the \"right-sizing\" approach may seem attractive to deal with vast vacant lots and abandoned houses with isolated residents, it can be problematic for people who are incapable of moving into these denser neighborhoods. In the case of Detroit, although residents in decaying neighborhoods are not forced to move into concentrated areas, if they live outside designated neighborhoods they may not get public services they require. This is because communities in shrinking cities often are low-income communities where they are racially segregated. Such segregation and exclusion may \"contribute to psychosocial stress level\" as well and further add burden to the quality of living environments in these communities.\n\nThe idea of \"smart shrinkage\", in some regards, is similar to dominant growth-based models that offer incentives encouraging investment to spur economic and population growth, and reverse shrinkage. However, rather than believing the city can return to previous population levels, the governments embrace shrinkage and accept having a significantly smaller population. With this model, governments emphasize diversifying their economy and prioritizing funds over relocating people and neighborhoods.\nYoungstown 2010 is an example of such an approach for the city of Youngstown, Ohio. The plan seeks to diversify the city's economy, \"which used to be almost entirely based on manufacturing\". Tax incentive programs like Youngstown Initiative have also \"assisted in bringing in and retaining investment throughout the city.\" These practices help attract and preserve investment throughout the city. Since the plan was introduced, many major investments have been made in the city. The downtown Youngstown has been also transformed from a high crime rate area into a vibrant destination.\n\nNevertheless, there are concerns that the smart shrinkage approach may worsen existing isolation of residents who cannot relocate to more vibrant neighborhoods. Environmental justice issues may surface from this approach if city governments ignore the types of industries planning investment and neighborhoods that are segregated.\n\nLand banks are often quasi-governmental counties or municipal authorities that manage the inventory of surplus vacant lands. They \"allow local jurisdictions to sell, demolish and rehabilitate large numbers of abandoned and tax-delinquent properties.\" Sometimes, the state works directly with local governments to allow abandoned properties to have easier and faster resale and to discourage speculative buying.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of land banks is the Genesee County Land Bank in the city of Flint, Michigan. As an industrial city with General Motors as the largest producer, declining car sales with the availability of cheap labor in other cities led to reduction in the labor force of the city. The main reason of the property or land abandonment problem in Flint was the state's tax foreclosure system. Abandoned properties were either transferred to private speculators or became state-owned property through foreclosure, which encouraged low-end reuse of tax-reverted land due to the length of time between abandonment and reuse.\n\nThe Land Bank provides a series of programs to revitalize shrinking cities. In the case of Flint, Brownfield Redevelopment for previous polluted lands is controlled by the land bank to allow financing of demolition, redevelopment projects and clean up through tax increment financing. A \"Greening\" strategy is also promoted by using abandonment as an opportunity for isolated communities to engage in maintenance and improvement of vacant lots. In the city, there is significant reduction in abandoned properties. Vacant lots are maintained by the banks or sold to adjacent land owners as well.\n\nEstablishment of land banks could increase land values and tax revenues for further innovation of the shrinking cities. Nevertheless, The process of acquiring foreclosures can be troublesome as \"it may require involvement on the part of several jurisdictions to obtain clear title,\" which is necessary for redevelopment. Economic problems that local residents have, including income disparities between local residents, cannot be solved by the land bank, with the addition of increasing rents and land values led by the revitalization of vacant land. Local leaders also lack the authority to interrupt works that Land Banks do. Environmental justice problems that are from previous polluting industry may not be fully addressed through shrinking city intervention and without opinions from local people. Therefore, a new approach of dealing with these vacant lots will be to work with non-profit local community groups to construct more green open spaces among the declining neighborhoods to reduce vacant lots and create strong community commitments.\n\nThere are several other miscellaneous interventions that some cities have used to deal with city shrinkage. One of the interventions would be the series of policies adopted in the city of Leipzig in East Germany. They include construction of town houses in urban areas and guardian houses with temporary rental-free leases. Temporary use of private property as public spaces is also encouraged. Another intervention would be the revitalization of vacant lots or abandoned properties for artistic development and artists interactions such as the Village of Arts and Humanities in North Philadelphia, where vacant lots and empty buildings are renovated with mosaics, gardens and murals.\n\nEconomic changes, the Automotive industry in the United States, societal shifts, and political restructuring each affected demographic change and shrinkage in Detroit. The city's demographic history plays a key role in the present situation of depopulation in Detroit, and how it has become an issue of economic inequality and environmental justice. These political, economic, and societal shifts are outlined below.\n\nThough it began as a small village in 1701, Detroit was not an incorporated city until 1815. By 1820 the city had around 1,400 inhabitants, which increased to 2,200 by 1830. By 1850 the city's population of predominantly immigrants had reached 21,000, and by 1860 had surpassed 45,600 total inhabitants. This is in part because Detroit was the final stop on the Underground Railroad, which diversified the city and brought many former African American slaves north, up until the American Civil War. Even though much of Detroit's African American community was free, racial tensions ran deep among white landowners, and free African Americans often had to deal with slave hunters. In the late 19th Century, roughly half of Detroit's population was foreign-born. Demographically, the city was home to numerous Austrians, Belgians, Canadians, Germans, English, Scottish, Polish, and Irish groups. Detroit's residents also lived in clearly defined ethnic and economic neighborhoods from the beginning, segregating English and non-English speakers from Jewish and Catholic, for example. In 1825, the Erie Canal and a network of highways, including the Chicago Road, also brought in additional settlers while the city developed. Throughout this time, Detroit was slowly becoming a commercial center in the Midwest. The market for manufactured goods slowly grew, as the construction of railroads connected industrial leaders to other prosperous counties in the state, allowing the population to grow further. By 1854, the railroad connected Detroit to New York City, permanently opening the city's commercial capacity. To support these opportunities, the city also modernized quickly, laying 242 miles of water pipe by 1883 to service the growing population, and contributing to suburbanization.\n\nIndustries native to Detroit, such as manufacturing cigars and kitchen ranges, were quickly overshadowed by the success of Detroit's automobile industry, which allowed the city to explode via population growth. Other cars had been built already in other cities, but Ford's concept of the moving assembly line \"put the world on wheels\". The materialization of the automobile industry put Detroit on the map as a global industrial center, allowing dozens of companies to emerge and offer jobs in the automobile industry. This had significant implications for population. In 1900, the US Census reported the city's population at 286,000, with over 115,000 of them working. By 1910, this number had grown to a total population of 466,000 with 215,000 working. During World War I, Detroit was a recipient of thousands of rural African Americans flowing into the city from the South, many of them taking jobs in burgeoning car factories. By 1920 over half of the population were immigrant generations, as Detroit was the nexus for many migrating populations.\n\nRoad engineers and industry workers flocked to Detroit with the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act). The creation of interstate highways and well-maintained roads made it easier to build homes away from the urban city center, increasing urban sprawl and suburbanization that would later characterize the region. Just as the highways allowed for suburban sprawl, they also allowed for segregation between suburbanites (typically white) and working class city-dwellers (immigrants and African Americans) as workers could not afford to move away from the city center. As population boomed, close living quarters instigated racially charged conflicts, through \"everyday expressions of white supremacy, and segregation\". As thousands of workers moved into the city, many lived near the factories to be close to work and fellow union members, creating concentrated neighborhoods of working class citizens. These neighborhoods were often class- and race-based, perpetuating social stigmas surrounding race and ethnic group. Much of this racial and class-based segregation continues today. Debates over the trade union of the automobile industry also sparked conflict, turning the working class against many wealthy industry owners and cementing the class system that would come to characterize the population. Ford's next conception of the automated assembly line changed city demographics, allowing unskilled labor to dominate the automobile industry and pushing skilled craftsmen out, usually further into the suburbs. The city developed at a rapid pace, with General Motors building offices adjacent to poor working class ghettoes, and developing the Detroit River to serve the needs of the auto industry.\n\nWith the Great Depression, consumers quickly lost faith in the economic boom in Detroit, which was augmented by the eventual market collapse in October 1929. The huge population of Detroit began to deplete as people lost their homes, savings, and jobs. Few cities were hit as hard by the Depression as Detroit, and by July 1930, a third of the automobile jobs were lost. The decline in job availability increased homelessness, unemployment, foreclosures, and out-migration from the city. As working and living conditions declined, particular groups were often targeted for evictions. One of the many examples of homelessness and shrinkage that plagued Detroit came in 1935, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt championed razing slum housing in Black Bottom, a low income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Detroit. More than 100 families were evicted with the promise of new public housing called the Brewster Homes. However, the housing program did not break ground for months, and was not fully replaced until the 1960s. In 1933, success was won by the working class through the enactment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union in car companies across Detroit. Unionization and the UAW's push for social welfare programs helped to build a solid middle class in spite of the Depression. Unions could negotiate wages and benefits packages, setting the stage for other working class communities across the nation.\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor shifted Detroit out of this first major economic slump. Along with other cities in the U.S., Detroit immediately became part of an all-out total war effort. Out-migration increased as men and women left to serve in World War II, while industry grew again in Detroit by using automobile factories to produce war items. Suddenly the problem was not unemployment, but housing shortages and overcrowding as men and women flooded into Detroit for work. Detroit's second wind and prolific growth attracted more immigrants and newcomers from everywhere. The city's physical growth was beginning to cause problems, and in 1927 the city limits were stretched to include 129 square miles. Housing was not built fast enough to accommodate the influx of new residents. Detroit's director-secretary of the Detroit Housing Commission claimed, \"There just isn't such a thing as a place to rent in Detroit\". Government services were too limited to keep up with the rapid growth. Those who could moved to the more affluent neighborhoods of Indian Village, North Woodward, and Grosse Point on the outskirts of the city. Political restructuring and the introduction of new housing commissioners allowed for more public housing to be built.\n\nAfter World War II, Detroit experienced another economic boom that was accompanied by increased social pressures. Automakers profited $1.1 billion between 1945 and 1950, a significant sum as the U.S. became a world superpower in the second half of the century. The ubiquity of cars and highways in Detroit encouraged further sprawl, and created segregated suburbs outside of the city limits. Martelle argues, \"While Detroit was the region's population base, the majority of the new housing was being built outside the city limits...which were also where the new factories were being built\". Detroit's automobile industry had inevitably driven immigration away from the congested city to cheaper land in the suburbs, taking much of the innovation with it. A degree of white flight was occurring, in which the white population moved to surrounding counties, leaving low income individuals (predominantly African American) in Detroit's city center.\n\nIn the 1950 mayoral elections, the city passed numerous policy decisions against urban infrastructure development, as Albert Cobo threatened to raze a slum to \"offer the land for sale to private individuals for redevelopment\". Cobo won the election, which had dramatic effects on public housing across the city. Cobo vetoed many of the proposed project plans, shifted the city's focus to \"urban renewal projects that would eradicate slums\", and replaced the Detroit Housing Commission with private developers. None of these plans included new housing for low income residents. In the 1950s, Mayor Cobo also refused federal funds that would have aided in public housing projects, further discriminating against low income communities. This decade concretized racial segregation and depopulation in Detroit. Housing remained segregated across the city, and more and more whites began to leave for the suburbs. The engineering of Interstate 94 in Michigan required many buildings in the city to be removed, including businesses and homes. The Big Three automobile manufacturers and other industries also implemented plans to build factories closer to consumer bases and reduce labor costs, causing a severe loss of employment opportunities within the city. In the 1970s, Detroit's economic base was exported overseas, with some 28% of equipment and plant investment done in foreign countries. Industry's move in away from Detroit \"set the course for Detroit's economic collapse\". As jobs were lost, economic inequality also increased, such that in 1959 the median income of a white family was $7,050, but for an African-American family was $4,370. In 1960, Detroit's population was around 1.5 million, 29% African-American and 70% white. In 2012, that number diminished to 701,475, with 82.7% African-American and 10.6% white residents\n\nDetroit's depopulation did not occur overnight, but slowly over a series of decades. Shrinkage is also not a new phenomenon, and is often the converse side of growth. However, shrinkage in Detroit today occurs in stark contrast to the accelerated expansion of other large cities in America. Jianping and Yasushi argue that an initial cause of depopulation can be due to out-migration, lower fertility rates, and changes in residential preferences or accessibility that lead to suburbanization. The decline of employment as auto makers moved to cheaper property also caused depopulation, as residents moved away from the city or even state to seek jobs.\n\nWhile issues such as out-migration and unemployment spurred shrinkage initially, many factors of shrinkage are ongoing and remain prevalent in Detroit. In the suburbs, increased residential development in \"undesirable\" land-use patterns occurs rapidly, such as land utilization for sprawl and the lack of high-rises. This threatens local ecosystems and land conservation and influencing further suburbanization. These suburbs are also indicative of racial segregation between suburb and city. In 2010 the city of Detroit's white population was only 10.61% of total residents, whereas African Americans made up 82.69% (see Demographic history of Detroit). This racial disparity implies a further cause to Detroit's shrinkage and the lack of opportunities for its remaining residents.\n\nAnother ongoing cause of shrinkage specific to Detroit is deindustrialization, primarily from Detroit's automobile industry moving to cheaper locations or overseas to Brazil and China. Other industries that supplied car parts to automakers also retreated, resulting in the loss of employment opportunities and financial crises for the entire city. With the Great Recession of 2008, the Big Three automakers – General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford Motor Company – were forced to apply for loans from the federal government in the Effects of the 2008–10 automotive industry crisis on the United States. The subsequent bankruptcy of the automobile industry in cities across Michigan lent themselves to dramatic unemployment and lack of financial investment in the Detroit, further contributing to depopulation. With white flight, waning industry left in Detroit, and a lack of social mobility for remaining residents, the effects of shrinkage were dire. From 2000 to 2004, Detroit lost 5.1% of its overall population, a dramatic decline in such a short period of time.\n\nBoth the initial and ongoing causes of shrinkage hold dramatic effects on the city and its remaining residents. Divisions between urban and suburban residences imply continued dramatic segregation that is self-perpetuating, resulting in a cycle where African American residents cannot afford to leave because property in the suburbs is too high. Simultaneously, because real estate in predominantly black neighborhoods often has a lower market value than white neighborhoods, white residents can sell their homes and leave for the suburbs, whereas home owners in black neighborhoods have a harder time selling their homes (see white flight). This depreciates African Americans' sense of socioeconomic status, as inner-city residents struggle to maintain their livelihoods without economic opportunities. Another issue that perpetuates this cycle is that many Detroit policy makers and municipal government workers refuse to see shrinkage as a problem, and avoid using the term altogether. Criticisms of the term run the gamut from shrinkage as a natural process, to using population decline as a money-making scheme through \"smart decline\". This is problematic because cities rely most heavily on their municipal governments, despite the cities' lack of political might in state legislatures. Changes to institutions, demographics, and the economy have made non-government coalitions less reliable, which is a large problem faced by shrinking cities today. Many politicians also do not see depopulation as an environmental justice issue, such that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not yet gotten involved in shrinkage issues in Detroit.\n\nIn inner city Detroit, problems also arise when fewer residents inhabit buildings that cannot be maintained. Instead, these once-beautiful buildings and centers of commerce are slowly falling into disrepair, a sign of inadequate revitalization efforts. Revitalization has stalled due to municipal politicians' framing of the problem as suburban growth, rather than city shrinkage. Building vacancy, demolition of condemned buildings, and underuse of infrastructure are rampant in Detroit, each the effect of decreased population. Lower population density in cities like Detroit can also lead to brownfield land and land wastage, two phenomena that occur after an industry abandons its facilities and leaves behind potential contaminants or pollutants. Jianping and Yasushi include these as two main effects of city shrinkage in large metropolises:\n\n\nIncreased suburbanization negatively impacts city residents due to lack of infrastructure and money devoted to the city. Other effects include loss of city services, loss of access to public goods due to a shrinking tax base, and loss of money flowing into the city to rebuild infrastructure. Each of these elements further affects the continued inequity between suburban and city residents, as well as the level of opportunity and quality of life available to each Detroit resident.\n\nThe causes and effects above lend insight into shrinkage as an environmental justice issue resulting from uneven development and investment disparities in urban planning. Economic development has been disproportionately skewed toward the suburbs instead of the city's core, in part because of political agency held by predominantly white suburbs. Many minority residents in the city's urban center lack the resources and political influence to achieve increased economic development. In cities like Detroit, there is no strong response to the deterioration of the city's core, primarily due to city planners' and politician's failure to prioritize the disadvantaged people and spaces. Policy makers are instead trying to limit urban sprawl and gentrify abandoned neighborhoods to make them more appealing to the predominantly white people that have moved away from the city. This has broader ripple effects in driving up rents and pushing original residents out of these neighborhoods. For example, the Detroit International Riverfront district near downtown has been historically used as a site for subsistence fishing, typically by resident African Americans. Redevelopment of this district in response to shrinkage through casinos, shopping, and expensive condos has led the city to restrict fishing on the riverfront, raising questions of environmental justice inequity. Traditional black communities that used this region for subsistence fishing are no longer able to do so, pushing them to seek other forms of subsistence in grocery stores or corner stores.\n\nAnother component of shrinkage in cities like Detroit is politicians who refuse to recognize and prioritize shrinkage as a problem, instead focusing on growth in other regions away from the city center. Funding is often redirected from the city center to the suburbs, encouraging further sprawl. This is due to a continued political thrust of Manifest Destiny, a concept that regional planners utilize in expanding suburban housing. According to this theory, if a city is not expanding, it is not considered successful. Without a plan to address shrinkage, it is likely that the surplus of vacant infrastructure and buildings would persist, along with housing problems. Some theorize that if left unchecked, this trend of vacancy would continue outside of city limits, affecting the suburbs as well. However, this perspective turns shrinkage into a sort of disease with its host as low income communities and communities of color, rather than addressing the social and racial segregation that catalyzes it. An attempted response to shrinkage and misallocated funding was made by the city through Detroit's Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP). The NSP was designed to address abandoned and condemned housing structures and received federal grant funding, but has not had much effect, failing to distribute funds evenly to historically poor neighborhoods. The NSP's distribution requirements include income status, but no data on race or gender, which are both important factors of shrinkage. The plan has had little effect on remediating vacancies and depopulation in the city's core.\n\nOther problems include the presence of brownfields near residential areas within the city. Historically, industries placed their facilities near working-class neighborhoods to ensure a broad labor base. However, as Detroit's automobile industry outsourced and moved outside the city limits, these decrepit and polluting facilities remained adjacent to low-income communities of color. The City of Detroit attempted to ameliorate these brownfields by creating the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, \"an authority providing incentives for the city to revitalize underdeveloped or under-utilized properties due to abandonment or environmental contamination\"(see also Planning and development in Detroit). The city outlined three tenets in facilitating the project: brownfield tables and templates, in-house meetings, and coordination with the community. Some of the clean-up programs include turning abandoned lots and buildings into spaces for performances and art, as well as new business, retail, and apartment buildings. Many of the future building projects are expected to bring thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars to the city, helping revitalize depressed areas and assist original residents. Programs created by the DBRA are intended to create up to 10,000 new housing units in neighborhoods near brownfields, as well as preserve \"greenfields\" from development. However, much criticism has been raised about the effectiveness of this organization in serving the interests of surrounding neighborhoods. The DBRA could also be using this brownfield program as a means to gentrify areas of the city to attract new residents instead of providing support for long-term residents.\n\nEarly efforts to mitigate shrinkage included the Detroit Vacant Land Survey of 1990. This included at attempt at de-densification, in which city residents and development were ushered into and concentrated into some neighborhoods while vacating others. In this model, residents would be moved into more densely populated areas that were already owned by the city. The Survey and resulting city planning were met by retaliation by residents, and failed. Hollander et al. suggest another model of de-densification includes dispersed vacancy, in which property owners are encouraged by the city to take title to surrounding vacant lots.\n\nToday, city planners offer little guidance on how to shrink a city, even when granted funding to help mitigate shrinkage. City planning policies are usually directed toward growth and new development, using tools such as comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision regulations, and urban growth boundaries. Since the beginning of the 2008 Great Recession, there have been some policies and financial investment in Detroit's infrastructure. The Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP) was proposed by the Planning and Development Department of the City of Detroit, and builds off of Congress' Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The NSP aimed to address the impacts of foreclosure in communities that were detrimentally affected by the economic crisis, and hopes to support market recovery and stabilize neighborhoods. However, this policy has been largely ineffective due to city government delays, poor infrastructural planning, and misallocation of funds.\n\nOther efforts to mitigate shrinkage include using occupied-housing-unit density as a metric \"to analyze changes in physical land use associated with population decline in urban neighborhoods\". This is a response to government proposed \"smart decline\", a method aimed at gentrification and consolidating abandoned neighborhoods rather than addressing root causes of shrinkage. Smart decline has been met with strong opposition in Detroit, especially when city planners were told by outside observers how to shrink \"gracefully\". Many smart decline plans are inherently top-down, assume a blank slate at project sites, and require an uninvolved and quiet public opinion. This concept's exclusion of community opinion is largely why it has been met by so much opposition. However, Hollander and Németh have proposed a version of smart decline that is founded instead on ethics, equity, and social justice, including town hall meetings, public hearings, and the merits of potential solutions.\n\nAnother attempt to remedy the shrinkage problem has been to capitalize on the population decline in Detroit's urban core for the benefit of remaining residents. Setting aside abandoned lots and green space for \"recreation, agriculture, green infrastructure, and other non-traditional land uses will benefit existing residents and attract future development, and enable shrinking cities to reinvent themselves as more productive, sustainable, and ecologically sound places\". While developing these lots into green space would benefit the community, many residents fear that it could result in increased development of high rises and office buildings, rather than community resources.\n\nThe future planning decisions for Detroit, as well as the future for environmental justice in relation to city planning and depopulation, are slowly improving. Much more research has been done on shrinking cities in the U.S., as well as in Detroit in particular. In order for more work to be done by the city government and non-government organizations, shrinkage must be seen as more than an issue of income, but an issue of race, gender, and household size. Problems of unemployment and racial discrimination exist as functions of environmental injustice, requiring policy makers to address inequality in funding distribution and housing availability for people of color. Organizations like Detroit Future City have begun work on carbon buffering, a \"best practices\" demolition program, and tree remediation.\n\nFrench colonists founded the city of New Orleans in 1718, traveling from Mobile, Alabama to the Mississippi River. Because the area was a major hub for the slave trade, there was an increase of African slaves from 300 to 1,000 between the years of 1726 to 1732. By 1800, the population of the city included Anglo-Americans, Creoles, and enslaved Africans that were intermixed. However, a large demographic shift took place as a result the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Driven by the 1791 slave insurgency of Saint Domingue and threat of war with England, the French sold 530,000,000 acres west of the Mississippi including New Orleans to the United States Government. After the purchase, over 10,000 refugees from Saint Domingue doubled the size of the city, changing the population to \"1/3 white, 1/3 free people of color and 1/3 African slaves\" by 1810. The city's population expanded even more and experienced shifts between 1830 and 1860 when the city's population grew three times as large, as a result of an influx of European immigrants whose population overtook the slave population. As a result of the end of the Civil War in 1865, the emancipated African American population in the city doubled to 50,000 by 1870. The subsequent Jim Crow laws segregated blacks to more low-lying and marginalized areas of the city, including black Creoles who previously resided in the French Quarter. However, by 1900 migration to New Orleans slowed, lowering it from the 5th to 12th largest among all American cities, placing it below the growth rate of Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee. This change took place largely because of New Orleans' reliance on agricultural exports that did not require urban laborers. This decline was somewhat lessened by the railway that passed through the city and connected to ocean freighters.\n\nBefore the 20th century, New Orleans' neighborhoods were of mixed race, but a combination of Jim Crow laws, racially segregated public housing, unequal educational opportunities, white flight, and unequal employment opportunities led to a racially segregated city. During this time, the city shifted from being tripartite to a biracial, meaning individuals were considered to be black or white. PhD Elizabeth Fussell explains how unequal opportunities based on race contributed to economic and geographic disparities in New Orleans over the years: explicitly unequal treatment of those racial groups has been reproduced through an interlocking system of unequal educational opportunities, residential segregation, and blacks were consistently far less likely than whites to complete secondary school, even to present. The effect of racial educational inequity during the \"human capital century\" has been to diminish the labor-market opportunities and life changes of the individuals that lag behind. Beginning in 1960, New Orleans began to see population loss, and just before Hurricane Katrina hit, New Orleans had almost twice as many people living below the poverty level than the national average and a 30% lower average income. The storm worsened population loss and changed the demographics of the city, resulting in an increased proportion of whites population and decreased proportion of black individuals in the years following.\n\nNew Orleans' population began declining in the 1960s. From 1970 to 2000, the population shrank by 18%, and the region's employment rate fell from 66% to 42%. This resulted partially from the decline of key economic enterprises in the area. New Orleans relied on tourism, a part, and oil, while elsewhere in the United States cities experienced technologically driven growth. The oil boom that had once economically supported the city collapsed in 1979 and 1980, leading to job loss and the proliferation of depopulation.\nMany other changes in the area incentivized suburbanization, or movement from the city area to surrounding suburbs, including the development of interstate 10 in 1955, the draining of backswamps that were formerly uninhabitable, and federal tax incentives. In terms of demographics, this caused movement of whites into exclusive suburban areas eventually resulting in a majority of Black residents in the urban core of New Orleans, but not in the broader metropolitan area that included suburbs. Furthermore, historic school integration and Hurricane Betsy drove many whites from New Orleans neighborhoods. Racially segregated public housing, racial discrimination from lenders and realtors contributed to the racialized emigration of New Orleans residens.\n\nCompounded with years of poor economic growth, the largest contributor to the worsening population decline of New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, which resulted in the flooding of over 80% of the city. The storm displaced 800,000 people, which is the greatest displacement in the United States since the Dust Bowl. In 2010, the population of New Orleans was only at 76% of what it was in 2005.\n\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans faced racial segregation and poverty levels above the national average. In 1960 it had the fifth highest level of poverty of all US cities, as well as some of the worst substandard housing. Poverty levels were at 24.5% in 2005, which were almost double the national level, and average income levels were at $30,711, which was about $16,000 less than the national average. Over the years, the city dealt with an aging infrastructure and gradual sinking of the city until portions were below sea level It was found that in inner city neighborhoods over 50% of children had levels of lead in their blood above federal guidelines.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century to 1980, New Orleans faced increasing residential segregation. Unemployment of blacks was as much as 10 times that of whites, and blacks paid a greater proportion of their income for housing than whites. In the 1970s, four times as many blacks had incomes placing them below the poverty level than whites, and by 1980 there was a belt along the undesirable backswamp of majority black residents. \nIn addition to facilitating the growth of suburbs and advancing depopulation, the creation of Interstate 10 displaced many historically black neighborhoods including Tulane/Gravier, Tremé/Lafitte and the 7th Ward. \nAs individuals with financial and social mobility moved to suburbs, the poor, who were disproportionately African American remained in low lying location within the city's core, making them especially susceptible to flood and storm damage. Although there are a variety of ways Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath affected groups differentially based on race and class, as journalist Eugene Robinson said, \"Environmental injustice began long before Hurricane Katrina ever hit, in the basic pattern of settlement in the city.\"\n\nHurricane Katrina and shrinkage of New Orleans had significant effects on various groups in the city. African Americans, renters, the elderly, and people with low income were disproportionately impacted by Hurricane Katrina compared to affluent and white residents. First, African Americans are less likely to have rental and homeowner's insurance and to have insurance with major companies as compared to whites, which is related to practices of racially based insurance redlining. Since people of color were more likely to rely on public transportation, the dependence of the evacuation on personal transportation impacted these individuals more than those with personal means to leave the area. Some academics highlight this disparity as an issue of climate injustice, which is the differential impact of climate change on certain groups, as scientists have shown that increases in activity of Atlantic hurricanes \"are believed to reflect, in large part, contemporaneous increases in tropical Atlantic warmth...[and] have attributed these increases to a natural climate cycle termed the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), while other studies suggest that climate change may instead be playing the dominant role.\"\n\nThe number of homeless people in the city was at double the pre-Katrina rate by 2008, and African Americans faced discrimination in housing transactions, finding inferior treatment based on race. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave some evacuees from Katrina and Rita trailers that were contaminated with formaldehyde, a mistake that took over two years to fix. The National Fair Housing alliance showed in a report that information about units was withheld from or differentially given to African Americans compared to whites, and pointed out examples of racist practices of landlords and online advertisements.\nEven after federal and state governments spent $4 billion on revitalization efforts to repair levees, black New Orleans is disproportionately endangered by future flooding. In the first four months after the storm, the city's white population rose while the black population declined. As of 2006, evacuees that were African American were 5 times more likely to be unemployed when compared to evacuees that were white.\nOf additional concern are the effects on children, who face four times the risk of having serious symptoms of emotional disturbance than comparable children. Moreover, while many parents feel that their children need professional help, the majority of them did not get it or have access to it. As of 2007, only 40% of school children had returned to public school.\n\nThese disparities bring up issues with environmental racism as well as environmental justice as a whole, which is \"defined in terms of the distribution (or maldistribution) of environmental goods and bads.\"\n\nThere is little evidence that New Orleans was planned and developed with a specific focus on shrinkage as a phenomenon. This is problematic, because even though the metropolitan area as a whole was growing, there was simultaneously an increase in suburbanization. Many long-time residents and their needs were left out of planning decisions due to race and socioeconomic status.\n\nPlanning for shrinkage as a result of Hurricane Katrina focuses most of its attention on reconstructing the city after the damage of the storm. There are a variety of methods proposed by academics, communities and governing bodies to develop New Orleans in the aftermath of shrinkage as well as Hurricane Katrina. A large part of the dominant planning narrative seeks to make New Orleans \"bigger and better\" while still decreasing the overall size of the city. Through the creation of various commissions, many ideas have been proposed and have incited controversy. Many planners agree that part of the effort to revitalize the area must not render the residents vulnerable to the effects of another similar hurricane. In the wake of Katrina, much planning focused on rapid reconstruction of some areas, with proposals for temporary prohibition were rejected by most residents. There are four main planning efforts in response to Hurricane Katrina's damage.\n\nThe Bring New Orleans Back Commission (BNOB), created by Mayor Ray Nagin in January 2006, consisted of \"professional planners and designers\" including the Urban Land Institute (ULI). Some of the BNOB policies included shrinking the city's footprint and conversion of some neighborhoods to parks and wetlands through buyouts from the government. This fueled an outcry from the public, who resisted the idea of being prevented from returning to their homes. This was especially true for African American residents, because \"they were much more likely than whites to live in flood prone areas.\" \n\nIn November 2006, the New Orleans Neighborhood Rebuilding Plan was approved by city council. It differed from BNOB as it mainly drew from the community and \"was based on the assumption that all areas of the city would be rebuilt,\" and planned to recover every neighborhood. One of their proposals was a \"lot next door\" policy, in which property owners were given first priority in purchasing adjacent homes.\n\nFunded mainly by philanthropy from the Rockefeller foundation and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, the Unified New Orleans Plan was developed in 5 months. According to America Speaks, the process had \"unprecedented levels of citizen engagement... established credibility... built a constituency committed to work... [and] helped restore hope.\" \n\nBeginning in January 2007, the Office of Recovery Management was funded by the city and by foundations. It was created to develop a strategy for recovery. It was headed by Edward Blakely, who promoted strategies such as \"trigger projects\" in 17 target areas to drive development, and the creation of target areas determined to be renew, redevelop or rebuild zones. As of 2007, the project was encountering problems with allocating funds assured by the Louisiana Recovery Authority and FEMA.\n\nLeipzig was on its way to becoming a metropolis that attracted people from all over Europe due to its centralized location. It was one of the major European centers of learning and culture in music and publishing. After World War II, it became the major urban and trade center within East Germany. Because Leipzig played a large role in the decline of Communism in East Germany, the city itself also suffered economic drawbacks and declines resulting in a change in landscape, infrastructure and geography. Today, Leipzig is considered a 'shrinking city' because of its rapid population decline and infrastructure devastation. While Leipzig is one of the most livable cities in East Germany and is a prominent cultural center, it is still suffering the repercussions of the last World War, economically, politically and socially.\n\nAfter World War II, the local economy in Leipzig was deflated and the regional economy desperately needed to be revitalized. The fall of socialist East Germany led to a mass emigration to other areas of the country. The housing vacancy had risen to 20%, and renovations in the older neighborhoods were needed. The post socialist conditions are partly to blame for the state in which many east German cities find themselves in. Because east Germany was a socialist country merging with a west-European capitalist country, it has a unique situation. Lingering socialist ideals competed with very democratic western philosophy, causing issues for old and new generations. Integrating east Germany into West Germany has been problematic because of regional variations due to differences in economic performance in the recent years. The whole area suffers from problems like joblessness, population loss, and a lack of renovation. In the case of Leipzig specifically, a dramatic loss of manufacturing jobs and mass out-migration has accelerated the shrinking process. Loss of stock in commercial real estate and housing stock produced a problematic picture to the whole of Germany and Europe in general. The transition from 40 years of socialist rule to a democratic-capitalist economy was not as smooth as expected. The loss of economic and socio-cultural importance did not fare well for Leipzig, or Germany as a whole. Becoming apart of the German Democratic Republic lead to the loss of several national functions of the former unitary state.\n\nIn 1949, when Leipzig was a part of the German Democratic Republic, the city underwent many infrastructure changes. National and regional industries, like banks and the publishing media, left Leipzig for the capitalist western Germany. The German Democratic Republic prioritized pre-war traditions rather than investing in innovations; the city of Leipzig was to become the industrial center with large-scale mining, which caused pollution in the air and the national and cultural landscape of the city was drastically changed. Villages were torn down to make room for the new machinery and coalfields. This caused inhabitants to leave the area, and at the end of GDR era in 1989, the population shrunk down to 530,000. Some neighborhoods were neglected because of their past-socialist nature. These infrastructures then began to disintegrate and there were no initiatives established to upkeep them. Nobody wanted to be reminded of communist times. 75% of the local industry was closed down within the years after the reunification of Germany. Small companies took over parts of the state, but it was not noticeable due to the large outflux of industry years earlier. There was huge environmental damage and social costs. The city had turned into a coal producing state, but the energy value of coal was poor, so continuation of coal mining was not economical. The city was destroyed by landscape devastation and air pollution, and the industry was not thriving and would not be continuing in the area. The physical infrastructure of roads, buildings and public transportation was designed for much larger population than is present, they are too large to represent the current population. The population is now stagnant.\n\nUrbanization is a cyclical process and urban and regional decline will make way for new growth. The Fordist model of industrialization was employed, which was characterized by mass standardized production and mass employment in large complexes. This mass production technology created increases in output due to specialization of jobs based on individual workers' skills and top-down management. While the output was unprecedented, this put added pressure on wages causing stagnation. There was an unbalanced relationship between consumption and production in that there was not enough payoff for the working class to incentivize working hard. \nSuburbanization is the growth of areas on the fringes of cities. It is one of the many causes of the increase in urban sprawl.\nHuman capital, creativity and competitiveness are key to successfully industrializing the city. Neglected areas of the city were ignored because of their connection to former socialist memories. Instead of renovating, large city centers were built away from the center of the city. These large buildings fell victim to the effects of neglect like decay. Large construction and renovation projects were meant to strengthen the optimistic view on the future of Germany. Suburban housing projects were constructed around the city so the houses could be offered to those who left the city earlier. The goal was to offer housing opportunities so that the population would come back and the regional population would not decline too drastically.\n\nThere was a policy of 'restitution before financial compensation' which had an adverse effect on inner city renovation projects. This was an accelerated out-migration to the suburbs and countryside which resulted in many empty houses in the city despite their perfect state of condition after renovation. Stimulating suburbanization increased the already too large housing stock in the region and failed to mitigate the inner city vacancy problems. The city would do best if the development policy was aimed at modest economic growth and employment was created to stabilize the urban population and prevent a new exodus to the west.\n\nAfter the fall of East Germany, the population of the German Democratic Republic suffered a decline. After the Second World War, there was an out-migration of 3.8 million people from East Germany to West Germany. This was so drastic that East Germany would eventually cease to exist. The rest of Germany felt the only option was to cut off ties completely with Eastern Germany. However, the shift from communist to capitalist gave new employment opportunities in retail, transportation and communication, but this only accounted for a small amount of the economy that was lost. There were not enough people living in the city to make use of these opportunities. Unemployment was not too high at 20%, but still higher than other cities in West Germany and other EU countries. The working-class neighborhoods fell victim to the large-scale vacancy.\n\nThe new policies are shifting their focus toward stabilizing the current population and adjusting the housing stock to the population size. The city has developed a strategy to adapt housing stock and infrastructure according to a 'shrinking city' model. There will be demolition of housing that were neglected or there is too little demand for living. These neglected areas are then replaced with parks or squares. The goal is to turn the area into a more attractive and greener, nature-oriented environment (See also gentrification). This in turn encourages a more spacious livelihood and leads to a higher quality of life, which could potentially attract urban dwellers to these remodeled neighborhoods, as well as land developers.\n\nStimulating owner-occupancy is another important strategy that strengthens the ties between the city and its inhabitants. There is a lack of clients and purchasing power for retailers, which causes problems especially for working-class neighborhoods. There is a public hearing that is held to brainstorm strategies for solving this problem, like focusing exclusively on physical solutions like improvements of housing stock and public space. Long-term monitoring of sustainable urban open space development at the city district level will also be helpful in the long run. Concrete socio-economic evidence of the benefits that green spaces bring to shrinking cities would be a valuable contribution to the rehabilitation of a shrinking city like Leipzig.\n\nA coherent urban development strategy is hard to find because there are many policy plans, each dealing with different parts of the problem. The government is not to blame completely for the state Leipzig is in as there are many facets of the shrinking city problem that need to be addressed. The government has not failed to find the right solutions, or been too optimistic in their judgements. Leipzig has a bad reputation in other parts of West Germany, which is where most investors come from. Leipzig can claim that they have branches of large office of West German companies like BMW and Porsche, but this does not result in enough jobs or opportunities to push the unemployment rate back to an acceptable level. The politicians and investors should not see the shrinking of the city as negative or a problem that cannot be solved; but that it offers things that other cities do not have like space for innovation, creative subcultures, cheap start-up rents, and an increase of green space for making the city more attractive. The attempt to get the 2012 Olympics to take place in Leipzig brought renewed recognition for the discussion of more building projects. For now, the city needs to focus on stabilizing the current population and lowering the unemployment rate by increasing opportunities within the city.\n\nA rapidly contracting population is often viewed holistically, as a citywide and sometimes even regional struggle. However, shrinking cities, by their nature and how local officials respond to the phenomena, can have a disproportionate social and environmental impact on the less fortunate, resulting in the emergence of issues relating to environmental injustices. This paradigm was established almost immediately after cities started shrinking in significance during the mid-20th century and persists today in varying forms.\n\nAlthough the concept of environmental justice and the movement it sparked was formally introduced and popularized starting in the late 1980s, its historical precedent in the context of shrinking cities is rooted in mid-20th century trends that took place in the United States.\n\nIn an American context, historical suburbanization and subsequent ill-fated urban renewal efforts are largely why the very poor and people of color are concentrated in otherwise emptied cities, where they are adversely plagued by conditions which are today identified as environmental injustices or environmental racism. These conditions, although created and exacerbated through mid-20th century actions, still persist today in many cases and include: living in close proximity to freeways; living without convenient access, if any, to healthy foods and green space. Unlike white people, people of color were socially and legally barred from taking advantage of federal government policy encouraging suburban flight. For example, the early construction of freeways coupled with practices such as redlining and racially restrictive covenants, physically prevented people of color from participating in the mass migration to the suburbs, leaving them in – what would become – hollowed and blighted city cores. Because income and race are deeply embedded in understanding the formation of suburbs and shrinking cities, any interventions responding to the shrinking city phenomenon will almost invariably confront issues of social and environmental justice. It is not the case in Europe, where suburbanization has been less extreme, and drivers of shrinking cities are also more closely linked to aging demographics, and deindustrialization.\n\nIn addition to discriminatory policy-driven decisions of the past, which caused cities to contract in population and created inhospitable living conditions for the poor and people of color in urban cores, environmental justices concerns also arise in present initiatives that seek solutions for cities struggling with considerable population losses.\n\nNew Orleans, like many major American cities, saw its population decrease considerably over the latter half of the 20th century, losing almost 50% of the population from its peak in 1960. In large part because of white flight and suburbanization, the population loss perpetuated existing racial segregation and left people of color (mostly African Americans) in the city center. By 2000, vacant and abandoned properties made up 12% of the housing stock. The city was struggling economically and in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, 134,344 of 188,251 occupied housing units sustained reportable damage, and 105,155 of them were severely damaged. Because of historical settlement patterns formed by racial restrictions in the first half of the 20th century, African Americans were disproportionately impacted by the destruction.\nResponding to Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin formed the Bring New Orleans Back Commission in September 2005. The goal of the commission was to assist in redevelopment decision-making for the city. The commission shared its proposal for redevelopment in January 2006, however it faced some criticism related to environmental justice concerns. The commission's proposal was presented prior to many residents having returned to the city and their homes. The process was not very inclusive, particularly with locals of impacted areas, who were predominantly from disadvantaged communities. While the proposal addressed future potential flooding by incorporating new parks in low-laying areas to manage storm water, the locations of the proposed greenspaces required the elimination of some of the low-income neighborhoods. Residents largely viewed the proposal as forced displacement and as benefitting primarily more affluent residents. The proposal was roundly rejected by residents and advocates for residents.\n\nA later intervention to alleviate the mounting abandonment and blight (which existed prior to Katrina but was exacerbated by the disaster) was Ordinance No. 22605, enacted by the New Orleans city council in 2007. The rationale for the ordinance was to allow the city to establish a \"Lot Next Door\" program, which seeks to \"assist in the elimination of abandoned or blighted properties; to spur neighborhood reinvestment, enhance stability in the rental housing market, and maintain and build wealth within neighborhoods.\" The program intended to give owner occupants the opportunity to purchase abutting properties (city acquired properties formerly state-owned or owned by the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority) as a means of returning properties to neighborhood residents. It later expanded to allow any individual to purchase a property if that person or a family member would live there. The impact of the program, however, was unevenly distributed throughout the city. Although black neighborhoods in the low-laying topographical regions were hit the hardest by Katrina, affluent neighborhoods with high rates of owner occupancy better absorbed vacant and abandoned properties than areas with more rental units.\n\nPerhaps the city most commonly associated with the concept of shrinking cities, Detroit too has grappled with issues of environmental justice. Detroit's current circumstances, as it struggles to deal with a population less than half of that from its peak in 1950, are partially the direct result of the same racist process, which left only the poor and people of color in urban city centers. The city presently faces economic strain since only six percent of the taxable value of real estate in the tri-county Detroit area is in the city of Detroit itself while the remaining ninety-four percent is in the suburbs. In recent years, the city has made attempts, out of necessity, to address both its economic and population decline.\nIn 2010, Detroit mayor David Bing introduced a plan to demolish approximately 10,000 of an estimated 33,000 vacant homes in the city because they were \"vacant, open, and dangerous\". The decision was driven by the reality that for financial constraints, the city's existing resources simply could not maintain providing services to all areas. However, the decision also reflected a desire to \"right-size\" Detroit by relocating residents from dilapidated neighborhoods to \"healthy\" ones. The idea of right-sizing and repurposing Detroit, however, is a contentious issue. Some locals are determined to stay put in their homes while others compare the efforts to past segregation and forced relocation. Mayor Bing clarified that people would not be forced to move, but residents in certain parts of the city \"need to understand they're not going to get the kind of services they require.\"\n\nIn addition to right-sizing Detroit as a means to deal with a massively decreased city population and economic shortfall, Mayor Bing also undertook budget cuts. \nAlthough often necessary and painful, certain cuts, such as those to the city's bus services can produce harms in an environmental justice framework. In Detroit, despite the city's massive size and sprawl, roughly 26% of households have no automobile access, compared to 9.2% nationally. From an environmental justice perspective this is significant because a lack of automobile access, coupled with poor transit and historic decentralization, perpetuates what is often referred to as a spatial mismatch. While wealth and jobs are on the outskirts of the metropolitan region, disadvantaged communities are concentrated in the inner-city, physically far from employment without a means of getting there. Indeed, almost 62% of workers are employed outside the city limit, and many depend on public transit. Some contend that for Detroit this situation should more specifically be termed a \"modal mismatch\" because the poor of the inner-city are disadvantaged because they lack automobile access in a region designed for automobiles.\n\nRegardless of name, the situation is little different and still embedded in historic racial and environmental injustices; the poor are clustered in an inner-city from past policies, which were often racially discriminatory, and cuts to public transportation reduce job accessibility for the many households in Detroit that lack automobile access.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58987623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58987623", "title": "Story Factory", "text": "Story Factory\n\nThe Story Factory is a not-for-profit organisation designed to help indigenous and disadvantaged children aged between 7 and 17 years develop their writing and storytelling skills. The programs run by the Story Factory aim to help young people, particularly those most at risk of losing confidence and then losing interest in schooling. The Story Factory conducts programs at it two creative writing centres, as short and long term residencies at primary and secondary schools, and as one off visits.\n\nThe Story Factory began in 2012 as the Sydney Story Factory in Redfern, in inner city Sydney. The organisation changed its name to The Story Factory at the opening of their second site in Paramatta to the west of Sydney in October 2018. \n\n<br>\n\nIn 2010 the co-founders of the Story Factory, Catherine Keenan and Tim Dick, heard Dave Eggers give a TED talk about 826 Valencia and were inspired to set up something similar in Sydney. They flew to San Francisco and visited 826 Valencia to learn as much as they could about its model. Unlike 826 Valencia, The Story Factory does not provide homework help, but focuses on Creative writing. \n\nAs a not-for-profit organisation that relies on volunteers and donations for support it took approximately 18 months to get the first site of The Story Factory operational. The initial volunteers meeting drew a crowd of 200 people.\n\nSince it opened in 2012 approximately 16,000 students have participated in the programs. In 2018 they had 1050 active volunteer writing tutors and see approximately 800 children per week.\n\nThe Story Factory focuses on creative writing rather than the homework help provided in the original 826 Valencia program. This philosophy is based on discussion with local teachers who said that there is much less space for creativity in the Australian curriculum now.\n\nThe University of Sydney conducted an evaluation of the student involvement in the Story Factory from 2014 to 2016. The study was looking at the development of writing skills, self-confidence, engagement in learning and enthusiasm for creative writing. The study used case study methodology and also pre- and post-program surveys. A total of 88 students were surveyed and from these 10 were the subject of detailed case studies. The evaluation showed that students felt positive about the program and believed it helped with school work. It showed the students gained empowerment and grew in self-knowledge and self-awareness. Students who participated in several workshops grew their creative writing skills often to a higher level than would be expected of their grade or stage.\n\nAn evaluation of the in-schools residency programs run by the factory found a \"notable shift in writing confidence and enjoyment\" in all five schools involved and this was particularly strong among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants. \n\nFormer board member of The Story Factory, Professor Robyn Ewing, believes that \"education is possibly the most critical factor in alleviating disadvantage, and the Story Factory strives to change the lives of young people, especially those from marginalised backgrounds, through creative writing and storytelling.\"\n\nThe Story Factory is supported by a variety of people. This includes 3 former Australian Prime Ministers: Julia Gillard and Tony Abbot who appeared is a video for the Story Factory in 2011 and Malcolm Turnbull through the Turnbull Foundation. It has also conducted four art auctions in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017 The auctions have received donations from six Archibald Prize winners: Kathryn Del Barton, Fiona Lowry, Nigel Milsom, Mitch Cairns, Euan Macleod and Wendy Sharpe. n 2017 the auction also included 2016 Archilbald Prize finalist, Abdul Abdullah, and another 45 artists.\n\nThe Story Factory, opened first in 2012 in Redfern. The Story Factory is accessed through the Martian Embassy. The idea is a spinoff from 826 Valencia that has a Pirate Supply Shop as its front. Keenan stated that the kids and the volunteers loved the design and the staff liked the idea of going to another world. The Martian Embassy is the retail arm of the Story Factory and sells Martian growing kits, alien bacteria fighters and cans of gravity. The shop then opens into the creative space.\n\n<br>In 2016 more than 25% of the students attending the Redfern creative space were traveling from Western Sydney. Western Sydney has the largest indigenous population is the country and many new arrivals. With the assistance of a grants from the Commonwealth Government and other donations the Paramatta location opened in October 2018. The building at 88-92 George Street is heritage listed. Refurbishing to make it a suitable workshop space involved consideration of heritage requirements.<br><br><br>\nThe Story Factory runs year long residency programs with local schools, at both Primary and Secondary levels. The first residency program lasted for a full school term at the Briar Road Public School in Campbelltown. In 2017 Canterbury Boys High was given a 12 month Story Factory residency program. The program was recognised in the 2018 NSW Department of Education Minister’s and Secretary's Award for Excellence when Canterbury Boys High as awarded the 2018 Secretary’s Award for Outstanding School Initiative. \n\nIn 2016 The Story Factory initiated a pilot Novella Program and selected children aged between 12 and 16 to write a novella of between 20,000 and 30,000 words. The works were published by The Story Factory in December 2016. The program is continuing. The 2016 and 2017 novellas where published by the Story Factory and are on sale at its Redfern shop. One of the 2017 novellas, Coconut Children by Vivian Pham, has been expanded and published by Penguin Random House.\n\nCatherine Keenan is the Co-founder and Executive Director of the Sydney Story Factory. In 2016 she was recognised as Australian of The Year, Local Hero for her work with the Sydney Story Factory\n\nThe Story Factory has a Director and Storyteller-in-Chief at each location. Richard Short, Storyteller-in Chief at Redfern has been has led workshops for teachers to improve their understanding of the creative process and also to teach them the vocabulary used at The Story Factory. Bilal Hafda, Storyteller-in-Chief at Paramatta won a $10,000 grant when he became the Westfield Local Hero in 2018. \"The Story Factory will use its $10,000 Westfield Local Heroes grant to fund two eight-week creative writing programs for as many as 60 participants.

{"id": "84072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84072", "title": "Thai numerals", "text": "Thai numerals\n\nThai numerals (, , ) are a set of numerals traditionally used in Thailand, although the Arabic numerals are more common due to pervasive westernization of Thailand in the modern Rattanakosin Era. Thai numerals follow the Hindu-Arabic numeral system commonly used in the rest of the world. In Thai language, numerals often follow the modified noun and precede a measure word, although variations to this pattern occur.\n\nThe Thai language lacks grammatical number. A count is usually expressed in the form of an uninflected noun followed by a number and a classifier. \"Five teachers\" is expressed as \"teacher five person\" ( or with the numeral included .) \"person\" is a type of referent noun that is also used as the Thai part of speech called in English a linguistic classifier, or measure word. In Thai, counting is \"kannap\" (, lit. 'occasion of respect'); the classifier, \"laksananam\" ( from \"laksana\" characteristic, form, attribute, quality, pattern, style; and \"nam\" name, designation, appellation.) Variations to this pattern do occur, and there really is no hierarchy among Thai classifiers.\nA partial list of Thai words that also classify nouns can be found in Wiktionary category: Thai classifiers.\n\nThai sūn is written as oval 0 (number) when using Arabic numerals, but a small circle when using traditional numerals, and also means \"centre\" in other contexts. It is from Sanskrit \"śūnya\", as are the (context-driven) alternate names for numbers one to four given below; but not the counting 1 (number). \n\nThai names for \"N\" +1 and the regular digits 2 through 9 as shown in the table, below, resemble those in Chinese varieties (e.g., Cantonese and Min Nan) as spoken in Southern China, the homeland of the overseas chinese living in South East Asia . In fact, the etymology of Thai numerals 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is Middle Chinese, while the etymology of Thai numeral 5 is Old Chinese, as illustrated in the table below\n\nNumerical digit characters, however, are almost identical to Khmer numerals. Thai and Lao words for numerals are almost identical, however, the numerical digits vary somewhat in shape. Shown above is a comparison between three languages using Cantonese and Minnan characters and pronunciations. Shown below is a comparison between three languages using Khmer numerals. Thai and Lao. The Thai transliteration uses the Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS).\n\nSanskrit lakh designates the place value of a digit (\"tamnaeng khong tua lek\", ตําแหน่งของตัวเลข), which are named for the powers of ten: the unit's place is \"lak nuai\" (หลักหน่วย); ten's place, \"lak sip\" (หลักสิบ); hundred's place, \"lak roi\" (หลักร้อย), and so forth. The number one following any multiple of \"sip\" becomes \"et\" (Cantonese: 一, yat; Minnan: 一, it). The number ten (\"sip\") is the same as Minnan 十 (sip, lit.). Numbers from twenty to twenty nine begin with \"yi sip\" (Cantonese: 二十, yisap; Minnan: 二十, lit. jisip). Names of the \"lak sip\" for 30 to 90, and for the \"lak\" of 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 and million, are almost identical to those of the like Khmer numerals. \n\nFor the numbers twenty-one through twenty-nine, the part signifying twenty: \"yi sip\" (ยี่สิบ), may be colloquially shortened to \"yip\" (ยีบ, ยิบ). See the alternate numbers section below.\n\nThe hundreds are formed by combining \"roi\" with the tens and ones values. For example, two hundred and thirty-two is \"song roi sam sip song\". The words \"roi\", \"phan\", \"muen\", and \"saen\" should occur with a preceding numeral (\"nueng\" is optional), so two hundred ten, for example, is \"song roi sip\", and one hundred is either \"roi\" or \"nueng roi\". \"Nueng\" never precedes \"sip\", so \"song roi nueng sip\" is incorrect. Native speakers will sometimes use \"roi nueng\" (or \"phan nueng\", etc.) with different tones on \"nueng\" to distinguish one hundred from one hundred and one. However, such distinction is often not made, and ambiguity may follow. To resolve this problem, if the number 101 (or 1001, 10001, etc.) is intended, one should say \"roi et\" (or \"phan et\", \"muen et\", etc.).\n\nNumbers above a million are constructed by prefixing \"lan\" with a multiplier. For example, ten million is \"sip lan\", and a trillion (10, a long scale billion) is \"lan lan\".\n\nColloquially, decimal numbers are formed by saying \"chut\" (จุด, dot) where the decimal separator is located. For example, 1.01 is \"nueng chut sun nueng\" (หนึ่งจุดศูนย์หนึ่ง).\n\nFractional numbers are formed by placing \"nai\" (ใน, in, of) between the numerator and denominator or using \"[set] x suan y\" ([เศษ] x ส่วน y, x parts of the whole y) to clearly indicate. For example, is \"nueng nai sam\" (หนึ่งในสาม) or \"[set] nueng suan sam\" ([เศษ]หนึ่งส่วนสาม). The word \"set\" (เศษ) can be omitted.\n\nThe word \"khrueng\" (ครึ่ง) is used for \"half\". It precedes the measure word if used alone, but it follows the measure word when used with another number. For example, \"kradat khrueng phaen\" (กระดาษครึ่งแผ่น) means \"half sheet of paper\", but \"kradat nueng phaen khrueng\" (กระดาษหนึ่งแผ่นครึ่ง) means \"one and a half sheets of paper\".\n\nNegative numbers are formed by placing \"lop\" (ลบ, minus) in front of the number. For example, −11 is \"lop sip et\" (ลบสิบเอ็ด).\n\nOrdinal numbers are formed by placing \"thi\" (ที่, place) in front of the number. They are not considered a special class of numbers, since the numeral still follows a modified noun, which is \"thi\" in this case.\n\nAi () is used for \"first born (son)\" or for the first month, \"duean ai\" (เดือนอ้าย), of the Thai lunar calendar.\n\nEk () is from Pali \"ḗka\", \"one\" \"Ek\" is used for \"one\" (quantity); \"first\" (rank), more prominent than \"tho\" โท \"second\", in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks; and for the lead actor in a role. In antiquity, a seventh daughter was called \"luk ek\" (ลูกเอก), though a seventh son was \"luk chet\" (ลูกเจ็ด).\n\nEt (, Cantonese: 一, yat; Minnan: 一, it), meaning \"one\", is used as last member in a compound number (see the main numbers section above).\n\nTho () is from Pali \"dūā\", \"two\". \"Tho\" is used for \"two\" and for the \"second-level rank\" in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks.\n\nYi (, Cantonese: 二, yi; Minnan: 二, ji) is still used in several places in Thai language for the number two, apart from \"song\" (สอง): to construct twenty (two tens) and its combinations twenty-one through twenty-nine; to name the second month, \"duean yi\" (เดือนยี่), of the traditional Thai lunar calendar; and in the Thai northern dialect \"thin pha yip\" (ถิ่น–พายัพ), which refers to the Year of the Tiger.\n\nTri () and trai () are from Sanskrit \"trāyaḥ\", \"three\". These alternatives are used for \"three\"; \"third rank\" in tone marks, education degrees and military ranks; and as a prefix meaning \"three(fold)\".\n\nChattawa () is the Pali numeral four; used for the fourth tone mark and as a prefix meaning fourth in order or quadruple in number.\n\nLo () means a dozen or twelve. It is usually used for trade. It may also mean jar or bottle.\n\nYip () in colloquial Thai is an elision or contraction of \"yi sip\" (ยี่สิบ) at the beginning of numbers twenty-one through twenty-nine. Therefore, one may hear \"yip et\" (ยีบเอ็ด, ยิบเอ็ด), \"yip song\" (ยีบสอง, ยิบสอง), up to \"yip kao\" (ยีบเก้า, ยิบเก้า). \"Yip\" may have a long vowel (ยีบ) or be elided further into a short vowel (ยิบ).\n\nSao () is twenty in the Thai northern dialect and in the Isan language. \"Xao\" (ຊາວ) is the word for twenty in the Lao language.\n\nKurut () means a dozen dozen or 144. It is usually used for trade. It is a loanword from gross.\n\nKot () is ten million used in religious context. It comes from Pali/Sanskrit \"kōṭi\". See also crore.\n\nThe alternate set of numerals used to name tonal marks (ไม้, \"mai\"), educational degrees (ปริญญา, \"parinya\"), and military rankings derive from names of Sanskrit numerals.\n\n"}
{"id": "1548372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1548372", "title": "Visual literacy", "text": "Visual literacy\n\nVisual literacy is the ability to interpret, negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an image, extending the meaning of literacy, which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed text. Visual literacy is based on the idea that pictures can be \"read\" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.\n\nThe notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time. Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind. During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class. In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access. By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.\n\nThe term \"visual literacy\" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the International Visual Literacy Association. In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: \"Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences.\" A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as \"understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them\". However, because multiple disciplines such as visual literacy in education, art history and criticism, rhetoric, semiotics, philosophy, information design, and graphic design make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.\n\nSince technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the information age. Similar to linguistic literacy (meaning-making derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope. Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.\n\nMany scholars from the New London Group such as Courtney Cazden, James Gee, Gunther Kress, and Allan Luke advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy. Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.\n\nVisual literacy is not limited to modern mass media and new technologies. The graphic novel \"\" by Scott McCloud discusses the history of narrative in visual media. Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in Lascaux, France, are early forms of visual literacy. Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is prehistoric.\n\nVisual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights. The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).\n\nVisual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the Association of College & Research Libraries in 2011. They were \"developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors\".\n\nThere are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be \"What is going on in this photograph?\" and \"What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?\". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.\n\nFilm director Martin Scorsese emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37483", "title": "Womyn", "text": "Womyn\n\nThe word womyn is one of several alternative spellings of the English word \"women\" used by some feminists. There are other spellings, including womban (a reference to the womb) or womon (singular), and wimmin (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the suffix or , see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to a male norm.\n\nHistorically, \"womyn\" and other spelling variants were associated with regional dialects (e.g. Scots) and eye dialect (e.g. African American Vernacular English).\n\nOld English had a system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, similar to modern German. In Old English sources, the word \"man\" was neuter. One of its meanings was similar to the modern English usage of \"one\" as a gender-neutral indefinite pronoun (compare with \"mankind\" (\"man\" + \"kind\"), which means the human race). The words \"wer\" and \"wyf\" were used, when necessary, to specify a man or woman, respectively. Combining them into \"wer-man\" or \"wyf-man\" expressed the concept of \"any man\" or \"any woman\". Some feminist writers have suggested that this more symmetrical usage reflected more egalitarian notions of gender at the time.\n\nThe term \"wimmin\" was considered by George P. Krapp (1872–1934), an American scholar of English, to be eye dialect, the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard. The spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is dialectal, foreign, or uneducated. This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word. That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear. It suggests that a character \"would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one\" and \"is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well.\"\n\nThe word \"womyn\" appeared as an Older Scots spelling of \"woman\" in the Scots poetry of James Hogg. The word \"wimmin\" appeared in 19th-century renderings of Black American English, without any feminist significance.\n\nThe usage of \"womyn\" as a feminist spelling of \"women\" (with \"womon\" as the singular form) first appeared in print in 1976 referring to the first Michigan Womyn's Music Festival. This is just after the founding of the Mountain Moving Coffeehouse for Womyn and Children, a lesbian feminist social event centred around women's music. Both the annual \"MichFest\" and the weekly coffeehouse operated a womyn-born womyn policy. Womyn's land was another usage of the term, associated with separatist feminism.\n\nZ. Budapest promoted the use of word \"wimmin\" (singular \"womon\") in the 1970s as part of her Dianic Wicca movement, which claims that present-day patriarchy represents a fall from a matriarchal golden age.\n\nThese re-spellings existed alongside the use of herstory, a feminist re-examination and re-telling of history. Later, another wave of female-produced music was known as the riot grrrl movement.\n\nThe word \"womyn\" has been criticized by trans activists due to its usage in trans-exclusionary radical feminist circles which exclude trans women from identifying into the category of \"woman\" and consequently prevent them from accessing spaces and resources for women.\n\nMillie Tant, a fictional character in the British satirical comic \"Viz\", often used the term \"wimmin\" when discussing women's rights.\n\n\n"}
