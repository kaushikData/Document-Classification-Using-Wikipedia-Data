The project covers the period from 1995 to 2000 and was a project of The City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center's Women's Studies Program and Center for the Study of Women. The digitized collection is made up of women from a diverse cross-section of cultural and ethnic social service organizations including activists from Arab-American, Haitian, Hispanic, African American, and Asian American communities. It is held at the Mina Rees Library, CUNY Graduate Center.\n\nThe project began in 1995 under the aegis of the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center's Women's Studies Program and Center for the Study of Women and Society. Initially started as part of a graduate class \"Women, Community, and Public Voice,\" Women's Studies Director Joyce Gelb and Deputy Director Patricia Laurence curated a list of oral history subjects: New York City-based women who were leaders in their communities. The specific focus was on unheralded women from a diverse cross-section of the five boroughs of New York. Although the project was based in the Women's Studies Program, the subjects were not specifically working in organizations that specifically supporting women. The focus was on the women leaders themselves. The last interviews were completed in 1998.\n\nThe scope of the project included compiling a list of oral history projects as well as a now-defunct searchable database of oral history collections.\n\nGraduate students from different concentrations within CUNY Graduate Center completed weekly internships as part of their degree programs, working at the organization that was the focus of the oral history project. Through this process they identified and interviewed leaders in the organization in a fieldwork environment within the metropolitan area of New York City. After receiving training on conducting oral history interviews, the graduate students went into the field and interviewed their subjects.\n\nThe main focus of the interviews was on biographical experiences that shaped their community-based work, and on challenges, achievements, motivations, and methodologies used to effect changes within their communities. The project was categorized into a subject map.\n\nIn 2011, a finding aid was completed. In 2013, digitization of the 77 audio cassettes and 2,300 pages of interview transcripts was completed, with clips of some of the oral histories made available online in 2014. There were an additional 80+ press articles on subjects as well as various ephemera included in the collection. Under the guidance of the Chief Librarian, a Reference Librarian, and a Digital Services Librarian, two Special Collections Interns and a Special Collections Volunteer worked on the digitization team portion of the project.\n\nThe Activist Women's Voices oral history project was funded by the following organizations:\n\nThe project included 26 separate activists and 3 organizations, who each had individual interview subjects. The total number of interviews digitized was 35. The timeframe of the project was 1995-2000. Subject areas are listed below in parenthesis. The collection is unique in the diversity of subjects of the oral history interviews and the wide range of subjects covered.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Chuj is a member of the Q'anjob'alan branch along with the languages of Tojolab'al, Q'anjob'al, Akateko, Popti', and Mocho' which, together with the Ch'olan branch, Chuj forms the Western branch of the Mayan family. The Chujean branch emerged approximately 2,000 years ago. In Guatemala, Chuj speakers mainly reside in the municipalities of San Mateo Ixtatán, San Sebastián Coatán and Nentón in the Huehuetenango Department. Some communities in Barillas and Ixcán also speak Chuj. The two main dialects of Chuj are the San Mateo Ixtatán dialect and the San Sebastián Coatán dialect.\n\nThe Chuj language has been influenced by Spanish, and Chuj speakers have a tendency to borrow Spanish words or code-mix. It is estimated that 70% of the Chuj language is purely Chuj. There are language conservation and revitalization efforts taking place in San Mateo Ixtatán, through groups like the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala.\n\nThe letter 'h' is conventionally used in words with initial vowels to distinguish them from words that begin with a glottal stop.\n\nBelow is a template for the verbal stem in Chuj. Verbal predicates in Chuj appear with a status suffix: -a with transitive verbs and –i with intransitive verbs. Finite clauses inflect for Tense-Aspect, person, and number.\n\nNon-verbal predicates are non-verbal words like adjectives, nouns, positionals, or directionals that act as the main predicate and are semantically stative.

{"id": "10253024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10253024", "title": "Coulure", "text": "Coulure\n\nCoulure (pronounced coo-LYUR) is a viticultural hazard that is the result of metabolic reactions to weather conditions that causes a failure of grapes to develop after flowering. In English the word \"shatter\" is sometimes used. Coulure is triggered by periods of cold, cloudy, rainy weather or very high out-of-season temperatures. The condition is most often manifested in the spring. It also occurs in vines that have little sugar content in their tissue. Flowers stay closed and are not fertilized. Thus the vines are not pollinated as the grape fails to develop and falls off. Coulure can also cause irregular bunches of grapes which are less compact than normal. These bunches are more sensitive to developing various grape diseases. The yield of a vine with coulure will decrease substantially. Grape varieties with high proclivity to coulure are Grenache, Malbec, Merlot, and Muscat Ottonel. Other causes of coulure may be vineyard conditions and practices, pruning too early or too severely, excessively fertile soils or overuse of fertilizers, and improper selection of rootstocks or clones.\n\nDuring the flowering part of the growing season (May-June in the Northern Hemisphere, November-December in the Southern Hemisphere), grapevines often need dry conditions with sufficient sunlight and ambient air temperature around for pollination to go smoothly. Less ideal conditions, particularly wet, rainy weather, increases the odds that a higher than normal numbers of flowers go unpollinated and coulure to occur.\n\nCoulure is a distinct phenomena unrelated to another viticultural hazard, millerandage, where the flowers are pollinated but the resulting berries develop with seeds and remain small. Like coulure, millerandage is often caused by inclement weather during the flowering and fruit set period and cause reduced yields.\n\nCoulure is caused by a carbohydrate deficiency in the plant tissues that causes the vine to conserve resources that would otherwise be funneled into the developing grape berries. As carbohydrate levels drop, soon after flowering the stems connected to the berries shrivel as the small grapes (0.2 inches/5 millimeters in diameter) eventually fall off. \n\nTo some extent coulure and the dropping of fruit is a natural and healthy reaction of a vine that is self-regulating its resource and the amount of fruit that it produces. But when the situation is exacerbated by certain weather conditions and disruption to photosynthesis, coulure can have a more severe impact on yields that may negatively affect a region's grape supply and thus influence pricing.\n\nWhen the weather is the primary instigator of coulure, the French term this phenomenon \"coulure climatique\". This describes the cloudy and wet conditions that limit the amount of photosynthetic activity that takes place during the flowering cycle of a grapevine. Limited sunshine means lower sugar levels that can be converted into resources to develop grape berries. Warm temperatures can also exacerbate coulure in some grape varieties by promoting cellular respiration and excessive shoot growth that further competes with the berries for the resources derived from carbohydrates. Other contributing factors include excessively fertile vineyard soils, either naturally or enhanced by the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers, overly vigorous rootstock and severe pruning that too drastically limits the amount of leaf surface needed to sustain photosynthesis.\n\nCoulure is not 100% preventable but a vineyard manager can take several precautions to lessen the severity and impact of coulure. Some grape varieties are more prone to develop coulure than others, such as Grenache, Malbec, Merlot and Muscat Ottonel. A grower can choose to grow clones of those varieties, now commonly available for Merlot and Malbec, that have less susceptibility to developing coulure. In the vineyard, care can be taken to not prune so severely and insure that there is adequate leaf coverage for photosynthesis. Trimming the tips of developing shoots near the end of the flowering period can lessen the competition for sugar resources between berries and new shoot development. For non-organic viticulture, chemical growth inhibitors can be applied to the vine to limit shoot growth as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "602199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602199", "title": "Dardani", "text": "Dardani\n\nThe Dardani (; ; ), or Dardanians (Δαρδανίωνες) were an Indo-European tribe which settled in the region that took its name from them of Dardania, at the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone. Their identification as either an Illyrian or Thracian tribe is uncertain. They and their territory were by most writers not considered part of Illyria.\n\nThe ethnonym was spelled in Greek as \"Dardaneis\", \"Dardanioi\" and \"Dardanoi\", and in Latin as \"Dardani\". \n\nIn 1854 within the context of 19th century historical linguistics, Johann Georg von Hahn was the first to propose that the names \"Dardanoi\" and \"Dardania\" were derived from a proto-Albanian word, meaning \"pear tree\" (\"dardha\" in modern Albanian the definite form, \"dardhë\" indefinite form < PAlb *\"dardā\"), in view of the fact that toponyms related to fruits or animals are not unknown in the region (cf. Alb. \"dele\"/\"delmë\" \"sheep\" supposedly related to Dalmatia, Ulcinj in Montenegro < Alb. \"ujk\", \"ulk\" \"wolf\" etc.). Opinions differ whether the ultimate etymon of this word in Proto-Indo-European was *\"g'hord-\", or *\"dheregh-\".\n\nThe term used for their territory was \"Dardanike\" (), while other tribal areas had more unspecified terms, such as \"Autariaton khora\" (), for the \"land of Autariatae.\"\n\nIn Greek mythology, Dardanos (Δάρδανος), one of the sons of Illyrius (the others being Enchelus, Autarieus, Maedus, Taulas, and Perrhaebus) was the eponymous ancestor of the \"Dardanoi\" (Δάρδανοι). Some Roman ethnographers proposed a connection between Dardani of the Balkans and the Dardans of Troy, having a group of Dardan colonists settle in the Balkans and subsequently degenerate into a state of barbarism, but the Romans considered them to be Greeks as a whole, which contradicts modern scholarship.\n\nThe Dardani are first mentioned in the 4th century BC, when their king Bardylis succeeded in bringing various tribes into a single organization. Under his leadership the Dardani defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times. At this time they were strong enough to rule Macedonia through a puppet king in 392-391 BC. In 385-384 they allied with Dionysius I of Syracuse and defeated the Molossians, killing up to 15,000 of their soldiers and ruling their territory for a short period. Their continuous invasions forced Amyntas III of Macedon to pay them a tribute in 372 BC. They returned raiding the Molossians in 360. In 359 BC Bardylis won a decisive battle against Macedonian king Perdiccas III, whom he killed himself, while 4,000 Macedonian soldiers fell, and the cities of upper Macedonia were occupied. Following this disastrous defeat, king Philip II took control of the Macedonian throne in 358 and reaffirmed the treaty with the Dardani, marrying princess Audata, probably the daughter or niece of Bardylis. The time of this marriage is somewhat disputed while some historians maintain that the marriage happened after the defeat of Bardylis. This gave Philip II valuable time to gather his forces against those Dardani who were still under Bardylis, defeating them at the Erigon Valley by killing about 7,000 of them, eliminating the Dardani menace for some time.\n\nIn 334 BC, under the leadership of Cleitus, the son of Bardylis, the Dardani, in alliance with other Illyrian tribes attacked Macedonia held by Alexander the Great. The Dardani managed to capture some cities but were eventually defeated by Alexander's forces.\n\nCelts were present in Dardania in 279 BC. The Dardanian king offered to help the Macedonians with 20,000 soldiers against the Celts, but this was refused by Macedonian king Ptolemy Keraunos.\n\nDardani were a constant threat to the Macedonian kingdom. In 230 under Longarus they captured Bylazora from the Paionians and in 229 they again attacked Macedonia, defeating Demetrius II in an important battle. In this period their influence on the region grew and some other Illyrian tribes deserted Teuta, joining the Dardani under Longarus and forcing Teuta to call off her expedition forces in Epirus. When Philip V rose to the Macedonian throne, skirmishing with Dardani began in 220-219 BC and he managed to capture Bylazora from them in 217 BC. Skirmishes continued in 211 and in 209 when a force of Dardani under Aeropus, probably a pretender to the Macedonian throne, captured Lychnidus and looted Macedonia taking 20.000 prisoners and retreating before Philip's forces could reach them.\n\nIn 201 Bato of Dardania along with Pleuratus the Illyrian and Amynander king of Athamania, cooperated with Roman consul Sulpicius in his expedition against Philip V. Being always under the menace of Dardanian attacks on Macedonia, around 183 BC Philip V made an alliance with the Bastarnae and invited them to settle in Polog, the region of Dardania closest to Macedonia. A joint campaign of the Bastarnae and Macedonians against the Dardanians was organized, but Philip V died and his son Perseus of Macedon withdrew his forces from the campaign. The Bastarnae crossed the Danube in huge numbers and although they didn't meet the Macedonians, they continued the campaign. Some 30,000 Bastarnae under the command of Clondicus seem to have defeated the Dardani. In 179 BC, the Bastarnae conquered the Dardani, who later in 174 pushed them out, in a war which proved catastrophic, with a few years later, in 170 BC, the Macedonians defeating the Dardani. Macedonia and Illyria became Roman protectorates in 168 BC. The Scordisci, a tribe of Celtic origin, most likely subdued the Dardani in the mid-2nd century BC, after which there was no mention of the Dardani for a long time.\n\nMacedonia and Illyria became Roman protectorates in 168 BC.\n\nIn 97 BC the Dardani are mentioned again, defeated by the Macedonian Roman army. In 88 BC, the Dardani invaded the Roman province of Macedonia together with the Scordisci and the Maedi.\n\nAccording to Strabo's \"Geographica\" (compiled 20 BC–23 AD), they were divided into two sub-groups, the Galabri and the Thunaki.\nIt seems quite probable that the Dardani actually lost independence in 28 BC thus, the final occupation of Dardania by Rome has been connected with the beginnings of Augustus' rule in 6 AD, when they were finally conquered by Rome. Dardania was conquered by Gaius Scribonius Curio and the Latin language was soon adopted as the main language of the tribe as many other conquered and Romanized.\n\nAt first, Dardania was not a separate Roman province, but became a region in the province of Moesia Superior in 87 AD. Emperor Diocletian later (284) made Dardania into a separate province with its capital at Naissus (Niš). During the Byzantine administration (in the 6th century), there was a Byzantine province of Dardania that included cities of Ulpiana, Scupi, Stobi, Justiniana Prima, and others.\n\nThe Illyrian language disappeared, with almost nothing of it surviving, except for names. The Illyrian tribes in antiquity were subject to varying degrees of Celticization, Hellenization, Romanization Byzantinization, and finally Slavicisation.\n\nIt is assumed that the Dardanian kingdom was made up of many tribes and tribal groups, confirmed by Strabo. The first and most prominent king of the Dardani was Bardylis who ruled from 385 BC to 358 BC. Bardylis' descendance (and inheritance) is unclear; Hammond believed that Bardylis II was the son of Bardylis, earlier having believed it to have been Cleitus (as per Arrian), while Wilkes believed Cleitus to be the son. Tribal chiefs Longarus and his son Bato took part in the wars against Romans and Macedonians. The Dardanians, in all their history, always had separate domains from the rest of the Illyrians.\n\nThe term used for their territory was (), while other tribal areas had more unspecified terms, such as \"Autariaton khora\" (), for the \"land of Autariatae.\" Other than that, little to no data exists on the territory of the Dardani prior to Roman conquest, especially on its southern extent.\n\nAccording to Ancient Greek and Roman historiography, the tribe was viewed of as \"extremely barbaric\". Claudius Aelianus and other writers wrote that they bathed only three times in their lives. At birth, when they were wed and after they died. Strabo refers to them as wild and dwelling in dirty caves under dung-hills. This however may have had to do not with cleanliness, as bathing had to do with monetary status from the viewpoint of the Greeks. At the same time, Strabo writes that they had some interest in music as they owned and used flutes and corded instruments.\n\nDardanian slaves or freedmen at the time of the Roman conquest were clearly of Paleo-Balkan origin, according to their personal names. It has been noted that personal names were mostly of the \"Central-Dalmatian type\".\n\nAn extenstive study based on onomastics has been undertaken by Radoslav Katičić which puts the Dardani language area in the Central Illyrian area (\"Central Illyrian\" consisting of most of former Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ultimate decision of the committee charged by the Delegation was to adopt the Esperanto language, but with certain reforms. The result became a distinct language known as Ido.\n\nThe Delegation was founded in 1901 by French academics Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau, who had noted the language difficulties arising among international bodies convening during the 1900 World's Fair in Paris. Working with European esperantists, they gathered support for the Delegation from professional societies, companies, and universities.\n\nAmong the chief aims of the Delegation were to select a language to be taught alongside \"natural languages\" and allow written and spoken communication in an international environment. Three conditions were laid out for the language to be chosen:\n\n\nIn June 1907, the Delegation convened and refused to decide the ultimate issue, but rather, at Couturat's insistence, created a committee to make the decision.\n\nThe Delegation Committee arranged to meet in Paris in October 1907. Supporters of Esperanto, including its author L. L. Zamenhof, warned Couturat that the committee had no authority to impose an international language, but they had received assurances from Couturat that Esperanto would be chosen anyway. The members of the Committee were:\n\n\nThe committee heard from representatives of language projects, including Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano in support of his own Latino sine flexione. Esperanto was represented by Louis de Beaufront, an active supporter of the language. Other languages, such as Bolak, Spokil and Idiom Neutral received the attention of the committee.\n\nTowards the end of the Committee's meeting, committee members received a proposal by an anonymous author identified as \"Ido\" (I.D. in Esperanto, possibly for \"Internacia Delegacio\" International Delegation, but also meaning \"offspring\" in Esperanto). The proposal reformed Esperanto in a number of ways, including removing circumflexed letters, dropping the mandatory accusative ending and reforming the plural. The reforms were endorsed by Esperanto's representative, de Beaufront.\n\nThe decision of the committee was to adopt Esperanto in principle, but with the reforms spelled out by Ido. A permanent commission was set up to see the implementation of the reforms. The anonymous \"Ido\", author of the reform project, was later revealed to be Louis de Beaufront, acting in concert with Louis Couturat.\n\nThe commission delivered an ultimatum to the Esperanto Language Committee, the nearest approximate to a governing body of the Esperanto movement at the time. A response was demanded in one month, but this was logistically impossible as members of the Language Committee spread out all over Europe and beyond. After a month passed with no response, the commission broke relations with the Esperantists.\n\nA number of Esperantists did migrate to the movement, including a number of influential leaders of the movement, but most ordinary speakers did not support the Ido reforms. This prompted the observation from outsiders that the Idists were generals without an army, and the Esperantists were an army with no generals. Less than a year later, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio was created to provide stronger leadership within the Esperanto movement, which had not received organizational guidance from its inventor, Dr. Zamenhof. While Esperantists have little regard for the Delegation and its decisions, partisans of Ido continue to insist that the Delegation Committee was legitimate. The Ido language even today still has a following. \n\nThe Encyclopedia of Esperanto summarizes the Esperantists' position as follows: \n\n"}

{"id": "6289015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6289015", "title": "Dramatism", "text": "Dramatism\n\nDramatism, an interpretive communication studies theory, was developed by Kenneth Burke as a tool for analyzing human relationships. In this theory, our lives are as if on a stage, setting us individuals as actors on that stage as a way to understand human motives and relations. Burke discusses two important ideas – that life is drama, and the ultimate motive of rhetoric is the purging of guilt. Burke recognized guilt as the base of human emotions and motivations for action. As cited in \"A Note on Burke on \"Motive\",\" the author recognized the importance of \"motive\" in Burke's work. And in \"Kenneth Burke's concept of motives in rhetorical theory,\" the authors mentioned that Burke believes that when guilty \"combined with other constructs, describes the totality of the compelling force within an event which explains why the event took place.\"\n\nTo understand people's movement and intentions, the theorist sets up the Five Dramatistic Pentad strategy for viewing life, not as life itself, by comparing each social unit involved in human activities as five elements of drama – act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose, to answer the empirical question of how persons explain their actions, and to find the ultimate motivations of human activities.\n\nWhy use \"drama\" as the metaphor? According to West, there are three basic reasons that drama is a useful metaphor to the idea of Dramatism.\n\n\nIt is possible because Burke believes that Drama has recognizable genres. Humans use language in patterned discourses, and texts move us with recurring patterns underlying those texts. And drama has certain audiences, which means rhetoric plays a crucial role when humans deal with experiences. Language strategies are central to Burke's dramatistic approach.\n\nBecause of the complexity and extension of Burke's thinking, it is difficult to label the ontology behind his theory. However, some basic assumptions can still be extracted to support the understanding of dramatism.\n\nThe Dramatistic Pentad is an instrument used as a set of relational or functional principles that could help us understand what he calls the ‘cycle cluster of terms’ people use to attribute motive. This pentad is a dissolution to drama. It is parallel with Aristotle’s four causes and has a similar correlation to journalists catchism: who, what, when, where, why, and how. This is done through the five key elements of human drama – act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The Pentad is a simple tool for seeing and understanding the complexity of a situation. It reveals the nuances and complications of language as symbolic action, which in turn, opens up our perspective. \n\nIn the 1969 edition of \"Grammar\", Burke added a new element, Attitude, thereby making the pentad a hexad. Attitude means \"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\" \n\nDavid Ling used the pentad elements to evaluate Senator Edward Kennedy's speech in 1969 to persuade the audiences to see him as a victim of his family curse instead of the one who should be responsible for a accident which caused death of a woman. From Kennedy's statement, Ling recognized several elements from the pentad: \"the scene (the event surrounding the death of the woman), the agent (Kennedy), the act (Kennedy's failure to report immediately the accident), the agency (whatever methods to make such a report), the purpose (to fulfill his legal and moral responsibilities). \" Kennedy denied his relationship with the died woman, described his survival as a fate, and described the hardness of rescuing the woman at the scene. He pivoted the fact and described it as a circumstance that he couldn't control.\n\nDramatistic ratios is the \"proportions of one element relative to another in the Dramatism Pentad\", which can be used to find the dominant element in the interaction.\n\nAny complete statement about motives will offer some kind of answers to the five questions above. While it is important to understand each element of the Pentad on its own, it is more important to understand how the elements work together. This is called a \"ratio\", and there are ten possible ratios within the Pentad. Burke maintained that analyzing the ratios of a speaker’s presentation would expose the resources of ambiguity people might exploit to interpret complex problems. The most common ratios used by Burke are Scene-Act and Scene-Agent. When engaged in a dramatistic study, he notes, \"the basic unit of action would be defined as 'the human body in conscious or purposive motion'\", which is an agent acting in a situation.\n\nIdentification is the basic function of sociality, using both positive and negative associations. When there is overlap between two people in terms of their substance, they have identification. On the other hand, division is the lack of overlap between two people in matters of essence. According to Burke, identification is an inevitable, thus both beneficial and detrimental characteristic of language in human relations. Identification has the following features:\n\nExamining Aristotle's principles of rhetoric, Burke points out that the definition of the \"old rhetoric\" is, in essence, persuasion. Correspondingly, Burke proposes a new rhetoric, which discusses several issues, but mainly focuses on the notion of identification. In comparison with \"old\" rhetoric, which stresses on deliberate design, \"new\" rhetoric may include partially \"unconscious\" factors in its appeal.\n\nBurke's concept of new rhetoric has also been expanded in various academic disciplines. For example, in 2015 philosophers Rutten & Soetaert used the new rhetoric concept to study changing attitudes in regards to education as a way to better understand if Burke's ideas can be applied to this arena.\n\nBurke's new rhetoric has also been used to understand the women's equality movement, specifically in regards to the education of women and sharing of knowledge through print media. Academic Amlong deconstructed print medias of the 1800s addressing human rights as an aspect of educating women about the women's rights movement.\n\nBurke asserts that all things have substance, which he defines as the general nature of something. Identification is a recognized common ground between two people’s substances, regarding physical characteristics, talents, occupation, experiences, personality, beliefs, and attitudes. The more substance two people share, the greater the identification. It is used to overcome human division.\n\nSometimes the speaker tries to falsely identify with the audience, which results in homophily for the audience. Homophily is the perceived similarity between speaker and listener. The so-called \"I\" is merely a unique combination of potentially conflicting corporate \"we's\". For example, the use of the people rather than the worker would more clearly tap into the lower middle-class values of the audience the movement was trying to reach.\n\nBurke recognizes that identification rests on both unity and division, since no one's substance can completely overlap with others. Individuals are \"both joined and separated\". Humans can unite on certain aspects of substance but at the same time remain unique, which is labeled as \"ambiguities\". Identification can be increased by the process of consubstantiation, which refers to bridging divisions between two people. Rhetoric is needed in this process to build unity.\n\nAccording to Burke, Guilt Redemption is considered the plot of all human drama, or the root of all rhetoric. He defined the \"guilt\" as \"the theological doctrine of Original Sin\" And as cited from Littlejohn, Burke sees guilt as \"all-purpose word for any feeling of tension within a person—anxiety, embarrassment, self-hatred, disgust and the like\"\n\nIn this perspective, Burke concluded that the ultimate motivation of man is to purge oneself of one's sense of guilt through public speaking. The term guilt covers tension, anxiety, shame, disgust, embarrassment, and other similar feelings. Guilt serves as a motivating factor that drives the human drama.\n\nBurke's cycle refers to the process of feeling guilt and attempting to reduce it, which follows a predictable pattern: order(or hierarchy), the negative, victimage (scapegoat or mortification), and redemption.\n\nSociety is a dramatic process in which hierarchy forms structure through power relationships. The structure of social hierarchy considered in terms of the communication of superiority, inferiority and equality. The hierarchy is created through language using, which enables us to create categories. We feel guilt as a result of our place in the hierarchy.\n\nThe negative comes into play when people see their place in the social order and seek to reject it. Saying no to the existing order is both a function of our language abilities and evidence of humans as choice makers. Burke coined the phrase \"rotten with perfection\", which means that because our symbols allow us to imagine perfection, we always feel guilty about the difference between the reality and the perfection.\n\nVictimage is the way that we try to redeem the guilt. There are two ways of victimage. The way of turning the guilt into ourselves is called mortification. It is engaged when we apologize or blame ourselves when facing the wrongdoing; the way of turning the guilt to external parties is called scapegoating. According to Burke, there are two different types of scapegoating, \"universal\" and \"fractional\". In \"universal\" scapegoating, the speaker blames everyone for the problem, so the audience associates and even feels sorry for the victim, because it includes themselves. In \"fractional\" scapegoating, the speaker blames a specific group or a specific person for their problems. This creates a division within the audience. The victim, whoever it may be, is \"vilified\", or made up to violate the ideals of social order, like normalcy or decency. As a result, by people who take action against the villains become \"heroized\" because they are confronting evil.\n\nThis is a confession of guilt by the speaker and a request for forgiveness. Normally, these people are sentenced to a certain punishment so they can reflect and realize their sins. This punishment is specifically a kind of “death,” literal or figuratively. \nMany speakers experience a combination of these two guilt-purging options.The ongoing cycle starts with order. The order is the status quo, where everything is right with the world. Then pollution disrupts the order. The pollution is the guilt or sin. Then casuistic stretching allows the guilt to be accepted into the world. Next, is the guilt, which is the effect of the pollution. After that, is victimage or mortification which purges the guilt. Finally comes transcendence which is new order, the now status quo.\n\nDramatism provides us a new way to understand people. Burke's goal is to explain the whole of human experience with symbolic interaction. It is used in a variety of fields.\n\nBurke's technical term for drama representative anecdote indicates that the compositionist's adage gives appropriate examples covers the case adequately. Winterowd suggests writers should present ideas dramatistically,not relying on argument and demonstration alone but grounding their abstractions in the concreteness of what being called as representative anecdotes. Representative anecdote means conceptual pivot and is equated with a family of terms: enthymeme, thesis, topic sentence, theme. The representative anecdote, can be either support or conceptual pivot, and in the case of drama is both support and conceptual pivot.\n\nDwight Macdonald and Ernest Van Den Haag views that popular (or \"mass\"-) culture functions not as Scene, as one might ordinarily expect, but as Agency. \"Masscult\" itself is the force involved in the Act of brainwashing the public into accepting lower standards of art. This Act is accomplished with the \"Sub-Agency\" of modern electronic technology, the mass media.\n\nDavid Ling uses the pentad to analyze Senator Edward Ted Kenndy's address to the people of Massachusetts.(See Chappaquiddick incident) He regards the events surrounding the death of Miss Kopechne as the scene, Kennedy himself as the agent, Kennady's failure to report the accident in time as act, methods to report as agency, and finds out that the purpose for Kennedy is to fulfill his legal and moral duty.\n\nAnother example of dramatism in politics is the use of Burke’s rhetorical interpretations as a tool to understand presentations of terrorism in media. Researchers Gurrionero and Canel highlight the use of Burke’s understanding of motives and identification within the context of the media’s framing of terrorist attacks, saying that the words and symbols used are with specific motives to frame the pentad into the voice that benefits the media and viewers at the expense of the acclaimed terrorists.\n\nRempel Denise applies dramatism to explore the social networking site MySpace. She analyzed the architecture of MySpace, the identity presentation of users and the audience reception and finds out that legitimate communication is impossible, and consequently, cannot lead the users to act consubstantially.\n\nAnother example of applying Dramatism guilt redemption cycle elements in communication field, is the communication crisis of Donald Sterling's scandal. Donald Sterling was the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball franchise of the National Basketball Association. A leaking private conversation provoked his racist and disparaging statement on African Americans. As Billings, the author of \"The Dramatistic Implications of Burke's Guilt Redemption Cycle in the Donald Sterling Communication Crisis\" recognized and analyzed, that Sterlings act of trying to redeem his guilt was failed because of insufficient scapegoat.\n\nGregory Clark addressed the pentad to look into the sharing places in the United States. He concluded that tourism sites, which work as the scene in pentad, have the tendency to differentiate American people from other culture and therefore established a sense of national identity in terms of a common culture.\n\nSome researchers, such as Robert Wade Kenny, addressed the use of the Pentad and Dramatism to look into the field of sociology. As Kenny states, that the pentad can be used to examine sociology because, \"sociology is predicated on the notion that human action is neither random nor mystical, and this sets up the initial condition necessary for an inquiry into the motivating principles that give rise to social order and disorder.\" He stated that sociology is a study of human action, human behavior and lifeworld \"must be in play\", and the behaviors are motivated, so the dramatism elements can be applied to sociology field.\n\nBurke's Dramatism has been a great contribute to the communication field, which is praised by many researchers in this area. Chesebro commented on Burke's work that “few critics have revealed the scope, imagination, insights, and dazzling concern for symbol using which Kenneth Burke possesses (Chesebro, 1993, p. xii) ” And the New York Times commented Burke as a leading critic in the US, that Burke is recognized \"as a major influence on critics like Harold Bloom and writers like Ralph Ellison\" Burke's work is widely praised and influenced a great amount of researchers as well as students in communication filed.\n\nBut there are indeed a lot of critiques on the work too. As Charles Kneupper comments on Burke's work on this theory, that \"i would concur that has been limitations in the application of dramatistic theory...\" The theory can be examined by four criteria below.\n\n\nThe theory of Dramatism is criticized for being too broad in scope because it aims to explain how humans interact with each other using symbols, which been described as a general explanation that is almost has no meaning as some critics believe.\n\n\nRelatedly, some critique that the theory lacks parsimony, meaning it is unclear and too large to be useful.\n\n\nOther theorists argue that Dramatism lacks utility because it leaves out topics of gender and culture. Notably, Burke included women in his theory (unlike much of scholarship at the time), but feminist scholars, like Condit, found Burke's concepts inadequate to their critical concerns, by using the generic \"man\" to represent all people.\n\nDennis Brissett and Charles Edgley examine the utility of dramatism on different levels, which can be categorized as the following dimensions:\n\n1. The dramaturgical self\n\nDramaturgical perspective is vividly used to analyze human individuality. It views individuality as more a social rather than a psychological phenomenon. The concept of a dramaturgical self was formulated by sociologist Erving Goffman was inspired by the theatre, and also finds roots in relations to Burke's work. Specifically, the concept of dramaturgy ideates life as a metaphorical theater, differentiating from Burke's concept of life as a theater itself.\n\nSome examples of classic research questions on the topic involve how people maximize or minimize the expressiveness, how one stage ideal self, the process of impression-management, etc. For example, Larson and Zemke described the roots of the ideation and patterning of temporal socialization which is drawn from biological rhythms, values and beliefs, work and social commitments, cultural beliefs and engagement in activity.\n\n2. Motivation and drama\n\nMotives play a crucial role in social interaction between an acting person and his or her validating audience. Within the dramaturgical frame, people are rationalizing. Scholars try to provide a way of understanding how the various identities which comprise the self are constructed. For example, Anderson and Swainson tried to find the answer of whether rape is motivated by sex or by power.\n\nSocial relationships as drama\n\nDramatists also concern the ways in which people both facilitate and interfere with the ongoing behavior of others. The emphasis is on the expressive nature of the social bond. Some topics as role taking, role distance are discussed. For example, by analyzing public address, scholars examine why a speaker selects a certain strategy to identify with audience. For example, Orville Gilbert Brim, Jr. analyzed data to interpret how group structure and role learning influence children's understanding of gender.\n\n3. Organizational dramas\n\nIn addition to focusing on the negotiated nature of social organization, dramaturgy emphasizes the manner in which the social order is expressed through social interaction, how social organization is enacted, featured and dramatized. Typical research topics include corporate realm, business influence on federal policy agenda, even funerals and religious themes. For example, by examining the decision making criteria of Business Angels, Baron and Marksman identified four social skills which contribute to entrepreneurial success: social perception; persuasion and social influence; social adaptability and impression management. They employ dramatism to show how these skills are critical in raising finance.\n\n4. Political dramas\n\nIt is acknowledged that the political process has become more and more a theatrical, image-mongering, dramatic spectacle worthy of a show-business metaphor on a grand scale. Scholars study how dramaturgical materials create essential images by analyzing political advertising and campaigns, stagecraft-like diplomacy, etc. For example, Philip.E.Tetlock tried to answer why presidents became more complex in their thinking after winning the campaign. He found the reason is not presidents' own cognitive adjustment, but a means of impression management.\n\nFeminist scholars also talked about our ability as a society to begin to think in new ways about sex and gender, to extent our language beyond duality to a broad \"humanity\" and to \"human beings\". Since \"being\" is a state in which women simply experience life as freely, consciously, and fully as possible, realizing that this is not only the purpose of life but a genuine place from which change can occur. Condit also went on to criticize Burke for assuming culture as a hegemony, specifically in relation to Burke's application of guilt purging within cultures as necessitating victims.\n\nLater scholars, such as Anne Caroline Crenshaw, went on to note that Burke did identify gender relations in one instance in relation to his arguments on social hierarchies through his analysis of socio-sexual relations present in Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis. However, this author notes that Burke’s work wasn’t a critique and examination of this relationship through dramatism, but rather that the theory of dramatism does give space to make such analyses. Furthermore, scholar Brenda Robinson Hancock used Burke’s dramatism to study women’s movements, specifically with identification as actors. Another scholar, Janet Brown, made use of Burke's pentad in relation to understanding and identifications of feminist literature. Despite these works and incorporation of Dramatism in feminist work, there remains the evidence that Burke did not use or intent his theory to account for gender.\n\nAnother critique of the theory is to whether the theory exists as a metaphorical or literal theory.\n\nBurke staunchly argued that his theory of dramatism is a literal theory, understanding reality as a literal stage with actors and enactment. However, future theorists, specifically Bernard Brock and Herb Simons, went on to argue dramatism as metaphorical theory claiming that Burke’s idea that all the world's a stage is mere a tool of symbolic interaction that signals life as a drama. Of note, the reasoning for Burke to emphasize his theory as literal relates to the reasons to why others claim it to be metaphorical: the issue lies in the understanding of language’s power as a symbol itself.\n\n"}

(For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in List of constructed languages.)\n\nThe extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within ontology than linguistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "862904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862904", "title": "Expressive language disorder", "text": "Expressive language disorder\n\nExpressive language disorder is a communication disorder in which there are difficulties with verbal and written expression. It is a specific language impairment characterized by an ability to use expressive spoken language that is markedly below the appropriate level for the mental age, but with a language comprehension that is within normal limits. There can be problems with vocabulary, producing complex sentences, and remembering words, and there may or may not be abnormalities in articulation.\n\nAs well as present speech production, very often, someone will have difficulty remembering things. This memory problem is only disturbing for speech; non-verbal or non-linguistically based memory will be unimpaired. An example of a child with expressive language disorder can be seen here.\n\nExpressive language disorder affects work and schooling in many ways. It is usually treated by specific speech therapy, and usually cannot be expected to go away on its own.\n\nExpressive language disorder can be further classified into two groups: developmental expressive language disorder and acquired expressive language disorder. Developmental expressive language disorder currently has no known cause, is first observed when a child is learning to talk, is more common in boys than girls, and is much more common than the acquired form of the disorder. Acquired expressive language disorder is caused by specific damage to the brain by a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or seizures.\n\nCare must be taken to distinguish expressive language disorder from other communication disorders, sensory-motor disturbances, intellectual disability and/or environmental deprivation (see DSM-IV-TR criterion D). These factors affect a person's speech and writing to certain predictable extents, and with certain differences.\n\nCareful diagnosis is also important because \"atypical language development can be a secondary characteristic of other physical and developmental problems that may first manifest as language problems\".\n\nWillem Levelt outlined the currently accepted theory of speech production. Words are produced after the concept waiting to be produced is conceptualized, related words are selected, encoded and the sound waves of speech are produced.\n\nThere is also a lot of debate about whether specific language impairments, such as expressive language disorder, are caused by deficits in grammar or by a deficit in processing language information. However, an alternative hypothesis to the cause of SLIs has been posited, called the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis opines that we can explain language impairments due to abnormal development of brain structures that are involved in procedural memory, our memories that remember how to perform different cognitive and motor tasks. The procedural memory system is associated with basal-ganglia circuits in the frontal lobe and further investigation of this particular hypothesis could aid in the development of a clinical neurological picture of what the underlying causes of SLI are.\n\nSome of the earliest neuroscientific discoveries were related to the discovery that damage to certain areas of the brain related to impairments in language, such as the discovery of Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Lesions in these parts of the brain impair language comprehension and language production, respectively. Paul Broca was the first to note that the left hemisphere of the brain appeared to be localized for language function, particularly for right handed patients. Modern neuroscientific research has verified this, though language may be lateralizaed to the right hemisphere in some right-handed individuals.\n\nIn 1990, it was reported that the several generations of the KE family suffered from developmental verbal dyspraxia and orofacial praxis that were inherited in a typical autosomal dominant pattern. Further analysis traced this inheritance pattern back to mutations in the FOXP2 genes. These studies have allowed scientists to begin to investigate how changes to one gene can alter human communication.\n\nFOXP2 is the first gene that has been identified that is specifically linked to speech and language production. Mutant alleles of the normal FOXP2 gene have been found to be the cause of severe speech impairments.\n\nNeuroimaging techniques, such as structural and functional MRI, found no significant differences between individuals with SLI and normal controls. However, more subtle and sophisticated techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry studies have allowed researchers to identify bilateral abnormalities in neural volume in areas of the brain associated with motor functions, such as the caudate nucleus, in the affected members of the KE family when compared to the unaffected family members. This volume reduction showed a high correlation between reduced volume and tests of oral praxis, supporting the idea that odd development of the caudate nucleus is related to the problems in motor control observed in the KE family.\n\nDue to the vague nature of the diagnosis of expressive language disorder, there is little specific scientific research that we can currently locate. A larger body of research exists around neuroscientific studies with children diagnosed with a specific language impairment (SLI). fMRI studies have shown that children with SLI have a significantly smaller left hemispheric pars triangularis (Broca's area) and asymmetry of dominance of language structures, as opposed to the more typical left hemisphere dominance. Scientists are beginning to elucidate differences in activation patterns in children with SLIs using neuroimaging techniques to capture brain activity while performing different cognitive tasks. A major observation is lack of left hemisphere lateralization in major language structures such as the inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. The same study reported hypoactivation and hyper activation of other brain regions - the supramarginal junction and anterior insula, respectively. Other in-depth imaging studies report finding previously undiagnosed lesions in the brains of children with well-characterized developmental language development. Together, these findings strongly suggest that language impairments are the result of an underlying neurological defect in an area of the brain related to language.\n\nStudies looking at long-term outcomes for individuals with specific language impairments such as expressive language disorder track these individuals from childhood to adulthood. As Whitehouse and his colleagues suggest, \"When childhood language problems persist into adulthood, they can have far reaching consequences in terms of academic, social and vocational outcomes.\" These researchers found that children diagnosed with an SLI would have persistent problems with language and are more likely to pursue vocational training rather than university, thereby avoiding professions requiring high levels of literacy. A lower socioeconomic status was also noted by adults who were diagnosed with an SLI as a child. Whitehouse also reported that these adults had more difficulties in establishing friendships, most likely due to a decreased ability to express themselves socially.\n\nSpecific language impairments are often secondary characteristics of other disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In these cases, issues with speech and language are often not treated specifically, but rather attention is given to the primary complaint. Due to the high correlation of an SLI with other disorders, it is difficult to tell the difference between \"pure SLI\" or language impairments due to the presence of another disorder.\n\nThe focus and attention on the need for effective literacy instruction in the current educational climate is large. It is widely recognized that literacy needs to be taught across all curricula and verbal fluency correlates positively academic achievement. Literacy strategies are now being taught in an inclusive manner, rather than the traditional pull-out system, it is assumed that successful teaching strategies for high needs students are good for all students. Basic principles for interventions for students with a specific language impairment follow - the necessity to set specific goals, to manipulate the classroom environment and curricula so that there are many opportunities to use grammar effectively, the importance of consistently modelling high quality speech, the use of a wide variety of text and literature, and to value comprehension as the most important goal for students to achieve. There is no current cure-all intervention for students with SLIs, however, this is an ever expanding field of research.\n\nStudents diagnosed with an expressive language disability usually qualify for extra educational supports and assistance in school.\n\nAn expressive language disability or delay in kindergarten age children is classified as a Communication Disability/Delay under a Code 30. If there is no marked improvement in the child's ability to express themselves verbally once the student enters Grade 1, a child can be given a Code 57 for a Communication Disability. This diagnosis must be given from a Speech-Language Pathologist in order for the child to receive continued special education funding.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7584041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7584041", "title": "Hard and soft (martial arts)", "text": "Hard and soft (martial arts)\n\nIn martial arts, the terms hard and soft technique denote how forcefully a defender martial artist counters the force of an attack in armed and unarmed combat. In the East Asian martial arts, the corresponding hard technique and soft technique terms are 硬 (pinyin yìng, Japanese gō) and 柔 (pinyin róu, Japanese jū), hence Goju-ryu (hard-soft school), Shorinji Kempo principles of \"go-ho\" (\"hard method\") and \"ju-ho\" (\"soft method\"), Jujutsu (“art of softness”) and Judo (“gentle way”).\n\nIn European martial arts the same scale applies, especially in the German style of grappling and swordplay dating from the 14th century (\"e.g.\", the German school of fencing); the use of the terms hard and soft are otherwise translated as \"strong\" and \"weak.\" In later European martial arts the scale becomes less of a philosophic concept and more of a scientific approach to where two swords connect upon one another and the options applicable to each in the circumstance, parting further from the original meaning as time went along.\n\nRegardless of origins and styles \"hard and soft\" can be seen as simply \"opposing or yielding\"; each has its application and must be used in its own way, and each makes use of specific principles of timing and biomechanics.\n\nIn addition to describing a physical technique applied with minimal force, \"soft\" also sometimes refers to elements of a discipline which are viewed as less purely physical; for example, martial arts that are said to be \"internal styles\" are sometimes also known as \"soft styles\", for their focus on mental techniques or spiritual pursuits.\n\nA hard technique meets force with force, either with a linear, head-on force-blocking technique, or by diagonally cutting the strike with one's force. Although hard techniques require greater strength for successful execution, it is the mechanics of the technique that accomplish the defense. Examples are:\n\n\nHard techniques can be used in offense, defense, and counter-offense. They are affected by footwork and skeletal alignment. For the most part, hard techniques are direct. The key point of a hard technique is interrupting the flow of attack: in counter-offense they look to break the attack and in offense they are direct and committed blows or throws. Hard technique use muscle more than soft techniques.\n\nThe goal of the soft technique is deflecting the attacker’s force to his or her disadvantage, with the defender exerting minimal force and requiring minimal strength. With a soft technique, the defender uses the attacker's force and momentum against him or her, by leading the attack(er) in a direction to where the defender will be advantageously positioned (tai sabaki) and the attacker off balance; a seamless movement then effects the appropriate soft technique. In some styles of martial art like Wing Chun, a series of progressively difficult, two-student training drills, such as pushing hands or sticky hands, teach to exercise the soft-technique(s); hence:\n\n(1) The defender leads the attack by redirecting the attacker's forces against him or her, or away from the defender — instead of meeting the attack with a block. The mechanics of soft technique defenses usually are circular: \"Yielding\" is meeting the force with no resistance, like a projectile glancing off a surface without damaging it. Another example could be: an Aikido check/block to an attacker's arm, which re-directs the incoming energy of the blow.\n\n\nSoft techniques can be used in offense but are more likely to appear in defense and counter offense. Much like hard techniques they are effected by foot work and skeletal alignment. Where a hard technique in defense often aims to interrupt the flow of attack; a soft technique aims to misdirect it, move around it or draw it into over commitment, in counter offense a soft technique may appear as a slip or a vault or simply using the momentum of a technique against the user. Soft techniques in offense would usually only include feints and pulling motions but the definition and categorization may change from one art form to another.\n\nSoft techniques are also characterized as being circular in nature and considered internal (using Qi (Chinese) or ki (Japanese and Korean)) by martial arts such as t'ai chi ch'uan, hapkido and aikido.\n\nThe principle of underlies all classical Bujutsu methods and was adopted by the developers of the Budō disciplines. Acting according to the principle of Jū, the classical warrior could intercept and momentarily control his enemy's blade when attacked, then, in a flash, could counter-attack with a force powerful enough to cleave armor and kill the foe. The same principle of Jū permitted an unarmed exponent to unbalance and hurl his foe to the ground.\nTerms like \"Jūjutsu\" and \"Yawara\" made the principle of Jū the all-pervading one in methods cataloged under these terms. That principle was rooted in the concept of pliancy or flexibility, as understood in both a mental and a physical context. To apply the principle of Jū, the exponent had to be both mentally and physically capable of adapting himself to whatever situation his adversary might impose on him.\n\nThere are two aspects of the principle of Jū that are in constant operation, both interchangeable and inseparable. One aspect is that of \"yielding\", and is manifest in the exponent's actions that accept the enemy's force of attack, rather than oppose him by meeting his force directly with an equal or greater force, when it is advantageous to do so. It is economical in terms of energy to accept the foe's force by intercepting and warding it off without directly opposing it; but the tactic by which the force of the foe is dissipated may be as forcefully made as was the foe's original action.\n\nThe principle of Jū is incomplete at this point because yielding is essentially only a neutralization of the enemy's force. While giving way to the enemy's force of attack there must instantly be applied an action that takes advantage of the enemy, now occupied with his attack, in the form of a counterattack.\nThis second aspect of the principle of Jū makes allowance for situations in which yielding is impossible because it would lead to disaster. In such cases \"resistance\" is justified. But such opposition to the enemy's actions is only momentary and is quickly followed by an action based on the first aspect of Jū, that of yielding.\n\nThere is disagreement among different schools of Chinese martial arts about how the two concepts of \"Hard/Soft\" and \"External/Internal\" apply to their styles.\n\nAmong styles that this terminology is applied to, traditional Taijiquan equates the terms while maintaining several finer shades of distinction.\n\n"}

Consumed with food, these nutritients become building material for the body. The examples are deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (iFat), essential aminoacids, DNA bases such as cytosine, or heavy water and glucose.\n\nOne of the most pernicious and irreparable types of oxidative damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon biomolecules involves the carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage (hydrogen abstraction). Intriguingly, the biomolecules most damageable by this type of damage belong to the group of essential nutrients (10 out of 20 amino acids; nucleosides at certain conditions (conditionally essential); all polyunsaturated fatty acids). In theory, replacing hydrogen with deuterium \"reinforces\" the bond due to the kinetic isotope effect, and such reinforced biomolecules taken up by the body will be more resistant to ROS.\n\nThe company Retrotope pioneered the development a source of deuterated omega-6 fatty acid 11,11-D-ethyl linoleate (RT001) as a food additive for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedreich’s ataxia and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy.

{"id": "5631083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5631083", "title": "International Typographic Style", "text": "International Typographic Style\n\nThe International Typographic Style, also known as the Swiss Style, is a graphic design style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was developed by designers in Switzerland during the 1950s. The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and flush left, ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named. The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.\n\nThe style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. In 1896 the Berthold Type Foundry released its Akzidenz Grotesk Typeface in an attempt to capture an objective style, and from that point the International Typographic style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the Basel School of Design in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated “the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.” This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on \"beauty for the sake of beauty\" or \"the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself\". Keller’s work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Théo Ballmer and Max Bill.\n\nThe 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as Univers. Univers paved the way for Max Miedinger and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed Helvetica. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style—visually demonstrating the content—and was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland’s borders. One of the editors, Josef Müller-Brockmann, “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer’s subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.” Many of Müller-Brockmann’s feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways.\n\nAfter World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress—clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America.\n\nOne of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was Rudolph de Harak. The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak’s own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid—flush left, ragged-right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was MIT.\n\nDuring 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc.\n\nDe Stijl was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930. Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like Piet Mondrian, Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like Gerrit Rietveld, Robert van't Hoff and J.J.P. Oud.\n\nBauhaus was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by Walter Gropius. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style.\n\nConstructivism was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes.\n\nSuprematism, which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality.\n\nAll of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.\n\nThe Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering. The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented.\n\nFor example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content.\n\nA good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response.\n\nEach design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.” Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “[express] the spirit of a more progressive age” by early designers in the movement. Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1193823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1193823", "title": "Jacobian conjecture", "text": "Jacobian conjecture\n\nIn mathematics, the Jacobian conjecture is a famous problem on polynomials in several variables. It was first posed in 1939 by Ott-Heinrich Keller. It was widely publicized by Shreeram Abhyankar, as an example of a question in the area of algebraic geometry that requires little beyond a knowledge of calculus to state.\n\nThe Jacobian conjecture is notorious for the large number of attempted proofs that turned out to contain subtle errors. As of 2018, there are no plausible claims to have proved it. Even the two-variable case has resisted all efforts. There are no known compelling reasons for believing it to be true, and according to there are some suspicions that the conjecture is in fact false for large numbers of variables. The Jacobian conjecture is number 16 in Stephen Smale's 1998 list of Mathematical Problems for the Next Century.\n\nLet \"N\" > 1 be a fixed integer and consider polynomials \"f\", ..., \"f\" in variables \"X\", ..., \"X\" with coefficients in a field \"k\". Then we define a vector-valued function \"F\": \"k\" → \"k\" by setting:\n\nThe Jacobian determinant of \"F\", denoted by \"J\", is defined as the determinant of the \"N\" × \"N\" Jacobian matrix consisting of the partial derivatives of \"f\" with respect to \"X\":\n\nthen \"J\" is itself a polynomial function of the \"N\" variables \"X\", ..., \"X\".\n\nIt follows from the multivariable chain rule that if \"F\" has a polynomial inverse function \"G\": \"k\" → \"k\", then \"J\" has a polynomial reciprocal, so is a nonzero constant. The Jacobian conjecture is the following partial converse:\n\nJacobian conjecture: If \"J\" is a non-zero constant and \"k\" has characteristic 0, then \"F\" has an inverse function \"G\": \"k\" → \"k\", and \"G\" is regular (in the sense that its components are polynomials).\n\nAccording to , the problem was first conjectured by Keller in 1939 for the limited case of two variables and integer coefficients (which has been proved — see ). \n\nThe obvious analogue of the Jacobian conjecture fails if \"k\" has characteristic \"p\" > 0 even for 1 variable. The characteristic of a field must be prime, so it is at least 2. The polynomial has derivative which is 1 (because \"px\" is 0) but it has no inverse function. However, suggested extending the Jacobian conjecture to characteristic by adding the hypothesis that \"p\" does not divide the degree of the field extension .\n\nThe condition \"J\" ≠ 0 is related to the inverse function theorem in multivariable calculus. In fact for smooth functions (and so in particular for polynomials) a smooth local inverse function to \"F\" exists at every point where \"J\" is non-zero. For example, the map x → \"x\" + \"x\" has a smooth global inverse, but the inverse is not polynomial.\n\n proved the Jacobian conjecture for polynomials of degree 2, and showed that the general case follows from the special case where the polynomials are of degree 3, or even more specifically, of cubic homogeneous type, meaning of the form \"F\" = (\"X\" + \"H\", ..., \"X\" + \"H\"), where each \"H\" is either zero or a homogeneous cubic. showed that one may further assume that the map is of cubic linear type, meaning that the nonzero \"H\" are cubes of homogeneous linear polynomials. These reductions introduce additional variables and so are not available for fixed \"N\".\n\nLet \"k\"[\"X\"] denote the polynomial ring and \"k\"[\"F\"] denote the \"k\"-subalgebra generated by \"f\", ..., \"f\". For a given \"F\", the Jacobian conjecture is true if, and only if, . Keller (1939) proved the birational case, that is, where the two fields \"k\"(\"X\") and \"k\"(\"F\") are equal. The case where \"k\"(\"X\") is a Galois extension of \"k\"(\"F\") was proved by for complex maps and in general by and, independently, . checked the conjecture for polynomials of degree at most 100 in two variables.\n\nThe strong real Jacobian conjecture was that a real polynomial map with a nowhere vanishing Jacobian determinant has a smooth global inverse. That is equivalent to asking whether such a map is topologically a proper map, in which case it is a covering map of a simply connected manifold, hence invertible. constructed two variable counterexamples of total degree 25 and higher.\n\nIt is well-known that the Dixmier conjecture implies the Jacobian conjecture (see Bass et al. 1982). Conversely, it is shown by Yoshifumi Tsuchimoto (2005), and independently by , that the Jacobian conjecture for 2N variables implies the Dixmier conjecture for N dimension. A self-contained and purely algebraic proof of the last implication is also given by who also proved in the same paper that these two conjectures is equivalent to Poisson conjecture.\n\n\n"}

She is currently a professor at the School of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London. She is well known for her opposition to orthodoxy in current analytic philosophy of mind, and for her use of J. L. Austin's Speech Act Theory to look at the effects of pornography.\n\nHornsby earned her PhD from the University of Cambridge under the direction of Bernard Williams. She also earned a BA and MPhil from Oxford and London, respectively. She taught at the University of Oxford for 17 years before moving to Birkbeck College, London. She was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1996 to 1997.\n\nHornsby's work focuses primarily on the philosophies of mind, action, language, and feminist philosophy.\n\nHornsby's action theory is significantly influenced by the philosophy of Donald Davidson. In her book \"Actions\" (1980), she argues that actions are events occurring beneath the surface of the skin. The argument for this turns on an ambiguity in the slogan \"all actions are bodily movements\". The ambiguity stems from the fact that 'move' is one of a class of verbs that can occur either transitively or intransitively. Nominal expressions containing such verbs are therefore ambiguous: for example, 'the movement of the flag' can refer either to the action of someone's moving the flag or to the resultant movement of the flag. As we only ever answer a question about what someone did by using transitive verbs --- e.g. 'Jack moved his arm', not 'Jack's arm moved' (unless the latter is taken to imply that the former is true) --- the slogan \"all actions are bodily movements\" is only true if 'movement' is read transitively. This ambiguity noted, Hornsby then points out that if A V-s B, then A caused B to V ('' and '' serving to distinguish between transitive and intransitive uses of the relevant verbs). If Jack raised the flag, Jack caused the flag to rise. As causes and effects must be distinct, we must therefore also distinguish between Jack's raising his arm from Jack's arm's rising, the former causing the latter. So actions are bodily movements, which cause bodily movements. The final move is to claim that we know from physiology that the causes of bodily movements are events that occur beneath the surface of the skin. Therefore, actions occur beneath the surface of the skin.\n\nThis claim is combined with another: that the most basic description, in the causal sense of 'basic', of an action is as a trying. This arises from accepting a coarse-grained account of the individuation of events, according to which events are particulars that can be described in many different ways. The descriptions are distinguished by the effects of the described event in terms of which they are picked out. For example, the event of my slamming the door may be identical to the event of my waking the cat. The first description picks out the event by reference to the event of the door's being slammed. The second description picks out the event by reference to the event of the cat's waking. The question then is, Is there a description of the events which are actions that picks them out without reference to any effects? Hornsby's answer is that we can describe actions as tryings. I can try to raise my arm and, if successful, my arm will rise. (Note, though, that not all tryings are actions, only the successful ones.)\n\nHornsby is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In July 2017, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

It is a member of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family, and its nearest relatives are the Afar and Saho languages. Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages, with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.\n\nAs of 2006, there were approximately 16.6 million speakers of Somali, of which about 8.3 million reside in Somalia.\n\nThe Somali language is spoken by ethnic Somalis in Greater Somalia and the Somali diaspora. It is spoken as an adoptive language by a few ethnic minority groups in these regions.\n\nSomali dialects are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benaadir and Maay (sometimes spelled Mai or Mai Mai). Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the Benadir coast from Cadaley to south of Merca, including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional phonemes which do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle (Rahanweyn) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.\n\nThe Somali language is regulated by the Regional Somali Language Academy, an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.\n\nIn addition to Somali, Arabic, which is also an Afro-Asiatic tongue, is an official national language in Somalia. Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old cultural and ethnic ties with the Arab world, the far-reaching influence of the Arabic media, and religious education. Variants of the Yemeni and Hadhrami dialects are most common, particularly among merchants.\n\nSomali's main lexical borrowings come from Arabic. Soravia (1994) noted a total of 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985, a prominent Somali dictionary. Most of the vocabulary terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical borrowings may have been more extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.\n\nItalian was the only official language in Italian Somaliland for nearly 70 years and later - during the Trusteeship period - was official together with the Somali. After 1960 independence, the Italian remained official for another dozen years. Italian was later declared an official language again by the Transitional Federal Government along with English in 2004. But, in 2012, they were later removed by the establishments of the Provisional Constitution by the Federal Government of Somalia leaving Somali and Arabic as the only official languages.\nItalian is a legacy of the Italian colonial period of Somalia when it was part of the Italian Empire. Italian was the mother tongue of the Italian settlers of Somalia. \nAlthough it was the primary language since colonial rule, Italian continued to be used among the country's ruling elite even after 1960 independence when it continued to remain as an official language. It is estimated that more than 200,000 native Somalis (nearly 20% of the total population of former \"Somalia italiana\") were fluent speaking Italian when independence was declared in 1960.\nAfter a military coup in 1969, all foreign entities were nationalized by Siad Barre (who spoke fluently Italian), including Mogadishu's principal university, which was renamed 'Jaamacadda Ummadda Soomaliyeed' (Somali National University). This marked the initial decline of the use of Italian in Somalia.\nHowever, Italian is still widely spoken by the elderly, the educated, and by the governmental officials of Somalia. Prior to the Somali civil war, Mogadishu still had an Italian-language school, but was later destroyed by the conflict.\n\nEnglish is widely taught in schools. It used to be a working language in the British Somaliland protectorate.\n\nItalian was an official language in Italian Somaliland and during the trusteeship period, but the use of Italian language in Somalia significantly diminished following independence. It is now most frequently heard among older generations.\n\nOther minority languages include Bravanese (also known as Chimwiini or Chimbalazi), a variant of the Bantu Swahili language that is spoken along the southern coast by the Bravanese people. Kibajuni is a Swahili dialect that is the mother tongue of the Bajuni ethnic minority group. Additionally, a number of Bantus speak Mushunguli as a mother tongue.\n\nThe Somali Sign Language (SSL) is a sign language used by the deaf community in Somalia and Djibouti. It was originally developed by a Somali man educated in a Somali deaf school in Wajir, Kenya. In 1997, he established the first school for the deaf in the city of Borama,Somalia\n\nA number of writing systems have been used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the Somali Latin alphabet is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since 1972. The script was developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except \"p\", \"v\" and \"z\". There are no diacritics or other special characters except the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop, which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant digraphs: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.\n\nBesides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad's writing. Indigenous writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare scripts, which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare, respectively.\n\n\n"}

As BitTorrent clients usually begin to upload files almost as soon as they have started to download them, such users are usually not freeloaders (people who don't upload data at all to the swarm). Therefore, this kind of leeching is considered to be a legitimate practice. Reaching an upload/download ratio of 1:1 (meaning that the user has uploaded as much as they downloaded) in a BitTorrent client is considered a minimum in the etiquette of that network. In the terminology of these BitTorrent sites, a leech becomes a seeder (a provider of the file) when they finished downloading and continues to run the client. They will remain a seeder until the file is removed or destroyed (settings enable the torrent to stop seeding at a certain share ratio, or after X hours have passed seeding).\n\nThe so-called \"bad\" leechers are those running specially modified clients which avoid uploading data. This has led to the development of a multitude of technologies to ban such misbehaving clients. For example, on BitTorrent, most private trackers do keep track of the amount of data a client uploads or downloads to avoid leeching, while on real P2P networks systems like DLP (Dynamic Leecher Protection) (eMule Xtreme Mod, eDonkey network) or uploader rewarding (Gnutella2) have been brought in place. Note that BitTorrent is not a P2P network, it is only a P2P file distribution system.\n\nLeeching is often seen as a threat to peer-to-peer sharing and as the direct opposite of the practice of seeding. But with rising downloads, uploads are still guaranteed, although few contributors in the system account for most services.\n\n"}

It is the more common of the two alphabets used today to write the Malay language, the other being Jawi (a modified Arabic script). The Latin Malay alphabet is the official Malay script in Indonesia (as Indonesian), Malaysia (as Malaysian) and Singapore, while it is co-official with Jawi in Brunei.\n\nHistorically, various scripts such as Pallava, Kawi and Rencong were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi with the introduction of Islam. The arrival of European colonial powers brought the Latin alphabet to the Malay Archipelago.\n\nAs the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the Dutch and the British), two major different spelling orthographies were developed in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. The Soewandi Spelling System (or the Republic Spelling System after independence), used in the Dutch East Indies and later in independent Indonesia until 1972, was based on the Dutch alphabet. In 1972, as part of the effort of harmonizing spelling differences between the two countries, Indonesia and Malaysia each adopted a spelling reform plan, called the Perfected Spelling System (\"Ejaan yang Disempurnakan\") in Indonesia and the New Rumi Spelling (\"Ejaan Rumi Baharu\") in Malaysia. Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malaysian varieties, a number of minor spelling differences remain.\n\nNew Rumi Spelling (Malay: Ejaan Rumi Baharu), Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System (Indonesian: Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan, abbreviated EYD), also called the Perfected Spelling System (PSS).\nThe names of letters differ between Indonesia and rest of the Malay-speaking countries. Indonesia follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet, while Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore follow the English alphabet. Regardless of the letter names, however, the letters represent the same sounds in all Malay-speaking countries. The Malay alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra (where Malay is native): \"tujuh\" is pronounced (and was spelt) \"tujoh\", \"rambut\" as \"rambot\", \"kain\" as \"kaen\", \"pilih\" as \"pileh\", etc., [e] and [o] are also allophones of /i/ and /u/ in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian and Sumatran. Many vowels were pronounced and formerly spelt differently that way also in East Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.\n\nIn addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:\n\n\n"}

His father Chandrabali Shukla was a prestigious Revenue Inspector (Kanoongo) at that time. Before he did his high school at London Mission School he learned Hindi, English and Urdu at his house by qualified teachers and then for further study he came to Allahabad and continued his study; after that he wrote and published his valuable literature works and his experienced information.\n\nThe work of Shukla traces the genesis of Hindi poetry and prose since the 6th century and its development through Buddhist and Nath schools and the medieval contributions of Amir Khusro, Kabirdas, Ravidas, Tulsidas, stretching to the modern realism of Nirala and Premchand.\n\nIn his assessment of Shukla (\"Acharya Ramchandra Shukla aur Hindi Alochana\") eminent critic Dr. Ram Vilas Sharma emphasises the fact that the great writer opposed feudal and courtly literature as it did not give a true picture of the life of the common people and contemporary society.\n\nHis works of literary criticism include \"Kavita Kya Hai\", the most widely read essay explaining poetry and poetics in his outstanding collection \"Chintamani\", published initially in two volumes as a collection of essays on emotions like anger and hatred. Recently his scattered and unpublished essays have been found and published as \"Chintamani-3\" edited by Namwar Singh and \"Chintamani-4\" by Kusum Chaturvedi.\n\nTo enrich the worldview of Hindi speakers, Acharya Shukla translated Edwin Arnold's \"The Light of Asia\" into \"Buddha Charit\" (A biography of Gautam Buddha in Brij Bhasha verse) and German scholar Ernst Haeckel's famous work \"The Riddles of Universe\" into \"Vishwa Prapanch\" where he added his own thought-provoking preface by comparing its findings with Indian philosophical systems.\n\nThese works signify that he did not restrict himself to be the foremost moderniser of the Hindi language, literature and thought. He was involved with scientific temper-building by translating and updating works of science and history. In developing a scientific methodology to investigate the literary works of several centuries as creations of socio-economic and political conditions of the respective era, Acharya Shukla became a pathbreaker.\n\nIn his view true literature is not merely an expression of human consciousness as an end in itself but accounts for Lokmangal, a concept defining progress of society where common people are supreme and their sufferings are best understood as purpose for amelioration: literature, through aesthetics, must address itself to the pains/woes of the downtrodden and underdog and work for human emancipation from exploitation of all kinds.\n\nAcharya Ram Chandra Shukla was born on 4 October 1884 to Chandrabali Shukla in a small village—Agona, Basti, Uttar Pradesh—during British rule over India. He started his work in the world of letters with a poem and an article \"Prachin Bharatiyoin Ka Pahirava\" in Hindi and by writing in English his first published essay at the age of 17—\"What Has India to do\". Keeping in the spirit of anti-imperialism, in 1921, he wrote \"Non-co-operation and Non-mercantile Classes of India\" which was an attempt to look at the struggle of Indian classes in the set up of colonial and semi-feudal economy.\n\nAcharya Shukla taught at Banaras Hindu University Varanasi and chaired its department of Hindi during Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya's period from 1937 until he died (1941). Although not a regular story writer, he wrote a long Hindi story \"Gyarah Varsh Ka Samay\" to inspire original writing. His collection of original poems \"Madhushrota\" includes his adolescent hunger for hills, rocks, waterfalls, crops and birds, and images of his childhood sphere. His famous work \"Sahitya ka Itihaas\" was later edited online by a group of eminent Hindi writers and translators, led by Sri Suresh Kumar Mishra \"Uratrupt\", writer and methodologist from Ranga Reddy, Andhra Pradesh. \"Hindi Sahitya ka Itihaas\" is considered as authentic Hindi literature.\n\nRam Chandra Shukla was married to Savitri Devi and had two sons, Keshav Chandra and Gokul Chandra, and three daughters, Durgavati, Vidhya and Kamla. He was a painter and designed his own house, which was incomplete when he died in 1941.\n\n\"Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan\", a research institute established in 1972 in his name, is a center of literary activities. It was built on the wish of his son Gokul Chandra Shukla and on the land provided by the Varanasi local authority. Later it got financial help from the state government of Uttar Pradesh for building and infrastructure. Its first secretary, Kusum Chaturvedi, published a regular journal \"Naya Mandand\" which established a reputation for its special numbers on women, postmodernism, Dalit Sahitya, among others. Its articles and research papers are acclaimed in Hindi and Indian languages literature. After the death of Kusum Chaturvedi, a connoisseur of literature, Gyan Datta Chaturvedi became the secretary. After his death, Dr. Manjeet Chaturvedi, son of Kusum Chaturvedi and Gyan Datta Chaturvedi, professor, Banaras Hindu University took over as the Secretary (MANTRI) of Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan; its Chairperson (ADHYAKSHA) is Dr. Mukta, a famous author of Hindi stories. Kusum Chaturvedi and Mukta have produced a documentary for Doordarshan on Acharya Shukla and published his authentic biography.\n\nAcharya Shukla Sansthan has published following under the editorship of Kusum Chaturvedi.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46095", "title": "Russell's paradox", "text": "Russell's paradox\n\nIn the foundations of mathematics, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy), discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, showed that some attempted formalizations of the naïve set theory created by Georg Cantor led to a contradiction. The same paradox had been discovered in 1899 by Ernst Zermelo but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other members of the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s Cantor himself had already realized that his definition would lead to a contradiction, which he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.\n\nAccording to naive set theory, any definable collection is a set. Let \"R\" be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If \"R\" is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russell's paradox. Symbolically:\n\nIn 1908, two ways of avoiding the paradox were proposed, Russell's type theory and the Zermelo set theory, the first constructed axiomatic set theory. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond Gottlob Frege's axioms of extensionality and unlimited set abstraction, and evolved into the now-standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The essential difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that Zermelo altered the axioms of set theory while preserving the logical language in which they are expressed (the language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem, turned out to be first-order logic) while Russell altered the logical language itself.\n\nLet us call a set \"abnormal\" if it is a member of itself, and \"normal\" otherwise. For example, take the set of all squares in the plane. That set is not itself a square in the plane, and therefore is not a member of the set of all squares in the plane. So it is \"normal\". On the other hand, if we take the complementary set that contains all non-(squares in the plane), that set is itself not a square in the plane and so should be one of its own members as it is a non-(square in the plane). It is \"abnormal\".\n\nNow we consider the set of all normal sets, \"R\". Determining whether \"R\" is normal or abnormal is impossible: if \"R\" were a normal set, it would be contained in the set of normal sets (itself), and therefore be abnormal; and if \"R\" were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that \"R\" is neither normal nor abnormal: Russell's paradox.\n\nDefine Naive Set Theory (NST) as the theory of predicate logic with a binary predicate formula_2 and the following axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension:\n\nfor any formula \"P\" with only the variable \"x\" free.\nSubstitute formula_4 for formula_5. Then by existential instantiation (reusing the symbol \"y\") and universal instantiation we have\n\na contradiction. Therefore, NST is inconsistent.\n\nIn 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed an axiomatization of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his axiom of separation (\"Aussonderung\"). Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by Abraham Fraenkel, Thoralf Skolem, and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called ZFC. This theory became widely accepted once Zermelo's axiom of choice ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical axiomatic set theory down to the present day.\n\nZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set \"X\", any subset of \"X\" definable using first-order logic exists. The object \"R\" discussed above cannot be constructed in this fashion, and is therefore not a ZFC set. In some extensions of ZFC, objects like \"R\" are called proper classes.\n\nZFC is silent about types, although the cumulative hierarchy has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem's formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As José Ferreirós notes, Zermelo insisted instead that \"propositional functions (conditions or predicates) used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be 'entirely \"arbitrary\"' [ganz \"beliebig\"];\" the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include higher-order quantification in order to avoid Skolem's paradox. Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced (apparently independently of von Neumann), the axiom of foundation, thus—as Ferreirós observes— \"by forbidding 'circular' and 'ungrounded' sets, it [ZFC] incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT [type theory]—the principle of the types of arguments\". This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreirós writes that \"Zermelo's 'layers' are essentially the same as the types in the contemporary versions of simple TT [type theory] offered by Gödel and Tarski. One can describe the cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. (Once we have adopted an impredicative standpoint, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is not unnatural to accept transfinite types.) Thus, simple TT and ZFC could now be regarded as systems that 'talk' essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order 'description' of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is shown by the existence of denumerable models (Skolem paradox), but it enjoys some important advantages.\"\n\nIn ZFC, given a set \"A\", it is possible to define a set \"B\" that consists of exactly the sets in \"A\" that are not members of themselves. \"B\" cannot be in \"A\" by the same reasoning in Russell's Paradox. This variation of Russell's paradox shows that no set contains everything.\n\nThrough the work of Zermelo and others, especially John von Neumann, the structure of what some see as the \"natural\" objects described by ZFC eventually became clear; they are the elements of the von Neumann universe, \"V\", built up from the empty set by transfinitely iterating the power set operation. It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell's paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of \"V\". Whether it is \"appropriate\" to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nOther resolutions to Russell's paradox, more in the spirit of type theory, include the axiomatic set theories New Foundations and Scott-Potter set theory.\n\nRussell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901. By his own account in his 1919 \"Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy\", he \"attempted to discover some flaw in Cantor's proof that there is no greatest cardinal\". In a 1902 letter, he announced the discovery to Gottlob Frege of the paradox in Frege's 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\" and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Frege's definition of function:\n\nRussell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 \"The Principles of Mathematics\", where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox:\n\nRussell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\". Frege responded to Russell very quickly; his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoort's commentary in Heijenoort 1967:126–127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox, and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his \"Principles of Mathematics\", but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory. For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the doctrine of types.\n\nErnst Zermelo in his (1908) \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" (published at the same time he published \"the first axiomatic set theory\") laid claim to prior discovery of the antinomy in Cantor's naive set theory. He states: \"And yet, even the elementary form that Russell gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them [J. König, Jourdain, F. Bernstein] that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set\". Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim:\n\nFrege sent a copy of his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\" to Hilbert; as noted above, Frege's last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Frege's last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russell's paradox, \"I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago\". A written account of Zermelo's actual argument was discovered in the \"Nachlass\" of Edmund Husserl.\n\nIn 1923, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed to \"dispose\" of Russell's paradox as follows:\nThe reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it\ncannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition F(F(fx)), in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(fx) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of F(Fu) we write (do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu. That disposes of Russell's paradox. (\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", 3.333)\nRussell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume \"Principia Mathematica\" hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While \"Principia Mathematica\" avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.\n\nIn any event, Kurt Gödel in 1930–31 proved that while the logic of much of \"Principia Mathematica\", now known as first-order logic, is complete, Peano arithmetic is necessarily incomplete if it is consistent. This is very widely—though not universally—regarded as having shown the logicist program of Frege to be impossible to complete.\n\nIn 2001 A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russell's paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published.\n\nThere are some versions of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.\n\nAs another example, consider five lists of encyclopedia entries within the same encyclopedia:\n\nIf the \"List of all lists that do not contain themselves\" contains itself, then it does not belong to itself and should be removed. However, if it does not list itself, then it should be added to itself.\n\nWhile appealing, these layman's versions of the paradox share a drawback: an easy refutation of the barber paradox seems to be that such a barber does not exist, or that the barber is a woman and therefore doesn't shave. The whole point of Russell's paradox is that the answer \"such a set does not exist\" means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference between the statements \"such a set does not exist\" and \"it is an empty set\". It is like the difference between saying \"There is no bucket\" and saying \"The bucket is empty\".\n\nA notable exception to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and \"cannot\") exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.\n\nOne way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows:\n\nAs illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell's paradox is not hard to extend. Take:\n\n\nForm the sentence:\n\nSometimes the \"all\" is replaced by \"all <V>ers\".\n\nAn example would be \"paint\":\n\nor \"elect\"\n\nParadoxes that fall in this scheme include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Usually translated as 'under erasure', it involves the crossing out of a word within a text, but allowing it to remain legible and in place. Used extensively by Jacques Derrida, it signifies that a word is \"inadequate yet necessary\"; that a particular signifier is not wholly suitable for the concept it represents, but must be used as the constraints of our language offer nothing better.\n\nIn the philosophy of deconstruction, \"sous rature\" has been described as the typographical expression that seeks to identify sites within texts where key terms and concepts may be paradoxical or self-undermining, rendering their meaning undecidable. To extend this notion, deconstruction and the practice of \"sous rature\" also seek to demonstrate that meaning is derived from difference, not by reference to a pre-existing notion or freestanding idea.\n\n\"Sous rature\" as a literary practice originated in the works of German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). The practice of placing words or terms under erasure first appeared in Heidegger's work \"The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics\", Heidegger's lecture course of 1929/30. And subsequently in a letter he penned to Ernst Jünger in 1956 titled \"Zur Seinsfrage\" (The Question of Being), in which Heidegger seeks to define nihilism. During the course of the letter, Heidegger also begins to speculate about the problematic nature of defining anything, let alone words. In particular, the meaning of the term ‘Being’ is contested and Heidegger crosses out the word, but lets both the deletion and the word remain. “Since the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.” According to the Heideggerian model, erasure expressed the problem of presence and absence of meaning in language. Heidegger was concerned with trying to return the absent meaning to the present meaning and the placing of a word or term under erasure “simultaneously recognised and questioned the term’s meaning and accepted use”.\n\nFrench philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) adopted this technique and further explored the implications of Heidegger's erasure and its application in the wider setting of deconstructive literary theory. Derrida extended the problem of presence and absence to include the notion that erasure does not mark a lost presence, rather the potential impossibility of presence altogether - in other words, the potential impossibility of univocity of meaning ever having been attached to the word or term in the first place. Ultimately, Derrida argued, it was not just the particular signs that were placed under erasure, but the whole system of signification.\n\n\n"}

Unless otherwise noted, statements refer to Castilian Spanish, the standard dialect used in Spain on radio and television. For historical development of the sound system see History of Spanish. For details of geographical variation see Spanish dialects and varieties.\n\nPhonemes are written inside slashes () and allophones inside brackets ().\n\nThe phonemes , , and are realized as approximants (namely , hereafter represented without the downtack) or fricatives in all places except after a pause, after a nasal consonant, or—in the case of —after a lateral consonant; in such contexts they are realized as voiced stops.\n\nThe phoneme is realized as an approximant in all contexts except after a pause, a nasal, or a lateral. In these environments, it may be realized as an affricate (). The approximant allophone differs from non-syllabic in a number of ways; it has a lower F2 amplitude, is longer, can only appear in the syllable onset (including word-initially, where non-syllabic normally never appears), is a palatal fricative in emphatic pronunciations, and is unspecified for rounding (e.g. \"viuda\" 'widow' vs \"ayuda\" 'help'). The two also overlap in distribution after and : \"enyesar\" ('to plaster') \"aniego\" ('flood'). Although there is dialectal and ideolectal variation, speakers may also exhibit other near-minimal pairs like \"abyecto\" ('abject') vs \"abierto\" ('opened'). There are some alternations between the two, prompting scholars like to postulate an archiphoneme , so that \"ley\" would be transcribed phonemically as and \"leyes\" as .\n\nIn a number of varieties, including some American ones, a process parallel to the one distinguishing non-syllabic from consonantal occurs for non-syllabic and a rare consonantal . Near-minimal pairs include \"deshuesar\" ('to bone') vs. \"desuello\" ('skinning'), \"son huevos\" ('they are eggs') vs \"son nuevos\" ('they are new'), and huaca\" ('Indian grave') vs u oca\" ('or goose').\n\nMany young Argentinians have no distinct phoneme and use the sequence instead, thus making no distinction between \"huraño\" and \"uranio\" (both ).\n\nThe phoneme (as distinct from ) is found in some areas in Spain (mostly northern and rural) and some areas of South America (mostly highlands).\n\nMost speakers in Spain (except for Western Andalusia and all Canary Islands), including the variety prevalent on radio and television, have both and (\"distinción\"). However, speakers in Latin America and those parts of southern Spain have only (\"seseo\"). Some speakers in southernmost Spain (especially coastal Andalusia) have only (a consonant similar to ) and not (\"ceceo\"). This \"ceceo\" is not entirely unknown in the Americas, especially in coastal Peru. The phoneme has three different pronunciations (\"laminal s\", \"apical s\" or \"apical dental s\") depending on dialect.\n\nThe phonemes and are laminal denti-alveolars (). The phoneme becomes dental before denti-alveolar consonants, while remains interdental in all contexts.\n\nBefore front vowels , the velar consonants (including the lenited allophone of ) are realized as post-palatal .\n\nAccording to some authors, is post-velar or uvular in the Spanish of northern and central Spain. Others describe as velar in European Spanish, with a uvular allophone () appearing before and (including when is in the syllable onset as ).\n\nA common pronunciation of in nonstandard speech is the voiceless bilabial fricative , so that \"fuera\" is pronounced rather than . In some Extremaduran, western Andalusian, and American varieties, this softened realization of , when it occurs before , is subject to merger with ; in some areas the homophony of \"fuego\"/\"juego\" is resolved by replacing \"fuego\" with \"lumbre\" or \"candela\".\n\nSome of the phonemic contrasts between consonants in Spanish are lost in certain phonological environments, and especially in syllable-final position. In these cases the phonemic contrast is said to be neutralized.\n\nThe three nasal phonemes—, , and —maintain their contrast when in syllable-initial position (e.g. \"cama\" 'bed', \"cana\" 'grey hair', \"caña\" 'sugar cane'). In syllable-final position, this three-way contrast is lost as nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant—even across a word boundary; or, if a nasal is followed by a pause rather than a consonant, it is realized for most speakers as alveolar (though in Caribbean varieties this may instead be or an omitted nasal with nasalization of the preceding vowel). Thus is realized as before labial consonants, and as before velar ones.\n\nSimilarly, assimilates to the place of articulation of a following coronal consonant, i.e. a consonant that is interdental, dental, alveolar, or palatal.\n\nAssimilatory nasal and lateral allophones are shown in the following table:\n\nThe alveolar trill and the alveolar tap are in phonemic contrast word-internally between vowels (as in \"carro\" 'car' vs \"caro\" 'expensive'), but are otherwise in complementary distribution. Only the trill can occur after , , or (e.g. \"alrededor\", \"enriquecer\", \"Israel\"), and word-initially (e.g. \"rey\" 'king'). After a stop or fricative consonant (but not ), only the tap can occur (e.g. \"tres\" 'three', \"frío\" 'cold').\n\nIn syllable-final position, inside a word, the tap is more frequent, but the trill can also occur (especially in emphatic or oratorical style) with no semantic difference—thus \"arma\" ('weapon') may be either (tap) or (trill).\n\nIn \"word\"-final position the rhotic is usually:\n\nWhen two rhotics occur consecutively across a word or prefix boundary, they result in one trill, so that \"da rocas\" ('s/he gives rocks') and \"dar rocas\" ('to give rocks') are either neutralized, or distinguished by a longer trill in the latter phrase.\n\nThe tap/trill alternation has prompted a number of authors to postulate a single underlying rhotic; the intervocalic contrast then results from gemination (e.g. \"tierra\" > 'earth').\n\nThe phonemes , , and become voiced before voiced consonants as in \"jazmín\" ('Jasmine') , \"rasgo\" ('feature') , and \"Afganistán\" ('Afghanistan') . There is a certain amount of free variation in this so that \"jazmín\" can be pronounced or .\n\nBoth in casual and in formal speech, there is no phonemic contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants placed in syllable-final position. The merged phoneme is typically pronounced as a relaxed, voiced fricative or approximant, although a variety of other realizations are also possible. So the clusters -\"bt\"- and -\"pt\"- in the words \"obtener\" and \"optimista\" are pronounced exactly the same way:\nSimilarly, the spellings \"-dm-\" and \"-tm-\" are often merged in pronunciation, as well as -\"gd\"- and -\"cd\"-:\n\nSpanish has five vowels , , , and (the same that are found in Asturian, Aragonese, Basque and Leonese). Each occurs in both stressed and unstressed syllables:\n\nNevertheless, there are some distributional gaps or rarities. For instance, an unstressed high vowel in the final syllable of a word is rare.\n\nBecause of substratal Quechua, at least some speakers from southern Colombia down through Peru can be analyzed to have only three vowel phonemes , as the close are continually confused with the mid , resulting in pronunciations such as for \"dulzura\" ('sweetness'). When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as , which are heard by outsiders as variants of . Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.\n\nPhonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal, e.g. \"cinco\" ('five').\n\nArguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. \"la madre\" ('the mother') vs. \"las madres\" ('the mothers'). However, these are more commonly analyzed as allophones triggered by an underlying that is subsequently deleted.\n\nThere is no agreement among scholars on how many vowel allophones Spanish has; an often postulated number is five .\n\nSome scholars, however, state that Spanish has \"eleven\" allophones: the close and mid vowels have close and open allophones, whereas appears in front , central and back variants. These symbols appear only in the narrowest variant of phonetic transcription; in more broad variants, only the symbols are used, and that is the convention adopted in this article as well (save for this section, for the sake of clarity).\n\nTomás Navarro Tomás describes the distribution of said eleven allophones as follows:\n\n\nAccording to Eugenio Martínez Celdrán, however, systematic classification of Spanish allophones is impossible due to the fact that their occurrence varies from speaker to speaker and from region to region. According to him, the exact degree of openness of Spanish vowels depends not so much on the phonetic environment, but rather on various external factors accompanying speech.\n\nSpanish has six falling diphthongs and eight rising diphthongs. While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and hiatus. There are also some lexical items that vary amongst speakers and dialects between hiatus and diphthong: words like \"biólogo\" ('biologist') with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like \"diálogo\" with a stressed or pretonic sequence of and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus. hypothesize that this is because vocalic sequences are longer in these positions.\n\nIn addition to synalepha across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech; when this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in \"poeta\" ('poet') and \"maestro\" ('teacher'). Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong may be reduced to in certain unstressed contexts, as in \"Eufemia\", . In the case of verbs like \"aliviar\" ('relieve'), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final (that is, \"aliviar\" would be || + ||). This contrasts with verbs like \"ampliar\" ('to extend') which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in . Spanish also possesses triphthongs like and, in dialects that use a second person plural conjugation, , , and (e.g. \"buey\", 'ox'; \"cambiáis\", 'you change'; \"cambiéis\", '(that) you may change'; and \"averiguáis\", 'you ascertain').\n\nNon-syllabic and can be reduced to , , as in \"beatitud\" ('beatitude') and \"poetisa\" ('poetess'), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic can be completely elided, as in (e.g. \"ahorita\" 'right away'). The frequency (though not the presence) of this phenomenon differs amongst dialects, with a number having it occur rarely and others exhibiting it always.\n\nSpanish is usually considered a syllable-timed language. Even so, stressed syllables can be up to 50% longer in duration than non-stressed syllables. Although pitch, duration, and loudness contribute to the perception of stress, pitch is the most important in isolation.\n\nPrimary stress occurs on the penultima (the next-to-last syllable) 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima and antepenultima (third-to-last syllable).\n\nNonverbs are generally stressed on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), whereas regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].\n\nIn addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous minimal pairs which contrast solely on stress such as \"sábana\" ('sheet') and \"sabana\" ('savannah'), as well as \"límite\" ('boundary'), \"limite\" ('[that] he/she limit') and \"limité\" ('I limited').\n\nLexical stress may be marked orthographically with an acute accent (\"ácido\", \"distinción\", etc.). This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of Spanish orthography, which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like \"distinción\") and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word. An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as \"mi\" (my), and \"mí\" (me). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when used in a sentence.\n\nLexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress. In addition, amongst sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress, e.g. \"búscalo\" ('look for it').\n\nA number of alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect morphophonological processes rather than strictly phonological ones. For instance, a number of words alternate between and or and , with the latter in each pair appearing before a front vowel:\n\nNote that the conjugation of most verbs with a stem ending in or does \"not\" show this alternation; these segments do not turn into or before a front vowel:\n\nThere are also alternations between unstressed and and stressed and respectively:\n\nLikewise, in a very small number of words, alternations occur between the palatal sonorants and their corresponding alveolar sonorants (\"doncella\"/\"doncel\" 'maiden'/'youth', \"desdeñar\"/\"desdén\" 'to scorn'/'scorn'). This alternation does not appear in verbal or nominal inflection (that is, the plural of \"doncel\" is \"donceles\", not *\"doncelles\"). This is the result of geminated and of Vulgar Latin (the origin of and , respectively) degeminating and then depalatalizing in coda position. Words without any palatal-alveolar allomorphy are the result of historical borrowings.\n\nOther alternations include ~ (\"anexo\" vs \"anejo\"), ~ (\"nocturno\" vs \"noche\"). Here the forms with and are historical borrowings and the forms with and forms are inherited from Vulgar Latin.\n\nThere are also pairs that show antepenultimate stress in nouns and adjectives but penultimate stress in synonymous verbs (\"vómito\" 'vomit' vs. \"vomito\" 'I vomit').\n\nSpanish syllable structure can be summarized as follows; parentheses enclose optional components:\n\nSpanish syllable structure consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one or two consonants; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a semivowel; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants. The following restrictions apply:\n\n\nMaximal onsets include transporte\" , flaco\" , \"clave\" .\n\nMaximal nuclei include \"buey , \"Uruguay .\n\nMaximal codas include \"instalar\" , \"perspectiva\" .\n\nIn many dialects, a coda cannot be more than one consonant (one of n, r, l or s) in informal speech. Realizations like , , are very common, and in many cases, they are allowed even in formal speech.\n\nBecause of the phonotactic constraints, an epenthetic is inserted before word-initial clusters beginning with (e.g. \"escribir\" 'to write') but not word-internally (\"transcribir\" 'to transcribe'), thereby moving the initial to a separate syllable. The epenthetic is pronounced even when it is not reflected in spelling (e.g. the surname of Carlos Slim is pronounced ). While Spanish words undergo word-initial epenthesis, cognates in Latin and Italian do not:\n\n\nSpanish syllable structure is phrasal, resulting in syllables consisting of phonemes from neighboring words in combination, sometimes even resulting in elision. The phenomenon is known in Spanish as \"enlace\". For a brief discussion contrasting Spanish and English syllable structure, see .\n\nPhonological development varies greatly by individual, both those developing regularly and those with delays. However, a general pattern of acquisition of phonemes can be inferred by the level of complexity of their features, i.e. by sound classes. A hierarchy may be constructed, and if a child is capable of producing a discrimination on one level, he/she will also be capable of making the discriminations of all prior levels.\n\n\nThis hierarchy is based on production only, and is a representation of a child’s capacity to produce a sound, whether that sound is the correct target in adult speech or not. Thus, it may contain some sounds that are not included in the adult phonology, but produced as a result of error.\n\nSpanish-speaking children will accurately produce most segments at a relatively early age. By around three-and-a-half years, they will no longer productively use phonological processes the majority of the time. Some common error patterns (found 10% or more of the time) are cluster reduction, liquid simplification, and stopping. Less common patterns (evidenced less than 10% of the time) include palatal fronting, assimilation, and final consonant deletion.\n\nTypical phonological analyses of Spanish consider the consonants , , and the underlying phonemes and their corresponding approximants , , and allophonic and derivable by phonological rules. However, approximants may be the more basic form because monolingual Spanish-learning children learn to produce the continuant contrast between and before they do the lead voicing contrast between and . (In comparison, English-learning children are able to produce adult-like voicing contrasts for these stops well before age three.) The allophonic distribution of and produced in adult speech is not learned until after age two and not fully mastered even at age four.\n\nThe alveolar trill is one of the most difficult sounds to be produced in Spanish and as a result is acquired later in development. Research suggests that the alveolar trill is acquired and developed between the ages of three and six years. Some children acquire an adult-like trill within this period and some fail to properly acquire the trill. The attempted trill sound of the poor trillers is often perceived as a series of taps owing to hyperactive tongue movement during production.\n\nThe trill is also very difficult for those learning Spanish as a second language, sometimes taking over a year to produce properly.\n\nOne research study found that children acquire medial codas before final codas, and stressed codas before unstressed codas. Since medial codas are often stressed and must undergo place assimilation, greater importance is accorded to their acquisition. Liquid and nasal codas occur word medially and at the ends of frequently-used function words, so they are often acquired first.\n\nResearch suggests that children overgeneralize stress rules when they are reproducing novel Spanish words and that they have a tendency to stress the penultimate syllables of antepenultimately stressed words, to avoid a violation of nonverb stress rules that they have acquired. Many of the most frequent words heard by children have irregular stress patterns or are verbs, which violate nonverb stress rules. This complicates stress rules until ages three to four, when stress acquisition is essentially complete, and children begin to apply these rules to novel irregular situations.\n\nSome features, such as the pronunciation of voiceless stops , have no dialectal variation. However, there are numerous other features of pronunciation that differ from dialect to dialect.\n\nOne notable dialectal feature is the merging of the voiced palatal fricative (as in \"ayer\") with the palatal lateral approximant (as in \"calle\") into one phoneme (\"yeísmo\"), with losing its laterality. While the distinction between these two sounds has traditionally been a feature of Castilian Spanish, this merger has spread throughout most of Spain in recent generations, particularly outside of regions in close linguistic contact with Catalan and Basque. In Spanish America, most dialects are characterized by this merger, with the distinction persisting mostly in parts of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northwestern Argentina. In the other parts of Argentina, the phoneme resulting from the merger is realized as ; and in Buenos Aires the sound has recently been devoiced to among the younger population; the change is spreading throughout Argentina.\n\nSpeakers in northern and central Spain, including the variety prevalent on radio and television, have both and (\"distinción\", 'distinction'). However, speakers in Latin America, Canary Islands and some parts of southern Spain have only (\"seseo\"), which in southernmost Spain is pronounced and not (\"ceceo\").\n\nThe phoneme has three different pronunciations depending on the dialect area:\n\nObaid describes the apico-alveolar sound as follows:\nDalbor describes the apico-dental sound as follows:\nIn some dialects, may become the approximant in the syllable coda (e.g. \"doscientos\" 'two hundred'). In many places, it debuccalizes to in final position (e.g. \"niños\" 'children'), or before another consonant (e.g. \"fósforo\" 'match') so the change occurs in the coda position in a syllable.\n\nFrom an autosegmental point of view, the phoneme in Madrid is defined only by its \"voiceless\" and \"fricative\" features. Thus, the point of articulation is not defined and is determined from the sounds following it in the word or sentence. In Madrid, the following realizations are found: > and > . In parts of southern Spain, the only feature defined for appears to be \"voiceless\"; it may lose its oral articulation entirely to become or even a geminate with the following consonant ( or from 'same'). In Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish, word-final , and (phonetically ) regularly weaken, and the preceding vowel is lowered and lengthened:\n\nA subsequent process of vowel harmony takes place so \"lejos\" ('far') is , \"tenéis\" ('you [plural] have') is and \"tréboles\" ('clovers') is or .\n\nSouthern European Spanish (Andalusian Spanish, Murcian Spanish, etc.) and several lowland dialects in Latin America (such as those from the Caribbean, Panama, and the Atlantic coast of Colombia) exhibit more extreme forms of simplification of coda consonants:\nThe dropped consonants appear when additional suffixation occurs (e.g. \"compases\" 'beats', \"venían\" 'they were coming', \"comeremos\" 'we will eat'). Similarly, a number of coda assimilations occur:\n\nFinal dropping (e.g. \"mitad\" 'half') is general in most dialects of Spanish, even in formal speech.\n\nThe deletions and neutralizations show variability in their occurrence, even with the same speaker in the same utterance, so nondeleted forms exist in the underlying structure. The dialects may not be on the path to eliminating coda consonants since deletion processes have been existing for more than four centuries. argues that it is the result of speakers acquiring multiple phonological systems with uneven control like that of second language learners.\n\nIn Standard European Spanish, the voiced obstruents before a pause are devoiced and laxed to , as in \"club ('[social] club'), \"sed ('thirst'), \"zigzag\" . However, word-final is rare, and even more so. They are restricted mostly to loanwords and foreign names, such as the first name of former Real Madrid sports director Predrag Mijatović, which is pronounced ; and after another consonant, the voiced obstruent may even be deleted, as in \"iceberg\", pronounced .\n\nThe fricative may also appear in borrowings from other languages, such as Nahuatl and English. In addition, the affricates and also occur in Nahuatl borrowings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2917649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2917649", "title": "Speech", "text": "Speech\n\nSpeech is human vocal communication using language. Each language uses phonetic combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized vowel and consonant sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., \"role\" or \"hotel\"), and using those words in their semantic character as words in the lexicon of a language according to the syntactic constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional speech acts, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use enunciation, intonation, degrees of loudness, tempo, and other non-representational or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization to convey meaning. In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through accent), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or drunkenness, normal consciousness and trance states), education or experience, and the like. \n\nAlthough people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people swear they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something. There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person. Solo speech can be used to memorize or to test one's memorization of things, and in prayer or in meditation (e.g., the use of a mantra).\n\nResearchers study many different aspects of speech: speech production and speech perception of the sounds used in a language, speech repetition, speech errors, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in children's enlargement of their vocabulary, and what different areas of the human brain, such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for linguistics, cognitive science, communication studies, psychology, computer science, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and acoustics. \nSpeech compares with written language\n, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called diglossia. \n\nThe evolutionary origins of speech are unknown and subject to much debate and speculation. While animals also communicate using vocalizations, and trained apes such as Washoe and Kanzi can use simple sign language, no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.\n\nSpeech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.\n\nIn linguistics (articulatory phonetics), articulation refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by manner of articulation and place of articulation. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place of articulation, there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several homorganic consonants.\n\nNormal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the lungs, which creates phonation in the glottis in the larynx, which is then modified by the vocal tract and mouth into different vowels and consonants. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in alaryngeal speech, of which there are three types: esophageal speech, pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as Donald Duck talk).\n\nSpeech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech. As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and child language acquisition. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier. Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of expressive aphasia patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.\n\nSpeech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of phonetics and phonology in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. Research into speech perception also has applications in building computer systems that can recognize speech, as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.\n\nSpeech perception is categorical, in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is voice onset time (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.\n\nIn speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in phonological memory). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.\n\nThere are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:\n\n\nThe classical or Wernicke-Geschwind model of the language system in the brain focuses on Broca's area in the inferior prefrontal cortex, and Wernicke's area in the posterior superior temporal gyrus on the dominant hemisphere of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the auditory cortex to Wernicke's area. The lexicon is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the arcuate fasciculus to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the motor cortex for articulation.\n\nPaul Broca identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or expressive aphasia, is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in telegraphic speech. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences. Wernicke's area is named after Carl Wernicke, who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex. Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or receptive aphasia, which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or jargon speech.\n\nModern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension. Damage to the left lateral sulcus has been connected with difficulty in processing and producing morphology and syntax, while lexical access and comprehension of irregular forms (e.g. eat-ate) remain unaffected.\nMoreover, the circuits involved in human speech comprehension dynamically adapt with learning, for example, by becoming more efficient in terms of processing time when listening to familiar messages such as learned verses.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first person of colour whose poetry and prose were published in South Africa.\n\nSydney Vernon Petersen was born on 22 June 1914 in Riversdale, a town in the south of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. He was the second child in a family of five children, of which all five later became teachers. His father was a saddler and harness maker, his mother a homemaker. Motivated mainly by their mother all of the children obtained, at least, their degree in Education. Petersen visited the local Berlin Mission School until 1926, completing his schooling in Cape Town at the Trafalgar High School. He excelled in athletics and sports throughout his student days. During his final year in high school a pastor, Reverend Kohl of the Lutheran Mission Church, he felt, had a particularly good influence on his personal development. At this time there were very limited opportunities for children of colour to obtain a proper schooling (in 1929 only around 600 children were enrolled in high school within the Union of South Africa) and it was a great achievement, despite these limitations, for him to obtain such results, made possible through his strong personal drive and the support of his parents and people like Reverend Kohl. As a young child, he made daily deliveries of bread and as a teenager did manual labour for a living and contribute to its training costs.\n\nOn completing school, he studied at the Battswood Training College, Wynberg, where he qualified as a teacher in 1933. His first teaching post was in Ladismith in the Cape Province. Two years later he was back in Cape Town teaching at the Berlin Mission School in Searle Street District Six. He began attending evening classes at the University of Cape Town for his Bachelor’s Degree with majors in Afrikaans, English and Mathematics, befriending the Afrikaans poet I.D. du Plessis. On graduating in 1940 he obtained the University Medal for Afrikaans. Later he obtained a B.Ed. degree from the same university. As a teacher, he served from 1939 as an assistant in the secondary school Battswood, while lecturing in the Training College Battswood and from 1945 as head of the same institution's primary school. In January 1947, he founded the Athlone High School where he remained principal until his retirement in 1974. After his retirement, he accepted a temporary post in the Department of Education at the Hewat Education College in Crawford and in 1981 he lectured at the Teacher Training College in Bellville, where he was employed until 1983. His wife, Mavis, was also a teacher and the couple had a son, Sydney, named after his father.\n\nIn 1959 Petersen was appointed a member of the US - SA leadership program and travelled with his family to America, where he lectured at several university colleges in New York and Chicago. His hosts noticed he was writing his reports by hand, so the bought him a typewriter, with which he wrote for the rest of his life. He travelled to Ghana, Israel, Greece and Turkey. In April 1960, he spent a year abroad as a guest of the Dutch-South African Society. From 1969 on he was also invited by the governments of Germany and the Netherlands to visit educational centres in these countries. In 1982 he was appointed to the advisory board of the SABC He died of kidney failure in Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town on October 30, 1987.\n\nAlready in primary school he started to write prose in addition to poetry. After 1940, short stories and sketches appeared in ‘’Naweek’’, ’’Suid-Afrika’’, ’’Die Huisgenoot’’ and \"Tydskrif vir Letterkunde\". His short stories \"Repos ailleurs\" and \"Kaapstad\" are included in the volume \"Geseënd is julle\" (Blessed Are You), edited by S. J. Malan and W.H. Vos. The short story \"Verbode vrugte\" (Forbidden Fruit), was published in 1943 in \"Die Naweek\" and included by Daniel Hugo in his collection \"Tydskrif 2\". Its theme of racially mixed marriage, dealt with in rather more jovial than confrontational fashion, was daring for the time.\nFrom the same period dates the novel \"As die Son Ondergaan\" (When the Sun Goes Down), a story about the demise of a young brown man (Frans) in the city. The gifted young man, unable to realise his ambition to become a teacher, left his home in the countryside for city, hoping to get a paying job. He is swallowed up in the urban industrial machine and makes friends with the wrong crowd of people. His morality undermined by drinking and sex, he marries a flighty young woman, Karolien. Deserted by his so-called friends and his wife, he is given over to drink. Then his parents come for him. By returning to his old, familiar environment he can at last, overcome his spiritual crisis. For the first time in African literature, the race issue is here addressed from the point of view of people of colour, the emotional impact emphasised. This problem, however, remains largely in the background, the destruction and preservation of the protagonist representing not a symbolic example of the coloured people's struggle, but rather a more universally human development. The novel shows a far more nuanced characterization than the stereotyping of so many previous writers. \n\nIn 1946 \"As die Son Ondergaan\" was awarded the prize in a nationwide contest of prose writing offered by the magazine \"Kern\" a part of the \"Unie-Volkspers\". Along with PJ Philander he authored school textbooks for geography and history.\n\nHowever, it is his poems that make the greatest contribution to Afrikaans literature. In his work, the brown people, with their varied feelings of resistance and resignation, receive for the first time, their own voice in African literature. His writing style initially draws more on the older poets and their national type of verse, rather than the \"Dertigers\" or \"Viertigers\" (Afrikaans poets of the thirties and forties) with their more personal issues. Many verses in his early collections are impressive in their simplicity and dramatic impact through the use of dialogue. In tone wry and bitter and filled with deep emotion, presented however, in a naturally sober and direct manner. Yet the technique in these poems still largely stems from the generation before the thirties.\n\n\"Die Enkeling\" (The individual) makes its impact more through the authenticity of feeling about the suffering of coloured people, than the quality of the poems, which technically, are not yet truly poetry. It is especially the poignant poem \"Bede\" (Prayer) that revolts against \"the accursed penalty of a dark skin\" and concludes with the speaker praying for the fortitude to accept his fate, should this indeed be God's will. \"Opstand\" (Revolt) describes far more how difficult it is to acquiesce and be silent. In \"Roepende stemme\" (Calling voices) a chorus cries out, questioning how long the oppression will continue, each commentator responding by placing the calls within a greater reality. \"Die arbeider\" (The labourer) is a largely successful portrayal of a human character. A poem like \"Die vreemde\" (The stranger) is typifies the protest and resentment caused by the inferior position coloured people hold within society, while the theme of \"Drinklied\" (Drinking song) speaks of trying to escape reality through alcohol. In a second edition, he omits a number of his more youthful verses - \"Worsteling\", \"Vergewe... Vergeet? \", \"Elegie\" and \"Die winterwind\" - but makes no further changes.\n\n\"Die stil kind\" (The quiet child) evinces considerable artistic progress, with the tone of the poems less harsh. As its title states, the dreaming child is portrayed as a lonely individual, while verses describe with deep emotion the ravaged victims of poverty. \"Riversdal\" shows nine women who wash white people's clothes by the river, with word and rhythm used to great effect. ‘’Voorteken’’ (Pre-ordained) outlines the loneliness of the coloured people, knowing that their life is doomed to heavy labour and unfulfilment. ‘’Motorrit \" (Road trip) expresses the sense of release when the narrator in his car leaves the city behind him, free in the speed of the car and the presence of nature, while \"Rondebosch\" likewise depicts the freedom of nature. \"Die loper\" (The runner) portrays the struggle of the intellectual coloured man, and \"Slotsom\" (Conclusion) concludes that, in death, no difference between the races exists.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, Petersen began publishing again after 1960 with \"Die kinders van Kain\" (The Children of Cain), \"Suiderkruis\" (Southern Cross), \"Nag is verby\" (Night is over) and \"Laat kom dan die wind\" (Late the Wind Then Comes). The finest verses in these collections wittily portray city types, while those of resistance against racial discrimination resound far more powerfully.\n\nThe title \"Die kinders van Kain\" immediately points to those excluded from the rest of society. The collection reflects the progress of his first two books and in depicting the provocation, the melancholy and loneliness of the brown people and can be seen as an important milestone in African poetry. The statement of most of the poems is sober and less desperate, while a larger number a number contain a transcendent purity. Beautiful poems include \"Kinders van Kain\" (where the fate of those kicked out is contrasted with the promise of the New Day); \"Die drumpel\" (The threshold), in which the harsh manner in which coloured people are treated is challenged by an accusation that, as a racial group, they originated from the immoral behaviour of white pioneers; \"Kinderland\" (Childhood), with its melancholy about the utterly lost dreams of childhood; and \"Die veles\" (The many) follows the path of common people through life in rather a witty manner. \"Bergies\" (Mountain dwellers) is also noteworthy, with its witty imagery of this marginalised sector of society, while \"Windermere\" touches the social needs of the people. \"Kaapse naweek\" describes the superficial lifestyle of revellers. \"Die toring Babel\" (The Tower of Babel) makes of discrimination not simply a local but a universal issue, while \"Kamee\" (Cameo) portrays the cheerfulness of the brown woman in the midst of her suffering.\n\n\"Suiderkruis\", in two sections, contains poems about of the memories of a youth in the rural areas. on the one hand and events within the contemporary urban environment on the other. Each section ends with a suite of five poems, \"Ballade\" - a series about the “platteland”, the countryside, and one on the “Confession of the city dweller” showing the contrasts in the feeling of freedom. Memories of country life find expression in poignant poetic memoirs such as \"Tuiskoms\" (Homecoming) and \"Sekelgat\", where former joys are played off against the sadness of remembrance. Well portrayed are also the marginalised of the city, \"Koerante-verkopertjie\" (News vendor) and \"Die doofstomme\" (The deaf-mute).\n\n\"Alleenstryd\" (“Single combat” or “the lonely struggle”) is a label he himself finds appropriate for poetry up to that point. It fits the loneliness and the life struggles to which his poems give voice, characterised in the progression from rural nature verses to the more realistically-oriented poems of city life.\n\n\"Nag is verby\", dedicated to I.D. du Plessis deals with how the question of skin colour can dominate one’s judgements on the value and dignity of the human being, and the search for one’s own identity in trying to find the sense of security that was present in the parental home. . The collection includes poems of resistance, landscape poetry, poems of remembrance and travel, the latter inspired by journeys both at home and abroad. The title reflects a optimistic outlook, a move away from a situation of frustration to one of greater hope and equality, which is also reflected in the content of the poems. The title poem develops a prophetic vision of human freedom. Noteworthy poems are \"Stadsmens\" (City dweller), depicting the hand-to-mouth existence of this group; \"Kaapse Vlak\" (Cape Flats) about the violent death of a young boy; and \"Landelik\" (Rural), beautiful images from this carefree and simple world. There are also several memory verses, the best of them, \"Drie dromertjies\" (Three little drummers), \"Die witborskraai\" (The pied crow) and \"Sekelmaan\" (The sickle moon).\n\nHis last collection\n\"Laat kom dan die wind\", received generally negative criticism. It includes poems of travel, childhood memories, longings for a bygone way of life and images of city personages.\n\nIn 1962 he published in the Netherlands a collection of English verses or aphorisms, \"Meditations on the brink: dedicated with reverence to the life-work of Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven\", based largely on the anthroposophical theories of Rudolf Steiner. It is his only such publication in English, speaks of his meeting with Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven and describes insights he gained through him. This he re-published under his own name in South Africa in 1980.\n\nIn 1967, Dr. W.H. Vos compiled a volume, \"Keurverse\" (Selected poems) from the poetry of Petersen and PJ Philander. His poems are included in several anthologies, including \"Groot verseboek\", \"Die Afrikaanse poësie in ’n duisend en enkele gedigte\", \"Digterstemme\", \"Afrikaanse verse\", \"Uit ons digkuns\", \"Uit ons letterkunde\", \"Digters en digkuns\", \"Die junior digbundel\", \"Woordpaljas\", \"My Afrikaanse verseboek\", \"Die goue vreugde\", \"Voorspraak\" en \"Junior verseboek\", also providing a poem for the collection \"Verse vir Opperman\". He also published poems in magazines such as \"Standpunte\" en \"Tydskrif vir Letterkunde\".\n\nIn 1950 the SABC dedicated an episode of \"Ons skrywers en digters aan die woord\" (Our writers and poets of the word) to his work. The South African Academy for Science and Art in 1959 awarded him a medal of honour for his contribution to Afrikaans culture and he received the Crown Medal for his educational work. In 1977, he was proposed for membership of the South African Academy for Science and Art, but the Academy took so long to come to a decision that seven members resigned in protest. When the Academy finally approached him to become a member, he turned this down due to ill health. In 1982 the State President awarded him the Decoration for Meritorious Service and in 1986 he was elected a member of the Society of Dutch Literature in Leiden in the Netherlands. Shortly after his death, he was declared honorary citizen of his native village Riversdale, together with Alba Bouwer and Dalene Matthee. A radio play about him was compiled by Chris Swanepoel under the title \"Kind van die dal\" (Child of the valley) and broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Afrikaans Service in 1989. The composer Hendrik Hofmeyr set to music two of his poems in 1997, \"Kinderland\" and \"Die veles\" from the volume \"Die kinders van Kain\" and in 2005 further songs set to music by Hofmeyr were sung at the “Woordfees “(Festival of the Word) in Stellenbosch.\n\nPoetry\n\nOther works\n\nNewspapers and Periodicals\nInternet\n\n"}

His father was an employee of Southern Railways during British rule and was one of the surveyors who was responsible for the construction of the Pamban Bridge. His father also worked for Sudeshamitran, a Tamil daily under the editorship of Bharathiyaar.\n\nHe was always interested in journalism, especially handwritten magazines in his school days. In his high school, he started publishing a magazine called Tamil Chudar which was acclaimed by Kalki Krishnamurthy, Rajaji and A.K. Gopal Chettiyar.\n\nHe has travelled extensively to places like Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Paris, Dubai, Rome and places of historical significance in India.\n\nHe worked for a weekly magazine called Velli Mani from 1946–1947, for Tamizh Pannai in 1948. He edited arguably the longest surviving Tamil literary monthly magazine, Amudasurabhi, for over five decades (1951–2003). He started a fortnightly Tamil literary magazine Illakiyapeedam in 1997 and is its editor and publisher.\nHe was also the editor of the following magazines: Kuruvi (children's weekly), Sundari (fortnightly), Mangalam (weekly) and Tamil Arasi (weekly).\n\nVikiraman is known more for his novels, particularly historical novels, than for his short stories. He edited arguably the longest surviving Tamil literary magazine, Amudasurabhi, for well over five decades (1949–2002). He is perhaps the only Tamil writer who has tried his hand in almost every genre, in addition to novel and short story, drama, poetry, travelogue and essay. He has also written stories for children and books on history for the youth in simple Tamil.\n\nHis first historical novel, \"Udayachandran\", appeared in 1957 and he has added 33 more in the four succeeding decades. The most famous of these has been \"Nandipurathu Nayagi\", first serialised in Amudasurabi during 1957–59, and published in book form in 1964. Nandipurathu Nayagi is in fact a sequel to \"Ponniyin Selvan\" of his better-known contemporary and mentor, Kalki Krishnamurthy, whose influence on Vikiraman is quite significant in respect of both historical novels and short stories.\n\nWith more than 150 short stories in 62 years to his credit, Vikiraman continues to write fiction for Ilakkiya Peetam, which he presently edits. Although he has received many accolades including the Kalaimamani title from the Tamil Nadu Government and an award from Tamil University, Thanjavur, for his literary achievements, he has admittedly a grievance that he is known only as a novelist and journalist, and not as a short story writer among the Tamil readers. And hence this collection of his 70 short stories, as he reveals his mind in \"Kathaiyin Kathai\", a sort of preface to the volume. Not an unjust grievance anyway, in this fast-track cultural ambience in which literature is loved more for its entertainment value, forcing the long, time-consuming novel to yield ground to short story as a form of literary expression. Judged from J.B. Priestley's observation that \"at its best, the short story offers us a wonderfully clear little window through which we can see something of the lights and shadows, the heights and depths of life in this world,\" a substantial number of the stories in this collection pass the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
