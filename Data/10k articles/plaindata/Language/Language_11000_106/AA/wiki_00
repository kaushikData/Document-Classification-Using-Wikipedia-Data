{"id": "1352105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1352105", "title": "Assyrian Neo-Aramaic", "text": "Assyrian Neo-Aramaic\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic (, \"sūrët\"), or simply Assyrian, is a Neo-Aramaic language within the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, that is largely spoken by Assyrian people, who are also known as Syriac Christians. The various Assyrian Aramaic dialects, including Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, have been heavily influenced by Classical Syriac, the Middle Aramaic dialect of Edessa, after its adoption as an official liturgical language, and they are ultimately descended from Old Aramaic, the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, displacing the East Semitic Assyrian dialect of Akkadian in around 10th century BC. \n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic is spoken by an estimated 200,000 people who are native to Upper Mesopotamia, which is a large region stretching from the plain of Urmia in northwestern Iran, to the Nineveh plains, and the Irbil, Kirkuk and Duhok regions in northern Iraq, together with the Al Hasakah region of northeastern Syria, and parts of southeastern Turkey. Instability throughout the Middle East over the past century has led to a worldwide diaspora of Assyrian speakers, with many speakers now living abroad, such as in North America, Australia and Europe. Speakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Turoyo are ethnic Assyrians and are descendants of the ancient Assyrian inhabitants of Northern Mesopotamia.\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic is one of the largest Neo-Aramaic languages (232,000 speakers), with Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (213,000 speakers) and Turoyo (250,000 speakers) making up most of the remaining Neo-Aramaic speakers. Despite the terms \"Chaldean Neo-Aramaic\" and \"Assyrian Neo-Aramaic\" indicating a separate ethnic identity, both the languages and their native speakers originate from the same Upper Mesopotamian region (which was Assyria).\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic is, to a significant degree, mutually intelligible with Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and they are sometimes considered to constitute dialects of the same language rather than two separate languages. To a moderate degree, Assyrian is also intelligible with Senaya, Lishana Deni and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic (which are, at times, also considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic), and is partially intelligible with Lishan Didan, Hulaulá and Lishanid Noshan. Its mutual intelligibility with Turoyo, a Central Neo-Aramaic language, is rather limited.\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic is a moderately inflected, fusional language with a two-gender noun system and a rather flexible word order. There is some Akkadian vocabulary and influence in the language. Due to its location and cultural influences, the speakers may use Iranian, English and Arabic loanwords, depending on where they live or where their family came from. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is written from right to left, and it uses the \"Madnhāyā\" version of the Syriac alphabet. Assyrian, alongside other modern Aramaic languages, is now considered endangered.\n\nAramaic was the language of commerce, trade and communication and became the vernacular language of Assyria in the late Iron Age and classical antiquity. It became the lingua franca of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC), Neo-Babylonian Empire (605–539 BC), the Achaemenid Empire (539–323 BC), the Parthian Empire (247 BC–224 AD), and the Sasanian Empire (224–651 AD). Aramaic writing has been found as far north as Hadrians Wall in Ancient Britain, in the form of inscriptions in Aramaic, made by Assyrian and Aramean soldiers serving in the Roman Legions in northern England during the 2ndcentury AD.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire resorted to a policy of deporting troublesome conquered peoples (predominantly fellow Semitic Aramean tribes as well as many Jews) into the lands of Mesopotamia. By the 6thcentury, the indigenous and originally Akkadian-speaking Semites of Assyria and Babylonia, spoke Akkadian-infused dialects of Eastern Aramaic. Consequently, during the Persian rule of Assyria, Aramaic gradually became the main language spoken by the Assyrians.\nEven before the Empire fell, the Assyrians had made Aramaic the\" lingua franca\" of its empire, and were capable of speaking both Akkadian and Aramaic.\n\nLocal unwritten Aramaic dialects emerged from Imperial Aramaic in Assyria–northern Mesopotamia, an Akkadian-influenced version of the Old Aramaic language which was introduced as the lingua franca of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727BC) The first evidence of such dialects emerged in Assyria, and begin to influence the written Imperial Aramaic from the 5th century BC. Following the Achaemenid conquest of Assyria under Darius I, the Aramaic language was adopted as the \"vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages\". After the conquest of Assyria by the Seleucid Empire in the late 4th century BC, Imperial Aramaic and other Aramaic dialects gradually lost their status as imperial languages but continued to flourish as lingua francas alongside Ancient Greek.\n\nBy the 1st century AD, Akkadian was extinct, although some loaned vocabulary and grammatical features still survives in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and other Assyrian languages to this day. The Neo-Aramaic languages evolved from Middle Aramaic by the 13th century. There is evidence that the adoption of Syriac, was led by missionaries. Much literary effort was put into the production of an authoritative translation of the Bible into Syriac, the Peshitta ( \"\"). At the same time, Ephrem the Syrian was producing the most treasured collection of poetry and theology in the Syriac language. \n\nBy the 3rd century AD, churches in Edessa in the Neo-Assyrian kingdom of Osroene began to use Syriac as the language of worship and the language became the literary and liturgical language of many churches in the Fertile Crescent. Syriac was the lingua franca of the Middle East until 900 AD, when it was superseded by Arabic.The differences with the Assyrian Church of the East led to the bitter Nestorian schism in the Syriac-speaking world. As a result, Syriac developed distinctive western and eastern varieties. Although remaining a single language with a high level of comprehension between the varieties, the two employ distinctive variations in pronunciation and writing system, and, to a lesser degree, in vocabulary.\n\nThe Mongol invasions of the 13th century, and the religiously motivated massacres of Assyrians by Tamurlane further contributed to the rapid decline of the language. In many places outside of northern Mesopotamia (the Assyrian homeland), even in liturgy, it was replaced by Arabic.\n\nThe original Mesopotamian writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC, the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers.\n\nAround 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken Sumerian, a language isolate. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the East Semitic Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) around 2600 BC. With the adoption of Aramaic as the 'lingua franca' of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.\n\nThe Syriac script is a writing system primarily used to write the Syriac language from the 1st century AD. It is one of the Semitic abjads directly descending from the Aramaic alphabet and shares similarities with the Phoenician, Hebrew, Arabic, and the traditional Mongolian alphabets. The alphabet consists of 22 letters, all of which are consonants. It is a cursive script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word.\n\nThe oldest and classical form of the alphabet is \"\" (); the name is thought to derive from the Greek adjective (\"strongylē\", 'rounded'), Although ʾEsṭrangēlā is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has undergone some revival since the 10th century.\n\nWhen Arabic gradually began to be the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent after the 7th century AD, texts were often written in Arabic with the Syriac script. Malayalam was also written with Syriac script and was called Suriyani Malayalam.\n\nThe \"Madnhāyā\", or eastern, version formed as a form of shorthand developed from the Syriac alphabet and progressed further as handwriting patterns changed. The \"Madnhāyā\" version also possesses vowel markings to help foreigners learn and read Syriac. Other names for the script include \"\", \"conversational\", often translated as \"contemporary\", reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic.\n\nThree letters act as matres lectionis: rather than being a consonant, they indicate a vowel. \"ʾĀlap̄\" (), the first letter, represents a glottal stop, but it can also indicate a vowel at the beginning or the end of a word. The letter \"Waw\" () is the consonant \"w\", but can also represent the vowels \"o\" and \"u\". Likewise, the letter \" represents the consonant \"y\", but it also stands for the vowels \"i\" and \"e\". In addition to foreign sounds, a marking system is used to distinguish ', 'hard' letters) from ', 'soft' letters). The letters \"Bēṯ\", \"Gāmal\", \"Dālaṯ\", \"Kāp̄\", \"Pē\", and \"Taw\", all plosives ('hard'), are able to be spirantized into fricatives ('soft').\n\nThe system involves placing a single dot underneath the letter to give its 'soft' variant and a dot above the letter to give its 'hard' variant (though, in modern usage, no mark at all is usually used to indicate the 'hard' value). Furthermore, the script has 22 consonants and 3 vowels.\n\nIn the 1930s, following the state policy for minority languages of the Soviet Union, a Latin alphabet was developed and some material published. Despite the fact that this innovation did not displace the Syriac script, the usage of the Latin script in the Assyrian community has become rather widespread due to the Assyrian diaspora's settlement mostly being in Europe and the anglophone, where the Latin script dominates. The Latin alphabet is preferred by most Assyrians for practical reasons and its convenience, especially in social media, where it is used to communicate. Although the Syriac Latin alphabet contains diacritics, most Assyrians rarely utilize the modified letters and would conveniently rely on the basic Latin alphabet. The Latin alphabet is also a useful tool to present Assyrian terminology to anyone who is not familiar with the Syriac script. A precise transcription may not be necessary for native Assyrian speakers, as they would be able to pronounce words correctly, but it can be very helpful for those not quite familiar with Syriac and more informed with the Latin script. \n\n\nVowel phonemes of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (\"Standard Urmian/Iraqi Koine\") are as follows:\n\nTwo basic diphthongs exist, namely and . For some words, many dialects have converted them to \"e\" and \"o\" respectively. When it comes to plurals, a commonly used vowel alteration in Assyrian is shifting the \"ɑ\" sound to \"e\", so \"ṭĕrā ('bird') will be \"ṭĕrĕ ('birds') in its plural form. This morphology is called an apophony and it is exemplified in English as the internal vowel alternations that produce such related words as \"foot\" and \"feet\".\n\nIraqi Koine is a standard Assyrian dialect which emerged in the mid-20th century, being influenced by both Urmian and Hakkari dialects.\n\nAssyrian is a nominative-accusative, null-subject language with an inflecting morphology, and it features a pronoun drop to a significant degree. Like English and modern Hebrew, Assyrian largely lacks grammatical cases. The Semitic genitive, which a noun is possessed or modified by another noun or noun phrase, is expressed morphologically by the genitive morpheme \"-i\" (\"bĕtī\" — 'my house'), indicating possession.\n\nWord stress bears a strong relationship to vowel length. A final vowel, long or short, may not be stressed, though one of the last three syllables may be stressed. As such, the last heavy syllable (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed. Gemination occurs in the language, as heard in words like \"lebbaa\" (\"heart\") and \"shmayya\" (\"sky\").\n\nAlthough subject–verb–object (SVO) is the default sentence structure of Syriac, subject–object–verb (SOV), verb–subject–object (VSO), verb–object–subject (VOS), object–verb–subject (OVS) and object–subject–verb (OSV) are also commonly used word orders in modern Assyrian, thus making Assyrian Neo-Aramaic a flexible language, akin to Latin and Greek.\n\nAssyrian has an extensive number of Iranian loanwords (namely Persian and Kurdish) incorporated in its vocabulary and grammar, as well as some Arabic and English loanwords. That is because of its close geographical proximity to those languages. As a central Semitic language, Assyrian is closely related to Hebrew, Arabic, Mandaic, Western Neo-Aramaic and Mandean, and would bear similar grammar style to these languages.\n\nIn Assyrian, personal pronouns have 7 forms. In singular forms, the 3rd have separate masculine and feminine forms, while the 1st and 2nd person do not. The 3rd person plural form also lacks a gender.\n\nLike all Semitic languages and the unrelated Insular Celtic languages, Assyrian uses inflected preposition when it comes to personal pronouns – The preposition \"al\" (\"on\") inflects as \"ali\" (\"on me\").\n\nNouns carry grammatical gender (masculine or feminine). They can be either singular or plural in number (a very few can be dual) and can exist in one of three grammatical states (somewhat akin to case in Indo-European languages). The states should not be confused with grammatical cases in other languages. Adjectives always agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify. Adjectives are in the absolute state if they are predicative but agree with the state of their noun if attributive.\n\nIn Syriac languages, most genitive noun relationships are built using the construct state, but contrary to the genitive case, it is the head-noun which is marked by the construct state. Thus, ', means \"the taxes of the kingdom\". Quickly, the construct relationship was abandoned and replaced by the use of the relative particle '. Thus, the same noun phrase becomes \"šeqlē d-malkūṯā\", where both nouns are in the emphatic state. Very closely related nouns can be drawn into a closer grammatical relationship by the addition of a pronominal suffix. Thus, the phrase can be written as \"\". In this case, both nouns continue to be in the emphatic state, but the first has the suffix that makes it literally read \"her taxes\" (\"kingdom\" is feminine), and thus is \"her taxes, [those] of the kingdom\".\n\nFinite verbs carry person, grammatical gender (except in the first person) and number, as well as tense and conjugation. The non-finite verb forms are the infinitive and the active and passive participles. The emphatic state became the ordinary form of the noun, and the absolute and construct states were relegated to certain stock phrases (for example, bar nāšā, \"man, person\", literally \"son of man\"). Verb forms are marked for person (first, second or third), number (singular or plural), gender (masculine or feminine), tense (perfect or imperfect), mood (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and voice (active, reflexive or passive).\n\nAssyrian employs a system of conjugations to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.\nVerb conjugations are present in other Semitic languages. These are regular modifications of the verb's root to express other changes in meaning. The first conjugation is the ground state, which models the shape of the root and carries the usual meaning of the word. The next is the intensive state form of the verb, which usually carries an intensified meaning. The third is the extensive state form of the verb, which is often causative in meaning. Each of these conjugations has its parallel passive conjugation. The particle \"-wa\" may be affixed to verbal forms derived from the present and past bases.\n\nAssyrian may also feature double negatives, such as in sentences like \"leh yawin la zoozeh\" (\"I won't give no money\").\n\nAssyrian uses verbal inflections marking person and number. The suffix \"-i\" indicates \"my\" or \"me\" and the suffix \"-eh\" indicates a plural (i.e. \"warda\" or \"flower\" becomes \"wardeh\"). Enclitic forms of personal pronouns are affixed to various parts of speech. As with object pronoun, all possessive pronouns are suffixes that are attached to the end of nouns to express possession similar to the English pronouns \"my, your, his, her,\" etc., which reflects the gender and plurality of the person or persons. This is a synthetic feature found in other Semitic languages, and also in unrelated languages such as Finnish (Uralic), Persian (Indo-European) and Turkish (Turkic), to name a few. Moreover, unlike many other languages, Assyrian has virtually no means of deriving words by adding prefixes or suffixes to words. Instead, they are formed according to a limited number of templates applied to roots.\n\nAlthough possessive suffixes are more convenient and common, they can be optional for some people and seldom used, especially among those with the Tyari and Barwari dialects, which take a more analytic approach regarding possession, just like modern Hebrew and English. The following are periphrastic ways to express possession, using the word \"bĕtā\" (\"house\") as a base:\n\n\nMost Assyrian Neo-Aramaic nouns and verbs are built from triliteral roots, which are a form of word formation in which the root is modified and which does not involve stringing morphemes together sequentially. Broken plurals are formed by changing the pattern of consonants and vowels inside the singular form. Semitic languages typically utilize triconsonantal roots, forming a \"grid\" into which vowels may be inserted without affecting the basic root.\n\nThe root , \"\", has the basic meaning of \"taking\", and the following are some words that can be formed from this root:\n\nWhen it comes to a determinative (like in English \"this\", \"a\", \"the\", \"few\", \"any\", \"which\", etc.) modern Assyrian generally has an absence of an article (English \"the\"), unlike its sister language Arabic which use a definite article (such as \"al-\"). Demonstratives (\"aha\" and \"aya\"/\"awa\", translating to \"this\" and \"that\", respectively) are commonly utilized instead (i.e. \"aha beta\", which means \"this house\"), which can have the sense of \"the\". An indefinite article (\"an\" or \"a\") can mark definiteness if the word is a direct object (but not a subject) by using the suffix \"l-\" (e.g. \"shaqil qalama\", meaning \"he takes a/the pen\"). Partitive articles may be used in some speech (\"bayeetoon khacha miya?\", which translates to \"do you want some water?\").\n\nFurthermore, Ancient Aramaic had a definite article in the form of a suffix: \"\"-aa\" for masculine words and \"-t(h)aa\"\" (if the word already ends in -aa) for feminine. The definite forms were \"palaaxaa\" for \"the (male) worker\" and \"palaxtaa\" for \"the (female) worker\". Over time, the definite form of the word became dominant and the definite sense of the word merged with the indefinite sense so that \"palaaxa\" became \"a/the (male) worker\" and \"palaxtaa\" became \"a/the (female) worker.\"\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic, like its parent language Syriac, has only two true morphological tenses: perfect and imperfect. Whereas these tenses were originally aspectual in Aramaic, they have become a truly temporal past and future tenses respectively. \n\nThe present tense is usually marked with the participle followed by the subject pronoun. However, such pronouns are usually omitted in the case of the third person. This use of the participle to mark the present tense is the most common of a number of \"compound\" tenses that can be used to express varying senses of tense and aspect.\n\nSIL Ethnologue distinguishes five dialect groups: \"Urmian, Northern, Central, Western\", and \"Sapna\", each with sub-dialects. Mutual intelligibility between the Assyrian dialects is as high as 80%–90%.\n\nThe Urmia dialect has become the prestige dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic after 1836, when that dialect was chosen by Justin Perkins, an American Presbyterian missionary, for the creation of a standard literary dialect of Assyrian. A second standard dialect derived from \"General Urmian\" known as \"Iraqi Koine\", developed in the 20th century.\n\nIn 1852, Perkins' translation of the Bible into General Urmian was published by the American Bible Society with a parallel text of the classical Syriac Peshitta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Iraqi Koine\", also known as \"Refined Urmian\" and \"Standard Assyrian\", is a compromise between the thicker rural accents of Hakkari and Nineveh Plains (listed above), and the former prestigious dialect in Urmia. \"Iraqi Koine\" does not really constitute a new dialect, but an incomplete merger of dialects. \"Koine\" is more analogous to Urmian in terms of manner of articulation, place of articulation and its consonant cluster formations, though it just lacks the regional Farsi influence in some consonants and vowels.\n\nDuring the First World War, many Assyrians living in Ottoman Turkey were forced from their homes, and many of their descendants now live in Iraq. The relocation has led to the creation of this dialect. \"Iraqi Koine\" was developed in the urban areas of Iraq (i.e. Baghdad, Basra, Habbaniya and Kirkuk), which became the meccas for the rural Assyrian population. By the end of the 1950s vast number of Assyrians started to speak \"Iraqi Koine\". Today, \"Iraqi Koine\" is the predominant use of communication between the majority of the Assyrians and it is also used as the standard dialect in music and formal speech.\n\nTo note, the emergence of the \"Koine\" didn't mean that the rest of the spoken dialects vanished. The \"Ashiret\" dialects were still active because some Assyrians remained in the rural areas and the fact that the first generation speakers who relocated in urban areas still maintained their native dialects. Elements of original \"Ashiret\" dialects can still be observed in \"Iraqi Koine\", especially in that of older speakers.\n\nAssyrian Neo-Aramaic has a rather slightly defined dialect continuum, starting from the Assyrian tribes in northern Iraq (i.e. Alqosh, Batnaya) and ending in Western Iran (Urmia). The dialects in Northern Iraq, such as those of \"Alqosh\" and \"Batnaya\", would be minimally unintelligible to those in Western Iran.\n\nThe dialects in Northern Iraq have a distinct phonetic system (such as the realization of /ħ/) and, as such, would be considered part of Chaldean Neo-Aramaic. Nearing the Iraqi-Turkey border, the Barwari and Tyari dialects are more \"traditionally Assyrian\" and would sound like those in the Hakkari province in Turkey. Furthermore, the Barwar and Tyari dialects are \"transitional\", acquiring both Assyrian and Chaldean phonetic features (though they don't use /ħ/). Gawar, Diz and Jilu are in the \"centre\" of the spectrum, which lie halfway between Tyari and Urmia, having features of both respective dialects, though still being distinct in their own manner.\n\nIn Hakkari, going east (towards Iran), the Nochiya dialect would begin to sound distinct to the Tyari/Barwar dialects and more like the Urmian dialect in Urmia, Western Azerbaijan, containing a few Urmian features. The Urmian dialect, alongside \"Iraqi Koine\", are considered to be \"Standard Assyrian\". Though \"Iraqi Koine\" is more widespread and had thus become the more common standard dialect in recent times. Both Koine and Urmian share phonetic characteristics with the Nochiya dialect to some degree.\n\n\n\n"}

It was devised by Chief Viraleo Boborenvanua over a 14-year period, based on designs found in traditional sand drawings, and intended as a native alternative to the Latin alphabet. It is used mainly for writing in the area's native Raga language, although it can also be used for other languages including Apma, Bislama and English.\n\nThe Avoiuli alphabet comprises characters equivalent to the letters A-Z, decimal numerals and other symbols, including a range of currency symbols representing the livatu and specific items of traditional value such as pigs and dyed mats. Like the Western orthography used to write Raga language, it represents the velar nasal \"ng\" and prenasalised consonant \"ngg\" using modified forms of the letters \"n\" and \"g\" respectively, but represents the labiovelar consonants \"bw\", \"mw\" and \"vw\" using digraphs. Although in some respects it is a relatively straightforward imitation of the Latin alphabet, Avoiuli has a few distinctive features. \n\nLike the sand drawings on which it is based, Avoiuli words are designed to be formed in a single stroke. The script can be written either left-to-right or right-to-left (with the letter shapes reversed, though the majority are symmetrical anyway). A few texts in Avoiuli are in boustrophedon style, with alternating lines of left-to-right and right-to-left writing.\n\nCapital letters in Avoiuli are similar to lowercase but are enlarged and drawn around a + shaped 'frame', a feature also seen in traditional sand drawings. Capital letters are not used much in everyday writing.\n\nScholars learn to write in Avoiuli at Turaga's traditional school at Lavatmanggemu in north-eastern Pentecost, and at affiliated 'custom schools', paying substantial school fees for the privilege. Avoiuli is also used in record-keeping by the Tangbunia indigenous bank.\n"}

{"id": "1058899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058899", "title": "Binary opposition", "text": "Binary opposition\n\nA nebular opposition (also binary system) is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary opposition is the system by which language and thought, two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another. It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right. Binary opposition is an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought. In structuralism, a binary opposition is seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.\n\nBinary opposition originated in Saussurean structuralist theory. According to Ferdinand de Saussure, the binary opposition is the means by which the units of language have value or meaning; each unit is defined in reciprocal determination with another term, as in binary code. It is not a contradictory relation but a structural, complementary one. Saussure demonstrated that a sign's meaning is derived from its context (syntagmatic dimension) and the group (paradigm) to which it belongs. An example of this is that one cannot conceive of 'good' if we do not understand 'evil'.\n\nTypically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is \"often value-laden and ethnocentric\", with an illusory order and superficial meaning. Furthermore, Pieter Fourie discovered that binary oppositions have a deeper or second level of binaries that help to reinforce meaning. As an example, the concepts \"hero\" and \"villain\" involve secondary binaries: good/bad, handsome/ugly, liked/disliked, and so on.\n\nA classic example of a binary opposition is the presence-absence dichotomy. In much of Western thought, including structuralism, distinguishing between presence and absence, viewed as polar opposites, is a fundamental element of thought in many cultures. In addition, according to post-structuralist criticisms, \"presence\" occupies a position of dominance in Western thought over \"absence\", because \"absence\" is traditionally seen as what you get when you take away \"presence\". (Had \"absence\" been dominant, \"presence\" might have most naturally been seen as what you get when you take away an \"absence\".) \n\nAccording to Nasser Maleki, there is another example of this phenomenon whereby people value one part of a binary opposition over another; “we, as living in a certain culture, think and act similarly in situations when we want to pick out one of the concepts in the binary oppositions or while seeking truth or a center. For example, we give superiority to life rather than death.” This suggests that the cultural setting a reader is a part of may influence their interpretation of a work of literature; “only one concept, from the binary opposition, is ready, in our mind, to be privileged and the other one is usually put aside as having the second priority.” He reached this conclusion by giving a name to the shared western unconsciousness for a preferred binary concept - logocentrism. This is the belief that “an ultimate reality or centre of truth exists and that can serve as the basis for all our thought and actions. This might imply that readers might unconsciously take side with one concept of binary opposition, and Derrida traces this reaction as a cultural phenomenon.” \n\nAccording to Jacques Derrida, meaning in the West is defined in terms of binary oppositions, “a violent hierarchy” where “one of the two terms governs the other.” Within the white/ black binary opposition in the United States, the African American is defined as a devalued other.\n\nAn example of a binary opposition is the male-female dichotomy. A post-structuralist view is that \"male\" can be seen, according to traditional Western thought, as dominant over \"female\" because \"male\" is the presence of a phallus, while the vagina is an absence or loss. John Searle has suggested that the concept of binary oppositions—as taught and practiced by postmodernists and poststructuralist—is specious and lacking in rigor.\n\nThe political (rather than analytic or conceptual) critique of binary oppositions is an important part of third wave feminism, post-colonialism, post-anarchism, and critical race theory, which argue that the perceived binary dichotomy between man/woman, civilized/uncivilised, and white/black have perpetuated and legitimized Western power structures favoring \"civilized white men.\" In the last fifteen years it has become routine for many social and/or historical analyses to address the variables of gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity. Within each of these categories there is usually an unequal binary opposition: bourgeoisie/working class man; white/people of colour; men/women; heterosexual/homosexual.\n\nPost-structural criticism of binary oppositions is not simply the reversal of the opposition, but its deconstruction, which is described as apolitical—that is, not intrinsically favoring one arm of a binary opposition over the other. Deconstruction is the \"event\" or \"moment\" at which a binary opposition is thought to contradict itself, and undermine its own authority.\n\nDeconstruction assumes that all binary oppositions need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations; the function of both logical and axiological oppositions must be studied in all discourses that provide meaning and values. But deconstruction does not only expose how oppositions work and how meaning and values are produced in a nihilistic or cynic position, \"thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively\". To be effective, and simply as its mode of practice, deconstruction creates new notions or concepts, not to synthesize the terms in opposition but to mark their difference, undecidability, and eternal interplay.\n\nLogocentrism is an idea related to binary opposition that suggests certain audiences will favour one part of a binary opposition pair over the other. This favouritism is often most strongly influenced by a readers' cultural background. The strong patriarchal themes in 'The Women and the Pot', an Amharic folktale, would be one such example of logocentrism. This tells the story of two women who are upset at their diminished role in society, and who consequently go to their King for help. He effectively conveys the message that women cannot be relied upon to take on a greater role in society, which becomes the moral of the tale. Prasad explains this idea; “The logocentric value is seen through the 'Eternal Knowledge' – the naturalness of male superiority – that is conveyed through the folktale. The hidden a priori binary opposition is 'Man over Woman'.” In relation to the cultural heritage of an audience having an influence on their unconscious preference for one part of a binary opposition, Prasad says; “By way of studying a selection of Ethiopian folktales, the paper uncovers the presence of logocentrism and a priori binary opposition being at work in Ethiopian folktales. These two elements attempt to endorse and validate the 'given' subservient position of women in society”.\n\nBinary opposition is deeply embedded within literature as language, and paired opposites, rely upon a relation with adjoining words inside a paradigmatic chain. If one of the paired opposites were removed the other’s precise meaning would be altered. In addition, binary opposition was explored in children’s literature and it was found that authors were reinforcing Westernized images and philosophies of feminism via the binary hierarchy. Western authors were creating a representation of non-Western countries based on colonial discourse, using binary oppositions to categorize human behaviour into one term or another – not both. The non-Western woman, therefore, was “the opposite or ‘other’ to women and girls from the West”.\n\n"}

Proceeds from the event are donated to The Alzheimer's Association. Games have been held in more than 40 cities and have cumulatively raised more than $5 Million for the care, support and research efforts of the Association.\n\nThe annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative Joseph Hugh Allen, died of Alzheimer's disease in 2008. Looking for a way to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powder puff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan. Abbott, who was residing in Washington D.C. at the time, believed that too many charitable organizations were raising money through formal black tie events. Along with her sister, she thought a powder puff football game that leveraged popular culture's blonde vs. brunette rivalry would be more appealing to a younger set of donors. She thought the $20 ticket price would provide a low cost way for attendees to support a good cause.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, the first blonde vs. brunette powder puff football game was played at Hains Point in Washington D.C. and raised $10,000. Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington D.C area before settling in at George Washington University’s Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009. Since its inception, the game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in the Washington Post and has raised over $500,000 in the Washington, D.C. alone.\n\nBy 2012, Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Football was being played in cities across the United States and each city has a slightly different approach to the game. “In Washington, the rivalry is intense. If friends are on opposite teams, they usually don't talk the weekend of the games,\" Abbott shared. Cities that host the game include: Albany, Amarillo, Akron, Atlanta, Austin, Bakersfield, CA, Baton Rouge, Boston, Buffalo, Charlotte, Burlington, IA, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbia, SC, Columbus,Denver, Evansville, Houston, Hudson Valley (New Rochelle, NY), Indianapolis, Jackson, Kansas City, Lexington, Los Angeles Louisville, Lubbock, TX, Madison, WI, Minneapolis, New York, North Alabama (Decatur, AL), Phoenix, Plainview, TX, Raleigh, North Carolina, San Diego, Santa Barbara, CA, San Francisco. Tallahassee, FL, Washington, D.C. and Wichita, KS\n\nAbbott has received national publicity and multiple awards for her efforts in raising funds for the Alzheimer’s Association. She plans to expand the event to more cities and eventually establish a \"Blondes vs. Brunettes Super Bowl\".\n\nThe game's increasing popularity in the Dallas-Fort Worth area resulted in the 2012 game moving to the Cotton Bowl to accommodate the larger crowds.\n\nGame rules do not require that hair colour be natural and it is common for many of the girls on the blonde team to have dyed hair.\n\nAn NBC Washington story cited participants changing their hair color in the weeks before the game and switching sides. Other media stories have highlighted intense workouts, team meetings that feature inspirational movies such as \"Remember the Titans\", and participants practicing their trash-talking to include brunettes trying to think up ways to intimidate their blonde opponents.\n\n"}

He completed his schooling in Johannesburg, after which he enrolled for a Bachelor's degree at the University of Witwatersrand. Roodt has six degrees, including a Ph.D. from the University of the Witwatersrand in Afrikaans, obtained with a thesis on the works of in 1994.\n\nRoodt lectured at the University of Durban-Westville for a while, and in 1985 left South Africa for France to avoid conscription in the South African Defence Force.\n\nTimes LIVE said that in the 1980s, Roodt was an anti-establishment anarchist, but that now \"he is branded a right-wing reactionary\" for his \"vehement anti-ANC essays\". Two of his literary works had been banned by the South African government in 1980, a time of strict censorship.\n\nAfter returning to South Africa in 1992, Roodt worked for Citibank until 1999, and in 2000 he co-founded PRAAG (Pro-Afrikaanse Aksiegroep, or Pro-Afrikaans Action Group), which describes itself as an extra-parliamentary movement devoted to the rights of Afrikaners. PRAAG also has a publishing division, which has published some of his recent works. Roodt has contributed articles to Focus, the journal of the liberal Helen Suzman Foundation, columns to \"American Renaissance\", a white nationalist magazine, various scientific or academic journals in South Africa as well as a host of articles in South African newspapers. He has also appeared on television and radio talk shows in South Africa.\n\nIn May 2011 Roodt stood for the Freedom Front Plus during the municipal elections as a candidate in Johannesburg, but was not elected.\n\nRoodt is the deputy leader and spokesperson of South African right-wing political party Front Nasionaal formed in late 2013 which promotes separatism and Afrikaner self-determination. The Sunday newspaper Rapport reported on 8 February 2015 that Roodt had been \"voted out of the party\" without him being aware of it. He was quoted in the article as saying that \"he would henceforth be devoting his energy to his publishing company, Praag... I am disillusioned with Afrikaner politics. I am finished with Afrikaner politics.\"\n\nRoodt has strong views on the preservation of Afrikaans and Afrikaner culture, which has led to some controversy in the South African media. He maintains a blog and the PRAAG website, commenting on issues in South Africa. Roodt also regularly writes letters regarding political matters to various South African newspapers and the literary e-zine LitNet.\n\nRoodt caused a controversy after creating an internet site about South African journalist, writer and activist Max du Preez. Roodt explained that he had set up the site 'so that everyone who has always wanted to say something about \"this idiot and prat\", but did not have the means, now has the opportunity'. When contacted by Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Rapport for comment, Du Preez replied that 'it only confirms what I suspected: That Dan has a homo-erotic fixation with me'. In May 2011, the domain name in question was seized by the regulator of South African web domain names, and given to Du Preez. A judge ruled that Roodt had misused Du Preez's name as part of a slanderous campaign against the latter. The website has since been offline.\n\nIn March 2010 Roodt advised Afrikaners to support the football team of the Netherlands instead of the South African team in the FIFA World Cup, hosted by South Africa in June and July 2010.\n\nIn May 2010 Roodt travelled to Europe where he met with members of the Swedish Resistant Movement (Swedish: Svenska Motståndsrörelsen) a Scandinavian group which describes itself as a National Socialist organisation.\n\nRoodt was the subject of a report for \"The Daily Show\" entitled \"The Amazing Racists\" by comedian John Oliver in June 2010 in which Roodt made a number of prejudiced statements about black South Africans. This led Oliver to satirically declare Roodt's views as representing “some of the finest examples of vintage bigotry.” Roodt stated that producers of the show had edited the interview to portray him in a negative light and threatened to sue the show. The South African Afrikaans civil rights organisation AfriForum publicly criticised Roodts statements as racist.\n\nIn 2012, the Press Ombudsman ordered the weekly tabloid \"Sondag\" to publish a front page apology to Roodt for publishing a defamatory article about him.\n\nRoodt's first novel, \"Sonneskyn en Chevrolet\" (Taurus, 1980), is an anti-establishment commentary on South African society (and specifically Afrikaner society) of that time. His only published volume of poetry to date, \"Kommas uit 'n boomzol\" (Uitgewery Pannevis, 1980), structurally parodies \"Komas uit 'n bamboesstok\" (Human & Rousseau, 1979), a volume of poetry by the Afrikaans poet D.J. Opperman. Afrikaans literary critic John Kannemeyer asserts that there is 'no one poem of any intrinsic value' in \"Kommas uit 'n boomzol\", and similarly views Roodt's subsequent prose work \"Twee sinne\" (Taurus, 1985).\n\nRoodt's first publication after \"Twee sinne\" is a critical essay on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) entitled \"Om die Waarheidskommissie te vergeet\" ('Forgetting the Truth Commission', 2001). This would be PRAAG's first publication of one of Roodt's works. In 2004, PRAAG published the novel \"Moltrein\", which is about a promising musician who leaves South Africa during the 1980s to avoid military service in the South African Defence Force.\n\nIn 2005 Roodt released \"The Scourge of the ANC\" (PRAAG), a critique of the ANC, and also of the former South African government under leadership of FW de Klerk. The following year, \"Aweregs\" (PRAAG, 2006), another collection of political essays, was released. Regarding \"Aweregs\", Venter notes that if the ultimate aim of the book is\nto demonstrate the author's pessimism regarding Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), \"the new\" South Africa, and supporters of the idea that Afrikaans can only survive by developing multilingualism in South Africa, then Roodt's vision succeeds. But it is a limited and distressing vision.\nIn 2015, Roodt published an essay \"Raiders of the Lost Empire: South Africa's English Identity\" (PRAAG) in which he \"explores the country's 'new' English identity which is founded on the old colonial identity of the nineteenth century when the redcoats invaded the Cape of Good Hope.\"\n\nRoodt currently lives with his wife, Karin (née Bredenkamp), and their three children in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\n"}

At the same time he began worshiping this portrait and considered Nigamananda as his spiritual master and revered God. He began to search Nigamananda and finally met him in Nilachala Kutir Puri on 20 March 1930, Thursday. At that time he was only seventeen years old and a student of class IX in Puri district School. On first meeting he was overwhelmed by his appearance and realised Nigamananda as Ishwar. Since that day, he became a regular visitor to Nilachala Kutir for his darshan. He used to note down guru Nigamananda's sayings(upadesh), later he published these \"upadesh\"(gospels)in books like Nilachala Vani and Nigama Upadesh. Subsequently, he wrote many books for Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and translated Nigamananda's originally written Bengali books, ବ୍ରହ୍ମଚର୍ୟ ସାଧନା(Brahamcharya Sadhana), ଯୋଗୀଗୁରୁ(Yogi Guru), ଜ୍ଞାନୀ ଗୁରୁ(Gyani Guru), ତାନ୍ତ୍ରିକ ଗୁରୁ(Tantrika Guru), and ପ୍ରେମିକଗୁରୁ(Premika Guru), into Odia language.

The terms can also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio through zoning.\n\nAs a formula FAR = (gross floor area) / (area of the plot)\n\nFloor Area ratio is sometimes called floor space ratio (FSR), floor space index (FSI), site ratio or plot ratio\n\nThe difference between FAR and FSI is that the first is a ratio, while the latter is an index.\nIndex numbers are values expressed as a percentage of a single base figure. Thus an FAR of 1.5 is translated as an FSI of 150%.\n\nThe terms most commonly used for this measurement vary from one country or region to the next.\n\nIn Australia \"floor space ratio\" (FSR) is used in New South Wales and \"plot ratio\" in Western Australia.\n\nIn India \"floor space index\" (FSI) and \"floor area ratio\" (FAR) are both used.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Hong Kong both \"plot ratio\" and \"site ratio\" are used.\n\nIn Singapore the terms \"plot ratio\" add \"gross plot ratio\" (GPR) are more commonly used.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"floor space ratio\" (FSR) and \"floor area ratio\" (FAR) are both used.\n\nUse ratios are used as a measure of the density of the site being developed. The ratio is generated by dividing the building area by the parcel area, using the same units.\n\nOne of the purposes of the 1916 zoning ordinance of New York City was to prevent tall buildings from obstructing too much light and air. The 1916 zoning ordinance sought to control building size by regulating height and setback requirements for towers. In 1961, a revision to the zoning ordinance introduced the concept of floor area ratio (FAR). Buildings built before 1961 often have FARs that would be unachievable today, such as the Empire State Building which has an FAR of 25 - meaning that it earns considerably greater rent than a newer building on the same land could hope for.\n\nThe floor area ratio (FAR) can be used in zoning to limit urban density. While it directly limits building density, indirectly it also limits the number of people that a building can hold, without controlling a building's external shape.\n\nFor example, if lot must adhere to a 0.1 FAR, then the total area of all floors in all buildings on the lot must be no more than one-tenth the area of the parcel itself. In other words, if the lot was 10,000 sq. ft, then the total floor area of all floors in all buildings mustn't exceed 1,000 sq. ft.\n\nAn architect can plan for either a single-story building consuming the entire allowable area in one floor, or a multi-story building that rises higher above the plane of the land, but which must consequently result in a smaller footprint than would a single-story building of the same total floor area. By combining the horizontal and vertical limits into a single figure, some flexibility is permitted in building design, while achieving a hard limit on at least one measure of overall size. One advantage to fixing this parameter, as opposed to others such as height, width, or length, is that floor area correlates well with other considerations relevant to zoning regulation, such as total parking that would be required for an office building, total number of units that might be available for residential use, total load on municipal services, etc. The amounts of these things tend to be constant for a given total floor area, regardless of how that area is distributed horizontally and vertically. Thus, many jurisdictions have found it unnecessary to include hard height limitations when using floor area ratio calculations.\n\nCommon exclusions to the total calculation of square footage for the purpose of floor area ratio (FAR) include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, stair towers, elevator shafts, and parking garages.\n\nJapan has extensively adopted the floor area ratio in the zoning system since 1970.\n\nIn India FAR and FSI are both used. FAR regulations vary from city to city and generally it is from 1.3 to 3.25. In Mumbai 1.33 is the norm but higher FSI is allowed along the Metro rail line and slum areas like Dharavi. In Bangalore, 40 feet streets allow only an FAR of 1.75 but 100 feet streets allow 3.25 FAR.\n\nFAR has a major impact on the value of the land. Higher allowable FAR yields higher land value.\n\nAndres Duany et al in Suburban Nation, the Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream (2000) note:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274504", "title": "French verbs", "text": "French verbs\n\nFrench verbs are a part of speech in French grammar. Each verb lexeme has a collection of finite and non-finite forms in its conjugation scheme.\n\nFinite forms depend on grammatical tense and person/number. There are eight simple tense–aspect–mood forms, categorized into the indicative, subjunctive and imperative moods, with the conditional mood sometimes viewed as an additional category. The eight simple forms can also be categorized into four tenses (future, present, past, and future-of-the-past), or into two aspects (perfective and imperfective).\n\nThe three non-finite moods are the infinitive, past participle, and present participle.\n\nThere are compound constructions that use more than one verb. These include one for each simple tense with the addition of or as an auxiliary verb. There is also a construction which is used to distinguish passive voice from active voice.\n\nFrench verbs are conjugated by isolating the stem of the verb and adding an ending. In the first and second conjugation, the stem is easily identifiable from the infinitive, and remains essentially constant throughout the paradigm. For example, the stem of (\"speak\") is \"parl-\" and the stem of (\"finish\") is \"fin-\". In the third group, the relationship between the infinitive form and the stem is less consistent, and several distinct stems are needed to produce all the forms in the paradigm. For example, the verb (\"drink\") has the stems \"boi-\", \"boiv-\", \"bu-\", and \"buv-\".\n\nThe ending depends on the mood, tense, aspect, and voice of the verb, as well as on the person and number of its subject. Every conjugation exhibits some degree of syncretism, where the same (homophonous, and possibly also homographic) form is used to realize distinct combinations of grammatical features. This is most noticeable for \"-er\" verbs. For instance, the conjugated form \"parle\" can be the 1st or 3rd person singular indicative or subjunctive form of \"parler\", or the singular familiar imperative. Furthermore, the 2nd person singular indicative and subjunctive form \"parles\" and the 3rd person plural form \"parlent\" are pronounced the same way as \"parle\" (except in liaison contexts). The prevalence of syncretism in conjugation paradigms is one functional explanation for the fact that French does not allow null subjects, unlike most of the other Romance languages.\n\nAside from and (considered categories unto themselves), French verbs are traditionally grouped into three \"conjugation classes\" (\"groupes\"):\n\nAs with English verbs, French verbs have both non-finite moods (\"les modes impersonnels\"), also called verbals, and finite ones (\"les modes personnels\").\n\nThe finite moods are the indicative (\"l'indicatif\"), the imperative (\"l'impératif\"), and the subjunctive (\"le subjonctif\"). As discussed below, sometimes the conditional is recognized as a fourth mood. While the rules that determine the correct mood are quite complex, they are simplified and summarized in the following table:\n\nMany linguists recognize a fourth mood, the conditional (\"le conditionnel\"), which is used in almost exactly the same circumstances as the conditional in English. In French, « Je le \"ferais\" si j'avais assez de temps » is \"I \"would do\" it if I had enough time\" in English. Other linguists consider the conditional to be a tense of the indicative mood. The two camps do not disagree on the rules for when and how to use the conditional. A third camp recognizes both \"conditionnel présent/conditionnel passé\" (for use in conditional sentences), and \"indicatif futur du passé / indicatif futur antérieur du passé\" (for tense concords, \"future from a past point of view\"), but they recognize also that both are conjugated the same.\n\n\nThe indicative mood has five \"simple\" (synthetic) tense-aspect forms, conveying four tenses (times of action) (future, present, past, and future-of-past) and two aspects (fabrics of time) (perfective, conveying an action viewed in its entirety without its time frame being considered in more detail, and imperfective, conveying an action that occurs repetitively or continuously). The tense-aspect forms of the indicative mood in French are called the present (\"le présent\": present tense, imperfective aspect), the simple past (\"le passé simple\": past tense, perfective aspect), the imperfect (\"l'imparfait\": past tense, imperfective aspect), the future (\"le futur\": future tense, unspecified aspect), and the conditional (\"le conditionnel\": future-in-past tense, unspecified aspect). Note that, as discussed above, in some uses the conditional can be considered a separate mood completely, while in other uses it is the future-in-past tense of the indicative. The use of the various tense forms is described in the following table:\n\nAdditionally, the indicative has five compound (two-word) tense-aspect forms, each of which is formed analogously to the perfect in languages such as English (e.g., \"have done\") (though in French this form does not indicate the perfect aspect) as applied to one of the above simple tense forms. These tense forms are used to indicate events before the corresponding simple tense forms; for example, « À ce moment-là, il se souvint de ce qu'il \"avait promis\" » (\"At that moment, he remembered what he had promised\"). In addition, except in literature or very formal speeches, the present perfect form is used in modern French wherever the simple past would have been used in older or more literary writing. Since this use is much more common than its use as a true present perfect, it is usually called the compound past (\"le passé composé\"). Further, where older or more literary French would have used the perfect form of the simple past tense (\"le passé antérieur\") for the past-of-the-past, modern non-literary French uses the pluperfect (\"le plus-que-parfait\"; the perfect of the imperfect), or sometimes a new form called the \"surcomposé\" (literally, \"over-compound\"), which re-applies the perfect to the compound past, resulting in a structure like « Je l'\"ai eu fait\" » (literally, \"I it \"have had done\"\").\n\nUnlike English or Spanish, French does not mark for a continuous aspect. Thus, \"I am doing it\" (continuous) and \"I do it\" both translate to the same sentence in French: « Je le fais. » However, the distinction is often clear from context; and when not, it can be conveyed using periphrasis; for example, the expression \"être en train de <nowiki>[faire quelque chose]</nowiki>\" (\"to be in the middle of <nowiki>[doing something]</nowiki>\") is often used to convey the sense of a continuous aspect. (For example, \"I am doing it\" might be expressed as « Je suis en train de le faire », \"I am in the middle of doing it.\") In the case of the past tense, neither the simple nor the compound past tense is ever used with a continuous sense; therefore, the imperfect often indicates a continuous sense (though it does have other uses, as discussed above).\n\nSimilarly to English, the verb (\"to go\") can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-future tense (\"le futur proche\"). Whereas English uses the continuous aspect (\"to be going\"), French uses the simple present tense; for example, the English sentence \"I am going to do it tomorrow\" would in French be « Je \"vais\" le \"faire\" demain ». As in English, this form can generally be replaced by the present or future tense: \"I am doing it tomorrow\", \"I shall do it tomorrow\", « Je le \"fais\" demain », « Je le ferai demain ».\n\nThe subjunctive mood has only two simple tense-aspect forms: a present (\"le présent du subjonctif\") and an imperfect (\"l'imparfait du subjonctif\"). Of these, only the present is used nowadays; like the simple past indicative, the imperfect subjunctive is only found in older and more literary works. When both tense-aspect forms are used, there is no difference in meaning between the two; the present is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a present or future tense, as well as in the few main clauses that use the subjunctive, and the imperfect is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a past tense form (other than present perfect). Except in literature and very formal speeches, modern French uses the present subjunctive even where an older or more literary work would use the imperfect subjunctive.\n\nAs with the indicative, the subjunctive also has one compound tense form for each simple tense form. The difference between the present perfect subjunctive (\"le passé du subjonctif\") and the pluperfect subjunctive (\"le plus-que-parfait du subjonctif\") is analogous to the difference between the present subjunctive and imperfect subjunctive; of the two, only the present perfect subjunctive is found in modern French.\nThe subjunctive in French is used almost wherever it would be in English, and in many other situations as well. It is used in \"que\" (\"that\") clauses to indicate emotion, doubt, possibility, necessity, desire, and so forth. For example, as in English one says\n\n\nBut also, unlike in English, the subjunctive is used in, for example,\n\n\nSometimes the subjunctive is used in the interrogative and the negative but not in the affirmative:\n\n\nIn addition to situations of doubt, negatives stated with certainty take the subjunctive:\n\n\nSuperlatives also can optionally be accompanied by the subjunctive in a \"que\" clause, if the speaker feels doubt:\n\n\nFinally, as in English, counterfactual conditions in the past are expressed by backshifting the apparent time reference. In English this backshifted form is called the pluperfect subjunctive, and unless it is expressed in inverted form it is identical in form to the pluperfect indicative; it is called subjunctive because of the change in implied time of action. In French, however, there is a distinction in form between the seldom used pluperfect subjunctive and the pluperfect indicative, which is used in this situation. For example,\n\n\nThe imperative only has a present tense, with a rarely used perfect: \"fais-le\" and \"aie-le fait\" both mean \"do it\", with the latter implying a certain deadline (somewhat like English \"have it done\").\n\nLike English, French has two voices, the unmarked active voice and the marked passive voice. As in English, the passive voice is formed by using the appropriate form of \"to be\" (\"être\") and the past participle of the main verb.\n\nIn French, all compound tense-aspect forms are formed with an auxiliary verb (either \"to be\" or \"to have\"). Most verbs use \"avoir\" as their auxiliary verb. The exceptions are all reflexive verbs and a number of verbs of motion or change of state, including some of the most frequently used intransitive verbs of the language:\n\n\nVerbs that are derived from these by prefixation may continue to select \"être\", but this is not always the case. For example:\n\nA small number of verbs, including some already mentioned above, can in fact be found with either auxiliary (, , , , , , ). There may be a subtle change of meaning depending on the auxiliary chosen, and one auxiliary is usually more literary or archaic than the other.\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tense-aspect forms and is essential to the agreement of the past participle.\n\nThe past participle is used in three ways in French: as an adjective, in the passive construction, and in the compound tense-aspect constructions. When it is used as an adjective, it follows all the regular adjective agreement rules. In passive constructions, it always agrees with the passive subject.\n\nIn compound tense-aspect forms, more complicated agreement rules apply, reflecting the subtle priority rules between the attribute meaning (which implies an agreement) and the compound tense construction (which by itself does not imply any agreement).\n\nA. The auxiliary verb is \"avoir\".\n\nB. The auxiliary is \"être\", and the verb is not reflexive. The past participle agrees with the subject: \nC. The auxiliary is \"être\" and the verb is reflexive. The agreement rules are in fact the same as those for structures with \"avoir\" in A, keeping in mind that the reflexive pronoun corresponds to either the direct object or the indirect object of the verb.\n\n"}

It was first created in 1964 and is hosted at the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in Mannheim, Germany. The corpus archive is continuously updated and expanded. It currently comprises more than 4.0 billion word tokens (as of August 2010) and constitutes the largest linguistically motivated collection of contemporary German texts. Today, it is one of the major resources worldwide for the study of written German.\n\nThe German Reference Corpus is often referred to by other names, such as \"Mannheim corpora\", \"IDS corpora\", \"COSMAS corpora\" and the corresponding German translations. The name \"Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)\" was originally used for a specific portion of the current archive which was collected between 1999 and 2002 by a number of institutions in a joint project under the same name. Since 2004, \"Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)\" is the official name of the full corpus archive.\n\nThe German Reference Corpus comprises fictional and academic texts, a large number of newspaper texts and several other text types. The texts cover the time range from around 1950 to the present.\n\nIn contrast to other well-known corpora and corpus archives (such as the British National Corpus), however, the German Reference Corpus is explicitly not designed as a \"balanced corpus\": The distribution of DeReKo texts across time or text types does not match some predefined percentages.\n\nThis conception complies with the fact that whether or not a given corpus constitutes a balanced or even representative language sample may only be assessed with respect to a specific language domain (i.e., the statistical population). Because different linguistic investigations generally aim at different language domains, the declared purpose of the German Reference Corpus is to serve as a versatile superordinate sample, or \"primordial sample\" (German: \"Ur-Stichprobe\") of contemporary written German, from which corpus users may draw a specialised subsample (a so-called \"virtual corpus\") to represent the language domain they wish to investigate.\n\nDue to copyright and licence restrictions, the DeReKo archive may not be copied nor offered for download. It can be queried and analyzed free of charge via the system \"COSMAS II\" - end-users are required to register by name and to agree to use the corpus data exclusively for non-commercial, academic purposes. \"COSMAS II\" enables users to compile from DeReKo a \"virtual corpus\" suitable for their specific research questions.\n\n\n\n"}

Like other Hmong-Mien languages, it is tonal and monosyllabic.\n\nLinguists in China consider the dialect spoken in Changdong, Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi to be the standard. This standard is also spoken by Iu Mien in the West, however, because most are refugees from Laos, their dialect incorporates influences from the Lao and Thai languages.\n\nIu Mien has 78% lexical similarity with Kim Mun (Lanten), 70% with Biao-Jiao Mien, and 61% with Dzao Min.\n\nIn China, Iu Mien is spoken in the following counties (Mao 2004:302-303). There are 130,000 speakers in Hunan province (known as the \"Xiangnan\" 湘南 dialect), and 400,000 speakers in Guangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Jiangxi provinces (known as the \"Guangdian\" 广滇 dialect).\n\nThere are several known dialects of Iu Mien. Dialects vary by clan and geographic location.\n\nIn Vietnam, Dao people belonging to the Đại Bản, Tiểu Bản, Quần Chẹt, Ô Gang, Cóc Ngáng, and Cóc Mùn subgroups speak Iu Mien dialects.\n\nThere are 31 cited consonant phonemes in Iu Mien. A distinguishing feature of Iu Mien consonants is the presence of voiceless nasals and laterals.\n\n\nIt appears that all single consonant phonemes except /ʔ/ can occur as the onset.\n\nUnlike Hmong, which generally prohibits coda consonants, Iu Mien has seven single consonant phonemes that can take the coda position. These consonants are /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, [p̚], [t̚], [k̚], and /ʔ/. Some of the stops can only occur as final consonants when accompanied by certain tones; for example, /ʔ/ only occurs with the tone or .\n\nIu Mien vowels are represented in the Iu Mien United Script using combinations of the six letters, , , , , , and .\n\nAccording to Bruhn, the monophthongs are , , , , , , , , , and . The diphthongs are , , , , , , , . Furthermore, additional diphthongs and triphthongs can be formed from the aforementioned vowels through /i/- or /u/-on-gliding (having /i/ or /u/ before the vowel). Such vowels attested by Bruhn include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\nThe dialect studied by Bruhn, and described in the above table, has a phoneme that does not have its own spelling, but is represented in various contexts either as or (which are also used for /e/ and , respectively). In all cases where is spelled , and nearly all cases where it is spelled , it does not contrast with /e/ or , respectively, and can be viewed as an allophone of these sounds. The only potential exception appears to be when occurring as a syllable final by itself, where it has an extremely restricted distribution, occurring only \nafter the (alveolo-)palatal consonants . The sound may be a secondary development from in this context, although Bruhn does not discuss this issue.\n\nIu Mien is a tonal language with six observed tonemes.\n\nIn the Iu Mien United Script (the language's most common writing system), tones are not marked with diacritics; rather, a word's tone is indicated by a special marker letter at the end of the word. If a word lacks a marker, then it is to be pronounced with a middle tone.\n\nIu Mien is an analytic language and lacks inflection. It is also a monosyllabic language, with most of its lexicon consisting of one syllable.\n\nThe language follows a SVO word order. Some other syntactic properties include the following:\n\nIn the past, the lack of an alphabet caused low rates of literacy amongst the Iu Mien speakers. It had been written with Chinese characters in China; however, this is extremely difficult for Iu Mien speakers from other countries such as Laos and from groups who now live in the West.\n\nIn an effort to address this, an Iu Mien Unified Script was created in 1984 using the Latin script, based on an earlier orthography developed in China. Unlike the Vietnamese language, this alphabet does not use any diacritics to distinguish tones or different vowel sounds, and only uses the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. This orthography distinguishes 30 initials, 128 finals, and eight tones. Hyphens are used to link adjectives with the nouns they modify. The alphabet is similar to the RPA used to write the Hmong language and the Hanyu Pinyin transcription scheme used for Chinese.\n\nThe following films feature the Iu Mien language:\n\n\n\n"}

His father was Moulavi Nasih Uddin and mother was Azimunnessa Begum. He was the second son of his parents. Alam secured a job with the Government Registration Department and served until retirement in 1955 as an Inspector of Registrations.\n\nIn 1917 he joined the 49th Bengali Paltan of British Indian Army, He served in the Signal Corps and Mahbub spent about three years at different stations in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) before being finally released in 1920, when the Paltan was broken up.\n\nIn Bangla prose, Alam is a writer of fiction and historian. His literary works were included in the curriculum of school level, secondary, higher secondary and graduation level Bengali Literature in Bangladesh.\n\n'Mofizon'(after the name of the heroin): Mahbub Ul Alam can be said to have written one novella, titled \"Mofizon,\"and one novel, \"Momener Jabanbondi' Mofizon is on a theme of the suppressed libidinal instinct in human nature. This short fiction provides a bold treatment of feminine sexual arousal and suppression working simultaneously at a time when Bengali society was not ready for it. It was, therefore, criticised by the conservative section of the Muslim society, but Poet Sufia Kamal, a noted female contemporary writer of Mahbub's wrote very succinctly that everybody blamed \"Mofizon\"but nobody understood Mofizon's pains. The superstitious male attitude towards marriage and women is also criticised in this novella. \nMomener JabanbandiMahbub's most well-known work, translated into English by Lila Roy as \"The Confession of a Believer\" is a novel—as the title suggests, on autobiographical elements—that portrays the central character as having gone through the continuous biting of the conscience mainly on moral grounds. As is Mahbub's habit to approach critical issues, the beginning of the novel contains a fictional discourse run by the child-protagonist about the existence of God. The later part of the novel shows the adult-protagonist as having overcome the temptation of seductive attractions from a married woman. This novel is rich in Mahbub's style of writing in bold, clear and precise sentences.\n\n\"Tajia\":(the name for the replica of Prophet's two grandsons' graves carried on vans in the streets by the mourning Muslims on the Ashura, 10th Muharram)is a collection of short-stories, which mainly deals with religious bigotry, whilePancha Anna(meaning a co-mixture of themes), another volume, which has short stories dealing with supernaturalism, famine, domestic affairs and marriage. After his death, four volumes of humorous short stories were published, which are: 'Pradhan Otithi and Taza Singhi Macher Jhol (The chief guest and the gravy of the freshly cooked catfish), Rongberong (Varieties, \"Paltan,\" (Warfront), and \"Sat Satero\" (multiplicities).\n\n'Paltan Jiboner Smriti'(Memories of the War Front) is the book with the publication of which in 1935 Mahbub arrived on the literary scene of the undivided Bengal. The book was first serialised in the monthly \"Mohammadi\" published from Kolkata, and it at once caught the attention of the readers for Mahbub's extraordinary verve in storytelling. Recollecting his days of war in Mesopotamia, Mahbub brings to life in bold humorous strokes his encounters with people in the kind of his Scottish boss, a lieutenant general, who presented him with a Robert Burns volume for his honesty, his co-mates and their pranks, cooks and guards of the camp, his sickness, the malaria epidemic in the quarters, and Iraqi date-tree gardens and their women. \nGomf Sandesh (news about mustache)is a delightful reading, as all the stories in this book throw a mocking but serene blow at the complicated relationship between Muslims and Hindus in the Bengal society. This book proves that Mahbub's major forte as writer lies in creating humour at the most unsuspecting moment.\n\nBangalir Muktijudhdher Itibritta (the complete history of the Liberation War of the Bengalis) is a mammoth task drawing up a documentary history of the Liberation War that ended in the creation of Bangladesh. A 670-page long 4-volume history, this book, compiled over two years by an elderly Mahbub at the age of 73 to 75, is often considered as the first documented history on the subject. Mahbub visited hundreds of villages all over Bangladesh and interviewed several hundred people to collect information about the guerrilla warfare as well as the conventional war. \nAnother book along this line, titled Bangaleer Samorik Oitijhya (The Military Tradition of the Bengalis), published recently contains unpublished writings of Mahbub as well as old entries from Paltan Jiboner Smriti.\n\nBesides, under a UNESCO project, Mahbub produced a number of books describing the flora and fauna of the then East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) and their habitat. These picturesque books on plants, birds and animals of Bangladesh are, unfortunately, not available now.\n\nWhile Alam was studying at Chittagong College, he married his distant relative Julekha. She died leaving seven children behind (three of whom died as infants), and Alam then married Rahela Khatoon, who gave birth to eleven children, and survived him by 26 years. On retirement, Mahbub took interest in social welfare and published a weekly newspaper, titled \"Zamana\" (meaning the current days), which he later on converted into a daily. Mahbub died in his own house at Kazir Dewry, Chittagong on 7 August 1981. His American writer-friend Robert C. Hammock wrote a chapter on Mahbub in his book \"Below the Llano Estakado.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20298111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20298111", "title": "Moravian dialects", "text": "Moravian dialects\n\nMoravian dialects () are the varieties of Czech spoken in Moravia, a historical region in the southeast of the Czech Republic. There are more forms of the Czech language used in Moravia than in the rest of the Czech Republic. The main four groups of dialects are the Bohemian-Moravian group, the Central Moravian group, the Eastern Moravian group and the Lach (Silesian) group (which is also spoken in Czech Silesia). While the forms are generally viewed as regional variants of Czech, some Moravians (522,474 in the 2011 Census) claim them to be one separate Moravian language.\n\nSoutheastern Moravian dialects form a dialect continuum with the closely related Slovak language, and are thus sometimes viewed as dialects of Slovak rather than Czech.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the language used in Slavic-speaking areas of Moravia was referred to as “Moravian” or as “Czech”. When regular censuses started in Austria-Hungary in 1880, the choice of main-communication languages in the forms prescribed in Cisleithania did not include Czech language but included the single item \"Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak\" (the others being \"German\", \"Polish\", \"Rusyn\", \"Slovene\", \"Serbo-Croatian\", \"Italian\", \"Romanian\" and \"Hungarian\"). Respondents who chose Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak as their main communicating language were counted in the Austrian censuses as Czechs.\n\nOn the occasion of 2011 Census of the Czech Republic, several Moravian organizations (political party Moravané and Moravian National Community amongst others) led a campaign to promote the Moravian nationality and language. The Czech Statistical Office assured the Moravané party that filling in “Moravian” as language would not be treated as ticking off “Czech”, because forms were processed by a computer and superseding Czech for Moravian was technically virtually impossible.\n\nAccording to the results of the census, there was a total number of 108,469 native speakers of Moravian in 2011. Of them, 62,908 consider Moravian to be their only native language, and 45,561 are native speakers of both Moravian and Czech.\n\nWhile the former regional dialects of Bohemia have merged into one interdialect, Common Czech (with some small exceptions in borderlands), the territory of Moravia is still linguistically diversified. This may be due to absence of a single Moravian cultural and political centre (analogous to Prague in Bohemia) for most of the history, as well as the fact that both of its major cities—Brno and Olomouc—used to be predominantly inhabited by a German-speaking population. The most common classification distinguishes three major groups of Moravian dialects: Central Moravian (Hanakian), Eastern Moravian (Moravian-Slovak) and Silesian (Lach). Some typical phonological differences between the Moravian dialects are shown below on the sentence \"‘Put the flour from the mill in the cart’\":\n\nCentral Moravian dialects, or Hanakian dialects (\"Hanak dialects\", \"Haná dialects\", ), are spoken in the central part of Moravia around Znojmo, Třebíč, Brno, Olomouc, Přerov, Zábřeh and Šumperk. While the Central Moravian group traditionally contained many dialects native to specific microregions, today's spoken language across Central Moravia is moving towards a unified \"Common Hanakian dialect\" (). Features of this group include\n\n\nThe dialects spoken in and around Brno have seen a lot of lexical influence from Hantec slang, a jargon incorporating many German and Yiddish loanwords into the local Central Moravian dialect. Although by the 21st century the slang had greatly declined in use, some vocabulary from Hantec is still used commonly in everyday speech, for example \"šalina\" instead of \"tramvaj\" for “tram”, from German \"elektrischelinie\".\n\nThe Hanakian dialect has a literary presence. Writers who have written in Hanakian dialect include Alois and Vilém Mrštík, Ondřej Přikryl and Jakub Obrovský. Written Hanakian dialect often distinguishes between \"wide\" or \"open\" \"ê\" and \"ô\" (as in \"rêba\", \"rôka\"), and \"closed\" \"e\" and \"o\", to reflect dialects which pronounce these two sounds differently.\n\nCzech translation:\nEastern Moravian dialects are transitional dialects between Czech and Slovak. They are spoken in the strip of land extending from Břeclav to Hodonín, Kyjov, Uherské Hradiště, Zlín and Vsetín. The Eastern group contains two dialects of specific interest, the Moravian Wallachian dialect () and the Moravian-Slovak dialect (). Features of Eastern Moravian dialects include:\n\n\nLachian dialects (\"Lach dialects\", ), spoken in north-eastern Moravia and the adjacent regions of Silesia around Opava, Ostrava, Frýdek-Místek and Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, are transitional dialects sharing more features of Polish. Defining phonological features include loss of distinction between long and short vowels, a feature colloquially known as “krátký zobák” in Czech (“short beak”), stress shifted to the penultimate syllable of the word, as in Polish, rather than the first syllable, alveolar consonants \"d\", \"t\" and \"n\" often shifted to their palatal counterparts, and a distinction between “hard” (post-alveolar or retroflex) \"š\", \"ž\", \"č\" and “soft” (alveolo-palatal) \"ś\", \"ź\", \"ć\", as in Polish. Silesian dialects also contain many German loanwords unfamiliar to other Czech dialects. The Lachian dialects are closely related to the Cieszyn Silesian dialect, spoken in the area around Karviná, Český Těšín and Třinec as well as on the Polish side of the border.\n\nBohemian-Moravian dialects, or South-eastern Bohemian dialects, spoken in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in western Moravia around Dačice, Jihlava and Žďár nad Sázavou are a transitional group between dialects of Bohemia and Moravia, sharing some features in common with Common Czech and others more in common with Central Moravian.\n\nMoravian dialects preserve numerous archaic phonological features that are no longer used in contemporary Czech, but can still be found in many other Slavic languages. The following tables list selected cognates, pointing out the archaisms and showing their equivalents in the other languages:\n\nWhile Moravian grammar tends to be similar to Czech grammar, there are some defining features. For instance, Moravian dialects apply a uniform pattern to the 3rd person plural ending of class IV \"-it\" verbs, and class III \"-et\" verbs, which in standard Czech traditionally varied in an unintuitive fashion:\n\nMoravian dialects also occasionally use prepositions in a different fashion to Standard and Common Czech, usually mirroring usage in Slovak (e.g. \"něco k jídlu\" > \"něco na jídlo\" for \"something to eat\", ) or Polish (e.g. \"pojď ke mně\" > \"choď do mě\", for \"come to me\", ).\n\nSince the end of the 20th century, the private association Moravian Language Institute (\"Ústav jazyka moravského\"), founded by waiter and amateur linguist Jan Kozohorský, has made attempts to standardise a literary Moravian language. The movement has been criticised by linguistics professors at Masaryk University in Brno as controversial and with strong political undertones.\n\n\n\n"}

It became an official language of New Zealand in April 2006, alongside English and Māori. However, the rights and obligations to use the language are restricted to court proceedings.\n\nNew Zealand Sign Language has its roots in British Sign Language (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in American Sign Language.\n\nLike other natural sign languages, it was devised by and for deaf people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or written language.\n\nIt uses the same two-handed manual alphabet as BSL (British Sign Language) and Auslan (Australian Sign Language).\n\nIt uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand's history of oralist education of deaf people. Its vocabulary includes Māori concepts such as marae and tangi, and signs for New Zealand placenames. (E.g. Rotorua - mudpools, Wellington - windy breeze, Auckland - Sky Tower, Christchurch - 2 Cs, represents ChCh.)\n\nThe first non-Polynesian immigrants to New Zealand were from Britain, and those who were deaf brought British Sign Language with them. The first known teacher of sign language was Dorcas Mitchell, who taught the children of one family in Charteris Bay, Lyttelton Harbour, from 1868 to 1877. By 1877 she had taught 42 pupils.\n\nWhen the first school for the deaf (then called the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the position of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was the policy of the school until 1979. A documentary film about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the children used sign language secretly and after leaving school, developing NZSL out of British Sign Language largely without adult intervention for over 100 years. The main haven for NZSL was the Deaf Clubs in the main centres. In 1979, \"Total Communication\" (a \"use anything that works\" philosophy) was adopted at the Sumner School, but the signing it used was \"Australasian Sign Language\" an artificial signed form of English. As a result, younger signers use a number of Australasian signs in their NZSL, to such an extent that some call traditional NZSL \"Old Sign\". NZSL was adopted for teaching in 1994.\n\nIn 1985, Marianne Ahlgren proved in her PhD thesis at Victoria University of Wellington that NZSL is a fully-fledged\nlanguage, with a large vocabulary of signs and a consistent grammar of space.\n\nThe New Zealand Sign Language Teachers Association (NZSLTA - formerly known as the New Zealand Sign Language Tutors Association) was set up in 1992. Over the next few years adult education classes in NZSL began in several centres. In 1997 a Certificate in Deaf Studies programme was started at Victoria University of Wellington, with instruction actually in NZSL, designed to teach deaf people how to competently teach NZSL to the wider public. Also in 1992 an interpreter training programme was established at the Auckland Institute of Technology, now known as Auckland University of Technology. This programme was first directed and taught by Dr Rachel Locker McKee (hearing) and Dr David McKee (deaf) and came about due to lobbying by the New Zealand Deaf Community and others who recognised the need for safer and more professional interpreting services. They had as early as 1984 sought support for more research to determine the need for sign language interpreters. Other than a one-off course run in 1985, this was the first time a professional training programme with a qualification was offered in New Zealand. Many of those who have gone on to work as professional NZSL interpreters began their journey in NZSL community classes taught by members of the NZSLTA.\n\nAn important step toward the recognition of NZSL was the publication in 1998 of a comprehensive NZSL dictionary by Victoria University of Wellington and the Deaf Association of NZ. It contains some 4000 signs (which correspond to many more meanings than the same number of English words, because of the way signs can be modulated in space and time), sorted by handshape, not English meaning, and coded in the Hamburg Notational System, HamNoSys, as well as pictorially. In 2011, Victoria University launched an Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language based on the original 1998 work, which includes video clips of each sign with examples and the ability to search for signs based on features of the sign (handshape, location, etc.) as well as the sign's English gloss.\n\nFor some years, TVNZ broadcast a weekly news programme, \"News Review\", interpreted in NZSL. This was discontinued in 1993 after a joint survey of deaf and hearing-impaired people found a majority favoured captioned programmes. Many Deaf people felt they had been misled by the survey. There has been no regular programming in NZSL since.\n\nBetween August 2012 to August 2013 the Human Rights Commission carried out an inquiry into the use and promotion of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The inquiry has focused on working with key government agencies and the Deaf community around the inquiry's three terms of reference 1) The right to education for Deaf people and potential users of NZSL. 2) The rights of Deaf people, and other potential users of NZSL, to access communication, information and services, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, through the provision of professional NZSL interpreter services and other NZSL services and resources. 3) The promotion and maintenance of NZSL as an official language of New Zealand. The full report of the inquiry, \"A New Era in the Right to Sign\", was launched in Parliament by the Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia, on 3 September 2013.\n\nNZSL became the third official language of New Zealand in April 2006, joining English and Māori. The parliamentary bill to approve this passed its third reading on April 6, 2006. At the first reading in Parliament, on June 22, 2004, the bill was supported by all political parties. It was referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee, which reported back to the House on July 18, 2005. The second reading passed 119 to 2 on February 23, 2006 with only the ACT party opposing because the government is not providing funding for NZSL. It passed the third reading on April 6, 2006 with the same margin.\n\nThe bill received Royal Assent, a constitutional formality, on 10 April 2006. New Zealand Sign Language became an official language of New Zealand the day after Royal Assent.\n\nThe use of NZSL as a valid medium of instruction has not always been accepted by the Government, the Association of Teachers of the Deaf, or many parents. However, in light of much research into its validity as a language and much advocacy by deaf adults, parents of deaf children (both hearing and deaf) and educationalists, NZSL has since become — in tandem with English — part of the bilingual/bicultural approach used in public schools (including Kelston Deaf Education Centre and Van Asch Deaf Education Centre) since 1994. Victoria University of Wellington has courses in New Zealand Sign Language, although it has yet to develop a major program for it. AUT teaches a Bachelor course for NZSL interpreting.\n\nDifferences in lexicon in New Zealand Sign Language have largely developed through the student communities surrounding five schools for the deaf in New Zealand:\n\n\n"}

The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BC, in the late Shang dynasty. Bronze inscriptions became plentiful during the following Zhou dynasty. The latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature, including classical works such as the \"Analects\", the \"Mencius\", and the \"Zuozhuan\". These works served as models for Literary Chinese (or Classical Chinese), which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century, thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese.\n\nOld Chinese was written with an early form of Chinese characters, with each character representing a monosyllabic word.\nAlthough the script is not alphabetic, most characters were created by adapting a character for a similar-sounding word.\nScholars have used the phonetic information in the script and the rhyming practice of ancient poetry to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology, corresponding roughly to the Western Zhou period in the early part of the 1st millennium BC.\nAlthough many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differed from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids. Most recent reconstructions also describe Old Chinese as a language without tones, but having consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, which developed into tone distinctions in Middle Chinese.\n\nMost researchers trace the core vocabulary of Old Chinese to Sino-Tibetan, with much early borrowing from neighbouring languages.\nDuring the Zhou period, the originally monosyllabic vocabulary was augmented with polysyllabic words formed by compounding and reduplication. Several derivational affixes have also been identified. However the language lacked inflection, and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and grammatical particles.\n\nMiddle Chinese and its southern neighbours Kra–Dai, Hmong–Mien and the Vietic branch of Austroasiatic have similar tone systems, syllable structure, grammatical features and lack of inflection, but these are believed to be areal features spread by diffusion rather than indicating common descent.\nThe most widely accepted hypothesis is that Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, together with Burmese, Tibetan and many other languages spoken in the Himalayas and the Southeast Asian Massif.\nThe evidence consists of some hundreds of proposed cognate words, including such basic vocabulary as the following:\n\nAlthough the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as Indo-European or Austronesian.\nAlthough Old Chinese is by far the earliest attested member of the family, its logographic script does not clearly indicate the pronunciation of words.\nOther difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.\nIn addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, including several sensitive border zones.\n\nInitial consonants generally correspond regarding place and manner of articulation, but voicing and aspiration are much less regular, and prefixal elements vary widely between languages.\nSome researchers believe that both these phenomena reflect lost minor syllables.\nProto-Tibeto-Burman as reconstructed by Benedict and Matisoff lacks an aspiration distinction on initial stops and affricates.\nAspiration in Old Chinese often corresponds to pre-initial consonants in Tibetan and Lolo-Burmese, and is believed to be a Chinese innovation arising from earlier prefixes.\nProto-Sino-Tibetan is reconstructed with a six-vowel system as in recent reconstructions of Old Chinese, with the Tibeto-Burman languages distinguished by the merger of the mid-central vowel with .\nThe other vowels are preserved by both, with some alternation between and , and between and .\n\nThe earliest known written records of the Chinese language were found at the Yinxu site near modern Anyang identified as the last capital of the Shang dynasty, and date from about 1250 BC. These are the oracle bones, short inscriptions carved on tortoise plastrons and ox scapulae for divinatory purposes, as well as a few brief bronze inscriptions. The language written is undoubtedly an early form of Chinese, but is difficult to interpret due to the limited subject matter and high proportion of proper names. Only half of the 4,000 characters used have been identified with certainty. Little is known about the grammar of this language, but it seems much less reliant on grammatical particles than Classical Chinese.\n\nFrom early in the Western Zhou period, around 1000 BC, the most important recovered texts are bronze inscriptions, many of considerable length. Even longer pre-Classical texts on a wide range of subjects have also been transmitted through the literary tradition. The oldest parts of the \"Book of Documents\", the \"Classic of Poetry\" and the \"I Ching\" also date from the early Zhou period, and closely resemble the bronze inscriptions in vocabulary, syntax, and style.\nA greater proportion of this more varied vocabulary has been identified than for the oracular period.\n\nThe four centuries preceding the unification of China in 221 BC (the later Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period) constitute the Chinese classical period in the strict sense.\nThere are many bronze inscriptions from this period, but they are vastly outweighed by a rich literature written in ink on bamboo and wooden slips and (toward the end of the period) silk.\nAlthough these are perishable materials, and many books were destroyed in the burning of books and burying of scholars in the Qin dynasty, other texts have been transmitted as copies. Such works from this period as the \"Analects\", the \"Classic of Filial Piety\", the \"Mencius\" and the \"Zuo zhuan\" have been admired as models of prose style since the Han dynasty. The Classical Chinese of such works formed the basis of Literary Chinese, which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century.\n\nEach character of the script represented a single Old Chinese word.\nMost scholars believe that these words were monosyllabic, though some have recently suggested that a minority of them had minor presyllables.\nThe development of these characters follows the same three stages that characterized Egyptian hieroglyphs, Mesopotamian cuneiform script and the Maya script.\n\nSome words could be represented by pictures (later stylized) such as \"rì\" \"sun\", \"rén\" \"person\" and \"mù\" \"tree, wood\", by abstract symbols such as \"sān\" \"three\" and \"shàng\" \"up\", or by composite symbols such as \"lín\" \"forest\" (two trees).\nAbout 1,000 of the oracle bone characters, nearly a quarter of the total, are of this type, though 300 of them have not yet been deciphered.\nThough the pictographic origins of these characters are apparent, they have already undergone extensive simplification and conventionalization.\nEvolved forms of most of these characters are still in common use today.\n\nNext, words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were signified by borrowing characters of pictorial origin representing similar-sounding words (the \"rebus strategy\"):\nSometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with \"wú\" \"don't\", a borrowing of \"mǔ\" \"mother\".\nLater, phonetic loans were systematically disambiguated by the addition of semantic indicators, usually to the less common word:\nSuch phono-semantic compound characters were already used extensively on the oracle bones, and the vast majority of characters created since then have been of this type.\nIn the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", a dictionary compiled in the 2nd century, 82% of the 9,353 characters are classified as phono-semantic compounds.\nIn the light of the modern understanding of Old Chinese phonology, researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds also have a phonetic nature.\n\nThese developments were already present in the oracle bone script, possibly implying a significant period of development prior to the extant inscriptions.\nThis may have involved writing on perishable materials, as suggested by the appearance on oracle bones of the character \"cè\" \"records\".\nThe character is thought to depict bamboo or wooden strips tied together with leather thongs, a writing material known from later archaeological finds.\n\nDevelopment and simplification of the script continued during the pre-Classical and Classical periods, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.\nThe language developed compound words, so that characters came to represent morphemes, though almost all morphemes could be used as independent words.\nHundreds of morphemes of two or more syllables also entered the language, and were written with one phono-semantic compound character per syllable.\nDuring the Warring States period, writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.\nThe most conservative script prevailed in the western state of Qin, which would later impose its standard on the whole of China.\n\nOld Chinese phonology has been reconstructed using a variety of evidence, including the phonetic components of Chinese characters, rhyming practice in the \"Classic of Poetry\" and Middle Chinese reading pronunciations described in such works as the \"Qieyun\", a rhyme dictionary published in 601 AD.\nAlthough many details are still disputed, recent formulations are in substantial agreement on the core issues.\nFor example, the Old Chinese initial consonants recognized by Li Fang-Kuei and William Baxter are given below, with Baxter's (mostly tentative) additions given in parentheses:\n\nVarious initial clusters have been proposed, especially clusters of with other consonants, but this area remains unsettled.\n\nMost scholars posit optional medials , and the combination as the origin of the retroflex and palatal obstruents of Middle Chinese, as well as many of its vowel contrasts.\nHowever, the palatal medial has been challenged on a number of grounds, and a variety of different realizations for this distinction have been used in recent constructions.\n\nReconstructions since the 1980s usually propose six vowels:\n\nwhich contrasts with the four-vowel system proposed by Li Fang-kuei and maintained by Gong, Ting, and Hwang:\n\nNevertheless, both systems are broadly in agreement once Li's three diphthongs /ia iə ua/ are accounted for.\nVowels could optionally be followed by the same codas as in Middle Chinese: a glide or , a nasal , or , or a stop , or . Some scholars also allow for a labiovelar coda .\nMost scholars now believe that Old Chinese lacked the tones found in later stages of the language, but had optional post-codas and , which developed into the Middle Chinese rising and departing tones respectively.\n\nLittle is known of the grammar of the language of the Oracular and pre-Classical periods, as the texts are often of a ritual or formulaic nature, and much of their vocabulary has not been deciphered. In contrast, the rich literature of the Warring States period has been extensively analysed. Having no inflection, Old Chinese was heavily reliant on word order, grammatical particles, and inherent word classes.\n\nClassifying Old Chinese words is not always straightforward, as words were not marked for function, word classes overlapped, and words of one class could sometimes be used in roles normally reserved for a different class. The task is more difficult with written texts than it would have been for speakers of Old Chinese, because the derivational morphology is often hidden by the writing system. For example, the verb \"to block\" and the derived noun \"frontier\" were both written with the same character .\n\nPersonal pronouns exhibit a wide variety of forms in Old Chinese texts, possibly due to dialectal variation.\nThere were two groups of first-person pronouns:\n\nIn the oracle bone inscriptions, the pronouns were used by the king to refer to himself, and the forms for the Shang people as a whole.\nThis distinction is largely absent in later texts, and the forms disappeared during the classical period.\nIn the post-Han period, came to be used as the general first-person pronoun.\n\nSecond-person pronouns included , , , .\nThe forms and continued to be used interchangeably until their replacement by the northwestern variant (modern Mandarin \"nǐ\") in the Tang period.\nHowever, in some Min dialects the second-person pronoun is derived from .\n\nCase distinctions were particularly marked among third-person pronouns.\nThere was no third-person subject pronoun, but , originally a distal demonstrative, came to be used as a third-person object pronoun in the classical period.\nThe possessive pronoun was originally , replaced in the classical period by .\nIn the post-Han period, came to be used as the general third-person pronoun.\nIt survives in some Wu dialects, but has been replaced by a variety of forms elsewhere.\n\nThere were demonstrative and interrogative pronouns, but no indefinite pronouns with the meanings \"something\" or \"nothing\".\nThe distributive pronouns were formed with a suffix:\n\nAs in the modern language, localizers (compass directions, \"above\", \"inside\" and the like) could be placed after nouns to indicate relative positions.\nThey could also precede verbs to indicate the direction of the action. Nouns denoting times were another special class (time words); they usually preceded the subject to specify the time of an action. However the classifiers so characteristic of Modern Chinese only became common in the Han period and the subsequent Northern and Southern dynasties.\n\nOld Chinese verbs, like their modern counterparts, did not show tense or aspect; these could be indicated with adverbs or particles if required. Verbs could be transitive or intransitive. As in the modern language, adjectives were a special kind of intransitive verb, and a few transitive verbs could also function as modal auxiliaries or as prepositions.\n\nAdverbs described the scope of a statement or various temporal relationships. They included two families of negatives starting with and , such as and . Modern northern varieties derive the usual negative from the first family, while southern varieties preserve the second. The language had no adverbs of degree until late in the Classical period.\n\nParticles were function words serving a range of purposes. As in the modern language, there were sentence-final particles marking imperatives and yes/no questions. Other sentence-final particles expressed a range of connotations, the most important being , expressing static factuality, and , implying a change. Other particles included the subordination marker and the nominalizing particles (agent) and (object).\nConjunctions could join nouns or clauses.\n\nAs with English and modern Chinese, Old Chinese sentences can be analysed as a subject (a noun phrase, sometimes understood) followed by a predicate, which could be of either nominal or verbal type.\n\nBefore the Classical period, nominal predicates consisted of a copular particle followed by a noun phrase:\n\nThe negated copula is attested in oracle bone inscriptions, and later fused as .\nIn the Classical period, nominal predicates were constructed with the sentence-final particle instead of the copula , but was retained as the negative form, with which was optional:\n\nThe copular verb (\"shì\") of Literary and Modern Chinese dates from the Han period.\nIn Old Chinese the word was a near demonstrative (\"this\").\n\nAs in Modern Chinese, but unlike most Tibeto-Burman languages, the basic word order in a verbal sentence was subject–verb–object:\n\nBesides inversions for emphasis, there were two exceptions to this rule: a pronoun object of a negated sentence or an interrogative pronoun object would be placed before the verb:\n\nAn additional noun phrase could be placed before the subject to serve as the topic. As in the modern language, yes/no questions were formed by adding a sentence-final particle, and requests for information by substituting an interrogative pronoun for the requested element.\n\nIn general, Old Chinese modifiers preceded the words they modified. Thus relative clauses were placed before the noun, usually marked by the particle (in a role similar to Modern Chinese \"de\" ):\n\nA common instance of this construction was adjectival modification, since the Old Chinese adjective was a type of verb (as in the modern language), but was usually omitted after monosyllabic adjectives.\n\nSimilarly, adverbial modifiers, including various forms of negation, usually occurred before the verb. As in the modern language, time adjuncts occurred either at the start of the sentence or before the verb, depending on their scope, while duration adjuncts were placed after the verb. Instrumental and place adjuncts were usually placed after the verb phrase. These later moved to a position before the verb, as in the modern language.\n\nThe improved understanding of Old Chinese phonology has enabled the study of the origins of Chinese words (rather than the characters with which they are written).\nMost researchers trace the core vocabulary to a Sino-Tibetan ancestor language, with much early borrowing from other neighbouring languages.\nThe traditional view was that Old Chinese was an isolating language, lacking both inflection and derivation, but it has become clear that words could be formed by derivational affixation, reduplication and compounding.\nMost authors consider only monosyllabic roots, but Baxter and Laurent Sagart also propose disyllabic roots in which the first syllable is reduced, as in modern Khmer.\n\nDuring the Old Chinese period, Chinese civilization expanded from a compact area around the lower Wei River and middle Yellow River eastwards across the North China Plain to Shandong and then south into the valley of the Yangtze. There are no records of the non-Chinese languages formerly spoken in those areas and subsequently displaced by the Chinese expansion.\nHowever they are believed to have contributed to the vocabulary of Old Chinese, and may be the source of some of the many Chinese words whose origins are still unknown.\n\nJerry Norman and Mei Tsu-lin have identified early Austroasiatic loanwords in Old Chinese, possibly from the peoples of the lower Yangtze basin known to ancient Chinese as the Yue. For example, the early Chinese name ( \"jiāng\") for the Yangtze was later extended to a general word for \"river\" in south China.\nNorman and Mei suggest that the word is cognate with Vietnamese \"sông\" (from *\"krong\") and Mon \"kruŋ\" \"river\".\n\nHaudricourt and Strecker have proposed a number of borrowings from the Hmong–Mien languages. These include terms related to rice cultivation, which began in the middle Yangtze valley:\nOther words are believed to have been borrowed from languages to the south of the Chinese area, but it is not clear which was the original source, e.g.\n\nIn ancient times, the Tarim Basin was occupied by speakers of Indo-European Tocharian languages, the source of ( \"mì\") \"honey\", from proto-Tocharian *\"ḿət(ə)\" (where *\"ḿ\" is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B \"mit\"), cognate with English \"\".\nThe northern neighbours of Chinese contributed such words as ( \"dú\") \"calf\" – compare Mongolian \"tuɣul\" and Manchu \"tuqšan\".\n\nChinese philologists have long noted words with related meanings and similar pronunciations, sometimes written using the same character.\nHenri Maspero attributed some of these alternations to consonant clusters resulting from derivational affixes.\nSubsequent work has identified several such affixes, some of which appear to have cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.\n\nA common case is \"derivation by tone change\", in which words in the departing tone appear to be derived from words in other tones.\nIf Haudricourt's theory of the origin of the departing tone is accepted, these tonal derivations can be interpreted as the result of a derivational suffix .\nAs Tibetan has a similar suffix, it may be inherited from Sino-Tibetan.\nExamples include:\nAnother alternation involves transitive verbs with an unvoiced initial and passive or stative verbs with a voiced initial:\nSome scholars hold that the transitive verbs with voiceless initials are basic and the voiced initials reflect a de-transitivizing nasal prefix.\nOthers suggest that the transitive verbs were derived by the addition of a causative prefix to a stative verb, causing devoicing of the following voiced initial.\nBoth postulated prefixes have parallels in other Sino-Tibetan languages, in some of which they are still productive.\nSeveral other affixes have been proposed.\n\nOld Chinese morphemes were originally monosyllabic, but during the Western Zhou period many new bisyllabic words entered the language.\nFor example, over 30% of the vocabulary of the \"Mencius\" is polysyllabic, including 9% proper names, though monosyllabic words occur more frequently, accounting for 80–90% of the text.\nMany words, particularly expressive adjectives and adverbs, were formed by varieties of reduplication:\nOther bisyllabic morphemes include the famous ( \"húdié\") \"butterfly\" from the \"Zhuangzi\".\nMore words, especially nouns, were formed by compounding, including:\nHowever the components of compounds were not bound morphemes: they could still be used separately.\n\nA number of bimorphemic syllables appeared in the Classical period, resulting from the fusion of words with following unstressed particles or pronouns.\nThus the negatives and are viewed as fusions of the negators and respectively with a third-person pronoun .\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26211", "title": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act", "text": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the \"leaders\" of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they \"ordered\" others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.\n\nRICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 () and is codified at as . G. Robert Blakey, an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee, drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee's chairman, Senator John Little McClellan. It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and signed into law by Richard M. Nixon. While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime, its later application has been more widespread.\n\nBeginning in 1972, 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct.\n\nUnder RICO, a person who has committed \"at least two acts of racketeering activity\" drawn from a list of 35 crimes—27 federal crimes and 8 state crimes—within a 10-year period can be charged with racketeering if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an \"enterprise\". Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count. In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of \"racketeering activity.\" \n\nWhen the U.S. Attorney decides to indict someone under RICO, they have the option of seeking a pre-trial restraining order or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant's assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a performance bond. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of Mafia-related shell corporations often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict.\n\nIn many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense attorney. Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court since it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.\n\nRICO also permits a private individual \"damaged in his business or property\" by a \"racketeer\" to file a civil suit. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an \"enterprise\". The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same. There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise \"through\" the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)). In essence, the enterprise is either the 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' or 'perpetrator' of the racketeers. A civil RICO action can be filed in state or federal court.\n\nBoth the criminal and civil components allow the recovery of treble damages (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages).\n\nAlthough its primary intent was to deal with organized crime, Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob. He once told \"Time,\" \"We don't want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have Ivy League diplomas.\"\n\nInitially, prosecutors were skeptical of using RICO, mainly because it was unproven. The RICO Act was first used by the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York on September 18, 1979, in the United States v. Scotto. Scotto, who was convicted on charges of racketeering, accepting unlawful labor payments, and income tax evasion, headed the International Longshoreman's Association. During the 1980s and 1990s, federal prosecutors used the law to bring charges against several Mafia figures. The second major success was the Mafia Commission Trial, which resulted in several top leaders of New York City's Five Families getting what amounted to life sentences. By the turn of the century, RICO cases resulted in virtually all of the top leaders of the New York Mafia being sent to prison.\n\nBeginning in 1972, 33 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, adopted state RICO laws to cover additional state offenses under a similar scheme.\n\nUnder the law, the meaning of racketeering activity is set out at . As currently amended it includes:\n\n\nPattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The US Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they \"have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\" (\"H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.\") Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\n\nAlthough some of the RICO predicate acts are extortion and blackmail, one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict and or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies.\n\nViolations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges. In these instances, charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement. Further, charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant.\n\nAnti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged abuses of the legal system by individuals or corporations who use the courts as a weapon to retaliate against whistle blowers or victims or to silence another's speech. RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers and/or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts.\n\nAlthough the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion, blackmail, and racketeering, large-scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute, also known as the \"Kingpin Statute\". The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate conspiracies, whereas the RICO law covers a variety of organized criminal behaviors.\n\nThe RICO statute contains a provision that allows for the commencement of a civil action by a private party to recover damages sustained as a result of the commission of a RICO predicate offense.\n\nIn November 2018, rapper 6ix9ine, birth name Daniel Hernandez, and four members of the Nine Trey Gangsters were charged with racketeering related to operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution.\n\nIn 1979, the United States Federal Government went after Sonny Barger and several members and associates of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels using RICO. In \"United States vs. Barger\", the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a hung jury on the predicate acts: \"There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns.\"\n\nOn August 20, 2006, in Tampa, Florida, most of the state leadership members of street gang the Latin Kings were arrested in connection with RICO conspiracy charges to engage in racketeering and currently await trial. The operation, called \"Broken Crown\", targeted statewide leadership of the Latin Kings. The raid occurred at the Caribbean American Club. Along with Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Tampa Police Department, the State Attorney's Office, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were involved in the operation. Included in the arrest were leader Gilberto Santana from Brooklyn NY, Captain Luis Hernandez from Miami FL, Affiliate Celina Hernandez, Affiliate Michael Rocca, Affiliate Jessica Ramirez, Affiliate Reinaldo Arroyo, Affiliate Samual Alvarado, Omari Tolbert, Edwin DeLeon, and many others, totaling 39.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, RICO suits have been filed against Catholic dioceses, using anti-racketeering laws to prosecute the highers-up in the episcopacy for abuses committed by those under their authority. E.g. a Cleveland grand jury cleared two bishops of racketeering charges, finding that their mishandling of sex abuse claims did not amount to criminal racketeering. Notably, a similar suit was not filed against Cardinal Bernard Law, then Archbishop/Emeritus of Boston, prior to his assignment to Vatican City. In 2016, RICO charges were considered for cover-ups in Pennsylvania.\n\nLouisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, in office from 1976 to 1980, faced indictment with violations of both the Hobbs and the RICO laws. He was accused of compelling companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. On September 23, 1980, the Baton Rouge-based United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of five counts of extortion and racketeering. The sentence of ten years imprisonment, later upgraded to eighteen when other offenses were determined, and a $25,000 fine was suspended pending appeal, and Dozier remained free on bail. He eventually served nearly four years until a presidential commutation freed him in 1986.\n\nAround June 1984, the Key West Police Department located in Monroe County, Florida, was declared a criminal enterprise under the federal RICO statutes after a lengthy United States Department of Justice investigation. Several high-ranking officers of the department, including Deputy Police Chief Raymond Cassamayor, were arrested on federal charges of running a protection racket for illegal cocaine smugglers. At trial, a witness testified he routinely delivered bags of cocaine to the Deputy Chief's office at City Hall.\n\nOn 29 March 1989 American financier Michael Milken was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud relating to an investigation into an allegation of insider trading and other offenses. Milken was accused of using a wide-ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices. It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime. Milken pleaded guilty to six lesser felonies of securities fraud and tax evasion rather than risk spending the rest of his life in prison and ended up serving 22 months in prison. Milken was also ordered banned for life from the securities industry.\n\nOn September 7, 1988, Milken's employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, was threatened with RICO charges \"respondeat superior\", the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees' crimes. Drexel avoided RICO charges by entering an Alford plea to lesser felonies of stock parking and stock manipulation. In a carefully worded plea, Drexel said it was \"not in a position to dispute the allegations\" made by the Government. If Drexel had been indicted under RICO statutes, it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen. This would have taken precedence over all of the firm's other obligations—including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital base. If the bond ever had to be paid, its shareholders would have been practically wiped out. Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO, an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business. By at least one estimate, a RICO indictment would have destroyed the firm within a month. Years later, Drexel president and CEO Fred Joseph said that Drexel had no choice but to plead guilty because \"a financial institution cannot survive a RICO indictment.\"\n\nIn 2002, the former minority owners of the Montreal Expos baseball team filed charges under the RICO Act against Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig and former Expos owner Jeffrey Loria, claiming that Selig and Loria deliberately conspired to devalue the team for personal benefit in preparation for a move. If found liable, Major League Baseball could have been responsible for up to $300 million in punitive damages. The case lasted two years, successfully stalling the Expos' move to Washington or contraction during that time. It was eventually sent to arbitration, where the arbiters ruled in favor of Major League Baseball, permitting the move to Washington to take place.\n\nRICO laws were successfully cited in \"NOW v. Scheidler\", 510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed. 2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the National Organization for Women, sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to abortion clinics. The Court held that a RICO enterprise does not need an economic motive and that the Pro-Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise. The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity.\n\nIn April 2000, federal judge William J. Rea in Los Angeles, ruling in one Rampart scandal case, said that the plaintiffs could pursue RICO claims against the LAPD, an unprecedented finding. The idea that a police organization could be characterized as a racketeering enterprise shook up City Hall and further damaged the already-tarnished image of the LAPD. However, in July 2001, US District Judge Gary A. Feess said that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO because they are alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage.\n\nOn April 26, 2006, the Supreme Court heard \"Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams\", , which concerned what sort of corporations fell under the scope of RICO. Mohawk Industries had allegedly hired illegal aliens, in violation of RICO. The court was asked to decide whether Mohawk Industries, along with recruiting agencies, constitutes an \"enterprise\" that can be prosecuted under RICO, but in June of that year dismissed the case and remanded it to Court of Appeals.\n\nAlso in Tampa, on October 16, 2006, four members of the Gambino crime family (Capo Ronald Trucchio, Terry Scaglione, Steven Catallono, and Anthony Mucciarone and associate Kevin McMahon) were tried under RICO statutes, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, prosecuting attorneys Gregory O'Connell and Charles Rose used RICO charges to bring down the Lucchese family within an 18-month period. Dismantling the Lucchese family had a profound financial impact on previously Mafia held businesses such as construction, garment, and garbage hauling. Here they dominated and extorted money through taxes, dues, and fees. An example of this extortion was through the garbage business. Hauling of garbage from the World Trade Center cost the building owners $1.2 million per year to be removed when the Mafia monopolized the business, as compared to $150,000 per year when competitive bids could be sought.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice's Operation Family Secrets indicted 15 Chicago Outfit (also known as the Outfit, the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mob, or the Organization) members and associates under RICO predicates. Five defendants were convicted of RICO violations and other crimes. Six pleaded guilty, two died before trial and one was too sick to be tried.\n\nA federal grand jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down a 48-count indictment against former Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas Judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella. The judges were charged with RICO after allegedly committing acts of mail and wire fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and honest services fraud. The judges were accused of taking kickbacks for housing juveniles, that the judges convicted of mostly petty crimes, at a private detention center. The incident was dubbed by many local and national newspapers as the \"Kids for cash scandal\". On February 18, 2011, a federal jury found Michael Ciavarella guilty of racketeering because of his involvement in accepting illegal payments from Robert Mericle, the developer of PA Child Care, and Attorney Robert Powell, a co-owner of the facility. Ciavarella is facing 38 other counts in federal court.\n\nScott W. Rothstein is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and chief executive officer of the now-defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm. He was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a massive 1.2 billion dollar Ponzi scheme. On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to federal authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to RICO. Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010. Bond was denied by U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents, he was considered a flight risk. On June 9, 2010, Rothstein received a 50-year prison sentence after a hearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nEleven defendants were indicted on RICO charges for allegedly assisting AccessHealthSource, a local health care provider, in obtaining and maintaining lucrative contracts with local and state government entities in the city of El Paso, Texas, \"through bribery of and kickbacks to elected officials or himself and others, extortion under color of authority, fraudulent schemes and artifices, false pretenses, promises and representations and deprivation of the right of citizens to the honest services of their elected local officials\" (see indictment).\n\nFourteen defendants affiliated with FIFA were indicted under the RICO act on 47 counts for \"racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies, among other offenses, in connection with the defendants' participation in a 24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer.\" The defendants include many current and former high-ranking officers of FIFA and its affiliate CONCACAF. The defendants had allegedly used the enterprise as a front to collect millions of dollars in bribes, which may have influenced Russia and Qatar's winning bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups, respectively.\n\nIn 2015, the Drummond Company sued attorneys Terrence P. Collingsworth and William R. Scherer, the advocacy group International Rights Advocates (IRAdvocates), and Dutch businessman Albert van Bilderbeek, one of the owners of Llanos Oil, accusing them of violating RICO by alleging that Drummond had worked alongside Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia to murder labor union leaders within proximity of their Colombian coal mines, which Drummond denies.\n\nIn 2005, a federal jury ordered Fasano to pay $500,000 under RICO for illegally helping a client hide their assets in a bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Art Cohen vs. Donald J. Trump\" was a civil RICO class action suit filed October 18, 2013, accusing Donald Trump of misrepresenting Trump University \"to make tens of millions of dollars\" but delivering \"neither Donald Trump nor a university\". The case was being heard in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, No. 3:2013cv02519, by Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. It was scheduled for argument beginning November 28, 2016. However, on November 18 and shortly after Trump won the presidential election, this case and two others were settled for a total of $25 million and without any admission of wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nThe US RICO legislation has other equivalents in the rest of the world. In spite of Interpol having a standardized definition of RICO-like crimes, the interpretation and national implementation in legislation (and enforcement) widely varies. Most nations cooperate with the US on RICO enforcement only where their own related laws are specifically broken, but this is in line with the Interpol protocols for such matters.\n\nBy nation, alphabetically:\nWithout other nations enforcing similar legislation to RICO, many cross border RICO cases would not be possible. In the overall body of RICO cases that went to trial, at least 50% have had some non-US enforcement component to them. The offshoring of money away from the US finance system as part racketeering (and especially money laundering) is typically a major contributing factor to this.\n\nHowever, other countries have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins. Colombia and Mexico both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime as well as separate laws that allow the seizure of goods related to these crimes. This latter provides a specific chapter titled \"International Cooperation\", which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico, and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico, in terms of any international instruments they may be party to.\n\nArguably, this may be construed as allowing the application of the RICO Act in Mexico, provided the relevant international agreements exist among Mexico and countries with RICO or RICO-equivalent provisions.\n\n\n\n"}

Since André Weil's initial definition of intersection numbers, around 1949, there had been a question of how to provide a more flexible and computable theory.\n\nLet \"R\" be a (Noetherian, commutative) regular local ring and \"P\" and \"Q\" be prime ideals of \"R\". In 1958, Serre realized that classical algebraic-geometric ideas of multiplicity could be generalized using the concepts of homological algebra.

Session wrestlers most commonly are men who cater to a male clientele, but there are also women who provide the service, as well as female clients.\n\nSome clients partake in private wrestling matches for the athletic challenge, but for most clients, engaging a private wrestler is a form of sexual fantasy, fulfilling a desire for domination and submission. The sessions usually includes wrestling or fighting in which the provider is stronger or more skilled than their opponent. The fantasy may also have an intellectual or emotional component, with the client trying to (or pretending to try to) take control, but failing. Session wrestling rarely involves sex, or sex acts, though it may include nudity.

Also, discussed at this stage is the fee, location, rules, duration, and attire. The matches are commonly categorized into several types:\n\n\nMixed wrestling is a private session wrestling match between a woman and a man. Many female bodybuilders take part in mixed wrestling matches.

Mumler in the 1860s. Mumler discovered the technique by accident, after he saw a second person in a photograph he took of himself, which he found was actually a double exposure. Seeing there was a market for it, Mumler started working as a medium, taking people's pictures and doctoring the negatives to add lost loved ones into them (mostly using other photographs as basis). Mumler's fraud was discovered after he put identifiable living Boston residents in the photos as spirits.\n\nOther spirit photographers also started to sell photographs. A later spirit photographer was Fred A. Hudson, who took many spirit photographs for spiritualists in 1872. Through the 1880s into the early 20th century spirit photography remained popular, with notable proponents such as Arthur Conan Doyle and William Crookes. William Stainton Moses, another spiritualist, claimed that spirit photography operated by means of a fluid substance called ectoplasm, in which the spirits take form. Some spiritualists authored books supporting spirit photography. Georgiana Houghton wrote \"Chronicles of the Photographs of Spiritual Beings and Phenomena Invisible to the Material Eye\" (1892) and James Coates wrote \"Photographing the Invisible\" (1911).\n\nOne of the later spirit photographers was William Hope (1863–1933). The psychical researcher Harry Price revealed that the photographs of Hope were frauds. Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.\n\nHope still retained a noted following from spiritualists such as Charles Lakeman Tweedale author of \"Man's Survival After Death\" (1920) as well as the author and spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle, who refused to accept any evidence that Hope was a fraud and went to great lengths to clear his name, including writing a book supporting spirit photography, \"The Case for Spirit Photography\" (1922). In his book \"Fifty Years of Psychical Research\", Price listed many spirit photographers who had been exposed as frauds. Price who had spent most of his life studying psychical phenomena wrote that \"There is \"no\" good evidence that a spirit photograph has ever been produced\", which is also the view of most psychical researchers.\n\nOther spirit photographers exposed as frauds include David Duguid and Edward Wyllie. Ronald Pearsall exposed the tricks of spirit photography in his book \"The Table-Rappers\" (1972).\n\nAccording to University of Westminster professor Annette Hill, unusual light sources were often interpreted as \"ghost lights\" in spirit photography. Hill says that with the advent of digital photography, \"the ghost light is re-imagined as an orb\", and many paranormal-themed websites show pictures containing visual artifacts they refer to as \"orbs\" that are claimed and debated as evidence of spirit presence, especially among ghost hunters. However, such common visual artifacts are simply a result of flash photography reflecting light off solid particles, such as dust or pollen, or liquid particles, especially rain, or even foreign material within the camera lens, and are especially common with modern compact and ultra-compact digital cameras. Fujifilm describes the artifacts as a common photographic problem.\n\n"}

The number of speakers is estimated to be in the region of 12 million. The language is taught in Swaziland and some South African schools in Mpumalanga, particularly former KaNgwane areas. Swazi is an official language of Swaziland (along with English), and is also one of the eleven official languages of South Africa.\n\nAlthough the preferred term is \"Swati\" among native speakers, in English it is generally referred to as \"Swazi\". Swazi is most closely related to the other \"Tekela\" Nguni languages, like Phuthi and Northern Transvaal (Sumayela) Ndebele, but is also very close to the \"Zunda\" Nguni languages: Zulu, Southern Ndebele, Northern Ndebele, and Xhosa.\n\nSwazi spoken in Swaziland can be divided into four dialects corresponding to the four administrative regions of the country: Hhohho, Lubombo, Manzini, and Shiselweni.\n\nSwazi has at least two varieties: the standard, prestige variety spoken mainly in the north, centre and southwest of the country, and a less prestigious variety spoken elsewhere.\n\nIn the far south, especially in towns such as Nhlangano and Hlatikhulu, the variety of the language spoken is significantly influenced by isiZulu. Many Swazis (plural \"emaSwati,\" singular \"liSwati\"), including those in the south who speak this variety, do not regard it as 'proper' Swazi. This is what may be referred to as the second dialect in the country. The sizeable number of Swazi speakers in South Africa (mainly in the Mpumalanga province, and in Soweto) are considered by Swaziland Swazi speakers to speak a non-standard form of the language.\n\nUnlike the variant in the south of Swaziland, the Mpumalanga variety appears to be less influenced by Zulu, and is thus considered closer to standard Swazi. However, this Mpumalanga variety is distinguishable by distinct intonation, and perhaps distinct tone patterns. Intonation patterns (and informal perceptions of 'stress') in Mpumalanga Swazi are often considered discordant to the Swazi ear. This South African variety of Swazi is considered to exhibit influence from other South African languages spoken close to Swazi.\n\nA feature of the standard prestige variety of Swazi (spoken in the north and centre of Swaziland) is the royal style of slow, heavily stressed enunciation, which is anecdotally claimed to have a 'mellifluous' feel to its hearers.\n\nSwazi does not distinguish between places of articulation in its clicks. They are dental (as ) or might also be alveolar (as ). It does, however, distinguish five or six manners of articulation and of manner, including tenuis, aspirated, voiced, breathy voiced, nasal, and breathy-voiced nasal.\nThe consonants /ts k ng mb/ have two sounds. /ts/ and /k/ can both occur as ejective sounds, /tsʼ/ and /kʼ/, but their common forms are /tsʰ/ and /k̬/. The sounds of /ng/ and /mb/ differ when at the beginning of stems as /ŋ/ and /mbʱ/, and commonly as /ŋɡ/ and /mɓ/ within words.\n\nThe Swazi noun (') consists of two essential parts, the prefix (') and the stem (\"\"). Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other Bantu languages.\n\nThe following table gives an overview of Swazi noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.\n\nVerbs use the following prefixes for the subject:\n\nMonths in Swazi/Swati:\n\nThe following example of text is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\"Bonkhe bantfu batalwa bakhululekile balingana ngalokufananako ngesitfunti nangemalungelo. Baphiwe ingcondvo nekucondza kanye nanembeza ngakoke bafanele batiphatse nekutsi baphatse nalabanye ngemoya webuzalwane.\"\n\nThe Declaration reads in English:\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\n\n\n"}
