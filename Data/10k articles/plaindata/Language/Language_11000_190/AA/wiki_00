He specialised in the study of Quran, Hadith and Arab literature. He is ranked among the foremost poets of Arabic from Mansura, Sindh. He was also a teacher to many Arab scholars, administrators and travellers to Sindh.\n\nIt is said that at the request of his clan leader Mabruk, Abu Raja Al-Sindi embraced Islam. And was among those who translated the Quran into Sindhi language during the reign of the Abbasid ruler Harun al-Rashid and the Abbasid Vizier of Sindh Abdullah Ibn Omar Hibari (d. 893) governed for about 30 years and made great contribution to the cultural and economic development of the Sindhi province. It was during the Hibari period that Sindh became closer in its ties and relations with the city of Baghdad (Abode of Peace) Due to the patronage extended by early Abbasid Caliphs and their Baramakid Grand Vizier's, Abu Raja Al-Sindi and a number of Sindhi's went to Baghdad and engaged themselves in scientific and literary pursuits they translated a large number of Sanskrit books on mathematics, astronomy, astrology, medicine, literature and ethics into Arabic.\n\nAmong those who traveled to Baghdad was the mathematician Sind ibn Ali, a colleague of Al-Khwarizmi, the two authors have also published texts under the name of Kitāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala, they improved the structure of basic mathematics and translated and worked on the famous astronomical chart the Zij al-Sindhind.\n\nZīj al-Sindhind (Arabic: زيج \"astronomical tables of Sind and Hind\") is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendar and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendar, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic Zij's based on the Indian astronomical methods known as the Sindhind. The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. This work marked the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of non-traditional methods of study and calculation\n\n"}

His works include important archetypes and paradigms from Hindu culture. In his poems there are notions of eternal return and transmigration, which are considered anchors of Indian philosophy.\n\nHis father, Vicente Mariano Barreto, was a man of considerable erudition and a pedagogical sense that bore fruit in his child. Having completed his secondary education in Panjim, Adeodato Barreto left for Portugal at the age of seventeen and enrolled at Coimbra in the law school in 1923 and, the following year, in the Faculty of Arts, for a course in history and philosophy. In Coimbra he was elected chairman of the Centro Republicano-Académico in October 1929. He graduated in law in 1928 and in historical and philosophical sciences in 1929, respectively, from the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts, University of Coimbra.\n\nHe taught in Figueira da Foz and Coimbra. He was later a law clerk in Montemor-o-Novo and a notary in Aljustrel. He collaborated assiduously with the periodicals \"O Diabo\" and \"Seara Nova\". He founded \"Índia Nova\" (1928-1929), which published six issues, and \"Círculo\" (1934), which had in all seven numbers.\n\nHe was the father of , the Portuguese politician and trade unionist. He was a close friend of Flausino Torres, with whom he also studied.\n\nHis dream, even while still at the university, was to create a newspaper. Thus was born the \"Índia Nova\", in Coimbra, where he was a director along with José Teles and Telo Mascarenhas. Next he founded the \"Instituto Indiano\" at the Faculdade de Letras de Coimbra. This had the support of Mendes dos Remédios, Providência da Costa, e Joaquim de Carvalho who promptly helped to organise it, and correspond with renowned Orientalists such as Rabindranath Tagore and Silvain Lévi. The Institute's activities were crowned with some success. It resulted in conferences, newspaper articles as well as the publication of Edições Swatwa. However, Adeodato Barreto devoted himself to the translation of the work of Romain Rolland on the life of Mahatma Gandhi. When it was completed and announced to its famous writer and Nobel Prize in Literature winner, its original author answered him immediately in an appreciative letter and declined to retain any copyright. The translation of the work on Mahatma Gandhi was however no published due to several editorial difficulties then.\n\nOn finishing his university studies, he was absorbed in the 4th Stage of Professional Group of High Schools. He had intended to teach, but soon opted for the legal profession. In fact, he was appointed associate professor of the Liceu de Évora in 1932 and he was soon accepted for the position of law clerk in Montemor-o-Novo. Months later, he was appointed notary in Aljustrel and remained there four years. In this part of the Alentejo, Adeodato Barreto founded and directed a new periodical called \"O Círculo\" and collaborated assiduously with the periodicals \"O Diabo\" and \"Seara Nova\". His book \"Civilização Hindu\" was born of a series of articles previously published in the \"Seara Nova\". Later he wrote \"O Livro da Vida \"(The Book of Life), a collection of poems published posthumously in 1940 in Goa.\n\nIn Coimbra, Barreto studied Esperanto, the international language, and was an enthusiast and advocate for its use. In Aljustrel he contributed to the emergence of a \"burgeoning Esperanto movement\", in the words of Francisco Rasquinho.\n\nHis aim to intervene among the most unprotected sections led him to create a weekly to provide support to the poor and to offer free evening literacy classes to mine workers. His activities for the disadvantaged did not go unnoticed by the PIDE, who gave it a subversive connotation. So Barreto was watched and, later, when he ran for the post of notary in Goa he was passed over due to his politics.\n\nTuberculosis claimed him at 32, on 6 August 1937 at the Sanatório dos Olivais in Coimbra.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18950939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950939", "title": "Arthur Koestler", "text": "Arthur Koestler\n\nArthur Koestler, (, ; ; ; 5 September 1905 – 1 March 1983) was a Hungarian-British author and journalist. Koestler was born in Budapest and, apart from his early school years, was educated in Austria. In 1931 Koestler joined the Communist Party of Germany until, disillusioned by Stalinism, he resigned in 1938. In 1940 he published his novel \"Darkness at Noon\", an anti-totalitarian work that gained him international fame. Over the next 43 years, from his residence in Britain, Koestler espoused many political causes, and wrote novels, memoirs, biographies and numerous essays. In 1968 he was awarded the Sonning Prize \"for [his] outstanding contribution to European culture\" and in 1972 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 1976 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and in 1979 with terminal leukaemia. In 1983 he and his wife committed suicide at their home in London.\n\nKoestler was born in Budapest to Henrik and Adele Koestler (\"née\" Jeiteles). He was an only child. His father Henrik Koestler had been born on 18 August 1869 in the town of Miskolc in northeastern Hungary. His paternal grandfather Lipót Koestler, was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1861 he married Karolina Schon, the daughter of a prosperous timber merchant. Henrik left school at age 16 and took a job as an errand boy with a firm of drapers. He taught himself English, German and French, and eventually became a partner in the firm. He then set up his own business importing textiles into Hungary.\n\nArthur's mother, Adele Koestler (\"née\" Jeiteles), was born on 25 June 1871 into a prominent Jewish family in Prague. Among her ancestors was , a prominent 18th-century physician and essayist, whose son Juda Jeitteles became a well-known poet. Beethoven set some of his poems to music. Adele's father, Jacob Jeiteles, moved the family to Vienna, where she grew up in relative prosperity until about 1890. Faced with financial difficulties, her father abandoned his wife and daughter, and emigrated to the United States. Adele and her mother moved from Vienna to Budapest to stay with Adele's married sister.\n\nHenrik Koestler met Adele in 1898 and married her in 1900. Arthur, their only child, was born on 5 September 1905. The Koestlers lived in spacious, well-furnished, rented apartments in various predominantly Jewish districts of Budapest. During Arthur's early years they employed a cook/housekeeper as well as a foreign governess. His primary school education started at an experimental private kindergarten founded by Laura Striker (\"née\" Polányi). Her daughter Eva Striker later became Koestler's lover, and they remained friends all his life.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I in 1914 deprived Koestler's father of foreign suppliers and his business collapsed. Facing destitution, the family moved temporarily to a boarding house in Vienna. When the war ended the family returned to Budapest.\n\nAs noted in Koestler's autobiography, he and his family were sympathetic to the short-lived Hungarian Bolshevik Revolution of 1919. Though the small soap factory owned at the time by Koestler's father was nationalized, the elder Koestler was appointed its director by the revolutionary government and was well-paid. Even though the autobiography was published in 1953, when Koestler had become an outspoken anti-Communist, he wrote favorably of the Hungarian Communists and their leader Béla Kun, and recalled fondly the hopes for a better future he had felt as a teenager in revolutionary Budapest.\n\nLater the Koestlers witnessed the temporary occupation of Budapest by the Romanian Army and then the White Terror under the right-wing regime of Admiral Horthy. In 1920 the family returned to Vienna, where Henrik set up a successful new import business.\n\nIn September 1922 Arthur enrolled in the Vienna Polytechnic University to study engineering, joining a Zionist duelling student fraternity. When Henrik's latest business failed Koestler stopped attending lectures, and was expelled for non-payment of fees. In March 1926 he wrote a letter to his parents telling them that he was going to Palestine for a year to work as an assistant engineer in a factory, for the purpose of gaining experience that would help him find a job in Austria. On 1 April 1926 he left Vienna for Palestine.\n\nFor a few weeks Koestler lived in a kibbutz, but his application to join the collective (\"Kvutzat Heftziba\") was rejected by its members. For the next twelve months he supported himself with menial jobs in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Frequently penniless and starving, he often depended on friends and acquaintances for survival. He occasionally wrote or edited broadsheets and other publications, mostly in German. In the spring of 1927 he left Palestine briefly, to run the Secretariat of Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Party in Berlin.\n\nLater that same year, through a friend, Koestler obtained the position of Middle East correspondent for the prestigious Berlin-based Ullstein-Verlag group of newspapers. He returned to Jerusalem, where for the next two years he produced detailed political essays, as well as some lighter reportage, for his principal employer and for other newspapers. He travelled extensively, interviewed heads of state, kings, presidents and prime ministers, and greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. As noted in his autobiography, he came to realize that he would never really fit in Palestine's Zionist Jewish community, the Yishuv, and particularly that he would not be able to have a journalistic career in Hebrew.\n\nIn June 1929, while on leave in Berlin, Koestler successfully lobbied at Ullstein for a transfer away from Palestine. In September he was sent to Paris to fill a vacancy in the bureau of the Ullstein News Service. A year later, in 1931, he was called to Berlin and appointed science editor of the \"Vossische Zeitung\" and science adviser to the Ullstein newspaper empire. The same year he was Ullstein's choice to represent the paper on board the \"Graf Zeppelin\"'s Polar flight, which carried a team of scientists and the Polar aviator Lincoln Ellsworth to 82 degrees North (thus not to the North Pole) and back. Koestler was the only journalist on board: his live wireless broadcasts, and subsequent articles and lecture tours throughout Europe, brought him further kudos. Soon afterwards he was appointed foreign editor and assistant editor-in-chief of the mass-circulation \"Berliner Zeitung am Mittag\".\n\nIn 1931 Koestler, encouraged by Eva Striker, and impressed by what he believed to be the achievements of the Soviet Union, became a supporter of Marxism-Leninism, and on 31 December 1931, he applied for membership of the Communist Party of Germany. As noted in his biography, he was disappointed in the conduct of the Vossische Zeitung, \"The Flagship of German Liberalism\", which adapted to changing times by firing Jewish journalists, hiring writers with marked German Nationalist views, and dropping its longstanding campaign against capital punishment. This led Koestler to the conclusion that Liberals and moderate Democrats could not stand against the rising Nazi tide and that the Communists were the only real counter-force.\n\nKoestler wrote a book on the Soviet Five-Year Plan, but it did not meet with the approval of the Soviet authorities and was never published in Russian. Only the German version, heavily censored, was published in an edition for German-speaking Soviet citizens.\n\nIn 1932 Koestler travelled in Turkmenistan and Central Asia. In September 1933 he returned to Paris and for the next two years was active in anti-Fascist movements, writing propaganda under the direction of Willi Münzenberg, the Comintern's chief propaganda director in the West.\n\nIn 1935 Koestler married Dorothy Ascher, a fellow Communist activist (they separated amicably in 1937).\n\nIn 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, he undertook a visit to General Francisco Franco's headquarters in Seville on behalf of the Comintern, pretending to be a Franco sympathizer and using credentials from the London daily \"News Chronicle\" as cover. He collected evidence of the direct involvement of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany on Franco's side, which at that time the Nationalist rebels were still trying to conceal. He had to escape after he was recognized and denounced as a Communist by a German former colleague. Back in France he wrote \"L'Espagne Ensanglantée\", which was later incorporated into his book \"Spanish Testament\".\n\nIn 1937 he returned to Loyalist Spain as a war correspondent for the \"News Chronicle\", but was in Málaga when it fell to the Nationalists and was captured. From February until June he was imprisoned in Seville under sentence of death. He was eventually exchanged for a \"high value\" Nationalist prisoner held by the Loyalists, the wife of one of Franco's ace fighter pilots. Koestler thus became one of the few authors to have been sentenced to death, an experience he wrote about in \"Dialogue with Death\". As he noted in his autobiography, his separated wife Dorothy Ascher had greatly contributed to saving his life by very intensive months-long lobbying in Britain. When he arrived in Britain after his release, they tried to resume their marriage, but Koestler's gratitude to her proved an insufficient foundation for a daily life together.\n\nKoestler then returned to France, where he agreed to write a sex encyclopaedia to support himself. It was published to great success under the title \"The Encyclopœdia of Sexual Knowledge\" under the pseudonyms of \"Drs A. Costler, A. Willy, and Others\".\n\nIn July 1938 Koestler finished work on his novel \"The Gladiators.\" Later that year he resigned from the Communist Party and started work on a new novel that in 1941 was published in London under the title \"Darkness at Noon\". It was also in 1938 that he became editor of \"Die Zukunft\" (The Future), a German-language weekly published in Paris.\n\nIn 1939 Koestler met and formed an attachment to the British sculptor Daphne Hardy. They lived together in Paris, and she translated the manuscript of \"Darkness at Noon\" from German into English in early 1940. She smuggled it out of France when they left ahead of the German occupation and arranged for its publication after reaching London that year.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II Koestler returned from the South of France to Paris. He attempted to turn himself in to the authorities as a foreign national several times and was finally arrested on 2 October 1939. The French government first detained Koestler at Stade Roland Garros until he was moved to Le Vernet Internment Camp among other \"undesirable aliens\", most of them refugees. He was released in early 1940 in response to strong British pressure. Milicent Bagot, an intelligence officer at MI5, recommended his release from Camp Vernet, but said that he should not be granted a British visa. (She was later the model for Connie Sachs in the George Smiley spy novels of John Le Carre and was the first to warn that Kim Philby of MI6 was probably spying for the USSR.) Koestler describes the period 1939 to 1940 and his incarceration in Le Vernet in his memoir \"Scum of the Earth\".\n\nShortly before the German invasion of France Koestler joined the French Foreign Legion in order to get out of the country. He deserted in North Africa and tried to get back to England. While waiting to gain passage on a ship out of Lisbon, he heard a false report that the ship on which Hardy was travelling had sunk, and that she and his manuscript were lost. He attempted suicide, but survived.\n\nArriving in the UK without an entry permit, Koestler was imprisoned pending examination of his case. He was still in prison when Daphne Hardy's English translation of his book \"Darkness at Noon\" was published in early 1941.\n\nImmediately after Koestler was released he volunteered for Army service. While awaiting his call-up papers, between January and March 1941, he wrote \"Scum of the Earth\", the first book he wrote in English. For the next twelve months he served in the Pioneer Corps.\n\nIn March 1942 Koestler was assigned to the Ministry of Information, where he worked as a scriptwriter for propaganda broadcasts and films. In his spare time he wrote \"Arrival and Departure\", the third in his trilogy of novels that included \"Darkness at Noon\". He also wrote several essays, which were subsequently collected and published in \"The Yogi and the Commissar\". One of the essays, titled \"On Disbelieving Atrocities\" (originally published in \"The New York Times\"), was about Nazi atrocities against the Jews.\n\nDaphne Hardy, who had been doing war work in Oxford, joined Koestler in London in 1943, but they parted company a few months later. They remained good friends until Koestler's death.\n\nIn December 1944 Koestler travelled to Palestine with accreditation from \"The Times\". There he had a clandestine meeting with Menachem Begin, the head of the Irgun paramilitary organisation, who was wanted by the British and had a 500-pound bounty on his head. Koestler tried to persuade him to abandon militant attacks and accept a two-state solution for Palestine, but failed. Many years later Koestler wrote in his memoirs: \"When the meeting was over, I realised how naïve I had been to imagine that my arguments would have even the slightest influence.\"\n\nStaying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler collected material for his next novel, \"Thieves in the Night.\" When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had started to see before going out to Palestine, was waiting for him. In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over the next three years Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived just a few miles from the Koestler cottage.\n\nIn 1948, when war broke out between the newly declared State of Israel and the neighbouring Arab states, Koestler was accredited by several newspapers, American, British and French, and travelled to Israel. Mamaine Paget went with him. They arrived in Israel on 4 June and stayed there until October. Later that year they decided to leave the UK for a while and move to France. News that his long-pending application for British nationality had been granted reached him in France in late December and early in the 1949 he returned to London to swear the oath of allegiance to the British Crown.\n\nIn January 1949 Koestler and Mamaine moved to a house he had bought in France, where he wrote a contribution to \"The God That Failed\" and finished work on \"Promise and Fulfilment\". The latter book received poor reviews in both the U.S. and the UK. His other book published in 1949 was \"Insight and Outlook\". This too received lukewarm reviews.\n\nIn July Koestler began work on \"Arrow in the Blue\", the first volume of his autobiography, and hired a new part-time secretary, Cynthia Jefferies, who eventually became his third wife. In the autumn he started work on \"The Age of Longing\", on which he continued to work until mid-1950.\n\nKoestler had reached agreement with his first wife, Dorothy, on an amicable divorce, and their marriage was dissolved on 15 December 1949. This cleared the way for his marriage to Mamaine Paget, which took place on 15 April 1950 at the British Consulate in Paris.\n\nIn June Koestler delivered a major anti-Communist speech in Berlin under the auspices of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, an organisation funded (though he did not know this) by the Central Intelligence Agency. In the autumn he went to the United States on a lecture tour, during which he lobbied for permanent resident status in the U.S. At the end of October, on impulse, he bought Island Farm being a small island with a house on it on the Delaware River near New Hope, Pennsylvania, with the intention of living there at least for part of each year.\n\nIn January 1951 a dramatised version of \"Darkness at Noon\", by Sidney Kingsley, opened in New York. It won the New York Drama Critics Award. Koestler donated all his royalties from the play to a fund he had set up to help struggling authors, the Fund for Intellectual Freedom (FIF). In June a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate to grant Koestler permanent residence in the U.S. Koestler sent tickets for the play to his House sponsor Richard Nixon and his Senate sponsor Owen Brewster, a close confidant of Joseph McCarthy. The bill became law on 23 August 1951 as Private Law 221 Chapter 343 \"AN ACT For the relief of Arthur Koestler\".\n\nIn 1951 the last of Koestler's political works, \"The Age of Longing\", was published. In it he examined the political landscape of post-war Europe and the problems facing the continent.\n\nIn August 1952 his marriage to Mamaine collapsed. They separated, but remained close until her sudden and unexpected death in June 1954. The book \"\", edited by Mamaine's twin sister Celia Goodman, gives an insight into their lives together.\n\nKoestler now decided to make his permanent home in Britain. In May 1953 he bought a three-storey Georgian town house on Montpelier Square in London, and sold his houses in France and the United States.\n\nThe first two volumes of his autobiography, \"Arrow in the Blue\", which covers his life up to December 1931 when he joined the German Communist Party, and \"The Invisible Writing\", which covers the years 1932 to 1940, were published in 1952 and 1954, respectively. A collection of essays, \"The Trail of the Dinosaur and Other Essays\", on the perils he saw facing western civilisation, was published in 1955.\n\nOn 13 April 1955 Janine Graetz, with whom Koestler had an on-off relationship over a period of years, gave birth to his daughter Cristina. Despite repeated attempts by Janine to persuade Koestler to show some interest in her, Koestler had almost no contact with Cristina throughout his life. Early in 1956 he arranged for Cynthia to have an illegal abortion.\n\nKoestler's main political activity during 1955 was his campaign for the abolition of capital punishment (which in the UK was by hanging). In July he started work on \"Reflections on Hanging\".\n\nAlthough Koestler resumed work on a biography of Kepler in 1955, it was not published until 1959, and in the interim it acquired the title \"The Sleepwalkers\". The emphasis of the book had changed and broadened to \"A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe\", which also became the book's subtitle. Copernicus and Galileo were added to Kepler as the major subjects of the book.\n\nLater in 1956, as a consequence of the Hungarian Uprising, Koestler became busy organising anti-Soviet meetings and protests.\n\nIn June 1957 Koestler gave a lecture at a symposium in Alpbach, Austria, and fell in love with the village. He bought land there, had a house built, and for the next twelve years used it as a place for summer vacations and for organising symposia.\n\nIn May 1958 he had a hernia operation. In December he left for India and Japan, and was away until early 1959. The resulting book was \"The Lotus and the Robot\".\n\nIn early 1960, on his way back from a conference in San Francisco, Koestler interrupted his journey at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where some experimental research was going on with hallucinogens. He tried psilocybin and had a \"bad trip\". Later, when he arrived at Harvard to see Timothy Leary, he experimented with more drugs, but was not enthusiastic about that experience either.\n\nIn November 1960 he was elected to a Fellowship of The Royal Society of Literature.\n\nIn 1962, along with his agent, A D Peters and the editor of The Observer, David Astor, Koestler set up a scheme to encourage prison inmates to engage in arts activities and to reward their efforts. The charity exists to this day and holds an exhibition in London each year.\n\nKoestler's book \"The Act of Creation\" came out in May 1964. In November he undertook a lecture tour of various universities in California. In 1965 he married Cynthia in New York, and moved to California, where he participated in a series of seminars at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.\n\nKoestler spent most of 1966 and the early months of 1967 working on \"The Ghost in the Machine\". In his article \"Return Trip to Nirvana\", published in 1967 in the \"Sunday Telegraph\", Koestler wrote about the drug culture and his own experiences with hallucinogens. The article also challenged the defence of drugs in Aldous Huxley's \"The Doors of Perception\".\n\nIn April 1968 Koestler was awarded the Sonning Prize \"for [his] outstanding contribution to European culture\". \"The Ghost in the Machine\" was published in August of same year and in the autumn he received an honorary doctorate from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada. In the later part of November the Koestlers flew to Australia for a number of television appearances and press interviews.\n\nThe first half of the 1970s saw the publication of four more books by Koestler: \"The Case of the Midwife Toad\" (1971), \"The Roots of Coincidence\" and \"The Call-Girls\" (both 1972), and \"\" (1974). In the New Year Honours List for 1972 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\n\nEarly in 1976 Koestler was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The trembling of his hand made writing progressively more difficult. He cut back on overseas trips and spent the summer months at a farmhouse in Denston, Suffolk, which he had bought in 1971. That same year saw the publication of \"The Thirteenth Tribe\", which presents his theory about the Khazar origins of European Jewry.\n\nIn 1978 Koestler published \"\". In 1980 he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. His book \"Bricks to Babel\" was published that year. His final book, \"Kaleidoscope\", containing essays from \"Drinkers of Infinity\" and \"\", with some later pieces and stories, was published in 1981.\n\nDuring the final years of his life, Koestler, Brian Inglis and Tony Bloomfield established the KIB Society (named from the initials of their surnames) to sponsor research \"outside the scientific orthodoxies\". After his death it was renamed The Koestler Foundation.\n\nIn his capacity as Vice President of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, later renamed Exit, Koestler wrote a pamphlet on suicide, outlining the case both for and against, with a section dealing specifically with how best to do it. He and Cynthia killed themselves on the evening of 1 March 1983 with overdoses of the barbiturate Tuinal taken with alcohol. Their bodies were discovered on the morning of 3 March, by which time they had been dead for thirty-six hours.\n\nKoestler had stated more than once that he was afraid, not of being dead, but of the process of dying. His suicide was not unexpected among his close friends. Shortly before his suicide his doctor had discovered a swelling in the groin which indicated a metastasis of the cancer.\n\nKoestler's suicide note:\nThe note was dated June 1982. Below it appeared the following:\n\nSince the above was written in June 1982, my wife decided that after thirty-four years of working together she could not face life after my death.\n\nFurther down the page appeared Cynthia's own farewell note:\n\nI fear both death and the act of dying that lies ahead of us. I should have liked to finish my account of working for Arthur – a story which began when our paths happened to cross in 1949. However, I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner resources.\nDouble suicide has never appealed to me, but now Arthur's incurable diseases have reached a stage where there is nothing else to do.\n\nThe funeral was held at the Mortlake Crematorium in South London on 11 March.\n\nControversy arose over why Koestler allowed, consented to, or (according to some critics) compelled his wife's simultaneous suicide. She was only fifty-five years old and was believed to be in good health. In a typewritten addition to her husband's suicide note Cynthia Koestler wrote that she could not live without her husband. Reportedly, few of their friends were surprised by this admission, apparently perceiving that Cynthia lived her life through her husband and that she had no \"life of her own\". Her absolute devotion to Koestler can be seen clearly in her partially completed memoirs. Yet according to a profile of Koestler by Peter Kurth:\n\nAll their friends were troubled by what Julian Barnes calls \"the unmentionable, half-spoken question\" of Koestler's responsibility for Cynthia's actions.\n\n\"Did he bully her into it?\" asks Barnes. And \"if he didn't bully her into it, why didn't he bully her out of it?\" Because, with hindsight, the evidence that Cynthia's life had been ebbing with her husband's was all too apparent.\n\nAnother controversy was occasioned by the terms of Koestler's will. With the exception of some minor bequests, Koestler left the residue of his estate, about one million pounds, to the promotion of research into the paranormal through the founding of a chair in parapsychology at a university in Britain. The trustees of the estate had great difficulty finding a university willing to establish such a chair. Oxford, Cambridge, King's College London and University College London were approached, and all refused. Eventually the trustees reached agreement with Edinburgh University to set up a chair in accordance with Koestler's request.\n\nKoestler's relations with women have been a source of controversy. David Cesarani alleged in his biography of Koestler, published in 1998, that Koestler had been a serial rapist, citing the case of the British feminist writer Jill Craigie, who said that she had been one of his victims in 1951. Feminist protesters forced the removal of his bust from Edinburgh University. In his biography, \"Koestler: The Indispensable Intellectual\" (2009), Michael Scammell countered that Craigie was the only woman to go on record that she had been raped by Koestler, and had done so at a dinner party more than fifty years after the event. Claims that Koestler had been violent were added by Craigie later, although Scammell concedes that Koestler could be rough and sexually aggressive.\n\nOthers, including Cesarani, claim that Koestler had misogynistic tendencies. He engaged in numerous sexual affairs and generally treated the women in his life badly. In his autobiography, \"The Invisible Writing\", Koestler admits to having denounced Nadezhda Smirnova, with whom he was having a relationship, to the Soviet secret police.\n\nKoestler wrote several major novels, two volumes of autobiographical works, two volumes of reportage, a major work on the history of science, several volumes of essays, and a considerable body of other writing and articles on subjects as varied as genetics, euthanasia, Eastern mysticism, neurology, chess, evolution, psychology, the paranormal and more.\n\n\"Darkness at Noon\" was one of the most influential anti-Soviet books ever written. Its influence in Europe on Communists and sympathisers and, indirectly, on the outcomes of elections in Europe, was substantial. Geoffrey Wheatcroft believes that Koestler's most important books were the five completed before he was 40: his first memoirs and the trilogy of anti-totalitarian novels that included \"Darkness at Noon\".\n\nKoestler embraced a multitude of political as well as non-political issues. Zionism, communism, anti-communism, voluntary euthanasia, abolition of capital punishment, particularly hanging, and the abolition of quarantine for dogs being reimported into the United Kingdom are examples.\n\nIn his book \"The Case of the Midwife Toad\" (1971) Koestler defended the biologist Paul Kammerer, who claimed to have found experimental support for Lamarckian inheritance. According to Koestler, Kammerer's experiments on the midwife toad may have been tampered with by a Nazi sympathizer at the University of Vienna. Koestler came to the conclusion that a kind of modified \"Mini-Lamarckism\" may explain some rare evolutionary phenomena.\n\nKoestler criticised neo-Darwinism in a number of his books, but he was not opposed to the theory of evolution in general terms. Biology professor Harry Gershenowitz described Koestler as a \"popularizer\" of science despite his views not being accepted by the \"orthodox academic community\". According to an article in the \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Koestler was an \"advocate of Lamarckian evolution – and a critic of Darwinian natural selection as well as a believer in psychic phenomena\".\n\nIn addition to his specific critiques of neo-Darwinism, Koestler was opposed to what he saw as dangerous scientific reductionism more generally, including the behaviourism school of psychology, promoted in particular by B. F. Skinner during the 1930s. Koestler assembled a group of high-profile antireductionist scientists, including C. H. Waddington, W. H. Thorpe and Ludwig von Bertalanffy, for a meeting at his retreat in Alpbach in 1968. This was one of many attempts which Koestler made to gain acceptance within the mainstream of science, a strategy which brought him into conflict with individuals such as Peter Medawar who saw themselves as defending the integrity of science from outsiders. Although he never gained significant credibility as a scientist, Koestler published a number of works at the border between science and philosophy, such as \"Insight and Outlook\", \"The Act of Creation\" and \"The Ghost in the Machine\".\n\nMysticism and a fascination with the paranormal imbued much of Koestler's later work and he became known for endorsing a number of paranormal phenomena, such as extrasensory perception, psychokinesis and telepathy. In his book \"The Roots of Coincidence\" (1972) he claims that such phenomena can never be explained by theoretical physics. According to Koestler, distinct types of coincidence could be classified, such as \"the library angel\", in which information (typically in libraries) becomes accessible through serendipity, chance or coincidence, rather than through the use of a catalogue search. The book mentions yet another line of unconventional research by Paul Kammerer, the theory of coincidence or seriality. He also presents critically the related concepts of Carl Jung. More controversial were Koestler's studies and experiments on levitation and telepathy.\n\nKoestler was Jewish by birth, but he did not practise the religion. In an interview published in the (London) \"Jewish Chronicle\" in 1950 he argued that Jews should either emigrate to Israel or assimilate completely into the majority cultures they lived in.\n\nIn \"The Thirteenth Tribe\" (1976) Koestler advanced a theory that Ashkenazi Jews are descended, not from the Israelites of antiquity, but from the Khazars, a Turkic people in the Caucasus that converted to Judaism in the 8th century and was later forced westwards. Koestler argued that a proof that Ashkenazi Jews have no biological connection to biblical Jews would remove the racial basis of European anti-Semitism.\n\nKoestler coined the phrase, \"one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third.\"\n\nKoestler first learned Hungarian, but later his family spoke mostly German at home. From his early years he became fluent in both languages. It is likely that he picked up some Yiddish too, through contact with his grandfather. By his teens he was fluent in Hungarian, German, French and English.\n\nDuring his years in Palestine Koestler became sufficiently fluent in Hebrew to write stories in that language, as well as to create what is believed to have been the world's first Hebrew crossword puzzle. During his years in the Soviet Union (1932–33), although he arrived with a vocabulary of only 1,000 words of Russian, and no grammar, he picked up enough colloquial Russian to speak the language.\n\nKoestler wrote his books in German up to 1940, but then wrote only in English. (\"L'Espagne ensanglantée\" was translated into French from German.)\n\nKoestler is said to have coined the word mimophant to describe Bobby Fischer.\n\n\n\n\nNB The books \"The Lotus and the Robot\", \"The God that Failed\", and \", as well as his numerous essays, all may contain further autobiographical information.\n\n\n\n\nKey to abbreviations used for frequently quoted sources\n\n\n\n"}

These dialect differences are small and mostly limited to slight regular sound changes. The vast majority of Biak speakers are also fluent in the local variety of Malay, but not all of them are proficient in standard Indonesian.\n\nDespite the comparatively high number of speakers compared to some other Austronesian languages, Biak is still in danger of extinction. Within the main towns, the generation of speakers aged between 20 and 50 have only passive knowledge of the language and rarely use the language actively, instead preferring to use Malay. Younger generations do not even generally have passive knowledge of the language. Biak is only actively used as a spoken language by members of the community over 50 years of age or so and even they regularly code switch into Malay. However, within the villages further from town there are still children who are fluent in Biak. Songs in Biak are also very popular throughout the Islands.\n\nThere is a strong initiative to promote the use of the Biak language, with translations of various books and teaching manuals as well as a radio station and a number of church services throughout the year being conducted solely in Biak. Since 2002, there has also been an initiative to introduce Biak being taught formerly in schools on the Islands.\n\nBiak has a phoneme inventory consisting of 13 consonants and 5 vowels, in which vowel length is phonemic. In the orthography long vowels are written with an acute accent. The phoneme is very infrequent in its use and some older speakers still realise it as in loanwords. \n\nThe vowel /u/ is the only rounded vowel in Biak; the other four are unrounded.\n\nIn Biak pronouns and articles are morphologically related, with both situating a given participant by indicating their relative discourse or spatial (e.g. directional or motional) status. This is not uncommon for Austronesian Languages. Pronouns in Biak are marked for number and clusivity.\nFree personal pronouns in Biak share their main distributional properties with nouns; however, they are somewhat more restricted. They can be used as a complement of a predicate or preposition but they cannot be used as subjects. In the example below we can see the use of the 1st person personal pronoun \"aya\" to complement a verb while the second example shows how a free personal pronoun, in this clause 3rd person \"i\" cannot be used as a subject:\n\nIn Biak, pronominal affixes can combine with verbs in three possible inflection patterns (given in the table below), which are partly phonologically conditioned. \nDue to the person marking nature of these affixes, the need for the presence of a core noun phrase in the same clause is negated. Thus the following sentence is still grammatical without NP Rusa nanine, as the verb has a pronominal affix that gives the same information. \nThese pronominal markers are person markers and are found in the final position of the noun phrase they determine. They attach to verbs along with a specifier that attaches after the pronominal affix; due to their distribution properties these markers should be considered clitics.\nThere are two specificity markers, -\"ya\" and –\"i\", where –\"ya\" can be used in all positions and -\"i\" is restricted to positions before pauses. In the example below the article attaches to the verb \"vebaya\", rather than the verb \"ifrúr\" because it is the final verb in the noun phrase headed by \"for\".\nNonspecificity, which refers to entities that do not yet exist in this world, or is used to question or deny the existence of an entity, is marked with the articles –\"o\" for singular and –\"no\" for plural noun phrases. This is shown in the examples below: \nNon-specific\n\nSpecific\n\nSimilar to other Austronesian languages, Biak makes a grammatical distinction between alienable and inalienable for possession.\n\nIn alienable possession, a possessive pronominal is formed with the possessive marker ‘ve’ to signify the person, number and gender of the possessor, and is followed by a pronominal article marking the gender and number of the possessed. The pronominal article contains the specificity markers ‘-i’ and ‘-ya’, with ‘-i’ being used only in pre-pausal positions. The following table illustrates the possessive pronominal construction.\nTypically, Biak follows a possessor-possessum structure for alienable possessive construction, with the possessive pronominal in the adnominal position:\nHowever, alienable possession can also be formed in the\norder of possessum-possessor, though this is much less frequent:\nInalienable possessive construction differs from alienable in that there is no system of pronominal possessives, only a set of affixes located on the possessum. In contrast to alienable possession, inalienable possession can only take the order of possessor-possessum. Biak contains three subsets of inalienability: body parts, Kinship, and locational.\n\nNot all body parts are considered inalienable. Those that are form the stem words from which to derive other body parts through the method of compounding. For example, the alienable ‘knee’ is formed through the inalienable stem ‘\"we\"’ (leg) and the compounding ‘\"pur\"’ (back) to form ‘\"wepur\"’. Possessive construction for alienable body parts follows the same pattern as other alienable terms. The inflectional system for inalienable body parts is as follows:\nUnusual for Austronesian languages of the area, Biak contains a partial prefix system for inflecting inalienable body parts. For the plural forms, suffix ‘-s’ reflects plurality and animateness of possessor and suffix ‘na’ expresses plurality and inaninameteness of the possessum. As stated above, inalienable possession is formed via a possessor-possessum structure: \nSimilarly to body parts, not all kinship terms are inalienable. The alienable kinship terms are formed through the same compounding method as alienable body parts, and follow the same possessive construction rules as other alienable terms. This table illustrates the inflectional system for inalienable kinship words:\n\nAll nouns that follow the table’s procedure have an\nidiosyncratic form for the first person, using a shorter term for the second\nand third person. (REF pg. 244) Here is an example of the usage of inalienable\nkinship inflection:\nLocational nouns are the last distinction of inalienability found in Biak. Locational nouns refer to locations that are ‘inherently connected to an entity’. For example, a tree in biak is referred to as having an ‘upper part’ and a ‘lower part’, and a canoe a ‘front’, a ‘middle’ and a ‘back’. The following table exhibits the inflectional system for inalienable locational nouns:\nThe suffix ‘-n’ expresses the plurality and inanimateness of\nthe possessum (REF pg. 250). The locational noun possessive structure is illustrated in this example:\n\n"}

In 2012, he was named winner of the Prix du roman arabe, but the prize money was withdrawn due to Sansal's visit to Israel to speak at the Jerusalem Writers Festival.\n\nBoualem Sansal was born in Théniet El Had, Tissemsilt. Trained as an engineer with a doctorate in economics, he began writing novels at the age of 50 after retiring from his job as a high-ranking official in the Algerian government. The assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf in 1992 and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria inspired him to write about his country. Sansal continues to live with his wife and two daughters in Algeria despite the controversy his books have aroused in his homeland. At the 2007 International Festival of Literature in Berlin, he was introduced as a writer \"exiled in his own country. \" He claims that Algeria is becoming a bastion of Islamic extremism and the country is losing its intellectual and moral underpinnings.\n\nSansal's novel \"Le village de l'Allemand ou le journal des frères Schiller, \" is the story of two Algerian brothers who burrow into the past and discover that their father had been a Nazi officer who fled to Algeria after the war. The book explores the fine line between Islamic fundamentalism and Nazism. \"Le Village de l'allemand\" is the first of Sansal's novels to be translated into English, and was published in the US as \"The German Mujahid\" and in the UK as \"An Unfinished Business\".\n\nSince the publication of \"Poste restante: Alger. Lettre de colère et d'espoir à mes compatriotes\" in 2006, Sansal's books have been banned in Algeria.\n\nSansal writes in French and his work has won top literary awards in France, among them the Prix du Premier Roman in 1999. His debut novel was \"Le serment des Barbares\" (Gallimard, 1999), which has now been made into a film based on a screenplay by Jorge Semprún.\n\nOn 16 October 2011 Sansal received the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. On 19 December 2011, he was announced as being on the jury for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to be held in February 2012.\n\nSansal was the recipient of the 2012 Editions Gallimard Arabic Novel prize for his book \"Rue Darwin.\" The prize is awarded by the Arab Ambassadors Council, based in Paris. However, after the Council learned that Sansal had attended the Jerusalem Writers Festival earlier in the year, they revoked the 15,000 euros prize money he had been slated to receive.\n\nCommenting on the decision to withdraw the prize money, Sansal said it was \"completely unacceptable\", adding that Arab countries – and his home country, Algeria, in particular – had \"shut themselves in a prison of intolerance\". France Culture radio director and head of the jury that awarded the prize, Olivier Poivre d'Avror, said before resigning his post in protest, the prize money had been withdrawn as a \"sordid\" consequence of Hamas pressure. \"Between being nominated for the prize and actually receiving it, Boualem Sansal visited Israel … Hamas immediately issued a statement calling his presence an act of treason against the Palestinians. The reaction of Arab Ambassadors Council was a direct result of this.\" A spokeswoman for the Arab Ambassadors Council claimed the council's decision had not been influenced by the Hamas statement on the matter. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman urged the international community to denounce the boycott against Sansal.\n\nSansal said he does not regret visiting Israel, stating, \"I am glad I visited Israel and returned with great happiness.\" Sansal also said that \"Israelis have all the reasons in the world to be proud of what they have achieved in their country in such a short period of time...In so many fields, Israel is at the international forefront and it is very impressive.\" Sansal also said that he was moved by Lieberman's support, and, \"His statement was so gracious in comparison to Arab governments. He told them: 'You're persecuting intellectuals. We embrace them and care for their safety. That is why your citizens are rebelling against you.' That is a harsh blow to Arab governments.\" Sansal criticized Hamas as well, saying that it was a terrorist movement that \"has taken Gazans hostage. It has taken Islam hostage.\"\n\nSansal was awarded the 2015 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for \"2084: la fin du monde\"\n\n\n\n\n1986: La Combustion dans les turboréacteurs, OPU, Alger.\n1989: La Mesure de la productivité, OPU, Alger\n\n"}

The broad spectrum revolution followed the most recent ice age around 15,000 BP in the Middle East and 12,000 BP in Europe. During this time, there was a transition from focusing on a few main food sources to gathering/hunting a \"broad spectrum\" of plants and animals.\n\nFlannery's hypothesis was meant to help explain the adoption of agriculture in the Neolithic Revolution. Unpersuaded by \"the facile explanation of prehistoric environmental change\" Flannery suggested (following Lewis Binford's equilibrium model) that population growth in optimal habitats led to demographic pressure within nearby marginal habitats as daughter groups migrated. The search for more food within these marginal habitats forced foragers to diversify the types of food sources harvested, broadening the subsistence base outward to include more fish, small game, waterfowl, invertebrates (such as snails and shellfish), as well as previously ignored or marginal plant sources. Most importantly, Flannery argues that the need for more food in these marginal environments led to the deliberate cultivation of certain plant species, especially cereals. In optimal habitats, these plants naturally grew in relatively dense stands, but required human intervention in order to be efficiently harvested in marginal zones. Thus, the broad spectrum revolution set the stage for domestication and rise of permanent agricultural settlement.\n\nA BSR is likely to manifest as both an increased spectrum of food resources and an evenness in the exploitation of high- and low-value prey. Under a broad spectrum economy a greater amount of low-value prey (i.e. high cost-to-benefit ratio) would be included because there are insufficient high-value prey to reliably satisfy a population's needs. In terms of plants, it would be expected that foodstuffs that had once been ignored because of difficulty of extraction were now included in a diet. In terms of fauna, animal prey which was previously considered an inefficient use of resources (particularly small, fast mammals or fish) could now also be worthwhile. In other words, increasing scarcity made the extra effort necessary for survival.\n\nIn the Middle East, the broad spectrum revolution led to an increase in the production of food. The growth and reproduction of certain plants and animals became vastly popular. Because large animals became quite scarce, people had to find new resources of food and tools elsewhere. Interests focused on smaller game like fish, rabbits, and shellfish because the reproduction rate of small animals is much greater than that of large animals.\n\nThe most commonly accepted stimulation for the BSR is demographic pressures on the landscape, under which over-exploitation of resources meant narrow diets restricted to high-value prey could no longer feed the expanding population.\n\nThe broad-spectrum revolution has also been linked to climatic changes, including sea level rises during which:\n\nThe Japanese site Nittano (inlet near Tokyo) was occupied several times between 6000 and 5000 BP. The Jōmon culture occupied Nittano at over 30,000 sites known in Japan. People hunted deer, pigs, bears, antelope, fish, shellfish, and gathered plants. Sites have yielded over 300 sample remains of shellfish and 180 sample remains of plants.\n\nThe broad spectrum revolution has been a subject of intense debate since it was first proposed, but its basic arguments are well-supported.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "948686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=948686", "title": "City block", "text": "City block\n\nA city block, urban block or simply block is a central element of urban planning and urban design.\n\nA city block is the smallest area that is surrounded by streets. City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern of a city, and form the basic unit of a city's urban fabric. City blocks may be subdivided into any number of smaller land lots usually in private ownership, though in some cases, it may be other forms of tenure. City blocks are usually built-up to varying degrees and thus form the physical containers or 'streetwalls' of public space. Most cities are composed of a greater or lesser variety of sizes and shapes of urban block. For example, many pre-industrial cores of cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle-east tend to have irregularly shaped street patterns and urban blocks, while cities based on grids have much more regular arrangements.\n\nIn most cities of the world that were planned, rather than developing gradually over a long period of time, streets are typically laid out on a grid plan, so that city blocks are square or rectangular. Using the perimeter block development principle, city blocks are developed so that buildings are located along the perimeter of the block, with entrances facing the street, and semi-private courtyards in the rear of the buildings. This arrangement is intended to provide good social interaction among people.\n\nSince the spacing of streets in grid plans varies so widely among cities, or even within cities, it is difficult to generalize about the size of a city block. However, as reference points for US cities, the standard square blocks of Portland, Houston, and Sacramento are , , and respectively (to the street center line). Oblong blocks range considerably in width and length. The standard block in Manhattan is about ; and in some U.S. cities standard blocks are as wide as . The blocks in Calgary, Canada, are , while those in Edmonton, Canada are . The blocks in central Melbourne, Australia, are , formed by splitting the square blocks in an original grid with a narrow street down the middle. In Chicago, Illinois and Minneapolis, Minnesota, a typical city block is (w × h), meaning that 16 east-west blocks or 8 north-south blocks measure one mile.\n\nMany world cities have grown by accretion over time rather than being planned from the outset. For this reason, a regular pattern of even, square or rectangular city blocks is not so common among European cities, for example. An exception is represented by those cities that were founded as Roman military settlements, and that often preserve the original grid layout around two main orthogonal axes. One notable example is Turin, Italy. Following the example of Philadelphia, New York City adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for a more extensive grid plan. By the middle of the 20th century, the adoption of the uniform, rectilinear block subsided almost completely, and different layouts prevailed, with random sized and either curvilinear or non-orthogonal blocks and corresponding street patterns.\n\nIn much of the United States and Canada, the addresses follow a block and lot number system, in which each block of a street is allotted 100 building numbers.\n\nThe concept of \"city block\" can be generalized as a \"superblock\" or \"sub-block\".\n\nA superblock or super-block is an area of urban land bounded by arterial roads that is the size of multiple typically-sized city blocks. Within the superblock, the local road network, if any, is designed to serve local needs only.\n\nWithin the broad concept of a superblock, various typologies emerge based primarily on the internal road networks within the superblock, their historical context, and whether they are auto-centric or pedestrian-centric. The context in which superblocks are being studied or conceived gives rise to varying definitions.\n\nAn internal road network characterised by cul-de-sacs is typical of auto-centric suburban development primarily in Western countries throughout the 20th century. The Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture's definition is rooted within this typically suburban conception:“Area containing residential accommodation, shops, schools, offices, etc., with public open space (e.g. a green), surrounded by roads and penetrated by cul-de-sac service-roads. It is linked to other super-blocks and a town centre by means of paths over or under the roads (e.g. in Radburn planning).”Though the aim of such superblocks is generally to minimise traffic within the superblock by directing it to arterial roads, the effect in many cases has been to entrench automobile dependence by limiting pedestrian permeability.\n\nSuperblocks can also contain an orthogonal internal road network, including ones based on a grid plan or quasi-grid plan. This typology is prevalent in Japan and China, for example. Chen defines the supergrid and superblock urban morphology in this context as follows:“The Supergrid is a large-scale net of wide roads that defines a series of cells or Superblocks, each containing a network of narrower streets.”Superblocks can also be retroactively superimposed on pre-existing grid plan by changing the traffic rules and streetscape of internal streets within the superblock, as in the case of Barcelona’s \"superilles\" (Catalan for superblocks). Each \"superilla\" comprises nine city blocks, with speed limits on the internal roads slowed to 10–20 km/h and through traffic disallowed, with through travel only possible on the perimeter roads.\n\nSuperblocks were popular during the early and mid-20th century auto-centric suburban development, arising from modernist ideas in architecture and urban planning. Planning in this era was based upon the distance and speed scales for the automobile and discounted the pedestrian and cyclist modes, as obsolete transportation vehicles. A superblock is much larger than a traditional city block, with a greater setback for buildings, and is typically bounded by widely spaced, high-speed, arterial or circulating routes rather than by local streets. Superblocks are often found in suburbs or planned cities, or are the result of urban renewal of the mid-20th century, where a street hierarchy has replaced the traditional grid. In a residential area of a suburb, the interior of the superblock is typically served by dead-ended or looped streets. The discontinuous streets served the automobile as longer distances, and the extra fuel required to go between destinations, was not a concern, but at the pedestrian scale, the discontinuity of the roads added to the distance that must be traveled. The discontinuity inside the superblock forced car dependency, discouraged errand walking, and forced more traffic onto the fewer continuous streets, increasing demand for through streets, which led ultimately to these streets having more travel lanes added for cars, thereby making it more difficult for any pedestrian to cross such streets. In this way, superblocks cut up the city into isolated units, expanded automobile dominance, and made it impossible for pedestrians and cyclists to get anywhere outside of the superblock. Superblocks can also be found in central city areas, where they are more often associated with institutional, educational, recreational and corporate rather than residential uses.\n\nUrban planner Clarence Perry argued for use of superblocks and related ideas in his \"neighborhood unit\" plan, which aimed to organize space in a way that was more \"pedestrian-friendly\" and provided open plazas and other space for residents to socialize. Planners, today, now know that the street discontinuity and the multi-lane roads associated with superblocks have caused the decline of pedestrian and bicycle use every where this \"sprawl\" pattern is present. The traditional urban block diffused automobile traffic onto several narrower roads at slower speeds. This more finely connected network of narrower roads better allowed the pedestrian and cyclist realms to flourish. The superblock, at the scale only suitable for automobiles, and not pedestrians, was the means for ultimate automobile dominance by the end of the 20th century. The same intention to facilitate pedestrian movement and socializing is captured by an influential 1989 conceptual design of a Pedestrian Pocket (see diagram). It is, similarly, a superblock composed of nine normal city blocks clustered around a light rail station and a central open space. Its circulation pattern consists primarily of a dense pedestrian network which is complementary to but independent from the car network. Access by car is provided by means of three loops. This superblock differs from Perry's concept in that it makes it impossible for cars to traverse it rather than very difficult; it is car-impermeable.\n\nIn the 1930s, superblocks were often used in urban renewal public housing projects in American cities. In using superblocks, housing projects aimed to eliminate back alleys, which were often associated with slum conditions.\n\nSuperblocks are also used when functional units such as rail yards or shipyards, inherited from the 19th and early 20th centuries, are too big to fit in an average city block. A contemporary function which reflects ancient practices that also requires larger than typical blocks is the sports stadium or arena. Just as the Colosseum in ancient Rome, sports complexes require superblocks. The Providence Park stadium in Portland, for example, takes up four normal city blocks as does the equally large Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina. Other contemporary institutions, establishments or functions that use superblocks are: city halls like Government Center, Boston and Toronto City Hall; regional general hospitals or specialized medical centres; convention and exhibition centers, such as Exhibition Place in Toronto and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center; and downtown enclosed Shopping Malls such as Eaton Centre in Toronto, echoing the large gallerias of the 19th century. Cultural complexes, such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, often occupy a superblock achieved through the consolidation of regular city blocks. A recent superblock user is the merchandise distribution centre, which can range in area from one to ten city blocks.\n\nMost notably, however, the largest superblocks in contemporary cities are used by university and college campuses such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the City College of New York, Columbia University and the University of Alberta in Edmonton. The \"campus\" impact on the city block structure is quite prominent particularly in small university towns such as Waterloo, Ontario or Ithaca, New York where the university superblock counts for a sizeable portion of the total city area. Campuses, in general, are fully walkable and sociable environments within the superblock structure. On some university campuses the extensive and exclusive pedestrian path network at grade is supplemented with below grade paths. New Urbanists would argue that separating circulation modes effectively kills the social interaction that bolsters urban areas.\n\nAdditional users of the superblock concept are large national or multinational corporations who constructed campuses in the late 1900s and 2000s. Examples of superblock campuses include Google in Mountain View, California; and Apple and Hewlett-Packard in San Jose, California. Another well-known commercial superblock is the World Trade Center site in New York City, where several streets of Manhattan's downtown grid were removed and de-mapped to make room for the center.\nSocial and housing agencies in the U.S., Canada and the UK used the superblock model for large housing projects such as Regent Park in Toronto and Benny Farm in Montreal, Canada. In New York City, the Stuyvesant Town private market, residential development superblock takes up about 18 normal city blocks and provides a large green amenity for its residents and neighbours. It uses crescent (loop) rather than dead-ended streets inside the superblock and an extensive network of paths that provide excellent connectivity within the block and to the neighbouring areas (see drawing).\n\nWhere the superblock is used for housing projects like Stuyvesant Town, the advantages sought are an improved separation of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, enhanced tranquility and reduced accident risk within the neighbourhood. In 2003, Vauban (a rail suburb of Freiburg, Germany) was constructed with similar goals. Its layout consists mainly of a superblock with a central pedestrian spine and a few narrow looped and dead-ended streets. The British new town of Milton Keynes is built around a grid of one-kilometre square superblocks (see drawing).\n\nSuperblocks have been proposed as a potential solution to road space prioritisation and increased pedestrian flows in the CBD of Melbourne, Australia. The City of Melbourne’s 2018 \"Transport Discussion Paper: City Space\" suggests, based on the example of Barcelona’s \"superilles\", that “‘Superblocks’ could be applied in Melbourne to make streets in the central city safer, greener, more inclusive and more vibrant.”\n\nThe superblock concept has been applied retroactively in Barcelona's La Ribera and Gràcia districts, which both have a medieval street network with narrow and irregular streets, since 1993. In these two cases it resulted in an increase of journeys on foot (over 10%) and by bicycle (>15%) and in a higher level of commercial and service activity.\n\nSuperblocks, or \"super·illes\" in the native Catalan, are now being superimposed in the Eixample District’s famous Ildefons Cerdà-designed late 19th century grid plan. Each \"superilla\" comprises nine city blocks, or \"illes\", in which the internal traffic flows have been altered to disallow through traffic, and speed limits on internal roads reduced. After entering a \"superilla\" from a perimeter road, vehicles are only able to circumnavigate one city block and return out to the same perimeter road again, meaning that local access to garages and businesses is maintained, but making it impossible to cut through to the other side. Speed limits have also been reduced to 20 km/h initially. It was estimated that this could be implemented city-wide for less than €20 million, simply by changing traffic signals.\n\nIt is planned to further reduce speeds to 10 km/h and remove on-street parking by building more off-street car parks. This is intended to make the internal streets safer for pedestrians and create more space for playing games, sports, and cultural activities such as outdoor cinemas.\n\nThe concept was initially spurred by a redesign of the city’s bus network that consolidated bus routes into a simpler orthogonal network, with more frequent services. With many streets freed from buses as a result, and the idea was formulated to create the \"superilles\" in order to reduce traffic, cut the high levels of air and noise pollution in the city, and reallocate space to pedestrians and cyclists. The \"superilles\" have been met with criticism and resistance from some residents however, who have complained about the dramatically increased distance for some previously short car trips, and the increased traffic on the arterial perimeter roads. This is, however, a necessary part of the strategy to discourage driving and boost the number of trips made by active transport modes or on the revamped bus network.\n\nSuperblocks have been the prevalent mode of urban land use planning in Japan, even being described as the \"\"sine qua non\" of Japanese urban design\", present in all medium to large Japanese cities to a greater or lesser degree. Cities are typically arranged around a system of wide arterial roads, often approximating a grid and flanked by generous sidewalks, and an orthogonal network of narrow internal streets, normally operating as shared zones with no sidewalks. The grid plan layout of Japanese cities such as Kyoto and Nara dates back to the eighth century, which were in turn derived from Chinese grid models. The system of superblocks were created mostly in the early to mid 20th century by physically widening arterial roads, superimposing the supergrid and superblock structure in a physical sense. This contrasts with the Barcelona model wherein the superblock model was imposed through changed traffic signalling rather than physical street widening. They further contrast to Western auto-centric models described above as they are typically characterised by highly walkable and cycle-able street networks, featuring high-density mixed use development and supported by highly effective and efficient public transport systems.\n\nResulting largely from planning controls which link building height with street width, Japanese superblocks are typically characterised by a ‘hard shell’ of tall buildings with commercial uses along the perimeter arterial roads, with a ‘soft yolk’ of low-rise residential use in the centre.\n\nThe spatial structure of superblocks can also be analysed, per a taxonomy detailed by Barrie Shelton, through the classification of roads as ‘global’, being the arterial roads which provide for cross-city travel, ‘local’ roads, which provide local access to buildings within the superblock, and ‘glocal’ roads, which may cross the entire superblock, allowing through travel, and in many instances into neighbouring superblocks. Glocal roads differ from global roads however, in that they are narrow, have lower speed limits, and do not form part of the ‘supergrid’ structure. Shelton also describes the sidewalks of the global arterial roads as functioning as streets in themselves, or ‘sidewalk streets’, operating in a similar manner to the local streets.\n\nIn a geoprocessing perspective there are two complementary ways of modeling city blocks:\n\nAlways a \"block without sidewalks\" is within a \"block with sidewalks\". The geometric subtraction of a \"block without sidewalks\" from \"block with sidewalks\", contains the sidewalk, the alley, and any other non-lot sub-structure.\n\nA perimeter block is a type of city block which is built up on all sides surrounding a central space that is semi-private. They may contain a mixture of uses, with commercial or retail functions on the ground floor. Perimeter blocks are a key component of many European cities and are an urban form that allows very high urban densities to be achieved without high-rise buildings.\n\nIn North American English and Australian English, the word \"block\" is used as an informal unit of distance. For example, someone giving directions might say, \"It's three blocks from here\".\n\nIn British English the term is very rarely used to express a measure of distance owing to blocks not being used in town or city planning in most countries. However it is often used to describe a short walk around the local area, as in \"walk around the block\".\n\nThere have been online innovations and websites such as msnbc.com-owned EveryBlock, which uses geo-specific feeds from neighborhood blogs, Flickr, Yelp, Craigslist, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and other aggregated data to give readers a picture of what is going on in their town or neighborhood down to the block.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6347", "title": "Cut-up technique", "text": "Cut-up technique\n\nThe cut-up technique (or \"découpé\" in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.\n\nThe cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:\n\n\nWilliam Burroughs cited T. S. Eliot's poem, \"The Waste Land\" (1922) and John Dos Passos' \"U.S.A.\" trilogy, which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.\n\nGil J. Wolman developed cut-up techniques as part of his lettrist practice in the early 1950s.\n\nAlso in the 1950s, painter and writer Brion Gysin more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a razor blade. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book \"Minutes to Go\" resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet Sinclair Beiles also used this technique and co-authored \"Minutes To Go\".\n\nGysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the Beat Hotel. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and audio recordings in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, hypothesizing that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text. Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of divination saying, \"When you cut into the present the future leaks out.\" Burroughs also further developed the \"fold-in\" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published \"The Third Mind\", a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication \"My Own Mag\" was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.\n\nIn an interview, Alan Burns noted that for \"Europe After The Rain\" (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: \"I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe\".\n\nArgentine writer Julio Cortázar often used cut ups in his 1963 novel \"Hopscotch\".\n\nIn 1969, poets Howard W. Bergerson and J. A. Lindon developed a cut-up technique known as vocabularyclept poetry, in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.\n\nA precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which Tristan Tzara offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at random from a hat. Collage, which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, \"dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love\" under the sub-title, \"TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM\".\n\nA drama scripted for five voices by performance poet Hedwig Gorski in 1977 originated the idea of creating poetry only for performance instead of for print publication. The \"neo-verse drama\" titled \"Booby, Mama!\" written for \"guerilla theater\" performances in public places used a combination of newspaper cut-ups that were edited and choreographed for a troupe of non-professional street actors.\n\nKathy Acker, a literary and intermedia artist, sampled external sources and reconfigured them into the creation of shifting versions of her own constructed identity. In her late 1970s novel \"Blood and Guts in High School\", Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.\n\nAntony Balch and Burroughs created a collaboration film, \"The Cut-Ups\" that opened in London in 1967. This was part of an abandoned project called \"Guerrilla Conditions\" meant as a documentary on Burroughs and filmed throughout 1961–1965. Inspired by Burroughs' and Gysin's technique of cutting up text and rearranging it in random order, Balch had an editor cut his footage for the documentary into little pieces and impose no control over its reassembly. The film opened at Oxford Street's Cinephone cinema and had a disturbing reaction. Many audience members claimed the film made them ill, others demanded their money back, while some just stumbled out of the cinema ranting \"it's disgusting\". Other cut-up films include \"Ghost at n°9 (Paris)\" (1963–72), a posthumously released short film compiled from reels found at Balch's office after his death, and \"William Buys a Parrott\" (1982), \"Bill and Tony\" (1972), \"Towers Open Fire\" (1963) and \"The Junky's Christmas\" (1966).\n\nFrom the early 1970s, David Bowie used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. Thom Yorke applied a similar method in Radiohead's \"Kid A\" (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs. Perhaps indicative of Thom Yorke's influences, instructions for \"How to make a Dada poem\" appeared on Radiohead's website at this time.\n\nStephen Mallinder of Cabaret Voltaire reported to \"Inpress\" magazine's Andrez Bergen that \"I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days – the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating tape loops and all that – has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin.\"\n\nPaul McCartney was a Burroughs acquaintance in London when the White Album was recorded -- See \"Revolution No. 9.\"\n\n\n"}

He lived the life of a \"white Maasai\" and could speak their language before his own native English. Born in Nairobi, Read spent his formative years in what is now Tanzania, a country to which he would always return. Read spent his twilight years lives in Momella near Arusha in northern Tanzania, where he continued to work on his writing until his death.\n\nRead was born to British parents in Kenya, on 23 April 1922 according to the author's website, 1921 according to the biographical note in \"Waters of the Sanjan\". Left on her own with young David, his mother eventually sought a living in Maasailand when Read was seven, there she ran a small hotel and traded with the Maasai. Here too, Read spent the next seven years of childhood, a period during which his playmates were the Maasai children. Maasai became his first language, followed by Swahili before English, and he ran wild with his friends learning a lot about the Maasai way of life and associating closely with nature and the wildlife. Totally accepted as a Maasai by the tribe, he took part in meat festivals and other tribal gatherings and ceremonies.\n\nAt the age of 14, Read was sent to school in Arusha. His schooling was completed by Correspondence Course when he was employed as an apprentice Metallurgist by the Tanganyika Department of Geological Survey.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the Kenya Regiment and later trained with the Royal Air Force and served with the King's African Rifles in Abyssinia, Madagascar and Burma. After the War, he commanded the Uganda contingent in the Victory Parade in London and joined the Tanganyika Veterinary Department, where he spent the next six years. During this time, he covered areas that included parts of Maasailand when he was able to renew his former close association with that tribe.\n\nHaving eventually acquired a farm of his own on the slopes of Kilimanjaro, also in Maasailand, he went on to become a leading farming figure and prominent landowner in Tanganyika and was Chairman of the Tanganyika Farmers Association from 1973 to 1975. However, after Independence was granted to Tanganyika in 1961, his properties began to be gradually eroded, during which period he was employed part-time by the Anglo American Corporation in Zambia as an Agricultural Consultant. By 1975 the Tanzania \nGovernment had acquired the last of his properties and he left Tanzania for Zambia, and then South Africa, where he again tried his hand at farming, an interlude in his life that proved far from happy or satisfactory. Finally in 1979 he returned to Kenya to join Lima Limited as their Agricultural Consultant.\n\nRead is married and has one daughter. He is unquestionably a leading authority on the people of Eastern Africa, speaking several African dialects, but it was with the Maasai that he spent his formative years, and with whom he has been most closely associated ever since.\n\nThe book covers Read's adventures between seven and fourteen years in the Serengeti, homeland of the Maasai, whose customs and lifestyle he reports, as seen through the eyes of a child. Jonathan Taylor writes: \"I learnt more about the Masai by reading \"Barefoot Over the Serengeti\" than I have from any of the countless scholarly anthropology tomes of colourful coffee table books written about them.” \n\nThis is Read's second autobiographical novel, covering the period between 1936 and 1952 \"Beating about the Bush\" picks up Read’s story where “Barefoot” left off, with his parents moving to the Lupa Goldfields to try to salvage their livelihoods after a catastrophic series of events that left them almost destitute, reliant on Read’s hunting skills and the help of their Maasai friends. \nThe book moves from Mission School life to veterinary training, active service in Abyssinia, Madagascar, Burma, and India, meetings with the King and Queen to privileged encounters with the hunter-gatherers of the Okiek people or, in Maasai language, Ndorobo people. During six years employment by the Tanganyika Veterinary Department in Dodoma he roamed the African savannas of his childhood, investigating ritual tribal killings and working as a livestock marketing officer.\n\nLike in his other works it is obvious that it is the people rather than the events that Read's narrative lays emphasis on.\n\nAfter the work for the Veterinary Department the Reads settled as wheat farmers on the Western slopes of Kilimanjaro. With no formal training, Read survived largely on his local knowledge and language skills, supplemented by his cattle buying. Life on 'Mountainside' suited Read, despite the constant battles against Africa's unforgiving environment, but the winds of change were to bring a greater challenge and one that would ultimately end Read's dreams.\n\nThis is Read's sole fiction novel, again situated in the Serengeti at the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. In a series of adventures the protagonist Dangoya develops his reputation and leadership of his age-group and has to deal with envy, drought, superstition and colonialists. Dangoya proves to be an enlightened leader, respecting his tribe's traditions and his elders but at the same time challenging incompetence and mere superstition. – In a concentrated form the book encloses Maasai tradition such as male and female circumcision, cattle raids, blood drinking, alcohol drinking, meat feasts, sexual habits like polygamy, initiation ceremonies, etc.\n\nIn his foreword Ole Ntekerei Memusi writes: “\"Waters of the Sanjan\" is an accurate and admirable historic record of my people.” (p. xi)\n\nRead's works, covering a period of seven decades, not only describe a unique life starting from the adoption of the young boy by the magnificent Maasai tribe whose influence never ceased through his adolescence and manhood; it is also an ethnographic document of a native African group, who rely on oral tradition and whose knowledge and history is, by the accuracy and the empathy which characterise Read's novels, preserved from amnesia.\n\n\n"}

In the vectorial semantic model, which is normally the one used to compute a document-term matrix, the goal is to represent the topic of a document by the frequency of semantically significant terms. The terms are semantic units of the documents.

{"id": "5913180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5913180", "title": "Expungement", "text": "Expungement\n\nIn the common law legal system, an expungement proceeding is a type of lawsuit in which a first time offender of a prior criminal conviction seeks that the records of that earlier process be sealed, making the records unavailable through the state or Federal repositories. If successful, the records are said to be \"expunged\". \"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines \"expungement of record\" as the \"Process by which record of criminal conviction is destroyed or sealed from the state or Federal repository.\" While expungement deals with an underlying criminal record, it is a civil action in which the subject is the petitioner or plaintiff asking a court to declare that the records be expunged.\n\nA very real distinction exists between an expungement and a pardon. When an expungement is granted, the person whose record is expunged may, for most purposes, treat the event as if it never occurred. A pardon (also called \"executive clemency\") does not \"erase\" the event; rather, it constitutes forgiveness. In the United States, an expungement can be granted only by a judge, while a pardon can be granted only by the President of the United States for federal offenses, and the state governor, certain other state executive officers, or the State Board of Pardons and Paroles (varies from state to state) for state offenses.\n\nEach jurisdiction whose law allows expungement has its own definitions of expungement proceedings. Generally, expungement is the process to \"remove from general review\" the records pertaining to a case. In many jurisdictions, however, the records may not completely \"disappear\" and may still be available to law enforcement, to sentencing judges on subsequent offenses, and to corrections facilities to which the individual may be sentenced on subsequent convictions.\n\nCriminal records in each state of Australia are covered by state law. In New South Wales, the relevant legislation is the Criminal Records Act 1991. Under the Act, an offender's criminal record may become spent if they do not re-offend for a period of 10 years. Offenses resulting in a prison term of more than six months will not become spent. Additionally, for certain employment occupations (e.g. education or child services), a \"full disclosure\" check is required, and spent convictions are still visible.\n\nIn 2008 there was an amendment to sections 2 and 3 of the South African Criminal Procedure Act (51 of 1977) known as the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act (65 of 2008). This new law came into effect on the 6th May 2009. In summary, the new law says that those convicted of a minor offense, determined by the type of sentence imposed, 10 or more years ago, qualify for the expungement of their criminal record. The sentence must have been a suspended jail term, correctional supervision or a fine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the term \"spent conviction\" is used. The relevant legislation is the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. In the data retention model of the Police National Computer, arrests which do not lead to a finding of guilt \"step down\" as soon as the relevant decision is made (typically a \"not guilty\" verdict or a dismissal of charges) and become visible to law enforcement only. Records of cautions and minor convictions do not step down and remain on the PNC and on enhanced CRB checks until the offender's 100th birthday. \n\nSince the passing of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, people convicted for homosexual acts between consenting adults under section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 can apply to have the conviction totally removed from their criminal record. Clause 96 confirms the effect of a successful application would ensure the person is considered as having not committed, nor been charged, prosecuted or convicted of a homosexual act.\n\nIn the United States, most states allow for expungement of criminal records, though laws vary significantly by state. The availability of expungement and the type of charge or conviction that may be expunged will depend upon the laws of the state in which the case was prosecuted. In some states, once sealed or expunged, all records of an arrest and/or subsequent court case are removed from the public record, and the individual may legally deny or fail to acknowledge ever having been arrested for or charged with any crime which has been expunged. Even after expungement, other states may maintain a public or confidential record of the charge and its disposition.\n\nEligibility for an expungement of an arrest, investigation, detention, or conviction record will be based on the law of the jurisdiction in which the record was made. Ordinarily, only the subject of the record may ask that the record be expunged. Often, the subject must meet a number of conditions before the request will be considered. Some jurisdictions allow expungement for the deceased.\n\nRequirements may include one or more of the following:\n\nTypes of convictions that are often not eligible for expungement include:\n\n\nMost jurisdictions have laws that allow - and in some states even require - the expungement of juvenile records once the juvenile reaches a certain age. In some cases, the records are destroyed; sometimes they simply are \"sealed.\" The purpose of these laws is to allow a minor who was accused of criminal acts, or in the language of many juvenile courts, \"delinquent acts,\" to erase his record, typically at the age of 17 or 18. The idea is to allow the juvenile offender to enter adulthood with a \"clean slate,\" shielding him or her from the negative effects of having a criminal record.\n\nStates have taken significantly different approaches when it comes to expungement for controlled substance violations such as marijuana and hashish. Typically, only convictions of possession or possession with the intent to distribute are eligible for expungement. Factors such as the weight/amount of the particular substance, age of the offender, and the number of offenses may impact eligibility for expungement as well. For example, in New Jersey, the threshold is 25 grams for marijuana and 5 grams for hashish if the offense occurred when the offender was 21 years of age or younger.\n\nProcedures for obtaining an expungement are different in each state, but tend to follow a similar process:\n\nThere is no post-conviction relief available in the federal system, other than a presidential pardon.\n\nCongressman Charles B. Rangel proposed the Second Chance Act in 2007, 2009, and 2011, which was intended to \"[amend] the federal criminal code to allow an individual to file a petition for expungement of a record of conviction for a nonviolent criminal offense\".\n\nIn some jurisdictions, all records on file within any court, detention or correctional facility, law enforcement or criminal justice agency concerning a person's detection, apprehension, arrest, detention, trial or disposition of an offense within the criminal justice system can be expunged. Each state sets its own guidelines for what records can be expunged, or for whether expungements are available at all. The petitioner requesting an expungement of all or part of their record will have to complete forms and instructions to submit to the appropriate authority. The petitioner may choose to hire an attorney to guide them through the process, or he/she can decide to represent themselves. This is called appearing pro se.\n\nA criminal record can only be expunged by the jurisdiction in which it was created. The federal government cannot order the expungement of state criminal records. States cannot order the expungement of records from other states or jurisdictions.\n\nWhen applying for a state professional license or job that is considered a public office or high security (such as security guard, law enforcement, or related to national security), you must often disclose that you have an expunged conviction. Failure to disclose an expunged criminal charge may result in denial of a license or denial of a security clearance by the Department of Justice. Some criminal convictions may warrant automatic denials of licensure, whether expunged or not.\n\nOne of the major benefits for the individual of expunging a criminal record is that there is a chance the individual may regain their right to possess a firearm. Federal laws deprive individuals with felony and domestic violence offenses of their firearm rights. Some states also have statutes depriving individuals of certain gun rights, usually for a definitive period of time.\n\nExpungement may restore gun rights in some states but will not be sufficient to restore firearms rights in others. Seeking restoration of firearm rights may requires that the petitioner specifically request restoration of those rights, or may require that the petitioner obtain a pardon that fully restores his or her civil rights.\n\nCalifornia's expungement law permits someone convicted of a crime to file a Petition for Dismissal with the court to re-open the case, set aside the plea, and dismiss the case. In order for one to qualify for expungement, the petitioner must have completed probation, paid all fines and restitution, and not currently be charged with a crime. If the requirements are met for eligibility, a court may grant the petition if it finds that it would be in the interest of justice to do so. A successful expungement will not erase the criminal record, but rather the finding of guilt will be changed to a dismissal. The petitioner then can honestly and legally answer to a question about their criminal history, with some exceptions, that they have not been convicted of that crime. What is actually stated on the record of the case is that the case was dismissed after conviction. If the petitioner is later convicted of the same crime again, then the expungement may be reversed.\n\nFor persons who serve sentences in the state prison system (felons), they must apply to the Superior Court for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (CR). The CR does not remove or expunge anything negative from the individual's record; however, it places something positive on it. Among other requirements, the applicant must live in California and have done so for at least 5 consecutive years prior to applying, and been law-abiding for 7 years starting from the sooner of their release from prison or court supervision. After they meet all requirements and receive a CR, certain of their rights are restored. and a request for a pardon is automatically sent to the governor.\n\nJuvenile criminal court records remain unless the individual petitions to have them sealed. This may be done when they reach their 18th birthday, even though some states provide for automatic expungement of certain juvenile records regardless of age.\n\nThere is not much that can be done to remove or conceal a DUI record, but in the state of California, it can be expunged. California Penal Code 1203.4 allows most types of convictions may be expunged. To qualify, the person must have completed probation, satisfied all financial obligations, not currently be facing charges or court supervision, and not have been sentenced to prison or parole.\n\nIn states like California, state laws allow an individual to reduce a \"wobbler\" offense from felony to misdemeanor, which will effectively restore firearm rights, provided that the individual has not been convicted of another felony or has not lost their firearm rights for another reason.\n\n\n"}

This pencil is usually made from non-toxic opaque wax (such as paraffin, beeswax, ceresin, carnauba or spermaceti wax) that is similar to a crayon but stronger. Marks made by grease pencils are resistant to moisture and can usually be removed by rubbing the marked surface with a paper towel.\n\nGrease pencils are available in several forms. The outer casing may be made of wood (like an ordinary pencil) and sharpened with a knife or pencil sharpener. Other types are covered in paper and sharpened by pulling a string to peel off the paper, needing no additional tools to remain functional. More recently, it has been produced in propelling form, essentially similar to a clutch pencil but with a different lead.\n\nSurfaces used with grease pencils include porcelain, glass, rock, polished stone, plastic, ceramics and other glazed, lacquered or polished surfaces, and metal, as well as the glossy paper that is used for photographic printing (particularly for contact sheets), x-rays, and for marking edits on analog audio tape and film. It is also used to label theatrical lighting gels. It is often used as a construction or handyman's marking tool as it rarely scratches the surface it is used on. It may be used to mark a wet surface. They are also favored among some traditional artists. Due to its ability to write on glass, it is often used in chemistry labs to mark glassware. \n\nGrease pencils were also widely used during the mid-20th century in aircraft control centers, military radar defense system stations on land and in aircraft carriers in particular. As information came in from radar operators and radio, men would take details of aircraft locations, vectors, weapons and fuel status and other information and write it in reverse on a large, clear panel of glass, which was readable to the officers on the other side of the panel. The information would be continuously updated as the situation changed. They have largely been replaced by digital displays in the modern era.\n\nIn the days when broadcast studios had a library of LP records, a track which was prohibited from public performance could be defaced by a wavy white or yellow chinagraph line, giving a visible warning to the presenter as well as making that track unusable.\n"}

An example of this is the team of Harbourmasters employed by the Port of London Authority who are empowered to undertake an enforcement role.\n\nActions that a harbourmaster may investigate include criminal acts, immigration, customs and excise, maritime and river safety and environmental and pollution issues. The police, customs, coastguard or immigration authorities will take over the handling of any offenders or incident once informed by the Harbourmaster.\n\nA harbourmaster may either be a civilian or a commissioned naval officer of any rank. \n\nHistorically all harbourmasters were naval officers; even today they must possess prior seafaring knowledge and experience through serving with either a merchant navy or armed navy. \n\nThe terms \"naval\" and \"civilian\" are used here to distinguish who is employed by a military force and who is employed by a public or private port.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, when a person has been appointed to superintend a Dockyard Port the officer serves in this capacity as the Queen's (or King's) Harbourmaster, and is entitled to fly a white-bordered Union Flag with a white central disc bearing the initials \"QHM\" (or \"KHM\" during the reign of a King) beneath a crown. Although legislation does not require it, most QHMs are serving officers in the Royal Navy.

{"id": "1585274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585274", "title": "Heawood conjecture", "text": "Heawood conjecture\n\nIn graph theory, the Heawood conjecture or Ringel–Youngs theorem gives a lower bound for the number of colors that are necessary for graph coloring on a surface of a given genus. For surfaces of genus 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., the required number of colors is 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, ... , the chromatic number or Heawood number.\n\nThe conjecture was formulated in 1890 by Percy John Heawood and proven in 1968 by Gerhard Ringel and Ted Youngs. One case, the non-orientable Klein bottle, proved an exception to the general formula. An entirely different approach was needed for the much older problem of finding the number of colors needed for the plane or sphere, solved in 1976 as the four color theorem by Haken and Appel. On the sphere the lower bound is easy, whereas for higher genera the upper bound is easy and was proved in Heawood's original short paper that contained the conjecture. In other words, Ringel, Youngs and others had to construct extreme examples for every genus g = 1,2,3... If g = 12s + k, the genera fall into 12 cases according as k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. To simplify, suppose that case k has been established if only a finite number of g's of the form 12s + k are in doubt. Then the years in which the twelve cases were settled and by whom are the following:\n\nThe last seven sporadic exceptions were settled as follows:\n\nPercy John Heawood conjectured in 1890 that for a given genus \"g\" > 0, the minimum number of colors necessary to color all graphs drawn on an orientable surface of that genus (or equivalently to color the regions of any partition of the surface into simply connected regions) is given by\n\nwhere formula_2 is the floor function.\n\nReplacing the genus by the Euler characteristic, we obtain a formula that covers both the orientable and non-orientable cases,\n\nThis relation holds, as Ringel and Youngs showed, for all surfaces except for the Klein bottle. Philip Franklin (1930) proved that the Klein bottle requires at most 6 colors, rather than 7 as predicted by the formula. The Franklin graph can be drawn on the Klein bottle in a way that forms six mutually-adjacent regions, showing that this bound is tight.\n\nThe upper bound, proved in Heawood's original short paper, is based on a greedy coloring algorithm. By manipulating the Euler characteristic, one can show that every graph embedded in the given surface must have at least one vertex of degree less than the given bound. If one removes this vertex, and colors the rest of the graph, the small number of edges incident to the removed vertex ensures that it can be added back to the graph and colored without increasing the needed number of colors beyond the bound. In the other direction, the proof is more difficult, and involves showing that in each case (except the Klein bottle) a complete graph with a number of vertices equal to the given number of colors can be embedded on the surface.\n\nThe torus has \"g\" = 1, so χ = 0. Therefore, as the formula states, any subdivision of the torus into regions can be colored using at most seven colors. The illustration shows a subdivision of the torus in which each of seven regions are adjacent to each other region; this subdivision shows that the bound of seven on the number of colors is tight for this case. The boundary of this subdivision forms an embedding of the Heawood graph onto the torus.\n\n"}
{"id": "27732058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27732058", "title": "Isotopy (semiotics)", "text": "Isotopy (semiotics)\n\nIn a story, we detect an isotopy when there is a repetition of a basic meaning trait (seme); such repetition, establishing some level of familiarity within the story, allows for a uniform reading/interpretation of it. An example of a sentence containing an isotopy is \"I drink some water\". The two words \"drink\" and \"water\" share a seme (a reference to liquids), and this gives homogeneity to the sentence.\n\nThis concept, introduced by Greimas in 1966, had a major impact on the field of semiotics, and was redefined multiple times. Catherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni extended the concept to denote the repetition of not only semes, but also other semiotic units (like phonemes for isotopies as rhymes, rhythm for prosody, etc.). Umberto Eco showed the flaws of using the concept of \"repetition\", and replaced it with the concept of \"direction\", redefining isotopy as \"the direction taken by an interpretation of the text\".\n\nThe concept was highly influential and has been revisited and redefined by multiple authors, starting from Greimas, to his epigons of the \"Paris school\", Umberto Eco, the \"Groupe µ\", and others. \n\nGreimas' initial definition was based on the concept of repetition (also termed recurrence or redundancy), was focused on semantics as it only regarded the repetition semes, and it stressed the role of isotopy of making possible a uniform reading of a story and resolving ambiguities. To quote his first 1966 formulation: \"a redundant set of semantic categories which make possible the uniform reading of the story.\" \n\nIn 1980 Umberto Eco showed a flaw of using the concept of \"repetition\". He noted that there are cases in which an isotopy is not a repetition of a seme, like in the French sentence \"l'ami des simples = l'herboriste\", in which \"ami\" (meaning lover, friend or fan) and \"simples\" (medicinal plants) does not appear to share a seme; to also embrace cases like this, Eco replaced the concept of \"repetition\" with the concept of \"direction\", defining isotopy more generally as \"a constancy in going in a direction that a text exhibits when submitted to rules of interpretative coherence.\"\n\nCatherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni systematically extended the concept of isotopy to denote the repetition of any semiotic unit. She identified semantic, phonetic, prosodic, stylistic, enunciative, rhetorical, presuppositional, syntactic, phonetic, and narrative isotopies. \n\nA semantic isotopy, the narrower and most common type of isotopy, the one of Greimas's original definition, is the recurrence of semes. A phonetic isotopy is the recurrence of phonomenes, like in rhyme, assonance and alliteration. A prosodic isotopy is the recurrence of the same rhythm.\n\nReviewing the many uses of the term isotopy, Eco concluded that although they all have something in common, isotopy is more of an \"umbrella term\" that cover all these different phenomena. Semantic isotopies alone can denote at times contextual disambiguation, subcategorization and selection restriction, anaphoric antecedent attribution, morphological agreement, or even other phenomena.\n\nMany derivative terms of isotopy have been defined, often with an added prefix, like \"bi-isotopy\", which could be used to define an ambiguous expression that has two possible interpretations.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Belgian semioticians known under the name \"Groupe µ\", introduced the concept of allotopy, conceived as the opposite of an isotopy. An allotopy is when two basic meaning traits (semes) contradict each other, as in the sentence \"I drink some concrete\".\n\n\n"}

Among his works, he wrote \"L'histoire des basques\" and also \"Histoire générale de la nation basque\", where he compares the basque dialects from France with those from Guipúzcoa and Álava.\n\nThe first known reference to a member of this family from Soule is a text dating to the 15th century which mentions Garzia Belaz de Medrano, a noble from Navarre. His grandson, Gérard de Bela (1550–1633), was a bailiff and lieutenant general serving under Jean de Belzunce, Captain-châtelain and Governor of Soule. Apart from Bela, this family used derivative surnames such as Belaspect, Belapeyre, Belagrace, Bela-Chéraute and Belapéritz. Athanasius of Belapeyre, the son of the Protestant Jacques de Bela and among the family's more prominent members, became a Catholic priest and ascended to the office of vicar general. Among his properties were the mill of Asconéguy and the Planterose House in Mauléon. The mill still has the coat of arms of the family, dated 1767, on the lintel of its entrance.\n\nAt the age of 18, Bela moved to Grenoble in search of adventure, and joined the French army as an artilleryman. He soon reached the rank of cadet, but after a perceived slight by the captain of his regiment, Bela challenged him to a duel and was subsequently imprisoned, but he managed to escape and fled to Germany, where joined the bodyguard of King Augustus III of Saxony. He then proceeded to Sweden. In this country he worked for their army as a Lieutenant and engineer. His love of drawing and mathematics led him to design fortifications of some importance. During the war of Polish succession, he was sent with the troops of a regiment of Dragoons and joined the defenders for Polish sovereignty. Being Captain of Dragoons he tried to defend the city of Dantzig, although he was made prisoner. Shortly after Bela managed to escape and retired to his homeland, having received a diploma of appreciation from the Polish King, naming him captain of his Royal Guard. Thanks to this feat, Bela was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of Dragoons and distinguished himself during the siege of Metz (1734). After a period in peace, he fought in Bohemia along the Marshal of France, and then also in Flanders and Germany. In 1745 as Lieutenant Colonel and when he had 36 years old, King Louis XV, assigned the formation of an army made up exclusively by Basques, which runs through the mountains and brings together a regiment of one thousand forty-six men, who are usually engaged in the conquest of mountainous terrain. His badge was a blue flag with the cross of St. Andrew in silver and the arms of the Kingdom of Navarre in the Center., the famous \"Volontaires Cantabres\", in which Bela was Colonel. The Cantabre regiment was disbanded in 1749. Later Bela challenged to a duel to an individual who was accused of embezzlement of funds from this body. He had a trial before the Court marshals of France sentenced him to six months of imprisonment, while his accuser had to retract. For this reason, Bela left military career and devoted himself to historical research, to write his military memoirs, to defend lawsuits, to play various public offices with special zeal, in short, to deploy a large activity. In 1748 he published his \"Exercices et Evolutions à l'usage du régiment Royal Cantabres\". A man of great erudition as evidenced by the large number of manuscripts, titles, memories and lots of documentation which left, as well as a history of the Basques from their origin to 1748, to which he dedicated 30 years of work, and it is divided into 12 books comprising the history of the seven Basque provinces more a dictionary of Basque dialects with the equivalent words in Hebrew, Greek, Celtic, armórico, Arabic, Latin gothic, Spanish and Italian. Bela encountered difficulties to print their work and was to deliver to the Benedictine Dom Sanadón - which would later be constitutional Bishop of the diocese. This extractó the work under the title Essai sur the noblesse des Basques, edited in Pau in 1785. Part of the manuscript of Bela was published by Clément Simon. Sanadon extract was translated into Spanish by Diego de Lazcano and published in Toulouse in 1786. Another translation was made by José Gironde, which released his version in 1858. The originals are in the National Library of Paris. Their military memoirs were published by Chaho in Ariel (1846) and by Duceré in 1896, with a biography of the author by j. of Jaurgain. Bring by his interest in the material progress of their fellow citizens, he translated into Basque works on Agriculture and economics, the quartermaster on duty refused to publish at the public expense. He also tried by various means obtain a small monopoly of wool knits for Mauleón, but their proposals were denied him by the Mayor; Workshop manufacture organized worked until four years before his death. Bela, as a member of the noble estate he was directly involved in the noble plot that led to the expulsion of members of the third estate in 1770. Later, in January 1774, acquired real rights over a large part of Zuberoa - Laruns, Mendibieu, Berrogain, Arrast, Larrory, Larrebieu, Moncayolle, Hôpital-Saint-Blaise, Sainte-Engrâce and Larrau-whose inhabitants ordered to recognize their manorial rights of hunting, rents, honours, etc., which succeeded for a couple of years until that alienation was overturned by the States. Come the revolution, Bela was stripped of more than half of his fortune, though it seems to be annoyed personally and not emigrated. His habit of greatness took him to invent a false pedigree, which was closely related with the nobles Belaz de Medrano, for whose descendants signed a testament on March 1, 1793.\n\n"}

He was notable for his combative character and his political commitment. His poetry touched on themes of love, art, his own political commitment, drawing attention to wrongs, ethnography, physics, history, immateriality, mythology, the animal world, poetic expression, the passing of time, religion, society, language, agricultural labour, urbanism, and geography. The Day of Galician Literature was devoted to him in 2016.\n\nManuel María was the son of two well-to-do farmers, Antonio Fernández Núñez, who was the mayor of Outeiro de Rei, and Pastora Teixeiro Casanova. He went to primary school in his small village of Rábade. In 1942 he moved to Lugo to carry out his secondary studies at the Marist Brothers school. In Lugo, at the age of 20, he began his precocious literary career participating in a conference circuit called \"Jóvenes valores lucenses.\" This helped him get in touch with members of a group that met at the Méndez Núñez cafeteria: Luís Pimentel, Ánxel Fole, Juan Rof Codina, Aquilino Iglesia Alvariño, and others. This was his introduction to Galicianism and the Galician literary world. His friendship with Uxío Novoneyra also dates from this period.\n\nIn 1950 he published his first collection of poems, \"Muiñeiro de brétemas\" (\"Miller of mists\"), which inaugurated the so-called \"Escola da Tebra\" (School of Shadows). His disappointment after failing the entrance exams to the University of Santiago inspired his second collection of poems, \"Morrendo a cada intre\" (\"Dying every minute\"). He did his military service in Santiago de Compostela and there he attended a gathering at Café Español, where he became a great friend of Carlos Maside. He then returned to Lugo, where he studied to become an attorney. In 1954 he won a prize at the \"Xogos Florais\" (Floral Games) in Ourense. In 1958 he became a court attorney in Monforte de Lemos, where he remained most of the rest of his life. To that city he dedicated a collection of poems, \"Cancioneiro de Monforte de Lemos\". The following year he married Saleta Goi García in Lugo.\n\nAlthough poetry was his preferred medium, Manuel María also attempted essays, narratives and plays. He moved away from a pessimistic existentialist position towards social and political commitment. In the troubled period of the 1960s and 1970s, he took part in the undercover reorganisation of the Galician nationalist political parties; he also worked with various organisations devoted to restoring Galician culture, arranging conferences and reciting poems. He managed the Xistral publishing house and together with its founder he ran the bookshop of the same name. He was made a corresponding member of the Royal Galician Academy in 1970, but renounced his membership in a public letter that appeared in the Galician newspapers in 1975.\n\nA grass-root militant of the Galician People's Union and of the \"Frente Cultural\" of the Galician National-Popular Assembly, he was elected councillor in Monforte in 1979 for the Galician National-Popular Bloc. He resigned in 1985, and moved to A Coruña to fully devote himself to literary and cultural activities. His column, \"Walking on Earth\", appeared in the newspaper \"Our Earth\". One of the last campaigns in which he took part was in response to the Prestige oil spill disaster, under the names of \"Burla Negra\" (\" Black Mockery\") and the Plataforma Nunca Máis (\"Never More\" Platform).\n\nIn 1997 he was appointed partner of honour of the Galician Writers Association. He was re-admitted to the Royal Galician Academy in February 2003, under the sponsorship of Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín and others. respondido por Méndez Ferrín.\n\nHe died at A Coruña on 8 September 2004, and was buried in the church of Santa Isabel, Outeiro de Rei.\n\nOn 7 September 2013 his house-museum in Outeiro de Rei was opened, \"Casa das Hortas\" (\"the House of the Vegetable gardens\"). On 4 July 2015, it was announced that the Royal Galician Academy would dedicate Galician Literature Day (May 17) of 2016 to his memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "368870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368870", "title": "Nicaraguan Sign Language", "text": "Nicaraguan Sign Language\n\nNicaraguan Sign Language (ISN; ) is a sign language that was largely spontaneously developed by deaf children in a number of schools in western Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s. It is of particular interest to the linguists who study it, because it offers a unique opportunity to study what they believe to be the birth of a new language.\n\nBefore the 1970s, there was no deaf community in Nicaragua. Deaf people were largely isolated from each other and mostly used simple home sign systems and gesture ('mímicas') to communicate with their families and friends, though there were several cases of idioglossia among deaf siblings. The conditions necessary for a language to arise occurred in 1977, when a center for special education established a program initially attended by 50 deaf children. The number of students at the school (in the Managua neighborhood of San Judas) grew to 100 by 1979, the year of the Sandinista revolution.\n\nIn 1980, a vocational school for deaf adolescents was opened in the area of Managua called Villa Libertad. By 1983, there were over 400 deaf students enrolled in the two schools. Initially, the language program emphasized spoken Spanish and lipreading, and the use of signs by teachers was limited to fingerspelling (using simple signs to sign the alphabet). The program achieved little success, with most students failing to grasp the concept of Spanish words.\n\nThe children remained linguistically disconnected from their teachers, but the schoolyard, the street, and the school bus provided fertile ground for them to communicate with each other. By combining gestures and elements of their home-sign systems, a pidgin-like form and a creole-like language rapidly emerged. They were creating their own language. This \"first-stage\" pidgin has been called \"Lenguaje de Signos Nicaragüense\" (LSN) and is still used by many who attended the school at this time.\n\nStaff at the school, unaware of the development of this new language, saw the children's gesturing as mime and as a failure to acquire Spanish. Unable to understand what the children were saying to each other, they asked for outside help. In June 1986, the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education contacted Judy Kegl, an American Sign Language linguist from MIT. As Kegl and other researchers began to analyze the language, they noticed that the young children had taken the pidgin-like form of the older children to a higher level of complexity, with verb agreement and other conventions of grammar. This more complex sign language is now known as \"Idioma de Señas de Nicaragua\" (ISN).\n\nISN offers a rare opportunity to study the emergence of a new language. Before ISN, studies of the early development of languages had focused on creoles, which develop from the mixture of two (or more) distinct communities of fluent speakers. In contrast, ISN was developed by a group of young people with only non-conventional home sign systems and gesture.\n\nSome linguists, such as Judy Kegl and R.J. Senghas see what happened in Managua as proof that language acquisition is hard-wired inside the human brain. \"The Nicaraguan case is absolutely unique in history,\" Steven Pinker, author of \"The Language Instinct\", maintains. \"We've been able to see how it is that children—not adults—generate language, and we have been able to record it happening in great scientific detail. And it's the only time that we've actually seen a language being created out of thin air.\"\n\nSince 1990, other researchers have begun to study and report on the development of this unique language and its community (including Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola, Richard Senghas, Laura Polich, and Jennie Pyers). While each has their own interpretation of the events leading to this language and its development since, all agree that the phenomenon being studied is one of the richest sources of data on language emergence discovered to date.\n\nBierma provides a good foundation to ISN structures. He takes as an example \"rolling down\". While a person may visualize this as one motion, ISN splits this action into two parts, manner and direction. These smaller parts allow for them to be rearranged to create different phrases. The most sophisticated speakers use an A-B-A speech pattern; in our example, this reflects the signs roll-down-roll, to note that the rolling down motion is continuous, not that the subject rolled and then descended.\n\nSpatial modulations are the building blocks of all sign languages studied to date. A neutrally placed sign is in front of the chest; however, a sign can be modulated, or directionally altered, to convey many grammatical changes.\n\nSpatial modulations can perform functions including \"indicating person or number; providing deictic, locative, or temporal information; or indicating grammatical relationships\".\n\nIn the article written by Senghas and Coppola, they explore spatial modulation as it occurs in ISN. They found that this movement from the neutral space was much more common among signers who began learning at a younger age than their peers who did so when they were older. Taking this into consideration (as well as their studies on spatial modulations for indicating shared reference and the speed at which signers at different stages of learning signed), Senghas and Coppola determined that child learners are creating Nicaraguan Sign Language; they \"changed the language as they learned it\". The fact that students who began signing at a younger age use spatial modulation more often than their older peers, who began signing at ISN's conception, is indicative that the language matures as the younger cohorts make the grammar more complex. They go on to note that only when a language is not matured, such as with ISN, do language-learning abilities show their transformational and creative capacity.\n\nIn the signing space, the use of pointing to indicate referent identity has increased greatly since the 1980s. Points can serve a \"pronoun-like function, coordinating with the spatial modulations to verbs, to indicate the argument structure of the sentence, and to co-index referents across discourse\".\nSenghas and Coppola have noted that signers who learned ISN before the Extensive Contact Period (before 1983) were inconsistent in whether an event was represented as rotated or reflected (unrotated) in the signing space. If the signer was watching an event where a man on the signer's left gave an object to a woman on the signer's right, it was at random (when the signer reiterated the scene) whether or not the signer would use spatial modulation to mark left and right based on his view from in front of the scene or as if the signer were facing the same way as the actors in the scene.\n\nSigners who began learning after 1983 were not inconsistent in this way. Across multiple signers and multiple scenes, signers would apply the same rotated representation. Senghas and Coppola suggested that this meant that \"spatial modulations are being used as a shared grammatical element among this age cohort\".\n\nResearchers disagree regarding at what stage in the development of ISN it was to be considered a full-fledged language.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of her research in Nicaragua in 1986 until Nicaraguan Sign Language was well established, Kegl carefully avoided introducing the sign languages she knew, in particular American Sign Language, to the deaf community in Nicaragua. A type of linguistic imperialism had been occurring internationally for decades where individuals would introduce ASL to populations of deaf people in other countries, often supplanting existing local sign languages. Kegl's policy was to document and study rather than to impose or change the language or its community. While she did not interfere with deaf Nicaraguans gaining exposure to other sign languages, she did not introduce such opportunities. She has, however, documented contact and influences with other sign languages that began as early as the 1990s and that continue; critics, such as Felicia Ackerman, have taken issue with the ethics of isolating the Nicaraguan children.\n\nKegl's organization Nicaraguan Sign Language Projects helped establish a deaf school staffed entirely by deaf Nicaraguan teachers and has supported deaf Nicaraguans in attending and presenting at international conferences.\n\nWilliam Stokoe, known by many as the father of American Sign Language linguistics, disagreed that the emergence of ISN is evidence of a language acquisition device. Stokoe also questions assertions that the language has emerged entirely without outside influence from (for example) Spanish or ASL. At present, there is no final evidence available to resolve the controversy surrounding nativism vs. cultural learning, and the dispute reaches far into theoretical linguistics, where approaches may conceptualize grammar in different and incompatible ways. Even if the evidence collected thus far seems to indicate a lack of access to Spanish and ASL in the early emergence process, it remains a possibility that the development of ISN is facilitated by the speaker's exposure to more general communicative strategies in early infancy.\n\nAlternatives to theories proposing a language acquisition device have been presented by Michael Tomasello (among others). Tomasello argues that the process of acquiring a first language is boosted by non-linguistic communication, as in the establishment of joint intentional frames and in the understanding of communicative intentions.\n\nIn any case, once ISN came into being, like other languages, it actively engaged in contact with languages in its environment.\n\nR.J. Senghas (1997) used the phrase \"unspeakable, unwritable\" language in the title of his dissertation to highlight the common misconception that those languages without a written form are not as \"real\" (a view often held by those who do not study indigenous languages). In a similar fashion, sign languages are often not given proper recognition because they are not spoken or written. (Senghas has never claimed that Nicaraguan Sign Language is unwritable, just that it was often thought as such by those who do not study sign languages).\n\nGenerally, the influence literacy has on the status of a language is also addressed in debates of the so-called \"written language paradigm,\" where it is acknowledged that the availability of written language to some extent must be considered as a culturally and historically dependent phenomenon. Tim Ingold, a British anthropologist, discussed these matters at some length in \"Perception of the Environment\" (2000), though he does not specifically deal with ISN. Since 1996, however, Nicaraguans have been writing their language by hand and on computer using SignWriting. Currently, Nicaraguan Sign Language has the largest library of texts written in any sign language, including three volumes of reading lessons in ISN, Spanish I and II (two levels of texts, workbooks and primers), \"Cuentos Españoles\" (a collection of stories in Spanish with ISN glossaries), a geography text, and many others.\n\n\n\n"}

An Italian working in Constantinople, he served as a Latin interpreter for Emperor Manuel I Komnenos.\n\nPascalis compiled the \"Liber thesauri occulti\", a Latin book on dream interpretation, in 1165, but appears not to have completed it himself. The second book and the first part of the third were translated or adapted from the \"Oneirocriticon\" of Achmet and the classical treatise of Artemidoros. His are the earliest known Latin translations of excerpts from Artemidoros. In the first part of the work, Pascalis also draws on Aristotle, quoting from what he refers to as the \"liber de naturis animalium\".\n\nPascalis works within the dream classification system of Macrobius:\nElaborating on the three \"true\" types, Pascalis distinguishes each by the degree to which the soul achieves liberty from the body, and by literary mode. In the \"somnium\", the soul perceives the future allegorically; in the \"visio\", historically; and in the \"oraculum\", prophetically. The future can sometimes be revealed directly, but often dreams rely on integument, allegory, and figure. Pascalis quotes the Solomon of the occult tradition as saying:\n\nWhat Solomon means, Pascalis goes on to explain, is not that we should avoid the interpretation of dreams, but rather that we should recognize that \"littera occidit, spiritus autem vivificat\" (\"The letter kills, but the spirit brings to life\"). Reason allows us to investigate the truth that is symbolized.\n\nSteven Kruger has discussed the dream theory of Pascalis in the context of medical discourse, or \"somatization,\" resulting from the introduction of new medical and scientific texts to Europe. While the \"Liber thesauri occulti\" draws on the tradition of humors, Pascalis goes beyond the connection Macrobius makes between \"insomnium\" and hunger or thirst to offer an elaborate psychosomatics. Where Macrobius had explained the \"visum\" in terms of an \"incubus\", Pascalis offers a complex medical explanation involving blood circulation, the bodily position of the sleeper, and humoral disposition.\n\nIn 1169, Pascalis translated the \"Cyranides\", a Hermetic magico-medical compilation. In his preface, he summarized his method:\n\nOther Latin translations from Greek by Pascalis include the \"Ystoria Beate Virginis Marie\" by the 8th–9th-century priest and monk Epiphanios and the \"Disputatio contra Judaeos\" attributed (with difficulties of chronology) to Anastasios of Sinai.\n\n\n"}

It was the first high-level (non-von Neumann) programming language to be designed for a computer.\n\n\"\"Kalkül\" means formal system – the Hilbert-style deduction system is for example originally called \"Hilbert-Kalkül\"\", so Plankalkül means \"formal system for planning\".\n\nWhile working on his intended doctoral dissertation, Konrad Zuse developed a formal system of notation for algorithms because no such system was yet known. This notation could only handle linear (unbranched and unlooped) calculation plans. Zuse's formal sytem on the other hand did include branched and looped calculation. He had intended to submit an early manuscript, written in 1944, as a PhD thesis, but the collapse of Nazi Germany made this impossible.\n\nNear the end of the Second World War, most of the computers Zuse was building were destroyed by Allied bombs. He was able to rescue one machine, the Z4, and move it to the small Alpine village of Hinterstein. After the war it was not possible for Zuse to continue building his computers, so he devoted his time to the development of a higher level programming model and language for them called the Plankalkül.\n\nNotes survive with scribblings about such a plan calculation dating back to May 1939 and in 1942 Zuse began writing a computer chess program in Plankalkül. In 1944 Zuse met with the German logician and philosopher Heinrich Scholz and they discussed Zuse's Plankalkül. In March 1945 Scholz personally expressed his deep appreciation for Zuse's utilization of the logical calculus. Plankalkül was not published at that time owing to a combination of factors such as conditions in World War II and postwar Germany and his efforts to commercialise the Z3 computer and its successors. \nBy 1946, Zuse had written a book on the subject but this remained unpublished.\n\nOnly in 1948 Zuse published a paper about the Plankalkül in the \"Archiv der Mathematik\" but still did not attract much feedback – for a long time to come programming a computer would only be thought of as programming with machine code. In the same year Zuse introduced his programming language at the Annual Meeting of the GAMM.\n\nThe Plankalkül was eventually more comprehensively published in 1972 and the first compiler for it was implemented in 1975 in a dissertation by Joachim Hohmann. Other independent implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by the Free University of Berlin.\n\nZuse was unhappy that the designers of ALGOL 58 did not acknowledge the Plankalkül, even though many of them had been aware of it.\n\nPlankalkül has drawn comparisons to APL and relational algebra. It includes assignment statements, subroutines, conditional statements, iteration, floating point arithmetic, arrays, hierarchical record structures, assertions, exception handling, and other advanced features such as goal-directed execution. The Plankalkül provides a data structure called \"generalized graph\" (\"verallgemeinerter Graph\"), which can be used to represent geometrical structures.\n\nPlankalkül shared an idiosyncratic notation using multiple lines with Frege's \"Begriffsschrift\" of 1879 (dealing with mathematical logic).\n\nSome features of the Plankalkül:\n\nThe only primitive data type in the Plankalkül is a single bit, denoted by S0. Further data types can be built up from these.\n\nZuse called a single program a \"Rechenplan\" (i.e. \"computation plan\"), and in 1944 he already envisioned a device that should read and then automatically translate a mathematical formulation of a program into machine readable punched film stock – a device which he called \"Planfertigungsgerät\" (i.e. \"plan construction device\").\n\nThe original notation was two dimensional. For a later implementation in the 1990s, a linear notation was developed.\n\nThe following example shows a program (in a linear transcription), which calculates the maximum of three variables by calling the function codice_1:\n\nIn a lecture in 1957 Zuse mentioned his hope that the Plankalkül \"after some time as a Sleeping Beauty, will yet come to life\".\n\nHeinz Rutishauser, one of the founders of ALGOL:\n\n\n"}

Sentence extraction is a low-cost approach compared to more knowledge-intensive deeper approaches which require additional knowledge bases such as ontologies or linguistic knowledge. In short \"sentence extraction\" works as a filter which allows only important sentences to pass.\n\nThe major downside of applying sentence-extraction techniques to the task of summarization is the loss of coherence in the resulting summary. \nNevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers.\n\nUsually, a combination of heuristics is used to determine the most important sentences within the document. Each heuristic assigns a (positive or negative) score to the sentence. After all heuristics have been applied, the highest-scoring sentences are included in the summary.\nThe individual heuristics are weighted according to their importance.\n\nSeminal papers which laid the foundations for many techniques used today have been published by Hans Peter Luhn in 1958 and H. P Edmundson in 1969.\n\nLuhn proposed to assign more weight to sentences at the beginning of the document or a paragraph.\nEdmundson stressed the importance of title-words for summarization and was the first to employ stop-lists in order to filter uninformative words of low semantic content (e.g. most grammatical words such as \"of\", \"the\", \"a\"). He also distinguished between \"bonus words\" and \"stigma words\", i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form \"significant\") or unimportant information.\nHis idea of using key-words, i.e. words which occur significantly frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today's summarizers. With large linguistic corpora available today, the tf–idf value which originated in information retrieval, can be successfully applied to identify the key words of a text: If for example the word \"cat\" occurs significantly more often in the text to be summarized (TF = \"term frequency\") than in the corpus (IDF means \"inverse document frequency\"; here the corpus is meant by \"document\"), then \"cat\" is likely to be an important word of the text; the text may in fact be a text about cats.\n\n"}

It is spoken by 4,800 people (as of 2004) in Luang Prabang Province, Laos.\n\nTai Nuea is a tonal language with a very limited inventory of syllables with no consonant clusters. 16 syllable-initial consonants can be combined with 84 syllable finals and six tones.\n\nTai Nuea has 17 consonants:\n\nAll consonants except for n can occur at the beginning of a syllable. Only the following consonants can occur at the end of a syllable: .\n\nTai Nuea has ten vowels and 13 diphthongs:\n\nTai Nuea has six tones:\n\nSyllables with p, t, k as final consonants can have only one of three tones (1., 3., or 5.).\n\nThe Tai Le script is closely related to other Southeast-Asian writing systems such as the Thai alphabet and is thought to date back to the 14th century.\n\nThe original Tai Nuea spelling did not generally mark tones and failed to distinguish several vowels. It was reformed to make these distinctions, and diacritics were introduced to mark tones. The resulting writing system was officially introduced in 1956. In 1988, the spelling of tones was reformed; special tone letters were introduced instead of the earlier Latin diacritics.\n\nThe modern alphabet has a total of 35 letters, including the five tone letters. It is encoded under the name \"Tai Le\" in the Basic Multilingual Plane of Unicode at U+1950-U+1974.\n\nThe Tai Nuea numerals are similar to Myanmar numerals; they are in fact unified with Myanmar's numerals in Unicode (U+1040-U+1049) despite some glyph variations.\n\nThe transcription below is given according to the Unicode tables.\n\nConsonants that are not followed by a vowel letter are pronounced with the inherent vowel [a]. Other vowels are indicated with the following letters:\n\nDiphthongs are formed by combining some vowel letters with the consonant [w] and some vowel letters with ᥭ [ai]/[j].\n\nIn the Thai and Tai Lü writing systems, the tone value in the pronunciation of a written syllable depends on the tone class of the initial consonant, vowel length and syllable structure. In contrast, the Tai Nuea writing system has a very straightforward spelling of tones, with one letter (or diacritic) for each tone. The first tone is not marked.\n\nExamples in the table show the syllable [ta] in different tones, in old (1956) and new (1988) spellings.\n\nTai Nuea has official status in some parts of Yunnan (China), where it is used on signs and in education. Yunnan People's Radio Station (\"Yúnnán rénmín guǎngbō diàntái\" 云南人民广播电台) broadcasts in Tai Nuea. On the other hand, however, very little printed material is published in Tai Nuea in China. However, many signs of roads and stores in Mangshi are in Tai Nuea.\n\nIn Thailand, a collection of 108 proverbs was published with translations into Thai and English.\n\n\n"}

It generalizes the concept of a string, by not forcing the letters to always be in a fixed order, but allowing certain reshufflings to take place. Traces were introduced by Cartier and Foata in 1969 to give a combinatorial proof of MacMahon's Master theorem. Traces are used in theories of concurrent computation, where commuting letters stand for portions of a job that can execute independently of one another, while non-commuting letters stand for locks, synchronization points or thread joins.\n\nThe trace monoid or free partially commutative monoid is a monoid of traces. In a nutshell, it is constructed as follows: sets of commuting letters are given by an independency relation. These induce an equivalence relation of equivalent strings; the elements of the equivalence classes are the traces. The equivalence relation then partitions up the free monoid (the set of all strings of finite length) into a set of equivalence classes; the result is still a monoid; it is a quotient monoid and is called the \"trace monoid\". The trace monoid is universal, in that all homomorphic monoids are in fact isomorphic.\n\nTrace monoids are commonly used to model concurrent computation, forming the foundation for process calculi. They are the object of study in trace theory. The utility of trace monoids comes from the fact that they are isomorphic to the monoid of dependency graphs; thus allowing algebraic techniques to be applied to graphs, and vice versa. They are also isomorphic to history monoids, which model the history of computation of individual processes in the context of all scheduled processes on one or more computers.\n\nLet formula_1 denote the free monoid, that is, the set of all strings written in the alphabet formula_2. Here, the asterisk denotes, as usual, the Kleene star. An independency relation formula_3 on formula_2 then induces a binary relation formula_5 on formula_1, where formula_7 if and only if there exist formula_8, and a pair formula_9 such that formula_10 and formula_11. Here, formula_12 and formula_13 are understood to be strings (elements of formula_1), while formula_15 and formula_16 are letters (elements of formula_2).\n\nThe trace is defined as the symmetric, reflexive and transitive closure of formula_5. The trace is thus an equivalence relation on formula_1, and is denoted by formula_20. The subscript \"D\" on the equivalence simply denotes that the equivalence is obtained from the independency \"I\" induced by the dependency \"D\". Clearly, different dependencies will give different equivalence relations.\n\nThe transitive closure simply implies that formula_21 if and only if there exists a sequence of strings formula_22 such that formula_23 and formula_24 and formula_25 for all formula_26.\n\nThe trace monoid, commonly denoted as formula_27, is defined as the quotient monoid\n\nThe homomorphism \n\nis commonly referred to as the natural homomorphism or canonical homomorphism. That the terms \"natural\" or \"canonical\" are deserved follows from the fact that this morphism embodies a universal property, as discussed in a later section.\n\nConsider the alphabet formula_30. A possible dependency relation is\n\nThe corresponding independency is\n\nTherefore, the letters formula_33 commute. Thus, for example, a trace equivalence class for the string formula_34 would be\n\nThe equivalence class formula_36 is an element of the trace monoid.\n\nThe cancellation property states that equivalence is maintained under right cancellation. That is, if formula_37, then formula_38. Here, the notation formula_39 denotes right cancellation, the removal of the first occurrence of the letter \"a\" from the string \"w\", starting from the right-hand side. Equivalence is also maintained by left-cancellation. Several corollaries follow:\n\n\nA strong form of Levi's lemma holds for traces. Specifically, if formula_49 for strings \"u\", \"v\", \"x\", \"y\", then there exist strings formula_50 and formula_51 such that formula_52\nfor all letters formula_53 and formula_54 such that formula_55 occurs in formula_56 and formula_57 occurs in formula_58, and\n\nA dependency morphism (with respect to a dependency \"D\") is a morphism\nto some monoid \"M\", such that the \"usual\" trace properties hold, namely:\n\nDependency morphisms are universal, in the sense that for a given, fixed dependency \"D\", if formula_61 is a dependency morphism to a monoid \"M\", then \"M\" is isomorphic to the trace monoid formula_72. In particular, the natural homomorphism is a dependency morphism.\n\nThere are two well-known normal forms for words in trace monoids. One is the \"lexicographic\" normal form, due to Anatolij V. Anisimov and Donald Knuth, and the other is the \"Foata\" normal form due to Pierre Cartier and Dominique Foata who studied the trace monoid for its combinatorics in the 1960s.\n\nJust as a formal language can be regarded as a subset of formula_1 the set of all possible strings, so then a trace language is defined as subset of formula_72 all possible traces.\n\nA language formula_75 is a trace language, or is said to be consistent with dependency \"D\" if\n\nwhere\n\nis the trace closure of a set of strings, and\n\nis the set of strings in a set of traces.\n\nGeneral references\nSeminal publications\n"}

Reaction to it brought about a major change in the politics of Wales. Historian John Davies has said that the lecture was \"the catalyst\" for the formation of \"Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg\" (the Welsh Language Society), and the start of a period of direct-action agitation to enhance the status of the Welsh language. Its direct effect on the formation of \"Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg\" is described in a history of that society. It has been said that \"of all the memorable phrases coined in the twentieth century none has greater resonance for the Welsh speaker than \"Tynged yr Iaith\" . . . which still haunts or inspires champions of the native tongue on the cusp of the new millennium\". It had the unintended effect of establishing language agitation as a movement separate from the mainstream of nationalist politics. The burgeoning effects from the initial stimulus of \"Tynged yr Iaith\" were listed by Gwyn Williams:\n\n\"Tynged yr Iaith\" was broadcast as the BBC Welsh Region's annual \"Radio Lecture\" for 1962. The lecture became available as an LP recording (hear clip ), and as a pamphlet, and is available in an English translation by G. Aled Williams. The lecture was delivered during the period between the taking of the census in 1961 and the publication of the results on the use of Welsh. Lewis anticipated that the figures when published would \"shock and disappoint\", and that Welsh would \"end as a living language, should the present trend continue, about the beginning of the twenty-first century\".\n\nThe lecture proceeded with a historical analysis of the status of the Welsh language since the Act of Union of 1535 mandated the use of English for the purposes of law and administration in Wales. Lewis maintained that the official government attitude was to desire the eradication of Welsh, and that Welsh opposition to this, if it existed, was largely unheard. He quotes at length from the Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales, known as the Blue Books, published in 1847, which criticised the influence both of the language and of Nonconformism on the life of Wales. He quotes specifically Commissioner R. W. Lingen's opinion that Welsh monoglots migrating from the countryside to the coalfields were prevented by their language from making any social advance. Lewis referred to this opinion as accurate and perceptive. He said that the industrial areas \"did not contribute anything new either to Welsh social life or to the literature of the eisteddfodau\", and that Welsh Nonconformity united town and country but \"at the same time kept them standing still\".\n\nLewis said that the anger and wrath provoked by the Blue Books resulted in no action, and that \"the whole of Wales, and Welsh Nonconformity in particular, adopted all the policy and main recommendations of the baleful report\". The few proponents of language revival were at the time regarded as eccentric. Lewis opined that during the period of \"awakening\" in 1860–1890, it might have been possible to establish the use of Welsh in education and administration throughout Wales, but that in 1962 this was not possible.\n\nAddressing the current situation, Lewis pointed out that central government no longer considered the language a threat. In fact, it could afford to promote bilingualism in Wales. Lewis saw this as merely consigning Welsh to a \"respectable and peaceful death and a burial without mourning\". \"If Wales seriously demanded to have Welsh as an official language on a par with English\", he said, \"the opposition—harsh, vindictive and violent—would come from Wales\". He discusses the ineffectual opposition to the drowning of the culturally significant Tryweryn valley, saying that government had \"taken the measure of the feebleness of Welsh Wales\" and \"need not concern itself about it any more\". It could \"leave that to the Welsh local authorities\".\n\nThis led him to discuss the celebrated case of Trefor and Eileen Beasley of Llangennech who, between 1952 and 1960, refused to pay their local taxes unless the tax demands were in Welsh. The local authority (Llanelli Rural District) was 84% Welsh-speaking in 1951, and Lewis pointed out that all the Rural District's councillors and officials were Welsh speakers. At the end of the eight-year battle, during which the Beasleys three times had their furniture taken by bailiffs, bilingual tax demands were finally issued.\n\nLewis took the Beasley case as a model for future action, but significantly added \"this cannot be done reasonably except in those districts where Welsh-speakers are a substantial proportion of the population\". He proposed to make it impossible for the business of local and central government to continue without using Welsh. \"It is a policy for a movement\", he said, \"in the areas where Welsh is a spoken language in daily use\". It would be \"nothing less than a revolution\".\n\nGwyn Williams said there were contrary effects. There was enthusiastic uptake of the cause of the language in the middle class, both English- and Welsh-speaking. But he saw the across-the-board implementation of language policies as causing the increasingly English-speaking industrial working-class (contemptuously dismissed by Lewis) to feel disenfranchised and excluded. He went on to blame this reaction for the \"No\" vote in the Welsh devolution referendum, 1979, in which the vote split very much on language lines.\n\nIn 1976, Clive Betts pointed out that the language movement was dissipating its efforts by ignoring Lewis's insistence that action should be restricted to Welsh-speaking areas—to the Bro Gymraeg, and called for a restricted Quebec-style policy in the Bro, as Lewis had suggested.\n\n"}
{"id": "33951834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33951834", "title": "Word recognition", "text": "Word recognition\n\nWord recognition, according to Literacy Information and Communication System (LINCS) is \"the ability of a reader to recognize written words correctly and virtually effortlessly\". It is sometimes referred to as \"isolated word recognition\" because it involves a reader's ability to recognize words individually from a list without needing similar words for contextual help. LINCS continues to say that \"rapid and effortless word recognition is the main component of fluent reading\" and explains that these skills can be improved by \"practic[ing] with flashcards, lists, and word grids\".\n\nThe article \"The Science of Word Recognition\" says that \"evidence from the last 20 years of work in cognitive psychology indicates that we use the letters within a word to recognize a word\". Over time, other theories have been put forth proposing the mechanisms by which words are recognized in isolation, yet with both speed and accuracy. These theories focus more on the significance of individual letters and letter-shape recognition (ex. serial letter recognition and parallel letter recognition). Other factors such as saccadic eye movements and the linear relationship between letters also affect the way we recognize words.\n\nAn article in \"ScienceDaily\" suggests that \"early word recognition is key to lifelong reading skills\". There are different ways to develop these skills. For example, creating flash cards for words that appear at a high frequency is considered a tool for overcoming dyslexia. It has been argued that prosody, the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry, can improve word recognition.\n\nWord recognition is a manner of reading based upon the immediate perception of what word a familiar grouping of letters represents. This process exists in opposition to phonetics and word analysis, as a different method of recognizing and verbalizing visual language (i.e. reading). Word recognition functions primarily on automaticity. On the other hand, phonetics and word analysis rely on the basis of cognitively applying learned grammatical rules for the blending of letters, sounds, graphemes, and morphemes.\n\nWord recognition is measured as a matter of speed, such that a word with a high level of recognition is read faster than a novel one. This manner of testing suggests that comprehension of the meaning of the words being read is not required, but rather the ability to recognize them in a way that allows proper pronunciation. Therefore, context is unimportant, and word recognition is often assessed with words presented in isolation in formats such as flash cards Nevertheless, ease in word recognition, as in fluency, enables proficiency that fosters comprehension of the text being read.\n\nThe intrinsic value of word recognition may be obvious due to the prevalence of literacy in modern society. However, its role may be less conspicuous in the areas of literacy learning, second-language learning, and developmental delays in reading. As word recognition is better understood, more reliable and efficient forms of teaching may be discovered for both children and adult learners of first-language literacy. Such information may also benefit second-language learners with acquisition of novel words and letter characters. Furthermore, a better understanding of the processes involved in word recognition may enable more specific treatments for individuals with reading disabilities.\n\nBouma shape, named after the Dutch vision researcher Herman Bouma, refers to the overall outline, or shape, of a word. Herman Bouma discussed the role of \"global word shape\" in his word recognition experiment conducted in 1973. Theories of bouma shape became popular in word recognition, suggesting people recognize words from the shape the letters make in a group relative to each other. This contrasts the idea that letters are read individually. Instead, via prior exposure, people become familiar with outlines, and thereby recognize them the next time they are presented with the same word, or bouma.\n\nThe slower pace with which people read words written entirely in upper-case, or with alternating upper- and lower-case letters, supports the bouma theory. The theory holds that a novel bouma shape created by changing the lower-case letters to upper-case hinders a person's recall ability. James Cattell also supported this theory through his study, which gave evidence for an effect he called word superiority. This referred to the improved ability of people to deduce letters if the letters were presented within a word, rather than a mix of random letters. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that readers are less likely to notice misspelled words with a similar bouma shape than misspelled words with a different bouma shape.\n\nThough these effects have been consistently replicated, many of their findings have been contested. Some have suggested that the reading ability of upper-case words is due to the amount of practice a person has with them. People who practice become faster at reading upper-case words, countering the importance of the bouma. Additionally, the word superiority effect might result from familiarity with phonetic combinations of letters, rather than the outlines of words, according to psychologists James McClelland and James Johnson.\n\nParallel letter recognition is the most widely accepted model of word recognition by psychologists today. In this model, all letters within a group are perceived simultaneously for word recognition. In contrast, the serial recognition model proposes that letters are recognized individually, one by one, before being integrated for word recognition. It predicts that single letters are identified faster and more accurately than many letters together, as in a word. However, this model was rejected because it cannot explain the word superiority effect, which states that readers can identify letters more quickly and accurately in the context of a word rather than in isolation.\n\nA more modern approach to word recognition has been based on recent research on neuron functioning. The visual aspects of a word, such as horizontal and vertical lines or curves, are thought to activate word-recognizing receptors. From those receptors, neural signals are sent to either excite or inhibit connections to other words in a person's memory. The words with characters that match the visual representation of the observed word receive excitatory signals. As the mind further processes the appearance of the word, inhibitory signals simultaneously reduce activation to words in one's memory with a dissimilar appearance. This neural strengthening of connections to relevant letters and words, as well as the simultaneous weakening of associations with irrelevant ones, eventually activates the correct word as part of word recognition in the neural network.\n\nUsing positron emission tomography (PET) scans and event-related potentials, researchers have located two separate areas in the fusiform gyrus that respond specifically to strings of letters. The posterior fusiform gyrus responds to words and non-words, regardless of their semantic context. The anterior fusiform gyrus is affected by the semantic context, and whether letter combinations are words or pseudowords (novel letter combinations that mimic phonetic conventions, ex. shing). This role of the anterior fusiform gyrus may correlate to higher processing of the word's concept and meaning. Both these regions are distinct from areas that respond to other types of complex stimuli, such as faces or colored patterns, and are part of a functionally specialized ventral pathway. Within 100 milliseconds (ms) of fixating on a word, an area of the left inferotemporal cortex processes its surface structure. Semantic information begins to be processed after 150 ms and shows widely distributed cortical network activation. After 200 ms, the integration of the different kinds of information occurs.\n\nThe accuracy with which readers recognize words depends on the area of the retina that is stimulated. Reading in English selectively trains specific regions of the left hemiretina for processing this type of visual information, making this part of the visual field optimal for word recognition. As words drift from this optimal area, word recognition accuracy declines. Because of this training, effective neural organization develops in the corresponding left cerebral hemisphere.\n\nEyes make brief, unnoticeable movements called saccades approximately three to four times per second. Saccades are separated by fixations, which are moments when the eyes are not moving. During saccades, visual sensitivity is diminished, which is called saccadic suppression. This ensures that the majority of the intake of visual information occurs during fixations. Lexical processing does, however, continue during saccades. The timing and accuracy of word recognition relies on where in the word the eye is currently fixating. Recognition is fastest and most accurate when fixating in the middle of the word. This is due to a decrease in visual acuity that results as letters are situated farther from the fixated location and become harder to see.\n\nThe word frequency effect suggests that words that appear the most in printed language are easier to recognize than words that appear less frequently. Recognition of these words is faster and more accurate than other words. The word frequency effect is one of the most robust and most commonly reported effects in contemporary literature on word recognition. It has played a role in the development of many theories, such as the bouma shape. Furthermore, the neighborhood frequency effect states that word recognition is slower and less accurate when the target has an orthographic neighbor that is higher in frequency than itself. Orthographic neighbors are words of all the same length that differ by only one letter of that word.\n\nSerif fonts, i.e.: fonts with small appendages at the end of strokes, hinder lexical access. Word recognition is quicker with sans-serif fonts by an average of 8 ms. These fonts have significantly more inter-letter spacing, and studies have shown that responses to words with increased inter-letter spacing were faster, regardless of word frequency and length. This demonstrates an inverse relationship between fixation duration and small increases in inter-letter spacing, most likely due to a reduction in lateral inhibition in the neural network. When letters are farther apart, it is more likely that individuals will focus their fixations at the beginning of words, whereas default letter spacing on word processing software encourages fixation at the center of words.\n\nBoth PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to study the activation of various parts of the brain while participants perform reading-based tasks. However, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide a more accurate temporal measurement by recording event-related potentials each millisecond. Though identifying where the electrical responses occur can be easier with an MEG, an EEG is a more pervasive form of research in word recognition. Event-related potentials help measure both the strength and the latency of brain activity in certain areas during readings. Furthermore, by combining the usefulness of event-related potentials with eye movement monitoring, researchers are able to correlate fixations during readings with word recognition in the brain in real-time. Since saccades and fixations are indicative of word recognition, electrooculography (EOG) is used to measure eye movements and the amount of time required for lexical access to target words. This has been demonstrated by studies in which longer, less common words induce longer fixations, and smaller, less important words may not be fixated on at all while reading a sentence.\n\nAccording to the LINCS website, the role of word recognition results in differences between the habits of adults and the habits of children learning how to read. For non-literate adults learning to read, many rely more on word recognition than on phonics and word analysis. Poor readers with prior knowledge concerning the target words can recognize words and make fewer errors than poor readers with no prior knowledge. Instead of blending sounds of individual letters, adult learners are more likely to recognize words automatically. However, this can lead to errors when a similarly spelled, yet different word, is mistaken for one the reader is familiar with. Errors such as these are considered to be due to the learner's experiences and exposure. Younger and newer learners tend to focus more on the implications from the text and rely less on background knowledge or experience. Poor readers with prior knowledge utilize the semantic aspects of the word, whereas proficient readers rely on only graphic information for word recognition. However, practice and improved proficiency tend to lead to a more efficient use of combining reading ability and background knowledge for effective word recognition.\n\nThe role of the frequency effect has been greatly incorporated into the learning process. While the word analysis approach is extremely beneficial, many words defy regular grammatical structures and are more easily incorporated into the lexical memory by automatic word recognition. To facilitate this, many educational experts highlight the importance of repetition in word exposure. This utilizes the frequency effect by increasing the reader's familiarity with the target word, and thereby improving both future speed and accuracy in reading. This repetition can be in the form of flash cards, word-tracing, reading aloud, picturing the word, and other forms of practice that improve the association of the visual text with word recall.\n\nImprovements in technology have greatly contributed to advances in the understanding and research in word recognition. New word recognition capabilities have made computer-based learning programs more effective and reliable. Improved technology has enabled eye-tracking, which monitors individuals' saccadic eye movements while they read. This has furthered understanding of how certain patterns of eye movement increases word recognition and processing. Furthermore, changes can be simultaneously made to text just outside the reader's area of focus without the reader being made aware. This has provided more information on where the eye focuses when an individual is reading and where the boundaries of attention lie.\n\nWith this additional information, researchers have proposed new models of word recognition that can be programmed into computers. As a result, computers can now mimic how a human would perceive and react to language and novel words. This technology has advanced to the point where models of literacy learning can be digitally demonstrated. For example, a computer can now mimic a child's learning progress and induce general language rules when exposed to a list of words with only a limited number of explanations. Nevertheless, as no universal model has yet been agreed upon, the generalizability of word recognition models and its simulations may be limited.\n\nDespite this lack of consensus regarding parameters in simulation designs, any progress in the area of word recognition is helpful to future research regarding which learning styles may be most successful in classrooms. Correlations also exist between reading ability, spoken language development, and learning disabilities. Therefore, advances in any one of these areas may assist understanding in inter-related subjects. Ultimately, the development of word recognition may facilitate the breakthrough between \"learning to read\" and \"reading to learn\".\n\n"}
