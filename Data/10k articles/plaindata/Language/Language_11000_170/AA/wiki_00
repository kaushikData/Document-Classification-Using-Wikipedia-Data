The Cruising Club of America (CCA) put together a technical committee that analyzed race boat data. They came up with this formula to compare boats based on readily available data. The CCA characterizes the formula as \"rough\". \n\nA lower value is supposed to indicate a sailboat is less likely to capsize. A value of 2 is taken as a cutoff for acceptable to certain race committees. However this is an arbitrary cutoff based on the performance of boats in the 1979 Fastnet race. The CSF does not consider the hull shape or ballast location.\n\nAny two sailboats will have the same CSF value if their displacement and beam are the same. As an example, one could have a light hull with 50% ballast in a bulb at the bottom of an eight foot fin keel, the other could have a heavy hull with 20% ballast in a full-length keel. The stability characteristics of the two sailboats will be drastically different despite the identical CSF value.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17297366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17297366", "title": "Common area", "text": "Common area\n\nA common area is, in real estate or real property law, the \"area which is available for use by more than one person...\" The common areas are those that are available for common use by all tenants, (or) groups of tenants and their invitees. In Texas and other parts of the United States, it is \"An area inside a housing development that is owned by all residents or by an overall management structure which charges each tenant for maintenance and upkeep.\"\n\nCommon areas often exist in apartments, gated communities, condominiums, cooperatives and shopping malls.\n\nIn any situation where there is a tenancy in common, all the tenants in common collectively own the common areas, meaning that any one individual owner does not possess more control over the land than any other owner.\n\nThis differs from a commons or common land, as used in English law, which is owned by one person, but which may be used by a group of persons.\n\nExamples of common areas include:\n\nIn \"Maryland v. Garrison\", the US Supreme Court found that police may enter a common area when executing a search warrant. Also, in \"Illinois v. Rodriguez\" the US Supreme Court held that \"a warrantless entry is valid when based upon the consent of a third party whom the police, at the time of the entry, reasonably believe to possess common authority over the premises, but who in fact does not do so.\" Furthermore, the court held:\nIn residence halls of colleges and universities, the common areas are those spaces in a dorm that are for the use of all the student residents. In order to paint murals, improve with fixtures, or otherwise change the common area, permission may have to be obtained from the director of residential life. Legally, there is nothing that a tenant can do if they do not approve of their common area furnishings, decorations, etc. unless it interferes directly with a disability. Anything pertaining to religion or beliefs are all covered under the Fair Housing Law. The only way to control common areas in this regard is if a serious threat was posed. State-run universities do have the authority to prohibit use of common areas should they see fit (whether that be decorating, furnishings, or physical use). For-profit housing can only limit these things to some extent. They cannot legally control every aspect of common area use because of the aforementioned Fair Housing Laws.\n\nCommon area also applies to organizations such as shopping malls and strip malls, in which multiple businesses operate. Oftentimes, business parks, malls, and other multi-company facilities will have a common area. This could be any one of the examples listed above or it could take form of a “break room”. These areas are generally centrally located and for everyone’s use within the businesses involved. There can be stipulations on conduct within the common areas as well as availability of the common areas. Businesses may also have common areas within themselves. Typically the businesses with common areas will have their own rules that cater to their business type, policy, and company vision.\n\nStates vary in how they tax common areas, for real estate tax purposes. It may depend on whether it is a condo or a co-op. For example, the state of Arizona taxes \"residential common areas\" in housing developments with a flat tax, but common areas of condominiums and golf courses are assessed separately.\n\nDependent upon the common area type (i.e. Business, Residential, State-owned) there are certain precautions one must take with utilizing them. Some require leases, some require contracts, and some only require only “at your word”. \nFor example, businesses may share common areas in a store like Black Lion or a store that accepts vendors from multiple backgrounds. It is understood in a lease or contract that they will share space with these different vendors. \nWith apartments, there are two different types of common areas you can have. One would be under contract and the other would be under lease. Apartments that rent by the unit (i.e. conventional housing) are signed for by one individual. That one individual legally decides the use of the common area should they ever gain a roommate in the future. If an apartment complex leases by the bedroom, there is a clause or paragraph detailing how the space is to be used equally between all lease holders. \nLastly, there are state-owned and mandated common areas. Forts and bases, government run facilities, and even jails have common areas. There is no agreement in a lease stating how those areas should be used. \nThere are different kinds of common areas and all of them have different rules and stipulations. The all have different legal proceedings should something happen in those areas.\n\nIn commercial real estate in the US, a building's loss factor is the percentage of the building's area shared by tenants or space that are dedicated to the common areas of a building used to calculate the difference between the net (usable) and gross (billable) areas.\n\nThat portion of the space is considered \"lost\" because it cannot be directly leased and the maintenance and operation costs must be covered by the other rentable areas.\n\nThe \"loss factor\" is often confused with load factor, but the formulas for each term vary.\n\nThe loss factor is calculated as follows:\n\nLoss Factor = (Rentable Area – Usable Area) / Rentable Area\n\nThe Building Owners and Managers Association has established a standard with American National Standards Institute, ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-2010 for measuring floor area and calculating gross leasable area and loss factor.\n\n"}
{"id": "1850719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850719", "title": "Controlled vocabulary", "text": "Controlled vocabulary\n\nControlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri, taxonomies and other forms of knowledge organization systems. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction.\n\nIn library and information science controlled vocabulary is a carefully selected list of words and phrases, which are used to tag units of information (document or work) so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search. Controlled vocabularies solve the problems of homographs, synonyms and polysemes by a bijection between concepts and authorized terms. In short, controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and ensure consistency.\n\nFor example, in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (a subject heading system that uses a controlled vocabulary), authorized terms—subject headings in this case—have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same word (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (\"cockroach\" versus \"Periplaneta americana\"), and choices between synonyms (\"automobile\" versus \"car\"), among other difficult issues.\n\nChoices of authorized terms are based on the principles of \"user warrant\" (what terms users are likely to use), \"literary warrant\" (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), and \"structural warrant\" (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).\n\nControlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of homographs, with qualifiers. For example, the term \"pool\" has to be qualified to refer to either \"swimming pool\" or the game \"pool\" to ensure that each authorized term or heading refers to only one concept.\n\nThere are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.\n\nHistorically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialized covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more pre-coordination of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorized subject heading. (e.g., children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorized and non-authorized terms, while historically most subject headings did not.\n\nFor example, the Library of Congress Subject Heading itself did not have much syndetic structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term \"Broader term\" and \"Narrow term\".\n\nThe terms are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the Library of Congress system, MeSH, and Sears. Well known thesauri include the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the ERIC Thesaurus.\n\nChoosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the specificity of the term chosen, whether to use direct entry, inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue.\n\nControlled vocabulary elements (terms/phrases) employed as tags, to aid in the content identification process of documents, or other information system entities (e.g. DBMS, Web Services) qualifies as metadata.\n\nThere are three main types of indexing languages.\n\n\nWhen indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example, using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document.\n\nIn recent years free text search as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is \"indexed\"). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.\n\nControlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of free text searching, such as to reduce irrelevant items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items (false positives) are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Take the English word \"football\" for example. \"Football\" is the name given to a number of different team sports. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is association football, which also happens to be called \"soccer\" in several countries. The word \"football\" is also applied to rugby football (rugby union and rugby league), American football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, and Canadian football. A search for \"football\" therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by tagging the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated.\n\nCompared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually relevant to the search topic).\n\nIn some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorized term is searched, there is no need to search for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.\n\nHowever, a controlled vocabulary search may also lead to unsatisfactory recall, in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question.\n\nThis is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with that of the indexer.\n\nAnother possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example, an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with \"football\" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, free text searches have high exhaustivity (every word is searched) so although it has much lower precision, it has potential for high recall as long as the searcher overcome the problem of synonyms by entering every combination.\n\nControlled vocabularies may become outdated rapidly in fast developing fields of knowledge, unless the authorized terms are updated regularly. Even in an ideal scenario, a controlled vocabulary is often less specific than the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might misinterpret the author, while this precise problem is not a factor in a free text, as it uses the author's own words.\n\nThe use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry. Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.\n\nNumerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including faceted classification, which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.\n\nControlled vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, are an essential component of bibliography, the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in library and information science. In the 1950s, government agencies began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on dialup X.25 networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first full text databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.\n\nIn large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve technical communication. The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing. This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in technical writing and knowledge management, where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a document or organization instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.\n\nWeb searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a Semantic Web, in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable metadata scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the Dublin Core Initiative. An example of a controlled vocabulary which is usable for indexing web pages is PSH.\n\nIt is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web. To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on faceted classification principles.\n\nControlled vocabularies of the Semantic Web define the concepts and relationships (terms) used to describe a field of interest or area of concern. For instance, to declare a person in a machine-readable format, a vocabulary is needed that has the formal definition of \"Person\", such as the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary, which has a Person class that defines typical properties of a person including, but not limited to, name, honorific prefix, affiliation, email address, and homepage, or the Person vocabulary of Schema.org. Similarly, a book can be described using the Book vocabulary of Schema.org and general publication terms from the Dublin Core vocabulary, an event with the Event vocabulary of Schema.org, and so on.\n\nTo use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary, web designers can choose from a variety of annotation formats, including RDFa, HTML5 Microdata, or JSON-LD in the markup, or RDF serializations (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX) in external files.\n\n"}

He was raised in Geneva, New York, and became \"David Christopher Aldwinckle\" when his stepfather adopted him in the 1970s. He graduated from Cornell University in 1987, dedicating his senior year to studying Japanese after visiting his pen pal and future wife in Japan. Aldwinckle moved to Japan for one year where he taught English in Sapporo, Hokkaido, and later spent one year at the Japan Management Academy in Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, before returning to complete a Masters of Pacific International Affairs (MPIA) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).\n\nIn 1993, Arudou joined the faculty of Business Administration and Information Science at the Hokkaido Information University, a private university in Ebetsu, Hokkaido, where he taught courses in business English and debate. He was an associate professor until 2011 when he left the university. From 2012 to 2013, Arudou was an Affiliate Scholar at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Meiji Gakuin University awarded him a Doctorate in Philosophy (International Studies) in 2014.\n\nAldwinckle married a Japanese citizen in 1987 and they have two daughters. Aldwinckle became a long-term resident of Japan in 1996. He became a naturalized Japanese citizen in 2000, retaining dual nationality via a loophole before relinquishing his US citizenship in 2002. On becoming Japanese, he changed his name to , taking his wife's surname. They divorced in 2006.\n\nArudou objected to the policies of three bathhouses in Hokkaido, Japan, in the late 1990s that had posted \"No Foreigners\" or \"Japanese Only\" signs on their doors. Arudou led a multinational group of 17 people of various nationalities (United States, Chinese, German, and Japanese) to enter the Yunohana bathhouse in Otaru and test the firmness of the \"No Foreigners\" policy posted on its door. The group attempted the walk-ins twice. Arudou returned to Yunohana in October 2000 for a third time as a naturalized Japanese citizen, but again was refused entry. The manager accepted that Arudou was a Japanese national, but refused him entry on the grounds that his foreign appearance could drive Japanese customers to take their business elsewhere.\n\nArudou and two co-plaintiffs, Kenneth Lee Sutherland and Olaf Karthaus, in February 2001 sued Earth Cure in district court pleading racial discrimination, and the City of Otaru for violation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a treaty which Japan ratified in 1996. On November 11, 2002, the Sapporo District Court ordered Earth Cure to pay the plaintiffs ¥1 million each (about US$25,000 in total) in damages. The court stated that \"categorically refusing all foreigners constitutes irrational discrimination, exceeds social norms, and amounts to an illegal act.\" The Sapporo District and High Courts both dismissed Arudou's claim against the city of Otaru for not creating an anti-discrimination ordinance. It stated that \"issues such as which measures to take, and how to implement them, are properly left to the discretion of Otaru.\" The Sapporo High Court upheld these rulings on September 16, 2004, and the Supreme Court of Japan denied review on April 7, 2005.\n\nIn 2003, Arudou and several other long-term foreign residents dressed up as seals to protest the granting of an honorary jūminhyō (residency registration) to Tama-chan, a male bearded seal, in Nishi Ward, Yokohama. The protesters asserted that if the government could grant jūminhyō to animals and animation characters, as was the case in Niiza and Kasukabe Cities, Saitama Prefecture, then there was no need to deny foreign residents the same. At the time, non-Japanese residents were registered in a separate alien registration system.\n\nIn February 2007, Arudou participated in a protest against an over-the-counter Japanese-language publication titled \"Kyōgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File – Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007\" \"(Secret Files of Foreigners' Crimes)\". The magazine highlighted alleged crimes committed by foreigners. Arudou, calling the magazine \"ignorant propaganda\" that \"focuses exclusively on the bad things that some foreigners do, but has absolutely nothing about crimes committed by Japanese\". Arudou posted a bilingual letter for readers to take to FamilyMart stores protesting discrimination against non-Japanese residents of Japan.\n\nIn June 2008, Arudou lodged a complaint with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police that its officers were targeting foreigners as part of a security sweep prior to the 34th G8 summit in Tōyako, Hokkaido. This followed an incident where Arudou asserted his right under the Police Execution of Duties Law to not need to show identification when requested by a police officer at New Chitose Airport. After meeting with police representatives at their headquarters, Arudou held a press conference covered by a local television station.\n\nIn August 2009, Arudou—acting as the chair of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing campaign to protest an advertisement by McDonald’s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in \"The Japan Times\", Arudou argued that the \"Mr. James\" campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald’s Japan withdraw the advertisement: \"Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a bathrobe and platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich?'\" \"Time\" magazine's Coco Masters concluded: \"To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring the fact that there really aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan.\"\n\nJapanologist Alex Kerr has criticized Arudou for his \"openly combative attitude\", an approach that Kerr thinks usually \"fails\" in Japan and may reinforce the conservative belief \"that gaijin are difficult to deal with\". Eric Weiner described Arudou as an \"outspoken man that rejects the notion that there's one Japanese way of doing anything\"; and himself as a \"loudmouth with an Internet connection\". Doug Struck described Arudou as emerging \"as the Outraged Man, tilting at uncomfortable truths about Japanese racial discrimination\". Paul Murphy described Arudou as \"the quintessential indefatigable civil rights campaigner\".\n\nArudou had a book published about the 1999 Otaru hot springs incident, originally in Japanese, and then in 2004 in an expanded English version, . The book is listed in the Japan Policy Research Institute's recommended library on Japan.\n\nArudou's next book, published in 2008, was coauthored with and titled . This bilingual book provides information on visas, starting businesses, securing jobs, resolving legal problems, and planning for the future from entry into Japan to death. \"Handbook\" came out in 2012 in an updated 2nd Edition and an ebook version in 2013.\n\nArudou has written a monthly column for the Community section of \"The Japan Times\" titled \"Just Be Cause\" since 2008, and has contributed occasional opinion columns to the newspaper since 2002. He was also a columnist for the \"Japan Today\" website and has been featured in \"The Asahi Evening News\".\n\nIn 2011, Arudou self-published his first novella titled \"In Appropriate: a novel of culture, kidnapping, and revenge in modern Japan\". The novella tells the story of a transnational marriage, culture shock, and child abduction. In 2015 he published \"Embedded Racism: Japan's Visible Minorities and Racial Discrimination\" through the Lexington Books imprint of Rowman & Littlefield.\n\nArudou has published twice in \"Fodor's Japan\" Travel Guide, in 2012 (Hokkaido Chapter) and 2014 (Hokkaido and Tohoku Chapters).

The set of Dyck words forms Dyck language.\n\nDyck words and language are named after the mathematician Walther von Dyck. They have applications in the parsing of expressions that must have a correctly nested sequence of brackets, such as arithmetic or algebraic expressions. \n\nLet formula_1 be the alphabet consisting of the symbols [ and ]. Let formula_2 denote its Kleene closure.\nThe Dyck language is defined as:\n\nIt may be helpful to define the Dyck language via a context-free grammar in some situations.\nThe Dyck language is generated by the context-free grammar with a single non-terminal , and the production:\n\nThat is, \"S\" is either the empty string () or is \"[\", an element of the Dyck language, the matching \"]\", and an element of the Dyck language.\n\nAn alternative context-free grammar for the Dyck language is given by the production:\n\nThat is, \"S\" is zero or more occurrences of the combination of \"[\", an element of the Dyck language, and a matching \"]\", where multiple elements of the Dyck language on the right side of the production are free to differ from each other.\n\nIn yet other contexts it may instead be helpful to define the Dyck language by splitting formula_2 into equivalence classes, as follows.\nFor any element formula_5 of length formula_6, we define partial functions formula_7 and formula_8 by\n\nwith the understanding that formula_9 is undefined for formula_18 and formula_13 is undefined if formula_20. We define an equivalence relation formula_21 on formula_2 as follows: for elements formula_23 we have formula_24 if and only if there exists a sequence of zero or more applications of the formula_25 and formula_26 functions starting with formula_27 and ending with formula_28. That the sequence of zero operations is allowed accounts for the reflexivity of formula_21. Symmetry follows from the observation that any finite sequence of applications of formula_25 to a string can be undone with a finite sequence of applications of formula_26. Transitivity is clear from the definition.\n\nThe equivalence relation partitions the language formula_2 into equivalence classes. If we take formula_33 to denote the empty string, then the language corresponding to the equivalence class formula_34 is called the Dyck language.\n\n\nWe can define an equivalence relation formula_49 on the Dyck language formula_50. For formula_51 we have formula_52 if and only if formula_53, i.e. formula_10 and formula_44 have the same length. This relation partitions the Dyck language formula_56 where formula_57. Note that formula_58 is empty for odd formula_59. E.g. there are 14 words in formula_60, i.e. [[]], [][], [[]], [[][[]]], [[[]]][], [[][][]], [][[[]]], [[][]][], [[]][[]], [][[][]], [[]][][], [][[]][], [][][[]], [][][][].\n\nHaving introduced the Dyck words of length formula_59, we can introduce a relationship on them. For every formula_62 we define a relation formula_63 on formula_58; for formula_65 we have formula_66 if and only if formula_44 can be reached from formula_10 by a series of proper swaps. A proper swap in a word formula_69 swaps an occurrence of '][' with '[]'.\nFor each formula_70 the relation formula_63 makes formula_58 into a [[partially ordered set]]. The relation formula_63 is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] because an empty sequence of proper swaps takes formula_10 to formula_10. [[transitive relation|Transitivity]] follows because we can extend a sequence of proper swaps that takes formula_10 to formula_44 by concatenating it with a sequence of proper swaps that takes formula_44 to formula_79 forming a sequence that takes formula_10 into formula_79. To see that formula_63 is also [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] we introduce an auxiliary function formula_83 defined as a sum over all prefixes formula_44 of formula_10:\n\nThe following table illustrates that formula_87 is [[Monotonic function|strictly monotonic]] with respect to proper swaps.\n\nHence formula_88 so formula_89 when there is a proper swap that takes formula_10 into formula_91. Now if we assume that both formula_92 and formula_93, then there are non-empty sequences of proper swaps such formula_10 is taken into formula_44 and vice versa. But then formula_96 which is nonsensical. Therefore, whenever both formula_97 and formula_98 are in formula_63, we have formula_100, hence formula_63 is antisymmetric.\n\nThe partial ordered set formula_102 is shown in the illustration accompanying the introduction if we interpret a [ as going up and ] as going down.\n\nThere exist variants of the Dyck language with multiple delimiters, e.g., on the alphabet \"(\", \")\", \"[\", and \"]\". The words of such a language are the ones which are well-parenthesized for all delimiters, i.e., one can read the word from left to right, push every opening delimiter on the stack, and whenever we reach a closing delimiter then we must be able to pop the matching opening delimiter from the top of the stack.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Formal languages]]"}

(Today - 2016 - Mitau, usually known as Jelgava, is in Latvia.) His father, (1733-1816) was a physician: his mother, born Henriette Marie Wirth (1744–1807), was the daughter of another physician.\n\nHe attended school in Mitau before moving on, in 1790, to start his university level education, under the sponsorship of Johann Friedrich von Recke, at Mitau's Academia Petrina where he studied theology. In Autumn 1791 he moved on to Jena where, having enrolled to pursue his study of theology, in 1792, he switched to Medicine. One of his fellow medical students at Jena, who became a friend, was David Veit. There were also early literary efforts at this stage which involved the poet Sophie Mereau. From Jena he moved on to Würzburg and Göttingen where he found time to start work on a novel entitled \"Die Wanderungen und Schicksale des Paters Abilgärd\" (\"The wanderings and destinies of Father Abilgärd\"). In 1797 he returned to Jena where he concluded his studies with a dissertation for which he received his doctorate in medicine. In 1800 he worked, briefly, in Vienna as a physician. In 1802 he introduced vaccinations against Chickenpox in Brno. At the end of 1803, still from Vienna, he renewed his literary relationship with Sophie Mereau. Working with Joseph Schreyvogel, during this period he co-edited a weekly newspaper in Vienna called \"Das Sonntagsblatt\" (\"The Sunday News sheet\"). He remained in Vienna till the end of 1809.\n\nIn 1809 Lindner abandoned his medical work, which he found insufficiently fulfilling and moved again, traveling via Munich, Regensburg, Nuremberg and Bayreuth. He ended up relocating to Weimar, close to Jena where he had studied as a student, and where he now took a writing job with the polymath publisher Friedrich Justin Bertuch. It was also in 1810 that he visited his uncle, the physician-theologian Gottlob Immanuel Lindner (1734–1818), who had been born (like Lindner's father) in Königsberg, but at this stage lived and worked in Strasbourg. Here he fell seriously ill, which caused him to stay with his uncle for longer than originally planned: he was nursed by a widow whose husband had been a French government official. It was still 1810 when he married Elise, who had been born at Huningue (on the southern tip of Elsaß, close to Basel) in 1789, as Elise Reiffinger. The marriage was childless but not joyless: sources indicate that during their later years Elise Lindner became an unusually influential spouse.\n\nIn 1813, by now living in Jena, with a fresh outbreak of fighting, Lindner was officially entrusted with the billeting of francophone troops, partly because he had mastered the French language. As calm returned to the streets he was rewarded for his hitherto unacknowledged teaching work, when he was given a post as a university professor of philosophy. Although little is known of his attitude to the respective belligerents in the 25 year \"world war\" that provided the backdrop for much of his life, it does appear that the successive reverses suffered by the French as their armies were rolled back after October 1813 left him unmoved. However, in 1814 he surrendered his professorship at Jena and returned initially to Weimar and then, with Elise, moved back to his father's home in Courland. He stayed and ran his father's affairs till the latter's death in May 1816.\n\nIn April 1817 Lindner returned to Weimar where he took on the editorship of a newspaper called the \"Oppositionsblatt\" (\"Opposition Newspaper\"). However, the backwash from a \"press scandal\" caused him to leave Weimar later the same year. This resulted from an \"indiscretion\" involving a secret report written by a man called August von Kotzebue.\n\nVon Kotzebue was employed by the Russian Tsar's \"Foreign Ministry\" and provided the Tsar with reports covering developments in politics, literature, economics, finance, education and what was going on more generally at the local university (in Jena). Although he came to be detested by liberals as a \"Russian spy\" it might be argued that von Kotzebue's reports contained nothing that was not in the public domain, and were no more than any foreign office employee working for any foreign power might have been expected to provide in a period of heightened political nervousness. Von Kotzebue and the Tsar were not in sympathy with liberal developments in political thought. In his report von Kotzebue criticised a newspaper called . Lindner happened to live in the same house as a copying clerk employed by von Kotzebue's: a copy of the report fell into Lindner's hands and Lindner sent it, accompanied by an anonymous letter, to the editor of \"Nemesis\", whose name was Heinrich Luden, in order that von Kotzebue's secret report might be published in the publication of which it was critical. The efficiency of the censor saw to it that the edition of \"Nemesis\" containing the report was not widely seen, but another editor, got hold of the document and published it in another (low circulation) newspaper called \"Der Volksfreunde\" (\"The Friend of the People\") in January 1818. The Russian government put pressure on the authorities locally to ensure Lindner's expulsion. (Von Kotzebue became so detested that he, too, had to leave the area, moving to Mannheim where in 1819 he was assassinated by the theology student, Karl Ludwig Sand.)\n\nLindner now settled for a period in Mulhouse, not far from the town where his wife had been born, but he did not remain in Elsaß for long. He was able to use his contacts to embark on a new career focused on diplomatic work and journalism. He participated in the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in September 1818 as a representative of Baden and of neighbouring Württemberg. In December of the same year he took over the editorship of a publication owned by the wealthy industrialist-publisher Johann Friedrich Cotta, and relocated to Stuttgart. The publication in question appears to have been shortlived, but in July 1819 he took on another title in von Cotta's collection, the newly founded \"Tribüne, Würtemberg. Zeitung für Verfassung und Volkserziehung zur Freiheit\" (\"... newspaper for constitutional and popular education towards freedom\").\n\nAs a journalist Lindner showed himself to be a supporter of the new king, William I of Württemberg, even where this sometimes ran counter to the views of his newspaper's proprietor, Johann Friedrich Cotta. The most significant outcome of collaboration between Lindner and the king was a document that appeared in 1820 entitled \"Manuscript aus Süddeutschland\". The document advocated some form of alliance between the three or four larger states of southern Germany, together with other significant states in the central regions, in order to provide a more effective counterweight to the might of Prussia and Austria within in the German Confederation, a pan-German political structure which had emerged in 1815 to fill the vacuum left by the termination in 1806 of the Holy Roman Empire. The proposal was seen as a move to reinvent the Confederation of the Rhine which, starting in 1805, had operated under the sponsorship of France for almost a decade. Among many who held power within the German lands, such ideas were not to be welcomed : the document was actually published in London. The proposals in it were powerfully and sometimes violently attacked both within and outside Germany. The name of its author, G. Erichson, was assumed to be a pseudonym, but the real author's identity was not immediately known, and Lindner himself was accordingly spared the sanctions that would otherwise have fallen upon him. The initiative for the publication is indeed believed to have come from the king of Württemberg, but it subsequently became widely believed that the \"Manuscript\" had actually been written by Friedrich Ludwig Lindner.\n\nThe appearance in 1824 of a second incendiary publication entitled \"Geheime Papiere\" (\"Secret Papers\") proved more demaging since the work was quickly attributed to him despite initial expressions of uncertainty. Around this time he also became involved in a dispute with a young ambitious delegate to the Federal Convention (Bundestag) called Friedrich von Blittersdorf. The upshot of all this was that he was obliged to leave Stuttgart, relocating to Augsburg in 1825.\n\nIn May 1827 he moved on to Munich, where he re-established contact with Cotta and took on the editorship of the \"Politische Annalen\", a position that from 1828 he shared with the poet Heinrich Heine. The journal proved relatively short-lived, but a friendship with Heine endured. Following the demise of the \"Politische Annalen\" Lindner reverted to his earlier profession, becoming a physician again.\n\nHe returned to Stuttgart in 1833, where he was now provided by the king with a pension. Relatively little is known of his final years, but he produced several translations as well as a satirical play attacking Hegel, who during his final years had become, in the eyes of some, Prussia's unofficial national philosopher.\n"}

Graphite lined stamps were used in the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1960 as an experiment in the automation of mail sorting.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, graphite lines were used exclusively on five stamps of the Wilding series from December 1957. They appear as one or two black lines printed vertically under the gum. The two lined stamps were to identify \"fully paid\" mail, which eventually became \"first class\" mail, while stamps with only one line paid the \"printed matter\" rate, or \"second class\" mail as it eventually became. On the two lined stamps, the bands are usually found widely spaced so that one appears at either side of the stamp, but they may also be found close together due to printing errors on the one and a half pence stamp. Several other errors of misplaced graphite lines are also known and not all are included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogue.\n\nThe use of graphite lines was developed by British Post Office scientists in conjunction with the stamp printers Harrison & Sons of High Wycombe and the stamps were first used in an experimental machine at Southampton. The machine used scanners to detect the graphite lines and to \"face\" the letters so that the stamp was always in the top right corner. The machine could also sort the letters according to the number of graphite lines on the stamps so that fully paid and printed matter stamps were separated. The machine then cancelled the letters. This was the first time that this had been done automatically.\n\nFrom November 1959, graphite lined stamps were issued with phosphor bands printed on the front of the stamp.

The substance is still a product of the firm today.\n\nGraphite lined stamps have become very collectable and often command high prices.

The name of the method, Hyperkino, is based on the intertwining of the concepts of textual criticism and hypertext.\n\nHyperkino was developed by Natascha Drubek and Nikolai Izvolov between 2005 and 2008:\nWe have connected the traditional principles of annotation with digital technologies and their markup languages, applying hypermedia principles of commentary to the linear medium of film. HYPERKINO annotations of a film are comparable to the footnotes and the commentary in historical-critical editions of texts, with the only difference being that they are various media forms (text, sound, pictures). […] The tradition of scholarly editions provides sophisticated ways of preserving texts over centuries, keeping them alive in constantly evolving receptions and commentaries. The idea of indexing a text, turning it into a network of interrelations and linking it with other texts, goes back to the tradition of editing scholarship.\nDigital humanities scholar Christian Gosvig Olesen stresses the importance of the analytical and theoretical phase preceding practical steps towards developing and designing the Hyperkino method: “In 2006 Drubek and Izvolov penned an article together that formulated this vision, Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats, which was published in the eighth edition of the international film studies review Cinema & Cie. in the fall of 2006.”\n\nHe characterizes Hyperkino as a philological reaction to audio commentaries which were the early and most popular forms of extras on DVDs: The article departed from a critique of current presentations in academic and contextualizing analyses of films on DVD to conceptualize a new way of DVD editorship relying on annotations and a more extensive and effective use of the hyperlinked structure of the DVD format. One of the points of critique was that existing DVD editions much too often overburdened the works in question […] Drubek and Izvolov instead advocated for a use of annotations which could appear in conjunction with the film but also exist independently of it. As the basis of this proposition they proposed a distinction between the film in itself as textus, which should be able to stand alone and be viewed independently of an analytical interpretive layer, and on the other hand an apparatus including all that which is not part of the filmic text itself: notes on the film’s historical context, script, stills or for example correspondences or business documents related to the film’s production.Hyperkino commentaries were made possible by the DVD format, introduced in 1996. In the ten years of its existence this format had produced several noteworthy audio commentaries by either filmmakers or scholars. However, it hardly had contributed to creating a standard of critical editions of films on digital carriers. In the academic environment of film studies the digital representation of film seemed to usher in a welcome convergence of film and writing on film. Digital technologies offered an option to explore the old medium of film from a new angle. The idea of a scholarly digital edition of a film surfaced several years after the first “Deluxe” editions of films with “deleted scenes” and other DVD extras were published. Scholarly interest in the DVD was driven by the requirement to have a stable “textus” which could be the basis of citations. In addition, film analysis asked for tools to annotate shots or even single frames in a film without destroying the cinematic text itself by intrusive modifications such as inserting talking heads or acousmatic voices of commentators.\nFrom this perspective Hyperkino was an exercise in understatement compared to other DVD extras. Its principle was a hidden annotation linked to the film frame marked by a minimal sign, usually a number. Clicking the number leads the viewer onto an off-screen commentary text section. “These sections we call 'footnotes' for the film. The main difference to current DVD commentaries is the presentation of scholarly research: It happens not in an audio but in a written format which makes the commentary quotable. Every HYPERKINO DVD edition is tantamount to an introductory article about the film published. The film and texts about the film merge on the digital carrier.”\n\nAs a commercially available DVD format Hyperkino materialized itself three years after the programmatic article by Drubek and Izvolov. In 2008 Drubek produced a Hyperkino DVD in Berlin and Prague, publishing Nikolai Izvolov’s reconstruction of Lev Kuleshov’s until then unpublished first film: \"Proekt inzhenera Praita\".\n\nGosvig Olesen writes: “First in the fold of the German DVD publisher Absolutmedien and later as the series KinoAcademia published by RUSCICO. The film to launch the format was Lev Kuleshov’s debut feature Proekt inzhenera Prayta (Engineer Prite’s Project), USSR, 1918). Not only was it the first time the film was made available digitally, it had also, as pointed out by film historian Kristin Thompson, for a long time only existed in a version without intertitles, which left the impression that the film was incomplete.”\n\nHyperkino editions emphasize the importance of incorporating different versions of the film. Two versions can be found on the German DVD of Engineer Prite’s Project allowing to compare the fragmented film as it lies in Gosfilmofond without intertitles with Izvolov’s 2001 reconstruction of the film which incorporated textual material from a surviving original libretto. The DVD contains the TV documentary The Kuleshov Effect (USSR, 1969) by Semyon Raitburt (ЭФФЕКТ КУЛЕШОВА, 1969, Семён Райтбурт). The Hyperkino “footnotes” quote from interviews with Kuleshov and Viktor Shklovsky.\n\nIn the following years around a dozen of Hyperkino DVDs were released by the Russian publisher RUSCICO under the series title “Kino Academia” containing the annotations of international film scholars specializing in Russian and Soviet film: Aleksandr Deriabin, Natascha Drubek, Bernard Eisenschitz, Jeremy Hicks, Nikolai Izvolov, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Milena Musina, Sergei Kapterev, Natalia Riabchikova, and Yuri Tsivian. Not all of the initially announced DVDs have been published yet, due to the high production costs. \n\nIn line with the aims described in Drubek’s and Izvolov’s 2005 article, every Hyperkino DVD edition consists of a textus and an apparatus. The apparatus in Hyperkino editions consists of alternative versions and “footnotes” connected to the film. Footnote numbers on all Hyperkino DVDs appear during playback in the upper right corner of the frame. In the RUSCICO editions the textus is on disc 1 (language versions) and the apparatus on disc 2 (film without language versions but with Hyperkino footnotes).\n\nIn 2010 at the Bologna festival Il Cinema Ritrovato three Hyperkino titles were awarded with the “DVD Awards 2010, VII edition. Best Special Features (Bonus) for their innovative handling of printed and illustrated commentaries”. The three DVDs were:\nIn the same year Hyperkino received another award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics and Scholars, the “Elephant 2010” (Kinovedenie i kinokritika v elektronnych SMI, novye technologii).\n\n“The idea of Hyperkino is a sensational breakthrough: imagine what a potential is looming here!”\n\nIn his article \"The Mosaic Approach. In defense of a nonlinear film criticism\" Jonathan Rosenbaum describes Hyperkino as \"a hybrid form—existing somewhere between reading and watching, like various computer-related activities—is part of what seems forward-looking about them […] What all these forms of criticism suggest is not merely a less linear way of approaching film experience but also a more interactive methodology. The fact that movies are being seen more and more often away from public theaters shouldn't necessarily mean that the way we all experience them and share our experiences is any less social. Perhaps it's more pertinent to note that the very forms of our social interactions in relation to films are changing as well.\"\n\nJulian Graffy discusses Hyperkino from the perspective of the “commentarist”: “Engaging with the Hyperkino commentaries leads to thoughts about the fundamental differences between a spoken commentary, the only version most viewers will so far have encountered, and the (predominantly written) Hyperkino approach.” Graffy mentions the time factor which challenged the performance of audio commentators: “bottlenecks, where too much is happening at once for you to cover all you want to say; and longueurs, where you wonder how to fill the space, or worry about extended periods of silence. […] None of these problems exists, of course, for the Hyperkino commentarist – he or she is not time-bound, and the notes can be as short or as long as required. They can also be more scholarly – the notes on Strike especially are full of references to sources both printed and archival – indicating to the scholar/student viewer where to do further research. And, above all, they have the advantage of hybridity, which is why the Hyperkino notes are more than just a book on screen.”\n\nIn 2011 film critic and media scholar Joachim Schätz called the Hyperkino publication of the Kuleshov debut a \"mediated revolution\" (“vermittelte Revolution”) and Hyperkino \"one of the most exciting forms of reflection on film one can experience today.\"\n\n\n"}

After doing philosophical studies in his home town, Osnabruck, Hanxleden volunteered for service in India. Together with the Jesuits Wilhelm Weber and Wilhelm Meyr, and a doctor, Franz Kaspar Schillinger (who left us an account of the perilous voyage), he set forth (30 October 1699) on a long arduous overland journey to India, travelling through Italy, Turkey, Syria, Armenia, and Persia, and set foot in India at Surat (in contemporary Gujarat) on 13 December 1700. During the journey Hanxleden was formally accepted as a member of the Society of Jesus. Weber and Meyr had died at sea, before reaching Surat. Left alone, Hanxleden proceeded to Goa where there was a large community of Jesuits.\n\nAfter completing his spiritual formation (Novitiate) in Goa, Hanxleden was sent to the Jesuit Seminary at Sampaloor in Thrissur District, Kerala, S. India. The remains of the seminary where he did his priestly studies in Sampallor and the church still kept as a historical monument at St. Francis Xavier's church sampaloor. The word Sampallor has got its origin from 'san-paul-ur', means land of St. Paul. It was the Jesuit priests who have given this name to this land which was formerly called as Ambalakad to commemorate St. Paul the Apostle of Jesus who travelled at length from middle East to the western Europe to preach the Gospel. It is also assumed that Jesuits had great reverence to Pope Paul III who approved the Plan of St. Ignatius of Lyola to form a congregation by name \"Society of Jesus\"in 1540 by the bull \"Formula of the Institute\".\n\nIt is in St. Paul's Seminary in Sampalloor, Hanxleden did his Theological studies;the immediate preparation to receive priesthood. He took time also to initiate himself to the local language, Malayalam and more importantly even to the liturgical language of the Thomas Christians of Kerala, the Syriac. He was ordained priest in 1706. In addition to his mother tongue German, and his mastery of Malayalam, Hanxleden also had a good command over Latin, Syriac, Portuguese, Sanskrit, and Tamil.\n\nHe moved to Palayoor and after surmounting several formidable barriers, learnt Sanskrit too and improved his Malayalam from two Namboothiri Brahmins, Kunjan and Sankaran from Angamaly, who were students in the Thrissur Sanskrit School. From 1707 to 1711 Hanxleden served as secretary to John Ribeiro who was Archbishop of Cranganore. During this time he travel led the length and breadth of Kerala on various tasks such as preaching and Catechesis. It is recorded that he served as the vicar of the main church in Malabar.\n\nHanxleden moved to Velur, Thrissur, a small village near Thrissur District in 1712 and built a church there. This would be his abode for most of his remaining life. Ernest wrote \"Puthen Pana\" based on the New Testament, sitting by the well of Pazhuvil Forane church. From 1729 onwards, he lived at Sampallor, and Palayoor. He died on 20 March 1732 at Pazhuvil of a snake-bite, and was buried there in the church. Later a memorial was built outside the church, and his mortal remains were removed to it. To maintain his memory a historical museum has also been started.\n\nThe \"Puththenpaana\", a Malayalam epic on the life of Christ, is his most celebrated poem. This is one of the earliest poems written in simple Malayalam. It has been an inalienable part of Christian (not restricted to Catholic) life in Kerala since the time of its composition; its \"paadham\"s are sung in a characteristic manner in Christian households on various solemn occasions, the most notable ones being Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and other days of Holy Week and Lent and evenings preceding funerals.\n\nThe poem consists of fourteen \"Paadhams\"; the couplets are written in the \"Sarppini\" \"Vruththam\", except for those in the twelfth \"Paadham\", which are in the \"Nathonnatha\" metre. The twelfth \"Paadham\" on the lament of the Virgin Mary at the crucifixion and death of Jesus is the heart of the poem. Other important \"Paadham\"s are concerned with the Fall of Man (second), the Annunciation (fourth), the Nativity (fifth), the Sermon on the Mount (seventh), the Last Supper (tenth), the trial and Crucifixion (eleventh), the Resurrection (thirteenth), and the Ascension (fourteenth). The first \"paadham\" has the poet telling us that he is writing the poem at the request of Antonio Pimental, Archbishop of Cranganore since Pimental held the ecclesiastical office from 1721 to 1752, the poem was composed some time during the period 1721–1732.\n\nThe \"Chathuranthyam\" is a mystic poem on the four ends of man: \"Maranam\", \"Vidhi\", \"Moksham\" and \"Narakam\" parts of the poem are sung on occasions similar to the \"Puththenpaana\" recitals. While his poems are written works, they also have a strong oral tradition; many pious Christians retain his poetical works in their minds and are able to recite it by heart.\n\nHanxleden was the first to compile a Malayalam Dictionary. His lexicon describes Malayalam words in both Sanskrit and Portuguese. He also wrote a short and succinct grammar for the Malayalam language. Hanxleden and his predecessor, Heinrich Roth, were the pioneering European Sanskrit scholars, he was the first European to write a Sanskrit grammar \"Grammatica grandonica\" and also the first European to compose Sanskrit verse. His Velur home, and the church he built are preserved as historical monuments. Among various exhibits at the museum are the bed used by Hanxleden and the \"chathurangam\" (which Hanxleden used to play) columns marked on the floor of his home. Mar Francis Vazhapilly, Metropolitan Archbishop of Thrissur from 1921 to 1942, used to stay at the Velur Forane Church for a few days during Lent so that he could sleep on the bed used by Arnos Paathiri and drink from the well dug during his times.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first truly international advertising award of its kind to acknowledge all media and methods from all over the world to be judged by a diverse global jury.\n\nThe Awards, founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy, began by celebrating advertising in the realms of cinema, television, print, and radio internationally, evolving since its inception into 22 unique media types: Ambient, Billboard, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health & Wellness, Health & Wellness - Craft, Integration, Medical, Medical - Craft, Music & Sound, Music Video, Non-Traditional, Package Design, Poster, Print, Production & Post-Production, Radio & Audio, Social Influencers, The NEW, Television/Cinema/Online Film and Verbal Identity. In 2004, the word \"Advertising\" was removed from the competition's name to reflect the fact that it observes more than just \"advertising\" in an ever-changing industry.\n\nIn 2009, LIA, along with creative Faris Yakob, developed \"The NEW,\" a medium that takes notice of new \"kinds\" of ideas rather than merely new ideas, for works that demonstrate concepts that don't fit comfortably among the standard media divisions, with a focus in fields of technology.\n\nIn 2014, LIA added Branded Entertainment as a medium. The judging category, first chaired by Jimmy Smith of Amusement Park Entertainment, awards \"creativity and the power of the idea across films, television programming, live events, audio, gaming and music videos that engage consumers by entertaining them, rather than through traditional advertising.\"\n\nFor 2016, LIA introduced a medium called Verbal Identity, centered on \"the long-term verbal assets\" of a brand, with sub-categories devoted to naming, taglines, copywriting and tone of voice.\n\nNew developments for 2017 include the addition of a Health & Pharma competition in response to a \"large number of requests from creatives\"; a Social Influencers medium \"based on Creativity and Engagement\", and a Chinese Creativity Show featuring a unique red statue and executed through a first round of judging in China and a final judging session simultaneous with the annual LIA Judging. (See: Judging)\n\nLIA has one main office in New York.\n\nLIA is one of the largest and most comprehensive awards programs in its field.\n\nAs of 2017, the thirteen LIA Jury panels, each one headed by a Jury President, are composed of nearly 100 experienced members of agencies, production companies, design houses, and technology companies. These panels decide on the Gold, Silver and Bronze Statue Winners, as well as the finalists, with each Jury given the non-compulsory opportunity to award a Grand LIA to a piece of work that has achieved a Gold statue. The judging process is unique in that each Juror sees every piece of work entered within the medium/media that he or she is required to judge. Judging is held annually in Las Vegas over a 7-to-10-day period in late September/early October.\n\nFor 26 years, LIA held its one-night awards ceremony in London. In 2012, it was decided to allocate the budget for the ceremony in favor of bringing a small group of young International Creatives from around the world together to share their experiences and to discuss the future of advertising, design, production, brand-building and the overall state of the creative global markets. (See: Creative LIAisons)\n\nIn 1985, LIA commissioned a British art student named Mary Griffiths to design the LIA statue. The 17\" LIA statue is a winged figure that is hand cast in metal prior to a gold, silver, bronze, or black plating (for Grand LIA winners). It stands on a custom black nickel finished base with an engraved plate displaying the year, medium, category, client/brand and the recipient's name and location.\n\nFor the first time in 2010, the same year as the Awards' 25th Anniversary, LIA awarded global Network of the Year, Agency of the Year, and Production Company of the Year designations. Subsequently, in 2011, LIA added Post-Production Company of the Year. Design Company of the Year, Independent Agency of the Year, Music & Sound Company of the Year and Radio & Audio Company of the Year have also been recognized in recent years.\n\nIn 2011, LIA gave a one-off award sponsored by JetBlue to filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's \"\", dubbed \"The Greatest Award Ever Sold\" for its analysis of product placement and the inner workings of the ad industry.\n\nIn 2017, LIA added Regional 'Of the Year' Awards to Australia / New Zealand, Asia, Europe, North America, the Middle East / Africa, and South America. as additional components of its global 'Of the Year' honors.\n\nEntries submitted for consideration are required to have been broadcast, published, or released commercially with client approval in order to become part of the competition, accompanied by the payment of a required fee based on the category.\n\nIn past years, LIA has published a hardbound, full-color Annual showcasing all of the winners and finalists from that given year.\n\nAs a way of giving back to the industry, LIA launched the 'Creative Conversations' program in 2012. Composed of educational discussions centered on the future of advertising, brand-building and production, the campaign is enforced through a series of seminars, lunches, and dinners that run concurrent with judging. The organization and expenses, including that of travel and hotel accommodations, are wholly funded by LIA. A large part of the experience's purpose is to bridge relationships between veteran speakers and junior \"Young Creatives\" from across the globe, the advertising industry's \"great teachers\" and \"young, energetic\" minds. The inaugural 2012 speakers included: Ted Royer, Susan Credle, Israel Diaz, Sonal Dabral, Tony Calcao, Jeremy Craigen, Faris Yakob, Neil French, Phil Growick, Dörte Spengler-Ahrens, Bob Garfield, Jonathon Ker, Ralph van Dijk, and Scott Elias.\n\nThe program was renamed \"Creative LIAisons\" for the 2015 awards, with just under 100 invited attendees. Daymond John returned as the Keynote Speaker, with other noteworthy speakers such as Amir Kassaei at DDB Worldwide, John Merrifield from Google, and Mark Tutssel of Leo Burnett Worldwide joining him.\n"}

In addition to the French base of the language, there are also a number of words from English and from the many African and South Asian languages that have been spoken on the island. \n\nMauritian Creole is the \"lingua franca\" and \"de facto\" language of Mauritius, formerly a British colony, which has kept both English and French as its core languages, even thought English is used mostly for Administration and educational purposes and French for media and for second speaking language. \n\nMauritians tend to speak Mauritian Creole at home and French in the workplace. French and English are spoken in schools. Though many Mauritians are of of Indian descent, they primarily speak Creole. It is their ancestral language in the sense that their ancestors, along with those of African, European and Chinese descent, helped create the creole language together centuries ago, when Mauritius was the meeting place of peoples from different continents who together founded a nation with its own culture and history. Today, around 1.3 million people speak the language.\n\nMauritian Creole is a French-based creole language, closely related to Seychellois Creole, Rodriguan Creole and Chagossian Creole. Mauritian's relationship to other French-based creole languages is controversial. Robert Chaudenson (2001) and Henri Wittmann (1972, 1987, etc.) have argued that Mauritian Creole is closely related to Réunion Creole, but Philip Baker and Chris Corne (1982) have argued that Réunion influence on Mauritian was minimal and that the two languages are barely more similar to each other than they are to other French-based creoles.\n\nAlthough the Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Mauritius, they did not settle there. Rather, the small Portuguese element in the vocabulary of Mauritian derives from the Portuguese element in European maritime jargon (such as the Mediterranean Lingua Franca) or from enslaved Africans or Asians who came from areas in which Portuguese was used as a trade language. Similarly, while the Dutch had a colony on Mauritius between 1638 and 1710, all the Dutch settlers evacuated the island to Réunion, leaving behind only a few runaway slaves who would have no discernible impact on Mauritian. The French then claimed Mauritius and first settled it between 1715 and 1721.\n\nAs they had done on Réunion and in the West Indies, the French created on Mauritius a plantation economy, based on slave labour. Slaves became a majority of the population of Mauritius by 1730 and were 85% of the population by 1777. They came from West Africa, East Africa and Madagascar.\n\nGiven the resulting linguistic fragmentation, French became the lingua franca among the slaves. However, the small size of the native French population on the island, their aloofness from most of their slaves, and the lack of formal education for slaves ensured that the slaves' French developed in very different directions from the slave owners' French.\n\nHistorical documents from as early as 1773 note the \"creole language\" that the slaves spoke.\n\nThe British took over Mauritius during the Napoleonic era, but few English-speakers ever settled there and Mauritian Creole had already been firmly entrenched.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in the 1830s made many leave the plantations, and Indian indentured workers replaced them after they had been brought in by plantation owners. Though the Indians soon became the majority on the island, which they remain, their own linguistic fragmentation as well as their alienation from the English- and French-speaking plantation owners led them to take up Mauritian Creole as their main lingua franca.\n\nEnglish and French have long enjoyed greater social status and dominated government, business, education, and the media, but Mauritian Creole's popularity in most informal domains has persisted.\n\nThe phonology of Mauritian Creole is very similar to that of Standard French. However, French and have respectively depalatalised to and in Mauritian, and the front vowels and have respectively been unrounded to and .\n\nThe language has several published dictionaries, both monolingual and bilingual, written by authors such as Philip Baker (1987), the group \"Ledikasyon pu travayer,\" and Arnaud Carpooran (2005, 2009, 2011), among others. The number of publications is increasing steadily; however, the orthographies used in them are significantly different.\n\nThe Mauritian government began supporting an orthographic reform in 2011, with a system that generally follows French but eliminates silent letters and reduces the number of different ways in which the same sound can be written. It was codified in the \"Lortograf Kreol Morisien\" (2011) and used in the \"Gramer Kreol Morisien\" (2012) as well. It has become standard upon its adoption by the second edition of the \"Diksioner Morisien\", which previously had been spelt as the \"Diksyoner Morisyen\".\n\nExamples shown are in Mauritian Creole and French only.\n\nExamples shown are in English, Mauritian Creole and French.\n\nMost words come from French but are not always used in the same way. For example, the French article \"le, la, les\" is often fused with the noun in Mauritian: French \"rat\" is Mauritian \"lera\" and French \"temps\" is Mauritian \"letan\". The same is true for some adjectives and prepositions: French \"femme\" (\"woman\") and \"riz\" (\"rice\") are \"bonnfam\" (from \"bonne femme\") and \"diri\" (from \"du riz\") in Mauritian. Some words have changed their meanings altogether: Mauritian \"gagn\" (\"to get\" or \"to obtain\") is derived from french \"gagner\" (\"to win\" or \"to earn\").\n\nOther words come from either Portuguese or Spanish such as \"lakaz\" from Spanish \"(la) casa\".\n\nThere are also several loanwords from the languages of the African Malagasy slaves, who contributed such words as Mauritian \"lapang\" from Malagasy \"ampango\" (rice stuck to the bottom of a pot), Mauritian \"lafus\" from Malagasy \"hafotsa\" (a kind of tree), and Mauritian \"zahtak\" from Malagasy \"antaka\" (a kind of plant). In some cases, as with some of the nouns from French, the Mauritian word has fused with the French article \"le/la/les\".\n\nWords of East African origin include Mauritian \"makutu\" from Makua \"makhwatta\" (running sore), Mauritian \"matak\" from Swahili, and Makonde \"matako\" (buttock).\n\nRecent loanwords tend to come from English, such as \"map\" instead of \"plan\" or \"carte\" in French (plan or kart in Mauritian Creole). English words used in Mauritian Creole retain their English spelling but should normally written with inverted commas.\n\nNouns do not change in the according to grammatical number. Whether a noun is singular or plural can usually be determined only by context. However, the particle \"bann\" (from \"bande\") is often placed before a plural. French \"un/une\" corresponds to Mauritian \"enn\" but its use has slightly different rules. Mauritian has an article (\"la\"), but it is placed after the noun. Compare French \"un rat\", \"ce rat\", \"le rat\", \"les rats\", and Mauritian \"enn lera\", \"lera-la\" and \"bann lera\".\n\nIn Mauritian, there is only one form for each pronoun, regardless of case or gender; \"li\" can thus be translated as \"he, she, it, him, his, her, hers\" depending on the context.\n\nVerbs do not change their form according to tense or person. Instead, the accompanying noun or pronoun determines who is engaging in the action, and several preverbal particles are used alone or in combination to indicate the tense: \"ti\" (from French \"étais\") marks past tense, \"pe\", short for the now-rare \"ape\" (from \"après,\" as Québec French still uses to mark the progressive aspect, \"(f)inn\" (from French \"fini\") marks the completive or perfect, and \"pou\" or sometimes \"va\" or \"av\" (from French \"va\") marks the future tense.\n\nFor example, \"li finn gagn\" (\"he/she/it had\") can also be shortened to \"linn gagn\" and pronounced as one word. The Réunion version is \"li té fine gagne\" for past, \"li té i gagne\" for past progressive, and \"li sava gagne\" for present progressive or near future.\n\nHere is the Lord's Prayer in Mauritian Creole, French and English:\n\n\n"}

Nakhi is also the ethnic group that speaks it, although in detail, officially defined ethnicity and linguistic reality do not coincide neatly: there are speakers of Naxi who are not registered as \"Naxi\", and citizens who are officially \"Naxi\" but do not speak it.\n\nIt is commonly proposed in Chinese scholarship that the Naic languages are Lolo-Burmese languages: for instance, Ziwo Lama (2012) classifies Naxi as part of a \"Naxish\" branch of Loloish.\n\nHowever, as early as 1975, Sino-Tibetan linguist David Bradley pointed out that Naxi does not partake in the shared innovations that define Loloish. Thurgood and La Polla (2003) state that \"The position of Naxi ... is still unclear despite much speculation\", and leave it unclassified within Sino-Tibetan. Guillaume Jacques & Alexis Michaud (2011) classify Naxi within the Naish lower-level subgroup of Sino-Tibetan; in turn, Naish is part of Naic, itself part of a proposed \"Na-Qiangic\" branch.\n\nNaxi in the broad sense (including Na/Mosuo) was initially split by the linguists He Jiren and Jiang Zhuyi into two major clusters, Western Naxi and Eastern Naxi.\n\nWestern Naxi (纳西语西部方言) is fairly homogeneous. It is spoken mainly in Lijiang, Zhongdian (Shangri-La), Weixi, and Yongsheng counties. Smaller populations of Western Naxi speakers are found in Heqing, Jianchuan, Lanping, Deqin, Gongshan, Ninglang (in Bapijiang village 坝皮匠村, Yongning Township 永宁乡) Muli (in Eya 俄亚), Yanbian (Daoju 道咀), and Tibet (in Mangkang 芒康). There over 240,000 speakers total. Western Naxi consists of the Dayan, Lijiangba, and Baoshanzhou dialects (\"Naxiyu Jianzhi\" p. 752).\n\nEastern Naxi (纳西语东部方言) consists of several mutually unintelligible varieties. It is spoken mainly in Yanyuan, Muli, and Yanbian counties. Eastern Naxi is also spoken by smaller populations in Yongsheng (in Zhangzidan 獐子旦), Weixi (in Qizong 其宗), and Lijiang (in Hailong 海龙 and Fengke 奉科) counties. There is a total of over 40,000 speakers (\"Naxiyu Jianzhi\" p. 754).\n\nAccording to the 2000 Chinese census, 310,000 people speak Nakhi, and 100,000 of those are monolingual. Approximately 170,000 speak Chinese, Tibetan, Bai, or English as a second language. Almost all speakers live in Yunnan, but some are in Tibet, and it is possible that some live in Burma.\n\nThe language is commonly spoken among Nakhi people in everyday life and the language is in little danger of dying out soon, although the written literacy is still a rare skill. The language can be written in the Geba syllabary, Latin script or Fraser alphabet, but they are rarely used in everyday life and few people are able to read Naxi. The 1932 Naxi Gospel of Mark was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in the Fraser alphabet.\n\nThe three most common dialects are Lijiang, Lapao, and Lutien. Lijiang, which is spoken in the western parts of the language's range, is the most uniform of the three and it is heavily influenced by Standard Chinese and Yunnanese dialects, proved by its huge volume of loan words from Chinese. The eastern dialects, which are much more native and have many dialectal differences.\n\nThe alphabet used here is the 1957 pinyin alphabet.\n\nIn the Lijiang dialect, there are nine vowels as well as syllabic : , written \"i, ei, ai, a, iu, ee, e, o, u\". There is also a final , written \"er\".\n\nThere are four tones: high level, mid-level, low level (or falling), and, in a few words, high rising. They are written \"-l, -, -q, -f.\"\n\n\n\n"}

If one or more of the propositions is false, the whole sentence is false. This is illustrated in Figure 2:\n\nPropositional representations are also:\n\n\nEach proposition consists of a set of predicates and arguments which are represented in the form of predicate calculus. For instance:\n\nAn event; (X) John hit Chris with a unicycle, the unicycle broke, because of this John started to cry, which caused Chris to be happy.\n\n\"A propositional representation\"\n\n\nEach set of predicates (words like hit, broke, cry, happy are first order-predicates; Cause is a second-order predicate) and arguments (often consisting of an agent/subject (e.g. John in ‘P’), a recipient/object (e.g. Chris in ‘P’) and an instrument (e.g. the unicycle in ‘P’)) are in turn manipulated as propositions: event/statement “John hit Chris with the unicycle” is represented as proposition ‘P’.\n\nAlso, features of particular objects may be characterized through attribute lists. ‘John’ as a singular object may have the attributes ‘plays guitar’, ‘juggles’, ‘eats a lot’, ‘rides a unicycle’ etc. Thus reference to ‘John’ identifies him as the object of thought in virtue of his having certain of these attributes. So in predicate calculus, if “John (F) has the property of being ‘rides a unicycle’ (x)” we may say salva veritate: (x)(Fx). These elements have been called semantic primitives or semantic markers/features. Each primitive may in turn form part of a propositional statement, which in turn could be represented by an abstract figure e.g. ‘P’. The primitives themselves play a crucial role in categorizing and classifying objects and concepts.\n\nThe meaningful relations between ideas and concepts expressed between and within the propositions are in part dealt with through the general laws of inference. One of the most common of these is Modus Ponens Ponendum (MPP), which is a simple inference of relation between two objects, the latter supervening on the former (P-›Q). Thus if we have two propositions (P, Q) and we assume a law of inference that relates to them both (P-›Q), then if we have P we must necessarily have Q. Relations of causation and may be expressed in this fashion, i.e. one state (P) causing (-›) another (Q)\n\nSo a purely formal characterization of the event (X) written above in natural language would be something like:\n\n"}

{"id": "14597908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14597908", "title": "Somali grammar", "text": "Somali grammar\n\nSomali is an agglutinative language, using a large number of affixes and particles to determine and alter the meaning of words.\n\nAs in other related Afroasiatic languages, Somali nouns are inflected for gender, number and case.\n\nAffixes change according to a number of rules. The definite article is a suffix, with the basic form being \"-ki\" or \"-ka\" for masculine nouns and \"-ti\" or \"-ta\" for female nouns. The \"k\" or \"t\" is the actual article marker, although it can change depending on the preceding consonant, with the following vowel determined by the case of the noun. Articles do not change for singular or plural.\n\nThe basic form of a Somali noun is in absolutive case. In this case, the article maintains the vowel \"-a\".\n\nThe subject of a sentence takes nominative case. In this case, the article takes the vowel \"-u\". If the subject of the sentence includes multiple nouns, only the last takes the nominative ending for the article.\n\nIf there is no article, a tonal change signifies nominative case, although this is not represented in the orthography. Some feminine nouns take the suffix \"-i\" in nominative case without an article.\n\nGenitive case is generally indicated through a tonal change. Some feminine nouns take an ending, \"-eed, -aad\" or \"-od\", depending on the final consonant of the root word.\n\nVocative case is indicated either through a tonal change or with the suffixes \"-ow\" (m. sg.), \"-ohow\" (m. pl.), \"-eey/-aay/-ooy\" (f. sg.) or \"-yahay\" (f. pl.).\n\nGender is not marked in nouns without the definite article. The gender of nouns does not follow any particular rule and is not generally obvious.\n\nNouns form their plural in three ways, including reduplication. Many nouns exhibit gender polarity, whereby they change gender in the plural form, e.g. \"buug-ga\" (the book) is masculine in the singular, but \"buugag-ta\" (the books) is feminine.\n\nThere are both subject and object forms for each personal pronoun, with each form further divided into short and emphatic forms.\n\nSomali verbs consist of a stem to which suffixes are added. Verbs in indicative mood exist in four tenses, present, present continuous, past and past continuous, in addition to a subjunctive mood form for present and future tense. Verbs in Somali conjugate mainly through the addition of suffixes, although a very small number of common verbs use a conjugation using prefixes.\n\nThe infinitive is created through the suffix \"-i\" or \"-n\" depending on verb class, e.g. \"keeni\" (to bring) and \"siin\" (to give). The infinitive is used in present tense only with the modal verb \"karid\" (to be able). Verbal nouns are formed with the endings \"-id\", \"-n\" and \"-sho\", e.g. \"keenid\" (the bringing), \"siin\" (the giving) and \"barasho\" (the learning) and are used and declined as per normal nouns.\n\nAccording to Ahmad (2013), the Pareto principle is in effect with regard to Somali grammar. When applied to Standard Somali, the adjective and verb, which collectively represent around 20% of Somali grammatical categories, would thereby constitute about 80% of both spoken and written Somali. This is due to the fact that tenses have an effect on both grammatical categories.\n\nPresent tense refers to an action which may or may not be happening at present. It may be used to express something which happens habitually or repeatedly. The present tense conjugation of \"keen\" (to bring) follows:\nPast tense is used to describe a completed action in the past with a discrete duration. The conjugation of \"keen\" (to bring) is:\n\nnb: The final \"-ay\" can also be pronounced and written \"-ey\".\n\nThe present continuous tense is formed with the suffix \"-ay-\" / \"-na-\" (depending on dialect) and the endings from the present tense. The present continuous forms of \"keen\" are:\nPast continuous is formed with the suffix \"-na\" / \"-ay\" and the past tense endings: \"keen+ay+ey\" = \"keenayey\" = I was bringing. Is it used to describe actions in the past which happened over a period of time: \"Intuu akhrinayey wargeyska wuu quracanayey.\" = While he was reading the newspaper, he was eating breakfast.\n\nFuture tense is formed with the infinitive of the required verb and the present tense of \"doon\" (to want):\nThe subjunctive is used only in subordinate clauses and certain prepositional phrases. The present subjunctive differs from the indicative only in that the vowel in the endings changes from \"a\" to \"o\". Future subjunctive uses the infinitive plus the present subjunctive form of \"doon\".\n\nSomali has several strategies to indicate where the intention or the interest or the focus is located in the phrase: a topic-comment or focus construction. The words \"baa\", \"ayaa\", and \"waxaa\" put the focus on nouns and noun phrases.\n\nExample:\n\n\nThus, the words baa, ayaa, and waxaa unconsciously raise the question of who went out? Therefore the noun.\n\nSomali also has the word waa which puts the focus on verbs and verb phrases.\n\nExample:\n\nJohn waa baxay - John \"Focus\" (waa) went out\n\nWaa is different from other previous one we have just seen, because it \nraises the question of what did John do? Therefore the verb.\n\nSentences in Somali are typically of the order Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Nouns have different tonal markings for number, gender (masculine and feminine), and case or role in the sentence.\n\n\n"}

They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech–Slovak. Historically the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is wen.\n\nThere are two literary languages: Upper Sorbian (), spoken by about 40,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian () spoken by about 10,000 people in Brandenburg. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as Lusatia ( in Upper Sorbian, in Lower Sorbian, or in German).\n\nAfter the settlement of the formerly Germanic territories (the part largely corresponding to the former East Germany) by the Sorbs' Slavic ancestors in the 5th and 6th centuries, the Sorbian language (or its predecessors) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of East Germany for several centuries, and still had its stronghold in (Upper and Lower) Lusatia, where it enjoys national protection and fostering to the present day. Outside Lusatia, it has been superseded by German, following official discrimination from the 13th century on. The printed language developed around the main Bible translations into Sorbian.\n\nIn Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages. In the home areas of the Sorbs, both languages are recognized as second official language next to German.\nThe city of Bautzen in Upper Lusatia is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, \"Bautzen/\".\nThe city of Cottbus () is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian; here too bilingual signs are found.\nSorbian has also been spoken in the small Sorbian (\"Wendish\") settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas, and it is possible that a few speakers still remain there. Until recently newspapers were published in Sorbian there. The local dialect has been heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.\n\nThe German terms \"Wends\" (\"Wenden\") and \"Wendish\" (\"wendisch/Wendisch\") once denoted \"Slav(ic)\" generally; they are today mostly replaced by \"Sorbs\" (\"Sorben\") and \"Sorbian\" (\"sorbisch/Sorbisch\") with reference to Sorbian communities in Germany.\n\nBoth Upper and Lower Sorbian have the dual for nouns, pronouns, adjectives and verbs; very few living Indo-European languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar. For example, the word is used for one hand, for two hands, and for more than two hands. As with most of the Slavic languages, Sorbian uses no articles.\n\nThe Sorbian languages are declined in six to seven cases:\n\nThe following is selected vocabulary from the two Sorbian languages compared with other Slavic languages.\n\n"}
{"id": "878752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=878752", "title": "Spanish language in the Philippines", "text": "Spanish language in the Philippines\n\nSpanish was the official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish rule in the late 16th century, through the conclusion of the Spanish–American War in 1898. It remained, along with English, as co-official language until 1987. It was at first removed in 1973 by a constitutional change, but after a few months it was re-designated an official language by presidential decree and remained official until 1987, with the present Constitution re-designating it instead as an \"optional and voluntary language\".\n\nPhilippine Spanish () is a variant of standard Spanish, spoken in the Philippines by a minority today, though it was quite widespread up to the early 20th century. The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because the Philippines was ruled from New Spain in present-day Mexico, for over three centuries. During that period, there was much Spanish and Mexican emigration to the Spanish East Indies.\n\nIt was the language of the Philippine Revolution and the country's first official language, as proclaimed in the Malolos Constitution of the First Philippine Republic in 1899. It was the language of commerce, law, politics and the arts during the colonial period and well into the 20th century. It was the main language of many classical writers and Ilustrados such as Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Antonio Luna and Marcelo del Pilar, to name but a few. It is regulated by the Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española, the main Spanish-language regulating body in the Philippines, and a member of the Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española, the entity which regulates the Spanish language worldwide.\n\nSpanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries of Spanish rule and continued to serve as a lingua franca until the first half of the 20th century. Spanish was the official language of the Malolos Republic, \"for the time being\", according to the Malolos Constitution of 1899. Spanish was also the official language of the Cantonal Republic of Negros of 1898 and the Republic of Zamboanga of 1899.\n\nDuring the early part of the U.S. administration of the Philippine Islands, Spanish was widely spoken and relatively well maintained throughout the American colonial period. Even so, Spanish was a language that bound leading men in the Philippines like Trinidad Hermenegildo Pardo de Tavera y Gorricho to President Sergio Osmeña and his successor, President Manuel Roxas. As a senator, Manuel L. Quezon (later President), delivered a speech in the 1920s entitled \"Message to My People\" in English and in Spanish.\n\nSpanish remained an official language of government until a new constitution ratified on January 17, 1973 designated English and Pilipino, spelled in that draft of the constitution with a \"P\" instead of the more modern \"F\", as official languages. Shortly thereafter, Presidential Proclamation No. 155 dated March 15, 1973 ordered that the Spanish language should continue to be recognized as an official language so long as government documents in that language remained untranslated. A later constitution ratified in 1987 designated Filipino and English as official languages. Also, under this Constitution, Spanish, together with Arabic, was designated an optional and voluntary language.\n\nThere are thousands of Spanish loanwords in 170 native Philippine languages, and Spanish orthography has influenced the spelling system used for writing most of these languages.\n\nAccording to the 1990 Philippine census, there were 2,660 native Spanish speakers in the Philippines.\nIn 2013 there were also 3,325 Spanish residents. However, there are 439,000 Spanish speakers with native knowledge, which accounts for just 0.5% of the population (92,337,852 at the 2010 census). In 1998, there were 1.8 million Spanish speakers including those who spoke Spanish as a secondary language.\n\nSpanish was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador, Miguel López de Legazpi, founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of Cebú. The Philippines, ruled first from Mexico City and later from Madrid, was a Spanish territory for 333 years (1565–1898). Schooling was a priority, however. The Augustinians opened a school immediately upon arriving in Cebú in 1565; the Franciscans followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the Dominicans when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.\n\nInitially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its missionaries was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish. The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as translators, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos. Before the 19th century, the natives generally were not taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator Gaspar Aquino de Belén. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in the Tagalog language. Pasyon is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Belén, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the corrido, provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the regional languages for the illiterate majority.\n\nIn the early 17th century, a Tagalog-Chinese printer, Tomás Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn Castilian. His book, published by the Dominican press where he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas's \"Arte\". Unlike the missionary's grammar (which Pinpin had set in type), the Tagalog native's book dealt with the language of the dominant rather than the subordinate other. Pinpin's book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, Tagalog conversion in the early colonial period.\nBy law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the Christian catechism. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. This discouraged the attendance at school and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a barrio or group of barrios had to have a priest's residence, a town hall, boys' and girls' schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.\n\nBetter school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops—several of whom served the churches in Hispanic America. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the Ilustrados. In 1846, French traveler Jean Baptiste Mallat was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were. In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (\"Normal School\", later Philippine Normal University), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press. \"El Boletín de Cebú\", the first Spanish newspaper in Cebu City, was published in 1886.\n\nIn Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread, to the point where it has been estimated at around 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century. In his 1898 book \"Yesterdays in the Philippines\", covering a period beginning in 1893, the American Joseph Earle Stevens, an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:\nLong contact between Spanish and the local languages, Chinese dialects, and later Japanese produced a series of pidgins, known as Bamboo Spanish, and the Spanish-based creole Chavacano. At one point these were the language of a substantial proportion of the Philippine population. Unsurprisingly, given that the Philippines was administrated for centuries from New Spain in present-day Mexico, Philippine Spanish is broadly similar to American Spanish, not only in vocabulary, but in pronunciation and grammar.\n\nAlthough the Philippines were not as culturally hispanized as Hispanic America, the Spanish language was the official language used by the civil and judicial administration, and was spoken by the majority of the population and understood by just everyone, especially after the passing of the Education Decree of 1863. By the end of the 19th century, Spanish was a strong second language among the upper classes of Philippine society, having been learned in childhood either directly from parents and grandparents or through tutoring by a local priest. By the time Spanish rule came to an end, Spanish was spoken as a second language by more than 60% of the population.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the oldest educational institutions in the country were set up by Spanish religious orders. These schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in Intramuros was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines. During the same year, the University of San Carlos in Cebú, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the University of Santo Tomás, considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the Dominicans. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of these schools, as well as of the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán, established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women known as Beaterios was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught Religion, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic with Music and Embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in the language as well. In 1859, Ateneo de Manila University was established by the Jesuits as the Escuela Municipal.\n\nIn 1863, Queen Isabel II of Spain decreed the establishment of a public school system, following the requests of the Spanish authorities in the islands, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of the Spanish language was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits. In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261. The total public schools was 841 for boys and 833 for girls and the total number of children attending these schools was 135,098 boys and 95,260 girls. In 1892, the number of schools had increased to 2,137, 1,087 of which were for boys and 1,050 for girls. This measure was at the vanguard of contemporary Asian countries, and led to an important class of educated natives which sometimes followed their studies abroad, like national hero José Rizal, who studied in Europe. This class of writers, poets and intellectuals is often referred to as Ilustrados. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century, that Spanish literature and press flourished. This was the result both of a majority of Spanish-speaking population, as well as the partial freedom of the press which the American rulers allowed.\n\nBefore the 19th century, Philippine revolts were small-scale and did not extend beyond linguistic boundaries. Thus, they were easily neutralized by Spanish forces. With the small period of the spread of Spanish through a free public school system (1863) and the rise of an educated class, nationalists from different parts of the archipelago were able to communicate in a common language. José Rizal's novels, Graciano López Jaena's satirical articles, Marcelo H. del Pilar's anti-clerical manifestos, the bi-weekly \"La Solidaridad\" which was published in Spain, and other materials in awakening nationalism were written in Spanish. The Philippine Revolution fought for reforms and later for independence from Spain. However, it did not oppose Spain's cultural legacy in the islands or the Spanish language. Even Graciano López Jaena's La Solidaridad article in 1889 praised the young women of Malolos who petitioned to Governor-General Valeriano Weyler to open a night school to teach the Spanish language. In fact, the Malolos Congress of 1899 chose Spanish as the official language. According to Horacio de la Costa, nationalism would not have been possible without Spanish. by then increasingly aware of nationalistic ideas and independence movements in other countries.\nSpanish was used by the first Filipino patriots like José Rizal, Andrés Bonifacio and, to a lesser extent, Emilio Aguinaldo. The 1896 Biak-na-Bato Constitution and the 1898 Malolos Constitution were both written in Spanish. Neither specified a national language, but both recognised the continuing use of Spanish in Philippine life and legislation. Aguinaldo was more comfortable speaking Tagalog. Spanish was used to write the Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Malolos Constitution, the original national anthem, \"Himno Nacional Filipino\", as well as nationalistic propaganda material and literature.\n\nThe country's first two constitutions and historic novels were written in Spanish. While widely understood by the majority of the population, Spanish at this time was the unifying language since Tagalog was not as prominent or ubiquitous as it is today and each region had their own culture and language, and would rather speak in their local languages. Before the spread of Filipino nationalism, the natives of each region still thought of themselves as Ilocano, Cebuano, Bicolano, Waray, Tagalog etc., and not as Filipinos.\n\nThe term \"Filipino\" originally referred to the natives of the Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called the natives \"Filipinos,\" in his book \"Relación de las Islas Filipinas\" (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call the natives \"Indios\".\n\nAlso during the colonial era, the Spaniards born in the Philippines, who were more known as insulares, criollos, or Creoles, were also called \"Filipinos.\" Spanish-born Spaniards or mainland Spaniards residing in the Philippines were referred to as Peninsulares. Peoples born in Spanish America or in the North American continent of New Spain who were residing in the Philippines were collectively referred to as Americanos. The Catholic Austronesian peoples of the Philippines were referred to as Indios and for those who were practicing the Islamic faith, Moros. The indigenous Aetas were referred to as Negritos. Chinese settlers were called Sangleyes. Japanese settlers were called Japoneses. Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as Mestizos or Tornatrás. In the 1800s, the term \"Filipino\" gradually became synonymous to anyone born in the Philippines regardless of ethnicity through the effort of the Insulares, from whom, Filipino nationalism began.\n\nIn 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking Ilustrados (The Enlightened Ones), which included the Insulares, the Indios, the Mestizos, the Tornatrás, etc., were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of Philippine Classical Literature which developed in the 19th century.\n\nJosé Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. One material highly instrumental in developing nationalism was the novels entitled \"Noli Me Tangere\" and \"El Filibusterismo\" which exposed the abuses of the colonial government and clergy composed of Peninsulares. The novels' very own notoriety propelled its popularity even more among Filipinos. Reading it was forbidden because it exposed and parodied the Peninsulares in the Philippine Islands.\n\nThe revolutionary Malolos Republic of 1899 designated the Spanish language for official use in its constitution, drawn up during the Constitutional Convention in Malolos, Bulacan. During this period, the nascent republic published a number of laws, acts, decrees, and other official issuances. These were published variously in the Spanish, English, and Tagalog languages, with the Spanish language predominating. Spanish was also designated the official language of the Cantonal Republic of Negros of 1898 and the Republic of Zamboanga of 1899.\n\nMany Spanish-speaking Filipino families perished during the Philippine–American War. According to the historian James B. Goodno, author of the \"Philippines: Land of Broken Promises\" (New York, 1998), one-sixth of the total population of Filipinos or about 1.5 million died as a direct result of the war.\n\nWith the era of the Philippines as a Spanish colony with its people as Spanish citizens having just ended, a considerable amount of media, newspapers, radios, and government proceedings were still written and produced in Spanish. By law, the Taft Commission allowed their guests to use the language of their choice. Ironically, the partial freedom of the press allowed by the American rulers served to further promote Spanish-language literacy among the masses. Even in the early 20th century, a hegemony of Spanish language was still in force.\n\nWhile the census of 1903 and of 1905 officially reported that the number of Spanish-speakers have never exceeded 10% of the total population during the final decade of the 19th century, it only considered Spanish speakers as their first and only language. It disregarded the Catholic Chinese Filipinos, many of whom spoke Spanish, and the creole-speaking communities. Furthermore, those who were academically instructed in the public school system also used Spanish as their second or third language. These together would have placed the numbers at more than 60% of the 9,000,000 Filipinos of that era as Spanish-speakers.\n\nIn the Eighth Annual Report by the Director of Education, David P. Barrows, dated August 1, 1908, the following observations were made about the use and extension of the Spanish language in the Philippines:\nA 1916 report by Henry Jones Ford to President Woodrow Wilson said\nAlthough the English language had begun to be heavily promoted and used as the medium of education and government proceedings, the majority of literature produced by indigenous Filipinos during this period was in Spanish. Among the great Filipino literary writers of the period were Fernando M. Guerrero, Rafael Palma, Cecilio Apóstol, Jesús Balmori, Manuel Bernabé, Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Teodoro M. Kalaw. This explosion of Spanish language in Philippine literature occurred because the middle and upper class Filipinos were educated in Spanish and Spanish language as a subject was offered in public schools. In 1936, Philippine sound films in Spanish began to be produced. Filipinos experienced a partial freedom of expression, since the American authorities weren't too receptive to Filipino writers and intellectuals during most of the colonial period. As a result, Spanish had become the most important language in the country.\n\nUntil the Second World War, Spanish was the language of Manila. After the war, the English-speaking U.S. having won three wars [in 1898, against Spain (Spanish–American War); in 1913 (from Philippine–American War to Moro Rebellion) against the Filipino independence; in 1945 against Japan (Philippines Campaign)], the English language was imposed.\n\nThe Spanish language flourished in the first two decades of the 20th century due to the partial freedom of the press and as an act of defiance against the new rulers. Spanish declined due to the imposition of English as the official language and medium of instruction in schools and universities. The American administration increasingly forced editorials and newspapers to switch to English, leaving Spanish in a marginal position, so that Enrique Zóbel de Ayala founded the Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española and the Premio Zóbel in 1924 to help maintain and develop the use of Spanish among the Filipino people.\n\nIt did not help when some Filipino nationalists and nationalist historiographers during the American Colonial Period who took their liberal ideas from the writings of the 19th century Filipino Propaganda which portrayed Spain and all things Spanish as negative or evil. Therefore, Spanish as a language was demonized as a sad reminder of the past. These ideas gradually inculcated into the minds of the young generation of Filipinos (during and after the American administration) who used those history textbooks at school that tended to generalize all Spaniards as villains due to lack of emphasis on Filipino people of Spanish ancestry who were also against the local Spanish government and clergy and also fought and died for the sake of freedom during the 19th century revolts, during the Philippine Revolution, during the Philippine–American War and during World War II.\n\nBy the 1940s as children educated in English became adults, the Spanish language was starting to decline rapidly. Still, a very significant community of Filipino Spanish-speakers lived in the bigger cities, with a total population of roughly 300,000. However, with the destruction of Manila during the Japanese occupation in World War II, the heart of the Spanish language in the Philippines was dismantled. Many Spanish-speaking Filipino families perished during the massacre and bombing of the cities and municipalities between 1942 and 1945. By the end of the war, an estimated 1 million Filipinos lost their lives. Some of those Spanish-speakers who survived were forced to migrate in the later years.\n\nAfter the war, Spanish became increasingly marginalized at an official level. As English and American-influenced pop culture increased, the use of Spanish in all aspects gradually declined. In 1962, when President Diosdado Macapagal decreed that the Philippines mark independence day on June 12 instead of July 4 which the country gained complete independence from the United States, it revealed a tendency to paint Spain as the villain and the United States as saviour, or the more benevolent colonial power. The Spanish language and Hispanic culture was demonized again. In 1973, Spanish briefly lost its status as an official language of the Philippines, was quickly redesignated as an official language, and finally did lose official status with the ratification of a subsequent constitution in 1987.\n\nThe 21st century has seen a revival of interest in the language, with the numbers of those studying it formally at college or taking private courses rising markedly in recent years. Today, the Philippine constitution provides that Spanish shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis. A great portion of the history of the Philippines is written in Spanish and, up until recently, many land titles, contracts, newspapers and literature were still written in Spanish. Today, Spanish is being somewhat revived in the Philippines by groups rallying to make it a compulsory subject in school.\n\nRepublic Act No. 9187 was approved on February 5, 2003 and signed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, declaring June 30 of every year as Philippine–Spanish Friendship Day to commemorate the cultural and historical ties, friendship and cooperation between the Philippines and Spain. On July 3, 2006, the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines created Resolution No. 2006-028 urging the national government to support and promote the teaching of the Spanish language in all public and private universities and colleges in the Philippines. On December 17, 2007, the Department of Education issued Memorandum No. 490, s. 2007 encouraging secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish in the 3rd and 4th year levels respectively, as an elective. , there was a growing demand for Spanish-speaking agents in the call center industry as well as in the business process outsourcing in the Philippines for the Spanish and American market. Around 7,000 students were enrolled in the Spanish language classes of the Instituto Cervantes de Manila for the school year 2007–2008. On December 11, 2008, the Department of Education issued Memorandum No. 560, s. 2008 that shall implement the Special Program in Foreign Language on a pilot basis starting school year 2009–2010. The program shall initially offer Spanish as a foreign language in one school per region, at two classes of 35 students each, per school. As of 2009, the Spanish government has offered to fund a project and even offered scholarship grants to Spain for public school teachers and students who would like to study Spanish or take up a master's degree in four top universities in Spain. The Spanish government has been funding the ongoing pilot teacher training program about the Spanish language, involving two months of face-to-face classes and a 10-month on-line component. \"Clásicos Hispanofilipinos\" is a project of Instituto Cervantes de Manila which aims to promote Filipino heritage and preserve and reintroduce the works of great Fil-Hispanic authors of the early 20th century to the new generation of Filipino Hispanophones. The Spanish novel of Jesús Balmori entitled \"Los Pájaros de Fuego\" (\"Birds of Fire\") which was mostly written during the Japanese occupation was published by the Instituto June 28, 2010. King Juan Carlos I commented in 2007 that, \"In fact, some of the beautiful pages of Spanish literature were written in the Philippines\".\n\nDuring her visit to the Philippines in July 2012, Sofia of Spain expressed her support for the Spanish language to be revived in Philippine schools.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, saying that there were 318 Spanish-trained basic education teachers in the Philippines, Philippine secretary of the Department of Education Armin Luistro announced an agreement with the Chilean government to train Filipino school teachers in Spanish. In exchange, the Philippines would help train Chilean teachers in English.\n\nSince the independence of the Philippines from Spain (1898), the dialect has lost most of its speakers and it might be now close to disappearing. Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the Spanish Empire and continued to serve as a lingua franca until the first half of the 20th century. In the last decades its use has declined. New developments in the Philippines are slowly reversing this trend.\n\nIn December 2007, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed a directive in Spain that require the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.\n\nThe presidential decision had immediate results. The Under-Secretary of the Department of Education, Vilma L. Labrador, circulated a Memorandum (17/XII/2007), on the \"Restoration of the Spanish language in Philippine Education\". In it, the Department mandates secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish.\n\nThere has been a resurgence of learning Spanish among Filipinos, for various reasons. Interest in the language and recuperation of it as part of their history, namely their written, cultural history, interest in their connection to the Spanish-speaking world, among others.\n\nDue to the huge demand for Spanish speakers among business process outsourcing companies in the Philippines, Filipinos are flocking to Instituto Cervantes and other language centers in order to learn Spanish.\n\n, of the younger generation of Filipino Hispanophones are following the Spanish orthographic convention of typing letters with diacritic marks (acute accents and diaeresis) as well as the inverted question and exclamation marks and the rest of the special characters and symbols found in Spanish orthography on their US standard layout computer keyboards by using the AltGr key, Modifier key, Code page 437, Code page 850, Microsoft Windows Alt Key Numeric Codes for character shortcuts, or the US-International keyboard layout.\n\nSpanish-language media was present in the 2000s with one Spanish newspaper, \"E-Dyario\", the first Spanish digital newspaper published in the Philippines, and \"Filipinas, Ahora Mismo\" was a nationally syndicated, 60-minute, cultural radio magazine program in the Philippines broadcast daily in Spanish for two years in the 2000s. Since the emergence of social media, Spanish speaking Filipinos have tended to use these more modern forms to continue publishing in Spanish language.\n\nThere are approximately 4,000 Spanish words in Tagalog (between 20% and 33% of Tagalog words), and around 6,000 Spanish words in Visayan and other Philippine languages. The Spanish counting system, calendar, time, etc. are still in use with slight modifications. Archaic Spanish words have been preserved in Tagalog and the other vernaculars, such as (\"coins\"), [) at the beginning of Spanish rule, the \"j\" used to be pronounced , the voiceless postalveolar fricative or the \"sh\" sound; (\"soap\")], [() with the \"j\" sound; (\"watch\")], (; \"money\"), etc. The Spaniards and the language are referred to as either \"Kastila\" or \"Katsila\" (mostly Visayan languages) after (\"Castile\"), the original Spanish Kingdom under which Spain was unified in 1492, which later became a Spanish region.\n\nChavacano (also called Zamboangueño), is a Spanish-based creole language spoken mainly in the southern province of Zamboanga and, to a much lesser extent, in the province of Cavite in the northern region of Luzon. Chavacano became the main language in the Zamboanga City and some parts of Zamboanga Peninsula, as a result of the migration into the area of a large number of workers, who came from different linguistic regions to build military and other Spanish establishments.\n\nWhile many Spanish words have entered Tagalog, Cebuano, Waray-Waray, and other Philippine languages, many of the words have seen a shift in meaning and even construction from the original Spanish. That has resulted in false friends, similar words in both languages but with a different meaning. A sample is shown below:\n\nThe following words do not fall under false friends. They are still a source of confusion:\n\nAlthough the greatest linguistic impact and loanwords have been from Spanish to the languages of the Philippines, the Philippine languages have also loaned some words to Spanish.\n\nThe following are some of the words of Philippine origin that can be found in the \"Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española\", the dictionary published by the Real Academia Española:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2374815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2374815", "title": "Speedloader", "text": "Speedloader\n\nA speedloader is a device used to reduce the time and/or effort needed to reload a firearm. Speedloaders come in variety of forms for reloading revolvers or with fixed (attached) or detachable magazines.\n\nGenerally, speedloaders are used for loading all chambers of a revolver simultaneously, although speedloaders (of different designs) are also used for the loading of fixed tubular magazines of shotguns and rifles, or (with other designs) the loading of box or drum magazines. Revolver speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing-out cylinders or top-break cylinders. Non-top-break cylinder revolvers having fixed cylinders must be unloaded and loaded one chamber at a time.\n\nThe modern revolver circular speedloader holds a full cylinder complement of cartridges in a secure fashion, spaced in a circular configuration so as to allow the cartridges to drop simultaneously into the cylinder easily (although non-circular types such as half-moon clips are very common as well). A mechanism is provided that allows the cartridges to be released from the speedloader when loaded, so that when it is removed, the cartridges remain in the cylinder. The most common type of speedloader uses a rotating latch. Another type slides the cartridges out an open side; and a third type has a latch that releases when pressed.\n\nRevolver speedloaders make the process of reloading an appropriately matched revolver much faster than reloading one round at a time (provided you have ready-loaded speedloaders available). Swing-out and top-break revolvers are designed to eject all cartridges with one movement, and speedloaders allow loading with but a single additional step. Speedloaders also provide a convenient way to carry ammunition for a revolver. Speedloaders do not, however, allow revolvers to be reloaded as fast as semiautomatic handguns without considerably more practice.\n\nPrior to the introduction of speedloaders for revolvers, reloading of revolvers was always accomplished by manually loading each cartridge into each chamber from cartridge loops on a belt or bandolier, a cartridge pouch, or other cartridge holder, such as a pocket. In fact, hand-loading is still the most common way of loading a revolver, speedloaders being mostly restricted to competition shooters and those who feel that they need more firepower for their personal defense revolver, since although speedloaders are useful for carrying one or several reloads at ready, one must load the speedloaders themselves prior to using.\n\nPrior to the introduction of modern metallic cartridges, circa 1861–1873, certain models of older black powder cap and ball revolvers could be used with multiple replaceable cylinders functioning as \"speedloaders\". It was however generally easier to simply buy a second revolver than to locate a cylinder alone, not to mention faster than swapping cylinders. As the reloading process for a cap and ball revolver was lengthy and time-consuming, carrying already-loaded cylinders with percussion caps placed on cylinder nipples was a considerable improvement in reloading time, although this is primarily a \"trick\" used by modern shooters who are used to having numerous shots available in short time with little work. When \"spare cylinders\" were carried, this practice was primarily done on Remington revolvers, as their cylinders were easily removable and were held by a cylinder pin, unlike the early Colt revolvers, which were held together by a wedge that went through the cylinder pin.\nMoon clips and half-moon clips are special speedloaders for use with revolvers that chamber rimless cartridges, such as 9×19mm Parabellum or .45 ACP. Double-action revolvers are designed to use rimmed cartridges, and the extractors are incapable of removing rimless cartridges. Because of this fact, a different method of extraction must be used. Moon clips are a full circle, and hold a full cylinder of cartridges, while half-moon clips are semicircles that hold half a cylinder full of cartridges.\nAnother variation of the speedloader for revolvers is the Speed Strip introduced by Bianchi International. Intended as an alternative to loose rounds in a pocket or dump pouch, it holds six cartridges in a re-usable Neoprene plastic strip. The strip operates by placing the cartridges one or two at a time into their respective chambers, and \"breaking\" the rounds off the strip into the chamber.\n\nLoading a firearm magazine, particularly one with a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds to the top of the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler, which are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as magazine loaders, stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. The simplest are inexpensive devices that depress the top round in the magazine, allowing the next round to be partially inserted with no pressure on it. These are also called \"thumb savers\", and address ease of loading more than speed of loading. There are also devices available for certain popular firearms, such as the Ruger 10/22, that accept loose ammunition and will load a round into the magazine with a simple push of a button or turn of a crank. These are more complex and expensive (US$25 to US$50), but are more truly a speedloader since they do greatly reduce the time required to load a magazine.\n\nA stripper clip is a device that holds a number of rounds, usually from 5 to 10 rounds, and allows them to be inserted into a magazine (fixed or detachable) by attaching the clip to a special bracket and pressing the rounds into place. Military ammunition is often packaged in stripper clips, which, in older bolt action rifles, could be loaded directly into the rifle's fixed magazine using a bracket machined into the rifle's action, or in modern rifles by the use of an adapter or guide that attaches the stripper clip to a detachable magazine.\n\nWhile much less common than revolver speedloaders, speedloaders for tubular magazines, called \"quickloaders\", have been around for many years and offer many of the same quick reloading ability benefits. The simplest quickloader of this type is the one used for rimfire rifles with front loading tubular magazines. In this case, the quickloader is simply a tube that contains a magazine-capacity number of cartridges, with a seal at one end and a gate at the other. To load the magazine, the follower is removed, the rifle is pointed upwards, the tube is placed over the end of the magazine, and the gate is opened. Gravity then pulls the cartridges from the quickloader into the magazine, the quickloader is set aside, and the follower is replaced. Any length of tubing or pipe of the right diameter can be used in this way, with a simple pin through the middle serving as a gate. Commercial rimfire quickloaders often have multiple tubes joined together in parallel, with a single rotating gate. This allows multiple reloads to be carried, with reloading accomplished by simply rotating the gate in line with the next full tube of ammunition.\n\nShotgun speedloaders are slightly more complex, since shotgun magazines load from the breech. Shotgun speedloaders generally require a special bracket be mounted near the magazine loading port of the gun; many models mount by replacing existing pins that hold the trigger group in the receiver, and so can be installed easily without permanent modification of the gun. This bracket serves to hold the end of the speedloader tube in the correct position to feed the rounds out of the speedloader and into the magazine. The speedloaders themselves consist of a plastic tube containing a slot cut in it, and a plunger that rides in the slot and that forces the rounds into the magazine. Capacity is usually four or five rounds of 2-inch (70 mm) length shells. Gravity is not suitable for operating these, as the rounds must be forced into the magazine against the pressure of the magazine spring. Shotgun speedloaders are most commonly encountered in action shooting sports like International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) shotgun competitions.\n"}

{"id": "167276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167276", "title": "Vineyard", "text": "Vineyard\n\nA vineyard () is a plantation of grape-bearing vines, grown mainly for winemaking, but also raisins, table grapes and non-alcoholic grape juice. The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture.\n\nA vineyard is often characterised by its terroir, a French term loosely translating as \"a sense of place\" that refers to the specific geographical and geological characteristics of grapevine plantations, which may be imparted in the wine.\n\nThe earliest evidence of wine production dates from between 6000 and 5000 BC. Wine making technology improved considerably with the ancient Greeks but it wasn't until the end of the Roman Empire that cultivation techniques as we know them were common throughout Europe.\n\nIn medieval Europe the Church was a staunch supporter of wine, which was necessary for the celebration of the Mass. During the lengthy instability of the Middle Ages, the monasteries maintained and developed viticultural practices, having the resources, security, stability and interest in improving the quality of their vines. They owned and tended the best vineyards in Europe and \"vinum theologium\" was considered superior to all others.\n\nEuropean vineyards were planted with a wide variety of the \"Vitis vinifera\" grape. However, in the late 19th century, the entire species was nearly destroyed by the plant louse \"phylloxera\" accidentally introduced to Europe from North America. Native American grapevines include varieties such as \"Vitis labrusca\", which is resistant to the bug. \"Vitis vinifera\" varieties were saved by being grafted onto the rootstock of Native American varieties, although there is still no remedy for \"phylloxera\", which remains a danger to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.\n\nThe quest for vineyard efficiency has produced a bewildering range of systems and techniques in recent years. Due to the often much more fertile New World growing conditions, attention has focussed heavily on managing the vine's more vigorous growth. Innovation in \"palissage\" (training of the vine, usually along a trellis, and often referred to as \"canopy management\") and pruning and thinning methods (which aim to optimize the Leaf Area/Fruit (LA/F) ratio relative to a vineyard's microclimate) have largely replaced more general, traditional concepts like \"yield per unit area\" in favor of \"maximizing yield of desired quality\". Many of these new techniques have since been adopted in place of traditional practice in the more progressive of the so-called \"Old World\" vineyards.\n\nOther recent practices include spraying water on vines to protect them from sub-zero temperatures (aspersion), new grafting techniques, soil slotting, and mechanical harvesting. Such techniques have made possible the development of wine industries in New World countries such as Canada. Today there is increasing interest in developing organic, ecologically sensitive and sustainable vineyards. Biodynamics has become increasingly popular in viticulture. The use of drip irrigation in recent years has expanded vineyards into areas which were previously unplantable.\n\nFor well over half a century, Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and California State University, Fresno, among others, have been conducting scientific experiments to improve viticulture and educating practitioners. The research includes developing improved grape varieties and investigating pest control. The International Grape Genome Program is a multi-national effort to discover a genetic means to improving quality, increasing yield and providing a \"natural\" resistance to pests.\n\nThe implementation of mechanical harvesting is often stimulated by changes in labor laws, labor shortages, and bureaucratic complications. It can be expensive to hire labor for short periods of time, which does not square well with the need to reduce production costs and harvest quickly, often at night. However, very small vineyards, incompatible widths between rows of grape vines and steep terrain hinder the employment of machine harvesting even more than the resistance of traditional views which reject such harvesting.\n\nNumbers of New World vineyard plantings have been increasing almost as fast as European vineyards are being uprooted. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of U.S. vineyards increased from , while Australian vineyard numbers more than doubled from and Chilean vineyards grew from . The size of individual vineyards in the New World is significant. Europe's 1.6 million vineyards are an average of each, while the average Australian vineyard is , providing considerable economies of scale. Exports to Europe from New World growers increased by 54% in the six years up to 2006.\n\nThere have also been significant changes in the kinds of grapes that are grown. For example, in Chile, large areas of low-quality grapes have been replaced with such grapes as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. In Argentina, due to an economic down-turn, acreage of Malbec was significantly reduced in the 1980s, but in the 1990s, during the quality revolution incited by Malbec Pioneer Nicolás Catena Zapata, growers started planting more Malbec, most notably in higher altitudes where cooler temperatures and more intense sunlight yields more concentrated yet smoother and more complex malbecs. Grape changes are often in response to changing consumer demand but sometimes result from vine pull schemes designed to promote vineyard change. Alternatively, the development of \"T\" budding now permits the grafting of a different grape variety onto existing rootstock in the vineyard, making it possible to switch varieties within a two-year period.\n\nLocal legislation often dictates which varieties are selected, how they are grown, whether vineyards can be irrigated and exactly when grapes can be harvested, all of which in serves to reinforce tradition. Changes in the law can also change which grapes are planted. For example, during Prohibition in the U.S. (1920–1933), vineyards in California expanded sevenfold to meet the increasing demand for home-brewing. However, they were largely planted in varieties with tough skins that could be transported across the country to home wine-makers and the resulting wine was of a low quality.\nAccording to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, in April 2015, China () overtook France () in terms of land devoted to vineyards, in second place behind Spain (), the world's largest producer.\n\nTerroir refers to the combination of natural factors associated with any particular vineyard. These factors include things such as soil, underlying rock, altitude, slope of hill or terrain, orientation toward the sun, and microclimate (typical rain, winds, humidity, temperature variations, etc.) No two vineyards have exactly the same terroir, although any difference in the resulting wine may be virtually undetectable.\n\nVineyards are often on located on hillsides and planted in soil that is of only marginal value to other plants. A common saying is that \"the worse the soil, the better the wine.\" Planting on hillsides, especially those facing north (in the southern hemisphere) or south (in the northern hemisphere), is most often in an attempt to maximize the amount of sunlight that falls on the vineyard. For this reason, some of the best wines come from vineyards planted on quite steep hills, conditions which would make most other agricultural products uneconomic. The stereotypical vineyard site for wine grapes (in the Northern hemisphere) is a hillside in a dry climate with a southern exposure, good drainage to reduce unnecessary water uptake, and balanced pruning to force the vine to put more of its energy into the fruit, rather than foliage.\n\nThe terroir philosophy is predominately French in origin, the flavour and character of the place defining the individuality and the special attributes of wines and combined with hundreds of years of the finest wine making traditions, terroir gives wines their distinctive taste and signature.\n\nA vignette is a 500-square-metre vineyard which is part of a larger consolidated vineyard. Investors purchase a piece of land within a vineyard, and outsource the grape maintenance and production operations to an outside grape grower or wine producers. Because they are contracting under a co-operative structure, they benefit from economies of scale and hence cheaper labour and operational costs.\n\n\n"}

The names were used by Allied personnel to identify aircraft operated by the Japanese for reporting and descriptive purposes. Generally, Western men's names were given to fighter aircraft, women's names to bombers, transports, and reconnaissance aircraft, bird names to gliders, and tree names to trainer aircraft.\n\nThe use of the names, from their origin in mid-1942, became widespread among Allied forces from early 1943 until the end of the war in 1945. Many subsequent Western histories of the war have continued to use the names.\n\nDuring the first year of the Pacific War beginning on 7 December 1941, Allied personnel often struggled to quickly, succinctly, and accurately identify Japanese aircraft encountered in combat. They found the Japanese designation system bewildering and awkward, as it allocated two names to each aircraft. One was the manufacturer's alphanumeric project code, and the other was the official military designation, which consisted of a description of the aircraft plus the year it entered service. For example, the military designation of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter was the \"Navy Type 96 Carrier Fighter\". Type 96 meant that the aircraft had entered service in Imperial year 2596, equivalent to Gregorian calendar year 1936. Other aircraft, however, which had entered service the same year carried the same type number; aircraft such as the Type 96 Carrier Bomber and the Type 96 Land Attack Bomber. Adding to the confusion, the US Army and US Navy each had their own different systems for identifying Japanese aircraft.\n\nIn mid-1942, Captain Frank T. McCoy, a United States Army Air Forces military intelligence officer from the 38th Bombardment Group assigned to the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit in Australia, set out to devise a simpler method for identifying Japanese aircraft. Together with Technical Sergeant Francis M. Williams and Corporal Joseph Grattan, McCoy divided the Japanese aircraft into two categories; fighters and everything else. He gave boys' names to the fighters, and the names of girls to the others. Later, training aircraft were named after trees, single engine reconnaissance aircraft were given men's names and multi-engine aircraft of the same type were given women's names. Transports were given girls' names that all began with the letter \"T\". Gliders were given the names of birds.\nMcCoy's system quickly caught on and spread to other US and Allied units throughout the Pacific theater. By the end of 1942, all American forces in the Pacific and east Asia had begun using McCoy's system, and British Commonwealth nations adopted the system shortly thereafter. The list eventually included 122 names and was used until the end of World War II. To this day, many Western historical accounts of the Pacific War still use McCoy's system to identify Japanese aircraft.\n\nIn an effort to make the names sound somewhat comical, McCoy gave many of the aircraft 'hillbilly' names, such as \"Zeke\" and \"Rufe,\" that he had encountered while growing up in Tennessee. Others were given names of people the creators of the system knew personally; the Mitsubishi G4M bomber, with its large gun blisters was named \"Betty\" in homage to a busty female friend of Williams. The Aichi D3A \"Val\" got its name from an Australian Army sergeant.\n\nNot all of McCoy's chosen names caught on. Many Allied personnel continued calling the Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter \"Zero\" instead of McCoy's name of \"Zeke.\" Also, McCoy's name for an upgraded version of the Zero, \"Hap,\" in tribute to US Army general Henry H. Arnold, had to be changed to \"Hamp\" when it was learned that Arnold disapproved.\n\n\n\n"}
