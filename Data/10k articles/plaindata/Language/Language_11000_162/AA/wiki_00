Sony introduced this protocol to control reel-to-reel type C video tape recorders (VTR) as well as videocassette recorders (VCR). It uses an DE-9 D-Sub connector with 9 pins (hence the name), where bi-directional communication takes place over a four wire cable according to the RS-422 standard. The communication parameters are 38,400 baud, 8 data bits, odd parity and 1 stop bit (38k4/8O1).\n\nWhile nowadays all post-production editing is done with a non-linear editing system, in those days editing was done linearly, using online editing. Editing machines relied heavily on the 9-Pin Protocol to remotely control automatic players and recorders.\n\nMany modern hard disk recorders and solid-state drive recorders can still emulate a 1982 Sony BVW-75 Betacam tape recorder.\n\nSony's standard also specifies a pinout:\n\nThis 9-pin RS-422 pinout has become a de facto standard, used by most brands in the broadcast industry. In the new millennium, RS-422 is slowly phased out in favor of Ethernet for control functions. However its simple way to perform troubleshooting means it will stay around for a long time.\n\nIn broadcast automation the Video Disk Control Protocol (VDCP) use the 9-Pin Protocol to playout broadcast programming schedules.\n\n\n"}

The producer or a first assistant director reviews the script, and marks certain elements that need to be taken care of before production, or even before pre-production can begin.\n\nEach scene, as per slug line, is measured into 1/8s of a page by its number of inches. Most pages of a screenplay are eight inches, so each inch is an 1/8, even if a page exceeds eight inches. The number of 1/8s is then marked in the top left corner of the scene, and circled. If a scene lasts longer than eight 1/8s, it is converted to 1. So, a scene lasting twelve 1/8s is marked 1 4/8.\n\nTo ease future production, an assistant director marks the elements found in each scene. This process repeats for each new scene. By the end, the producer will be able to see which scenes need which elements, and can begin to schedule accordingly. The film industry has a standard for color-coding:\n"}
{"id": "48423585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48423585", "title": "Comeback (sports)", "text": "Comeback (sports)\n\nA comeback (or come-from-behind) is an occurrence of an athlete or sports team engaged in a competition overcoming a substantial disadvantage in points or position, particularly if this results in the disadvantaged team winning. It has been described as \"the single greatest aspect of competition that most embodies the spirit of what makes sport extraordinary\". It has been observed in spectator sports that \"dramatic play seems to involve both players; cheering would often escalate when one player gained momentum, and then his/her opponent suddenly turned the tables and made a comeback\", with such a result drawing more enthusiasm than one competitor defeating the other without giving up any points. Fans are likely to feel better about a team that loses after staging a \"comeback that fell just short\" than a team that lost by the same score after having played evenly throughout the match and then allowed the other team the winning score at the end.\n\nIn some sports, particularly those regulated by a game clock, the time that it takes to score points makes a comeback impossible when there is too great a point disadvantage to overcome in the time remaining. It has been noted, however, that in \"some sports, such as tennis or baseball, a comeback is possible until the very last point, regardless of what the deficit might be\". Many sporting news outlets have compiled lists of \"greatest comebacks\" for various sports.\n\nSome academic study of sports comebacks has been conducted. One study indicated that in the sports of basketball, football and ice hockey, the team leading in points at the beginning of the final period of play wins the game 80% of the time, with the trailing team overcoming this disadvantage 20% of the time. Another determined that the home team advantage has a significant impact on the probability of a team engineering a late comeback, noting that for professional basketball teams, \"the home team is more than three times as likely to make a fourth-quarter comeback than is the visiting team (33.3% versus 10.5%)\". A comeback by one competitor may coincide with, or be alternatively characterized as, a \"choke\" by the opponent allowing the comeback.\n\nThere is no official definition or statistic for comebacks in American football, but many fans note the ability of certain teams to mount a comeback late in the game. A team may have a second-half comeback after having fallen well behind in the first half, or a fourth-quarter comeback after having fallen well behind with only one quarter of play remaining.\n\nCertain comebacks are particularly historically significant. For example, in American football, \"The Comeback\" refers to a specific NFL playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers played January 3, 1993. It featured the Bills recovering from a 32-point deficit shortly after halftime to win in overtime, 41–38, the largest comeback in terms of points in NFL history, postseason or regular season. This has been referred to as \"the greatest comeback in NFL history\". Another prominent example of a comeback came in Super Bowl LI, played on February 5, 2017, where the New England Patriots, down by 25 points in the third quarter, would eventually defeat the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, 34–28, for its second championship title in three years.\n\nThe 2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern football game featured the largest comeback in NCAA Division 1-A history, when the Michigan State Spartans rallied to score 38 unanswered points to beat the Northwestern Wildcats 41–38 after falling behind 38–3 with 9:54 left in the 3rd quarter.\n\nIn the 2006 Insight Bowl, the Texas Tech Red Raiders completed the largest comeback in NCAA Division 1-A Bowl Game history. The Minnesota Golden Gophers led 38-7 with 7:47 left in the 3rd quarter. Texas Tech quarterback Graham Harrell scored two touchdowns, running back Shannon Woods scored another TD, and kicker Alex Trlica hit the game-tying 52-yard field goal as time expired in regulation. Gophers QB Bryan Cupito led a drive capped off by a Joel Monroe field goal. Shannon Woods ended the game with a 3-yard rushing touchdown to complete the thrilling comeback. The 2015-16 TCU Horned Frogs tied this record in the 2016 Alamo Bowl.\n\nIn the 2016 Valero Alamo Bowl, the TCU Horned Frogs tied the aforementioned Texas Tech Red Raiders for the largest comeback in NCAA Division 1-A Bowl Game history. The Oregon Ducks led 31-0 at halftime. The Ducks' star quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. left the game with an injury. TCU backup QB Bram Kohlhausen (who was playing for starter Trevone Boykin as he was suspended for off-the-field issues) led an unbelievable 31-point second half to tie the game. The Frogs ended up winning the game 47-41 in 3OT after the Ducks failed to convert on 4th Down.\n\nThe ability for a comeback to occur in association football is limited by the game clock.\n\nA notable example of such a comeback is Charlton Athletic F.C. 7–6 Huddersfield Town A.F.C., 21 December 1957. With 27 minutes left, Charlton were losing 5–1 and down to ten men. However, they scored six more goals to win 7–6.\n\nAn example of a record breaking come back is F.C Barcelona (6-1, 6-5 on aggregate) against Paris Saint-Germain F.C in the Champions league round of 16 on March 8, 2017 at Camp Nou, Barcelona. It was the first time that a team in UEFA Champions League history a team had overcome a four-goal deficit in order to qualify for the quarterfinals.\n\nIn baseball, a comeback is theoretically possible at any point in the game up until the event that ends the game itself. There are no time constraints that would prevent a team from using its very last opportunity for play to score enough consecutive runs to win the game (or to tie the game, forcing extra innings).\n\nIn terms of individual games, on three occasions in Major League Baseball history, a team has come back from being twelve runs down to win the game:\n\nWith respect to comebacks over a series of multiple games, in MLB series play, the Boston Red Sox defeated the Yankees in 7 games in the 2004 American League Championship Series, after trailing 3-0 in the series.\n\nA team may have a second-half comeback after having fallen well behind in the first half, or a fourth-quarter comeback after having fallen well behind with only one quarter of play remaining.\n\nThe greatest comeback in National Basketball Association play occurred on November 27, 1996, when the Utah Jazz, down by 36 points to the Denver Nuggets in the third quarter, overcame this deficit to win 107-103. The greatest comeback in NCAA Division I history occurred on February 22, 2018 when Drexel overcame a 34 point deficit against Delaware. This surpassed the previous record, a February 1994 game between the Kentucky Wildcats and the Louisiana State University Tigers, in which the Wildcats were down by 31 points, but came back to win 99–95. In the Philippines, the San Miguel Beermen became the first basketball team in history to ever win a best-of-7 title series from 0-3 down after beating Alaska Aces in Game 7 of the 2015–16 PBA Philippine Cup Finals.\n\nThese comebacks happened at the end of regulation or the end of an overtime period in a short amount of time:\nThese comebacks happened over a longer stretch of the game:\nIn the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, both games of the March 13 session set NCAA postseason records, for largest deficit overcome within the final five minutes of a game (16) and largest deficit at any point in the game overcome (25).\n\nThe following comebacks are based solely on a points deficit basis:\n\n36 points — Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets (November 27, 1996)\n\nThe Utah Jazz defeated the Denver Nuggets 107 to 103 on November 27, 1996. The Jazz, playing before a hometown crowd at the Delta Center, trailed 70 to 36 at halftime. Led by the scoring efforts of Karl Malone with 31 points and Jeff Hornacek contributing 29 points, the Utah Jazz secured the win to overcome one of the largest deficits in NBA history.\n\n35 points — Sacramento Kings vs. Chicago Bulls (December 21, 2009)\n\nThe Sacramento Kings defeated the Chicago Bulls 102-98 on December 21, 2009 at Chicago's United Center. Trailing three quarters, with the largest deficit at 35 points, the Kings rallied behind the scoring of Tyreke Evans' 23 points. Sacramento overcame the Bulls in the fourth quarter despite a 26-point performance of Chicago's Luol Deng. This comeback constitutes the second largest comeback in NBA history.\n\nThey were down by as high as 35 points with less than 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. But despite trailing for almost three quarters, they fought their way back and beat Chicago Bulls by four points.\n\n30 points — Dallas Mavericks vs. Los Angeles Lakers (December 6, 2002)\n\nThe third largest NBA comeback occurred at Staples Center on December 6, 2002. The Los Angeles Lakers were down 30 in the 3rd quarter and trailing by 27 entering the 4th. On the back of 21 points from Kobe Bryant, the Lakers came back to win 105-103. Fittingly, Bryant scored with 8.4 seconds remaining, giving the Lakers their first lead of the game and held on for the win.\n\n29 points — Milwaukee Bucks vs. Atlanta Hawks (November 25, 1977)\n\nThe fourth largest NBA comeback occurred at Atlanta's Omni Coliseum on November 25, 1977. The Milwaukee Bucks, down 29 points to the Atlanta Hawks, came back to win 117-115. This game is the largest fourth quarter comeback in NBA history. Milwaukee's Junior Bridgerman led the comeback effort with 24 points and held off Atlanta's high scorer John Drew with 30 points on the night.\n\n29 points — Dallas Mavericks vs. Minnesota Timberwolves (December 30, 2008)\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 107 to 100 on December 30, 2008 to overcome a 29-point third quarter deficit. Jason Terry led all Mavericks scorers with 29 points while Dirk Nowitzki added 24 points. The game was played at Dallas' American Airlines Center.\n\n27 points — Miami Heat vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (March 20, 2013)\n\nAt Quicken Loans Arena, the Miami Heat overcame at the time league high 27-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 98-95 and extend their winning streak to 24 games.\n\n27 points — Toronto Raptors vs. Golden State Warriors (December 3, 2013)\n\nAt Oracle Arena in Oakland, the visiting Toronto Raptors held a 75-48 advantage over the Golden State Warriors with just over 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the Warriors outscored Toronto 64-28 in the final 21:20 by means of tremendous 3-point shooting to come away with a 112-103 win at home.\n\n26 points - Atlanta Hawks vs. Dallas Mavericks (October 24, 2018)\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks overcame a 26-point deficit in the second quarter to beat the Dallas Mavericks with a final score of 111-104 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. \n\n26 points - Boston Celtics vs. Houston Rockets (December 28, 2017)\n\nThe Boston Celtics overcame a 26-point deficit, coming back in the second half to beat the Houston Rockets with a final score of 99-98 at the TD Garden in Boston.\n\n26 points - Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Indiana Pacers (April 20, 2017)\n\nTrailing by as much as 26, the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a 25-point half-time deficit (largest ever overcome), to take a commanding 3-0 First Round series lead over the Indiana Pacers and further fuel what would become a historic 10-game playoff win-streak. The 26-point comeback tied the largest ever in NBA post-season history (along with the 2012 Clippers against the Memphis Grizzlies), with LeBron James scoring 41 points and a triple-double in another career night performance. \n\n25 points - Golden State Warriors vs. San Antonio Spurs (May 14, 2017)\n\nThe Golden State Warriors came back from a 25 point deficit, led by Steph Curry's 40 points and Kevin Durant's 34 points. Curry led the team with 7 made threes and 14 made field goals. Precipitating the comeback was the injury of the Spurs' first option, Kawhi Leonard. The Warriors won 113-111.\n\n25 points - Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Utah Jazz (April 25th, 2018)\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder erased a 25 point comeback in the third quarter of the NBA first round against the Utah Jazz. Russell Westbrook's 45 points and Paul George's 34 points saved the Thunder from elimination to force a game 6.\n\nThe ability for a comeback to occur in ice hockey is limited by the game clock.\n\nIn National Hockey League series play, the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers became the third NHL team to win a seven-game series after being down 3–0 (the others being the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders). This feat was once again accomplished in 2014 by the Los Angeles Kings. After being down three games in their series against the San Jose Sharks, the Kings rallied and won the next four. This momentum seemingly carried them in the remainder of their series, culminating with their winning the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn the 1995 Indianapolis 500, Jacques Villeneuve overtook the pace car by mistake and was penalized with two laps, but recovered and won the race.\n\nIn professional tennis, the match goes to the first player to win a predetermined number of sets, usually three or five in professional tournaments. There have been numerous instances of a player being down one or two sets to none, and coming back to win the remaining sets in a row to win the match. It is theoretically possible for a player to come back from a deficit at any point in the game.\n\nA notable example of such a comeback in tennis is the 1999 French Open final, between Andre Agassi and Andrei Medvedev, wherein Medvedev dominated the first two sets (1-6, 2-6) before Agassi mounted a come-from-behind victory, winning the remaining three sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-4) which allowed him to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\nIn the 10,000 metres at the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, runner Lasse Virén fell in the twelfth lap after getting tangled with Emiel Puttemans, with Tunisia's Mohamed Gammoudi also falling after being tripped by Viren's legs. Despite losing about 20 metres, Virén caught up with, and then outpaced, the pack, breaking Ron Clarke's 7-year-old world record with a time of 27:38:40\n\nIn the 2013 America's Cup, Oracle Team USA (representing the Golden Gate Yacht Club), fell behind the challenger Emirates Team New Zealand (representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron) by a score of 8 races to 1. Oracle had to win the last eight consecutive races to come from behind and win the competition. This has been described as \"[p]ossibly the greatest comeback in sports history\".\n"}

It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).\n\n\"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.\" Claude Shannon (1916–2001)\n\nThe origins of communication theory is linked to the development of information theory in the early 1920s. Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.\n\nHarry Nyquist's 1924 paper, \"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed\", contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.\n\nRalph Hartley's 1928 paper, \"Transmission of Information,\" uses the word \"information\" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.\n\nAlan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.\n\nThe main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon in the \"Bell System Technical Journal\" in July and October 1948 under the title \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\". Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.\n\nIn 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography (\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.\n\nIn 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.\n\nThe studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, Warren Weaver and others, prompted research on new models of communication from other scientific perspectives like psychology and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.\n\nScholars from disciplines different from mathematics and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':\n\nAccording to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, \"Communication Theory as a Field\" (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”\n\n\"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)\n\nBasic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:\n\n\n\n\n"}

On the prisoner at the bar pleading not guilty, the clerk of the crown answered culpable, and states that he was ready (prest) to join issue. The words \"cul. prist\" were then entered on the roll, showing that issue had been joined. When French law terms were discontinued, the words were taken as forming one word addressed to the prisoner.\n\nThe formula \"Culprit, how will you be tried?\" in answer to a plea of \"not guilty,\" is first found in the trial for murder of the 7th Earl of Pembroke in 1678.\n\nUnder this criminal law, the preferred term is defendant.\n"}

{"id": "194143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194143", "title": "Double negative", "text": "Double negative\n\nA double negative is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of negation are used in the same sentence. Multiple negation is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a clause. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have negative concord or emphatic negation. Portuguese, Persian, Russian, Spanish, Neapolitan, Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Afrikaans, Hebrew, and some dialects of English, such as African-American Vernacular English, are examples of negative-concord languages, while Latin and German do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.\n\nLanguages without negative concord typically have negative polarity items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs. Examples are \"ever\", \"anything\" and \"anyone\" in the sentence \"I haven't ever owed anything to anyone\" (cf. \"I have\"n't\" \"never\" owed \"nothing\" to \"no one\"\" in negative-concord dialects of English, and \"\"Nunca\" devi \"nada\" a \"ninguém\"\" in Portuguese, lit. \"Never have I owed nothing to no one\", or \"\"Non\" ho \"mai\" dovuto \"nulla\" a \"nessuno\"\" in Italian). Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as \"not\" or \"never\", but also by words such as \"doubt\" or \"hardly\" (\"I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone\" or \"He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone\").\n\nStylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. \"I'm not feeling not good\"), an understatement of the positive (\"I'm feeling good\"). The rhetorical term for this is litotes.\n\nWhen two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative: this is known as litotes. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.\n\nvs.\n\nThese two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.\n\nIn Standard English, two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop Robert Lowth wrote \"A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes\". For instance, \"I do not disagree\" could mean \"I certainly agree\", \"I agree\", \"I sort of agree\", \"I don't understand your point of view\", \"I have no opinion\", and so on; it is a form of \"weasel words\". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.\n\nThis is opposed to the single negative \"I do not agree\", which typically means \"I disagree\". However, the statement \"I do not completely disagree\" is a similar double negative to \"I do not disagree\" but needs little or no clarification.\n\nWith the meaning \"I completely agree\", Lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making back-handed compliments. The phrase \"Mr. Jones was not incompetent.\" will seldom mean \"Mr. Jones was very competent\" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.\n\nDiscussing English grammar, the term \"double negative\" is often though not universally applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.\n\nDouble negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as Southern American English, African American Vernacular English, and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in Middle English. Historically, Chaucer made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his \"Canterbury Tales\". About the Friar, he writes \"Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous\" (\"There never was no man nowhere so virtuous\"). About the Knight, \"He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight\" (\"He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man\").\n\nFollowing the battle of Marston Moor, Oliver Cromwell quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father Valentine Walton: \"A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies.\" Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read \"not ... to be any more\" instead.\n\nWhereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:\n\nIn contrast, some double negatives become positives:\n\nThe key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former. In the first example, the verb \"to go\" separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb. Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an adverb and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as \"I don't want to know no more\" contrasts with Romance languages such as French in \"Je ne veux pas savoir.\" \n\nAn exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in \"I'm not doing ; I'm thinking.\" A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it. Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:\n\nThen what happens is that the verb \"to doubt\" becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix \"no-\" to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb \"hungry\". Where people think that the sentence \"I'm not hungry no more\" resolves to a positive is where the latter negative \"no\" becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart \"more\" which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase \"no more\" is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., ; therefore, it is argued, \"I did not go nowhere\" resolves to \"I went somewhere\".\n\nOther forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:\n\nPhilosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred \"I'm not entirely familiar with Nihilism or Existentialism\"; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:\n\nTo the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.\nUp to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation. \"Prescriptive grammarians\" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English. To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English. This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.\n\nIn his \"Essay towards a practical English Grammar\" of 1711, James Greenwood first recorded the rule: \"Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm\". Robert Lowth stated in his grammar textbook \"A Short Introduction to English Grammar\" (1762) that \"two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative\". Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it. Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.\n\nDouble negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film \"Mary Poppins\", the chimney sweep Bert employs a double negative when he says, \"If you don't want to go nowhere...\" Another is used by the bandits in the \"Stinking Badges\" scene of John Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\": \"Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!\".\n\nMore recently, the British television show \"EastEnders\" has received some publicity over the Estuary accent of character Dot Branning, who speaks with double and triple negatives (\"I ain't never heard of no licence.\").. In the Harry Enfield sketch \"Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class\", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: \"Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing.\"\n\nIn music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall\", in which schoolchildren chant \"We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control\") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in The Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\").\n\nDouble negation is uncommon in other West Germanic languages. A notable exception is Afrikaans, where it is mandatory (for example, \"He cannot speak Afrikaans\" becomes \"Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie\", \"He cannot Afrikaans speak not\"). Dialectal Dutch, French and San have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:\n\nAnother point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a \"double negative\" but simply a grammatical template for negation. The second \"nie\" cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., \"pas\" in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical. It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded \"nie\", meaning \"not\", through historical accident.\n\nThe second \"nie\" is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with \"nie\" or another negating adverb.\n\nAfrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive. For example,\n\nWhile double negation is still found in the Low Franconian dialects of west Flanders (e.g., \"Ik ne willen da nie doen\", \"I do not want to do that\") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as Garderen, it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In Belgian Dutch dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like \"nooit niet\" (\"never not\") for \"never\".\n\nSimilar to some dialectal English, Bavarian employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian \"Des hob i no nia ned g'hört\" (\"This have I yet never not heard\") with the standard German \"Das habe ich noch nie gehört\". The German emphatic \"niemals!\" (roughly \"never ever\") corresponds to Bavarian \"(går) nia ned\" or even \"nie nicht\" in Standard German pronunciation.\n\nAnother exception is Yiddish. Due to Slavic influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.\n\nA few examples would be:\n\nWhile in Latin a second negative word appearing along with \"non\" turns the meaning into a positive one: \"ullus\" means \"any\", \"nullus\" means \"no\", \"non...nullus\" (\"nonnullus\") means \"some\". In the same way, \"umquam\" means \"ever\", \"numquam\" means \"never\", \"non...numquam\" (\"nonnumquam\") means \"sometimes\", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.\n\nIn French, the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. \"ne [verb] pas\", \"ne [verb] plus\", or \"ne [verb] jamais\", as in the sentences \"Je ne sais pas\" (\"I do not know\"), \"Il n'y a plus de baguettes\" (\"There aren't any more baguettes\"), and \"On ne sait jamais\" (\"one never knows\"). The second term was originally an emphatic; \"pas\", for example, derives from the Latin \"passus\", meaning \"step\", so that French \"Je ne marche pas\" and Catalan \"No camino pas\" originally meant \"I will not walk a single step.\" This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative \"ne\" is mostly left away in favour of \"pas\", as in \"Je sais pas\" \"I don't know\". In Northern Catalan, \"no\" may be omitted in colloquial language, and Occitan, which uses \"non\" only as a short answer to questions. In Venetian, the double negation \"no ... mìa\" can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: \"magno mìa\" (\"I eat not\") and \"vegno mìa\" (\"I come not\"). These exemplify Jespersen's cycle.\n\nItalian, Portuguese and Romanian languages usually employ doubled negative correlatives. Portuguese \"Não vejo nada\", Romanian \"Nu văd nimic\" and Italian \"Non vedo niente\" (\"I do not see nothing\") are used to express \"No, I do not see anything\". In Italian, a second following negative particle \"non\" turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both \"Voglio mangiare\" (\"I want to eat\") and \"Non voglio non mangiare\" (\"I don't want not to eat\") mean \"I want to eat\", the latter phrase more precisely means \"I'd prefer to eat\".\n\nOther Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In Asturian, an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: \"Yo nunca nun lu viera\" (\"I had not never seen him\") means \"I have never seen him\" and \"A mi tampoco nun me presta\" (\"I neither do not like it\") means \"I do not like it either\". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double \"no\" with other negatives, so \"Jo tampoc no l'he vista\" or \"Eu tampouco non a vira\", respectively (\"I neither have not seen her\") meant \"I have not seen her either\". That practice is dying out.\n\nIn 1974, Italy held a referendum on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce. Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal. And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative). This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.\n\nIn spoken Welsh, the word ddim (not) often occurs with a prefixed or mutated verb form that is negative in meaning: \"Dydy hi ddim yma\" (word-for-word, \"Not-is she not here\") expresses \"She is not here\" and \"Chaiff Aled ddim mynd\" (word-for-word, \"Not-will-get Aled not go\") expresses \"Aled is not allowed to go\".\n\nNegative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, ni or nid. The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: \"[Ni] wyddai neb\" (word-for-word, \"[Not] not-knew nobody\") means \"Nobody knew\" and \"[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres\" (word-for-word, \"[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money\") means \"Aled will not get much money\". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.\n\nDoubled negatives are perfectly correct in Ancient Greek. With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, \"no one\") results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι (\"No one was not suffering\") means more simply \"Everyone was suffering\". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς (\"Do not permit no one to raise an uproar\") means \"Let not a single one among them raise an uproar\".\n\nThose constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means \"It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him\", and one should not blame them for not trying.\n\nIn Modern Greek, negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning \"no one\", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.\n\nIn Slavic languages other than Slavonic, multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the Serbo-Croatian, \"Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio\" (\"Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere\") means \"Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere\", and \"Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla\" (\"Never I did not go there\") means \"I have never been there\". In Czech it is also common to use three or more negations. For example, \"Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl\" (\"I have not never seen no one nowhere\"). In Russian, \"I know nothing\" is я ничего не знаю (\"ya nichevo nye znayu\"), lit. \"I nothing don't know.\"\n\nA single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying \"I saw nobody\" in Polish (\"Widziałem nikogo\") instead of the more usual \"I did not see nobody\" (\"Nikogo nie widziałem\") might mean \"I saw an instance of nobody\" or \"I saw Mr. Nobody\" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in Slovenian, saying \"I do not know anyone\" (') in place of \"I do not know no one\" (') has the connotation \"I do not know just \"anyone\"\": I know someone important or special.\n\nAs with most synthetic \"satem\" languages double negative is mandatory in Latvian and Lithuanian. Furthermore, all verbs and indefinite pronouns in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.\n\nFor instance, a statement \"I have not ever owed anything to anyone\" would be rendered as \"es nekad nevienam neko neesmu bijis parādā\". The only alternative would be using a negating subordinate clause and subjunctive in the main clause, which could be approximated in English as \"there has not ever been an instance that I would have owed anything to anyone\" (\"nav bijis tā, ka es kādreiz būtu kādam bijis kaut ko parādā\"), where negative pronouns (\"nekad, neviens, nekas\") are replaced by indefinite pronouns (\"kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas\") more in line with the English \"ever, any\" indefinite pronoun structures.\n\nDouble or multiple negatives are grammatically required in Hungarian with negative pronouns: \"Nincs semmim\" (word for word: \"[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]\", and translates literally as \"I do not have nothing\") means \"I do not have anything\". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes \"se-,\" \"sem-,\" and \"sen-\" to interrogative pronouns.\n\nSomething superficially resembling double negation is required also in Finnish, which uses the auxiliary verb \"ei\" to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes \"-an,\" \"-än,\" \"-kaan,\" or \"-kään\" to interrogative pronouns: \"Kukaan ei soittanut minulle\" means \"No one called me\". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with \"ei\". This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example \"edes\" for \"jopa\" (\"even\"), as in \"jopa niin paljon\" meaning \"even so much\", and \"ei edes niin paljoa\" meaning \"not even so much\".\n\nNegative verb forms are grammatically required in Turkish phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, \"Hiçbir şeyim yok\" (literally, word for word, \"Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not\") means \"I don't have anything\". Likewise, \"Asla memnun değilim\" (literally, \"Never satisfied not-I-am\") means \"I'm never satisfied\".\n\nJapanese employs litotes to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (\"shinakereba naranai\", \"must\") literally means \"not doing [it] would not be proper\". しなければいけません (\"shinakereba ikemasen\", also \"must\") similarly means \"not doing [it] cannot go forward\".\n\nOf course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. \"He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji\" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (\"kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen\"), there is a rather harsher idea: \"As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist\".\n\nMandarin Chinese also employs litotes in a like manner. One common construction is 不得不 (Pinyin: \"bùdébù\", \"cannot not\"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (\"bìxū\", \"must\"). Compared with \"我必须走\" (\"Wǒ bìxū zǒu\", \"I must go\"), \"我不得不走\" (\"Wǒ bùdébù zǒu\", \"I cannot not go\") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: \"Unfortunately, I have got to go\". Similarly, \"没有人不知道\" (\"Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào\", \"There is not a person who does not know\") is a more emphatic way to express \"Everyone knows\".\n\nDouble negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, \"我不相信没人不来\" (\"Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái\", \"I do not believe no one will not come\") means \"I do not think everyone will come\". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.\n\nMany languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as Jespersen's cycle, where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. Old French \"jeo ne dis\" → Modern Standard French \"je ne dis pas\" → Modern Colloquial French \"je dis pas\" \"I don't say\").\n\nIn many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative \"per se\" (thus in French \"pas\" \"step\", originally \"not a step\" = \"not a bit\"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives \"not\" and \"nicht\" in these languages originally meant \"nothing\": e.g. Old English \"ic ne seah\" \"I didn't see\" » Middle English \"I ne saugh nawiht\", lit. \"I didn't see nothing\" » Early Modern English \"I saw not\".\n\nA similar development to a circumfix from double negation can be seen in non-Indo-European languages, too: for example, in Maltese, \"kiel\" \"he ate\" is negated as \"ma kielx\" \"he did not eat\", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle \"ma\"- \"not\" and followed by the particle -\"x\", which was originally a shortened form of \"xejn\" \"nothing\" - thus, \"he didn't eat nothing\".\n\n"}

The usual cause of downdrift is when the tones in three successive syllables are H L H. In this case the second high tone tends to be lower than the first. The effect can accumulate so that with each low tone, the pitch of the high tones becomes slightly lower, until the end of the intonational phrase, when the pitch is 'reset'.\n\nTwo basic types of downdrift are found. In one, called \"discrete downdrift\", when downstep occurs all tones shift downward, so that their relative difference in pitch remains constant; in the other, called \"tone terracing,\" the pitch of the low tone remains at the lower end of the speaker's vocal range, while the other tones shift downward, so that their difference in pitch narrows.\n\nPitch reset is required in the first instance because the tones approach the lower end of the speaker's comfort range, and in the second because the tonal distinctions of the language start being lost.\n\n"}

The most common downhaul on a modern sailboat is attached to the spinnaker pole, though this may be referred to as the foreguy in some rigging nomenclature. The term is also commonly applied to the cunningham on the mainsail.\n\nIn a windsurfing rig, the downhaul is the primary load-bearing line which controls the sail's shape. Modern windsurfing sails incorporate a sleeve for the mast, and therefore do not have a halyard which tensions the top of the sail.

After graduating, Camp worked as an educational organizer in Chicago, creating and putting into practice programs designed to help residents of public housing study for their GED's and programs to provide instruction in English as a second language to members of Chicago's Latino community. Camp eventually decided to return to school, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003. As a graduate student, her advisors were John Searle, Richard Wollheim, and John MacFarlane.\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate, Camp spent several years at Harvard University as part of the Harvard Society of Fellows, before moving to the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 where she served as an Associate Professor of Philosophy until 2013. In 2013, Camp accepted a tenured offer from Rutgers University where she is currently an Associate Professor of Philosophy (and where she is additionally affiliated with the Center for Cognitive Science.)

Along with Elizabeth Harman and Jill North, Camp is one of the organizers behind a series of workshops aimed at providing mentorship to women in graduate philosophy programs; the first workshop is currently intended to be held at Princeton University in August 2014.\n\nMuch of Camp's research has focused on forms of thought and speech that do not fit neatly in to standard propositional models. An especial focus of her research has been figurative speech such as sarcasm and metaphor, although she has also worked significantly in other areas, including the effects that loaded language (such as slurs) can have on conversational dynamics, and how conversations are effected when a speaker and a listener are uncertain about whether or not their interests agree. Camp has strongly defended the idea of the indispensability of metaphor. She has also written on philosophical issues involving concepts as well as on animal cognition. Camp has also made an effort to counter arguments used against the classical Gricean implicature account of metaphor, making a number of arguments intended to show that contextualist approaches to metaphor are flawed and that it is in fact possible for what is meant by a speaker to differ from what is literally said by a speaker, even in situations where the speaker appears to be quite candid in their speech.\n\nCamp has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals such as Noûs, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Philosophical Studies and Philosophical Quarterly. She has also contributed chapters to a number of books, including chapters in \"A Companion to Donald Davidson\" (part of the Blackwell Companions to Philosophy series,) and the forthcoming \"Concepts: New Directions\".\n"}
{"id": "1592807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1592807", "title": "Evidentiality", "text": "Evidentiality\n\nIn linguistics, evidentiality is, broadly, the indication of the nature of evidence for a given statement; that is, whether evidence exists for the statement and if so what kind. An evidential (also verificational or validational) is the particular grammatical element (affix, clitic, or particle) that indicates evidentiality. Languages with only a single evidential have had terms such as mediative, médiatif, médiaphorique, and indirective used instead of \"evidential\". Evidential is a meaning of nature and statement that is whether evidence exists for the statement and what kind of evidence exists.\n\nAll languages have some means of specifying the source of information. European languages (such as Germanic and Romance languages) often indicate evidential-type information through modal verbs (, , , ) or other lexical words (adverbials) () or phrases (English: \"it seems to me\").\n\nSome languages have a distinct grammatical category of evidentiality that is required to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as \"I hear that\", \"I see that\", \"I think that\", \"as I hear\", \"as I can see\", \"as far as I understand\", \"they say\", \"it is said\", \"it seems\", \"it seems to me that\", \"it looks like\", \"it appears that\", \"it turns out that\", \"alleged\", \"stated\", \"allegedly\", \"reportedly\", \"obviously\", etc.\n\nAlexandra Aikhenvald (2004) reports that about a quarter of the world's languages have some type of grammatical evidentiality. She also reports that, to her knowledge, no research has been conducted on grammatical evidentiality in sign languages. A first preliminary study on evidentiality in sign language has been conducted by Laura Mazzoni on LIS (Italian Sign Language).\n\nMany languages with grammatical evidentiality mark evidentiality independently from tense-aspect or epistemic modality (which is the speaker's evaluation of the information, i.e. whether it is reliable, uncertain, probable).\n\nGrammatical evidentiality may be expressed in different forms (depending on the language), such as through affixes, clitics, or particles, like Japanese has inferential evidentials and reportive markers that are realized as suffixes on a variety of (mainly verbal) predicates, and as grammaticalized nouns. In another example, Eastern Pomo has four evidential suffixes that are added to verbs, \"-ink’e\" (nonvisual sensory), \"-ine\" (inferential), \"-·le\" (hearsay), \"-ya\" (direct knowledge).\n\nThe use of evidentiality has pragmatic implications in languages that do not mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality. For example, a person who makes a false statement qualified as a belief may be considered mistaken; a person who makes a false statement qualified as a personally observed fact will probably be considered to have lied.\n\nIn some languages, evidential markers also serve other purposes, such as indicating the speaker's attitude to, or belief in, the statement. Usually a direct evidential marker may serve to indicate that the speaker is certain about the event stated. Using an indirect evidential marker, such as one for hearsay or reported information, may indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the statement, or doesn't want to take responsibility for its truth. A \"hearsay\" evidential may then have the undertone of \"that's what they say; whether or not it's true is nothing I can take responsibility for\". In other languages, this is not the case. Therefore one should distinguish between such evidential markers that only mark source of knowledge, and such evidential markers that serve other functions, such as marking epistemic modality.\n\nEvidentials can be used to ‘deflect culpability’ in a statement. In his dissertation on Nanti, a Peruvian Amazonian language, Lev Michael refers to an example in which a young girl is accidentally burned, and a community member questions her mother about how it happened. Her mother uses the evidential marker ‘ka’ which translates to ‘presumably,’ to deflect responsibility for the girl’s mistake.\n\nSome languages are borderline cases. For example, French is mostly like English in not having grammatical evidentiality, but does have some ability to express it via inflection. By using a mood called the conditional (which has three uses: conditions, future-in-the-past, and hearsay), journalistic French frequently makes a distinction between \"Il a reconnu sa culpabilité\" and \"Il aurait reconnu sa culpabilité\" (both \"He has admitted his guilt\"), but with an implication of certainty with the first, and the idea of \"reportedly\" with the second; the same happens in Spanish: \"Él ha reconocido su culpa\" vs. \"Él habría reconocido su culpa\".\n\nFollowing the typology of Aikhenvald (2004, 2006), there are two broad types of evidential marking:\n\n\nThe first type (\"indirectivity\") indicates whether evidence exists for a given statement, but does not specify what kind of evidence. The second type (\"evidentiality proper\") specifies the kind of evidence (such as whether the evidence is visual, reported, or inferred).\n\n\"Indirectivity\" (also known as \"inferentiality\") systems are common in Uralic and Turkic languages. These languages indicate whether evidence exists for a given source of information—thus, they contrast \"direct\" information (reported directly) and \"indirect\" information (reported indirectly, focusing on its reception by the speaker/recipient). Unlike the other \"evidential \"type II\"\" systems, indirectivity marking does not indicate information about the source of knowledge: it is irrelevant whether the information results from hearsay, inference, or perception (however, some Turkic languages distinguish between \"reported indirect\" and \"non-reported indirect\", see Johanson 2003, 2000 for further elaboration). This can be seen in the following Turkish verbs:\n\nIn the first word \"geldi\", the unmarked suffix \"-di\" indicates past tense. In the second word \"gelmiş\", the suffix \"-miş\" also indicates past tense but \"indirectly\". It may be translated into English with the added words \"obviously\", \"apparently\" or \"as far as I understand\". The direct past tense marker \"-di\" is unmarked (or neutral) in the sense that whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.\n\nThe other broad type of evidentiality systems (\"type II\") specifies the nature of the evidence supporting a statement. These kinds of evidence can be divided into such criteria as:\n\nA \"witness\" evidential indicates that the information source was obtained through direct observation by the speaker. Usually this is from visual observation (\"eyewitness\"), but some languages also mark information directly heard with information directly seen. A witness evidential is usually contrasted with a \"nonwitness\" evidential which indicates that the information was not witnessed personally but was obtained through a secondhand source or was inferred by the speaker.\n\nA \"secondhand\" evidential is used to mark any information that was not personally observed or experienced by the speaker. This may include inferences or reported information. This type of evidential may be contrasted with an evidential that indicates any other kind of source. A few languages distinguish between secondhand and thirdhand information sources.\n\n\"Sensory\" evidentials can often be divided into different types. Some languages mark \"visual\" evidence differently from \"nonvisual\" evidence that is heard, smelled, or felt. The Kashaya language has a separate \"auditory\" evidential.\n\nAn \"inferential\" evidential indicates information was not personally experienced but was inferred from indirect evidence. Some languages have different types of inferential evidentials. Some of the inferentials found indicate:\n\nIn many cases, different inferential evidentials also indicate epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential may indicate that the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.\n\n\"Reportative\" evidentials indicate that the information was reported to the speaker by another person. A few languages distinguish between \"hearsay\" evidentials and \"quotative\" evidentials. Hearsay indicates reported information that may or may not be accurate. A quotative indicates the information is accurate and not open to interpretation (i.e., is a direct quotation). An example of a reportative from Shipibo (\"-ronki\"):\n\nThe following is a brief survey of evidential systems found in the languages of the world as identified in Aikhenvald (2004). Some languages only have two evidential markers while others may have six or more. The system types are organized by the number of evidentials found in the language. For example, a two-term system (\"A\") will have two different evidential markers; a three-term system (\"B\") will have three different evidentials. The systems are further divided by the type of evidentiality that is indicated (e.g., \"A1\", \"A2\", \"A3\", etc.). Languages that exemplify each type are listed in parentheses.\n\nThe most common system found is the A3 type.\n\nTwo-term systems:\n\n\nThree-term systems:\n\n\nFour-term systems:\n\n\nFive-plus term systems:\n\n\nEvidential systems in many languages are often marked simultaneously with other linguistic categories. For example, according to Aikhenvald a given language may use the same element to mark both evidentiality and mirativity (i.e. unexpected information). She claims that this is the case of Western Apache where the post-verbal particle \"lą̄ą̄\" primarily functions as a mirative but also has a secondary function as an inferential evidential. This phenomenon of evidentials developing secondary functions or of other grammatical elements (e.g. miratives, modal verbs) developing evidential functions is fairly widespread. The following types of mixed systems have been reported:\n\nIn addition to the interactions with tense, modality, and mirativity, the usage of evidentials in some languages may also depend on the clause type, discourse structure, and/or linguistic genre.\n\nHowever, despite the intersection of evidentiality systems with other semantic or pragmatic systems (through grammatical categories), Aikhenvald believes that several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, she believes that there are modal systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express modality. Likewise, there are mirative systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express mirativity.\n\nEvidentiality is often considered to be a sub-type of epistemic modality (see, for example, Palmer 1986, Kiefer 1994). Other linguists consider evidentiality (marking the source of information in a statement) to be distinct from epistemic modality (marking the degree of confidence in a statement). An English example:\n\nFor instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) states that evidentiality \"asserts\" evidence while epistemic modality \"evaluates\" evidence and that evidentiality is more akin to a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude about the validity of a statement but this is not a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.\n\nConsidering evidentiality as a type of epistemic modality may only be the result of analyzing non-European languages in terms of the systems of modality found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic modality (and are thus ambiguous when taken out of context). Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001) finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).\n\nAlthough some linguists have proposed that evidentiality should be considered separately from epistemic modality, other linguists conflate the two. Because of this conflation, some researchers use the term \"evidentiality\" to refer both to the marking of the knowledge source and the commitment to the truth of the knowledge.\n\nEvidentiality is not considered a grammatical category in English because it is expressed in diverse ways and is always optional. In contrast, many other languages (including Quechua, Aymara, and Yukaghir) require the speaker to mark the main verb or the sentence as a whole for evidentiality, or offer an optional set of affixes for indirect evidentiality, with direct experience being the default assumed mode of evidentiality.\n\nConsider these English sentences:\n\nWe are unlikely to say the second unless someone (perhaps Bob himself) has told us that Bob is hungry. (We might still say it for someone incapable of speaking for himself, such as a baby or a pet.) If we are simply assuming that Bob is hungry based on the way he looks or acts, we are more likely to say something like:\n\nHere, the fact that we are relying on sensory evidence, rather than direct experience, is conveyed by our use of the word \"look\" or \"seem\".\n\nAnother situation in which the evidential modality is expressed in English is in certain kinds of predictions, namely those based on the evidence at hand. Amongst EFL teachers, these are usually referred to as \"predictions with evidence\". Examples:\n\nThe suffix \"ish\" can be considered to be a grammaticalized marker of uncertainty.\n\nThe notion of evidentiality as obligatory grammatical information was first made apparent in 1911 by Franz Boas in his introduction to \"The Handbook of American Indian Languages\" in a discussion of Kwakiutl and in his grammatical sketch of Tsimshianic. The term \"evidential\" was first used in the current linguistic sense by Roman Jakobson in 1957 in reference to Balkan Slavic (Jacobsen 1986:4; Jakobson 1990) with the following definition:\n\nJakobson also was the first to clearly separate evidentiality from grammatical mood. By the middle of the 1960s, \"evidential\" and \"evidentiality\" were established terms in linguistic literature.\n\nSystems of evidentiality have received focused linguistic attention only relatively recently. The first major work to examine evidentiality cross-linguistically is Chafe & Nichols (1986). A more recent typological comparison is Aikhenvald (2004).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10939", "title": "Formal language", "text": "Formal language\n\nIn mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a formal language consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.\n\nThe alphabet of a formal language consist of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language. Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called \"well-formed words\" or \"well-formed formulas\". A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, which consists of its formation rules.\n\nThe field of formal language theory studies primarily the purely syntactical aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.\nIn computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.\n\nThe first formal language is thought to be the one used by Gottlob Frege in his \"Begriffsschrift\" (1879), literally meaning \"concept writing\", and which Frege described as a \"formal language of pure thought.\"\n\nAxel Thue's early semi-Thue system, which can be used for rewriting strings, was influential on formal grammars.\n\nAn alphabet, in the context of formal languages, can be any set, although it often makes sense to use an alphabet in the usual sense of the word, or more generally a character set such as ASCII or Unicode. The elements of an alphabet are called its letters. An alphabet may contain an infinite number of elements; however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.\n\nA word over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., string) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet Σ is usually denoted by Σ (using the Kleene star). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the \"empty word\", which is often denoted by e, ε, λ or even Λ. By concatenation one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.\n\nIn some applications, especially in logic, the alphabet is also known as the \"vocabulary\" and words are known as \"formulas\" or \"sentences\"; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.\n\nA formal language \"L\" over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ, that is, a set of words over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.\n\nIn computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with natural languages, the adjective \"formal\" is often omitted as redundant.\n\nWhile formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept \"formal language\" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less. In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as regular languages or context-free languages. The notion of a formal grammar may be closer to the intuitive concept of a \"language,\" one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.\n\nThe following rules describe a formal language  over the alphabet Σ = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, = }:\nUnder these rules, the string \"23+4=555\" is in , but the string \"=234=+\" is not. This formal language expresses natural numbers, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their syntax), not what they mean (semantics). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that \"0\" means the number zero, \"+\" means addition, \"23+4=555\" is false, etc.\n\nFor finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language  as just  = {\"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", \"cba\"}. The degenerate case of this construction is the empty language, which contains no words at all ( = ∅).\n\nHowever, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as Σ = {a, b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: \"a\", \"abb\", \"ababba\", \"aaababbbbaab\", …. Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing \"L\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", \"cba\"}. Here are some examples of formal languages:\n\nFormal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as\n\nTypical questions asked about such formalisms include:\n\n\nSurprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is \"it cannot be done at all\", or \"it is extremely expensive\" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of computability theory and complexity theory. Formal languages may be classified in the Chomsky hierarchy based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing automaton. Context-free grammars and regular grammars provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of parsing, and are widely used in practical applications.\n\nCertain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.\n\nExamples: suppose \"L\" and \"L\" are languages over some common alphabet.\n\nSuch string operations are used to investigate closure properties of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the context-free languages are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with regular languages, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of trios and abstract families of languages studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.\n\nA compiler usually has two distinct components. A lexical analyzer, generated by a tool like codice_1, identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. identifiers or keywords, which are themselves expressed in a simpler formal language, usually by means of regular expressions. At the most basic conceptual level, a parser, usually generated by a parser generator like codice_2, attempts to decide if the source program is valid, that is if it belongs to the programming language for which the compiler was built.\n\nOf course, compilers do more than just parse the source code – they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an abstract syntax tree. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an executable containing machine code that runs directly on the hardware, or some intermediate code that requires a virtual machine to execute.\n\nIn mathematical logic, a \"formal theory\" is a set of sentences expressed in a formal language.\n\nA \"formal system\" (also called a \"logical calculus\", or a \"logical system\") consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a \"deductive system\"). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems formula_1 and formula_2 may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).\n\nA \"formal proof\" or \"derivation\" is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or propositions) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a rule of inference. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.\n\nFormal languages are entirely syntactic in nature but may be given semantics that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical logic, the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an interpretation assigns a meaning to each of the formulas—usually, a truth value.\n\nThe study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of model theory. In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within mathematical structures, and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a \"model\" for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.\n\n\n"}

It probably dates back to the 14th- or 15th-century Italian Renaissance. It presents a typical example of Renaissance magic.\n\nIt is possible that the \"Key of Solomon\" inspired later works, particularly the 17th-century grimoire also known as \"Clavicula Salomonis Regis\", \"Lesser Key of Solomon\" or \"Lemegeton\", although there are many differences between the books.\n\nMany such grimoires attributed to King Solomon were written during the Renaissance, ultimately being influenced by earlier works of Jewish kabbalists and Arab alchemists. These, in turn, incorporated aspects of the Greco-Roman magic of Late Antiquity.\n\nSeveral versions of the \"Key of Solomon\" exist, in various translations, with minor to significant differences. The archetype was probably a Latin or Italian text dating to the 14th or 15th century. Most surviving manuscripts date from the late 16th, 17th or 18th centuries. \nThere is also an early Greek manuscript dating to the 15th century (Harleian MS. 5596) that is closely associated with the text.\nThe Greek manuscript is referred to as \"The Magical Treatise of Solomon\", and was published by Armand Delatte in \"Anecdota Atheniensia\" (Liége, 1927, pp. 397–445.) Its contents are very similar to the \"Clavicula\".\n\nAn important Italian manuscript is Bodleian Library Michael MS 276. An early Latin text survives in printed form, dated to ca. 1600 (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Memorial Library, Special Collections). There are a number of later (17th century) Latin manuscripts. One of the oldest existing manuscripts (besides Harleian 5596) is a text in English translation, entitled \"The Clavicle of Solomon, revealed by Ptolomy the Grecian\" and dated to 1572 (Sloane 3847). There are a number of French manuscripts, all dated to the 18th century, with the exception of one dated to 1641 (P1641, ed. Dumas, 1980).\nA Hebrew text survives in two versions, one kept at the British Library, on a parchment manuscript, separated in BL Oriental MSS 6360 and 14759. The BL manuscript was dated to the 16th century by its first editor Greenup (1912), but is now thought to be somewhat younger, dating to the 17th or 18th century. The discovery of a second Hebrew text in the library of Samuel H. Gollancz was published by his son Hermann Gollancz in 1903, who also published a facsimile edition in 1914. Gollancz' manuscript had been copied in Amsterdam, in Sephardic cursive script, and is less legible than the BL text. The Hebrew text is not considered the original. It is rather a late Jewish adaptation of a Latin or Italian \"Clavicula\" text. The BL manuscript is probably the archetype of the Hebrew translation, and Gollancz' manuscript a copy of the BL one.\n\nAn edition of the Latin manuscripts of the British Library was published by S. L. MacGregor Mathers in 1889.\nL. W. de Laurence in 1914 published \"The Greater Key of Solomon\", directly based on Mathers' edition, to which he made alterations in an attempt to advertise his mail-order business (for example by inserting instructions like \"after burning one-half teaspoonful of Temple Incense\" along with ordering information for the incense).\n\nThe \"Key of Solomon\" is divided into two books. It describes not the appearance or work of any spirit but only the necessary drawings to prepare each \"experiment\" or, in more modern language, magical operations.\n\nUnlike later grimoires such as the \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\" (16th century) or the \"Lemegeton\" (17th century), the \"Key of Solomon\" does not mention the signature of the 72 spirits constrained by King Solomon in a bronze vessel. As in most medieval grimoires, all magical operations are ostensibly performed through the power of God, to whom all the invocations are addressed. Before any of these operations (termed \"experiments\") are performed, the operator must confess his sins and purge himself of evil, invoking the protection of God.\n\nElaborate preparations are necessary, and each of the numerous items used in the operator's \"experiments\" must be constructed of the appropriate materials obtained in the prescribed manner, at the appropriate astrological time, marked with a specific set of magical symbols, and blessed with its own specific words. All substances needed for the magic drawings and amulets are detailed, as well as the means to purify and prepare them. Many of the symbols incorporate the Transitus Fluvii occult alphabet.\n\nAccording to the mythical history of the document, as recorded in its introduction, Solomon wrote the book for his son Rehoboam, and commanded him to hide the book in his sepulchre upon his death. After many years the book was discovered by a group of Babylonian philosophers repairing Solomon's tomb. None could interpret the text, until one of them, Iohé Grevis, suggested that they should entreat the Lord for understanding. The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and extracted a promise that he would keep the text hidden from the unworthy and the wicked, after which he was able to read it plainly. Iohé Grevis then placed a conjuration on the book that the unworthy, the unwise or those who did not fear God would not attain the desired effect from any of the workings contained therein.\n\nBook I contains conjurations, invocations and curses to summon and constrain spirits of the dead and demons in order to compel them to do the operator's will. It also describes how to find stolen items, become invisible, gain favour and love, and so on.\n\nBook II describes various purifications which the operator (termed \"exorcist\") should undergo, how they should clothe themselves, how the magical implements used in their operations should be constructed, and what animal sacrifices should be made to the spirits.\n\n\n\n\n\nme\n"}

For instance, given the following text: \"After the \"match\", replace any remaining fluid deficit to prevent chronic dehydration throughout the tournament\", a substitute of \"game\" might be given.\n\nLexical substitution is strictly related to word sense disambiguation (WSD), in that both aim to determine the meaning of a word. However, while WSD consists of automatically assigning the appropriate sense from a fixed sense inventory, lexical substitution does not impose any constraint on which substitute to choose as the best representative for the word in context. By not prescribing the inventory, lexical substitution overcomes the issue of the granularity of sense distinctions and provides a level playing field for automatic systems that automatically acquire word senses (a task referred to as Word Sense Induction).\n\nIn order to evaluate automatic systems on lexical substitution, a task was organized at the Semeval-2007 evaluation competition held in Prague in 2007. A Semeval-2010 task on cross-lingual lexical substitution has also taken place.\n\nThe skip-gram model takes words with similar meanings into a vector space (collection of objects that can be added together and multiplied by numbers) that are found close to each other in N-dimensions (list of items). A variety of neural networks (computer system modeled after a human brain) are formed together as a result of the vectors and networks that are related together. This all occurs in the dimensions of the vocabulary that has been generated in a network.\nThe model has been used in lexical substitution automation and prediction algorithms. One such algorithm developed by Oren Melamud, Omer Levy, and Ido Dagan uses the skip-gram model to find a vector for each word and its synonyms. Then, it calculates the cosine distance between vectors to determine which words will be the best substitutes.\nIn a sentence like \"The dog walked at a quick pace\" each word has a specific vector in relation to the other. The vector for \"The\" would be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0] because the 1 is the word vocabulary and the 0s are the words surrounding that vocabulary, which create a vector.\n\n"}

{"id": "10374788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10374788", "title": "Modern Standard Tibetan grammar", "text": "Modern Standard Tibetan grammar\n\nTibetan grammar describes the morphology, syntax and other grammatical features of Standard Tibetan, a Sino-Tibetan language. Standard Tibetan is typologically an ergative–absolutive language. Nouns are generally unmarked for grammatical number, but are marked for case. Adjectives are never marked and appear after the noun. Demonstratives also come after the noun but these are marked for number. Verbs are possibly the most complicated part of Tibetan grammar in terms of morphology. The dialect described here is the colloquial language of Central Tibet, especially Lhasa and the surrounding area, but the spelling used reflects classical Tibetan, not the colloquial pronunciation.\n\nNouns are not usually marked for grammatical gender or number.\n\nNatural gender may be conveyed through the lexicon, e.g. གཡག་ <gyag> \"yak (male),\" འབྲི་ <'bri> \"yak-cow.\" In human or animate nouns, gender may be indicated through suffixes. These suffixes are generally པ་ <pa> or པོ་ <po> \"male,\" and མ་ <ma> or མོ་ <mo> \"female.\" \n\nNumber is never marked in inanimate nouns or animals. Even human nouns can only take the plural marker ཚོ་ <tsho> if they are specified or definite, e.g. ཨ་མ་ \"mother\" → ཨ་མ་ཚོ་ \"(the) mothers.\" Tibetan does not mark definiteness, and such a meaning would be left to be deduced from the context.\n\nTibetan nouns are marked for six cases: absolutive, agentive, genitive, ablative, associative and oblique. Particles are attached to entire noun phrases, not to individual nouns. Case suffixes are attached to the noun phrase as a whole, while the actual noun remains unchanged. The form taken by the suffix depends on the final sound of the noun to which the suffix is attached.\n\nThe absolutive case is the unmarked form of the noun, which may be used as the subject of an intransitive verb, the object of a transitive verb or the experiencer of an emotion.\n\nThe genitive case marks possession and is often translated as \"of.\" The form of the genitive suffix depends on the last sound of the noun:\n\n\nThe genitive is also used to form relative clauses. Here, the genitive suffix is attached to the verb and is translated as \"that\" or \"who.\"\n\nFormally the agentive (or ergative) case is built upon the genitive by adding ས་ <-s> to the latter; consequently:\n\n\nThe agentive is used for ergative and instrumental functions. The ergative function occurs with the subject, agent or causer of transitive verbs, the agent of \"mental\" and \"verbal\" actions and the perceiver of a sensation.\n\nThe ablative case is always suffixed with ནས་ <nas>. It marks direction away from the noun. Like the agentive case, the ablative can also take the ergative role marking the agent of an action.\n\nThe associative case is marked by the suffix དང་ <dang>, which may be translated as \"and\" but also as \"with,\" \"against\" or have no translation at all. When speaking, after the associative suffix is used, a pause is inserted, for example:\n\nThe associative suffix cannot combine with other case or plural markers on the same noun or noun phrase:\n\nThe oblique suffix fulfills the functions of both the dative and locative cases. The dative case marks the indirect object of an action and can be translated as \"to.\" The locative case marks place, with or without movement, or time, and can be translated as \"on,\" \"in,\" \"at\" or \"to.\"\n\nThere are two varieties of the suffix, one of which is dependent on the final sound of the noun and one that is not. The form –ར་ <-r> is found only after vowels and འ་ <'a> whereas –ལ་ <-la> can be found after all sounds including vowels and <'a>. The <-r> form is rarely used to mark the dative with monosyllabic words except the personal pronouns and demonstrative and interrogative adjectives.\n\nPronouns have between one and three registers and three numbers: singular, dual and plural.\n\nTibetan has proximal, medial and distal demonstrative pronouns: proximal འདི་ <'di> \"this,\" medial དེ་ <de> \"that,\" and distal ཕ་གི་ <pha-gi> \"that over there.\" འདི་ <'di> and དེ་ <de> also have temporal meanings where འདི་ <'di> is connected with present and དེ་ <de> is connected with the past or the future:\n\nཕ་གི་ <pha-gi>, on the other hand, can only express spatial distance. From these demonstrative pronouns the following adverbs are derived: འདིར་ <'dir> \"here,\" དེར་ <der> \"there,\" and ཕ་གིར་ <pha-gir> \"over there.\"\n\nThe demonstratives can be used as both pronouns and adjectives. As pronouns they act much in the same way as the third person pronouns do, but may also refer to previous clauses or events. As adjectives they appear after the noun and act as any other adjective would. Both adjectival and pronominal demonstratives are capable of receiving both case and number suffixes.\n\nThere is an important division of verbs into two main classes: volitional and non-volitional. The former concerns controllable actions, and the latter non-controllable actions. This difference is comparable to that in English between \"look\" and \"see\", and between \"listen\" and \"hear\": \"listen\" and \"look\" are volitional because you can choose to do them or not, while \"see\" and \"hear\" are non-volitional because they do not denote deliberate actions. These two classes are important when conjugating any Tibetan verb because each class can only use a certain set of suffixes. This means that volitional verbs cannot use the same suffixes as non-volitional verbs and vice versa. For example, the verb form མཐོང་པ་ཡིན་ <mthong-pa-yin> would be incorrect as <mthong> is a non-volitional verb and <pa-yin> is a volitional suffix. The correct form would be མཐོང་པ་རེད་ <mthong-pa-red> or \"I saw.\"\n\nBoth the volitional and non-volitional classes contain transitive as well as intransitive verbs. The forms of transitive and intransitive verbs remain the same if the two verbs share the same root. The difference between transitive and intransitive is only evident in the way each verb is used: if the verb takes an object then it is transitive, if it does not then it is intransitive. This distinction determines which case the nouns will take.\n\nVerbs in modern spoken Tibetan have between one and three stems. These are the present-future stem, the past stem and the imperative stem. Many verbs, however, only have one stem when spoken, remaining distinct only in writing, meaning that inflection is based mainly on the use of verbal auxiliaries. The verb is inflected by means of attaching suffixes to the verb stem in a similar way to nouns and pronouns.\n\nTibetan has several verbs that can be translated as \"to be\" or \"to have\" which appear in two classes. Copulas in the first class are essential, meaning that they denote an essential quality of the noun. Copulas in the second class are existential, meaning that they express the existence of a phenomenon or a characteristic and suggests an evaluation by the speaker. The difference between essential and existential copulas is similar to that of the verbs \"estar\" and \"ser\" in the Spanish language.\n\nThere are three essential copulas: \"assertive\" རེད་ <red>, \"revelatory\" རེད་བཞག་ <red-bzhag>, and \"egophoric\" ཡིན་ <yin>\n\nརེད་ <red> is the \"assertive\" essential copula. It translates as \"to be\" and represents an objective assertion or affirmation regarding the subject of the sentence. The negative of རེད་ <red> is མ་རེད་ <ma-red>. The attribute may be an adjective, giving an attributive meaning, or a substantive, giving an equative meaning. The attributive immediately precedes the verb.\n\nThis copula, in rare cases, may also express possession of a quality:\n\nརེད་བཞག་ <red-bzhag> is the \"revelatory\" copula, meaning that the speaker has only recently become aware of what they are stating. It may be translated as \"to be\" with the statement preceded by an exclamation such as \"Hey!\" or \"Why!\" Its negative form is རེད་མི་འདུག་ <red-mi-'dug>.\n\nཡིན་ <yin> is the \"egophoric\" essential copula. It is usually translated as \"I am\" because of its main use with the first person. Like རེད་ <red>, it can be used with adjectives or substantives. Its negative form is མིན་ <min>.\n\nཡིན་ <yin> may, on rare occasions, express an intention or an insistence on the part of the speaker:\n\nThere are three existential copulas: \"assertive\" ཡོད་རེད་ <yod-red>, \"testimonial\" འདུག་ <'dug> and \"egophoric\" ཡོད་ <yod>.\n\nཡོད་རེད་ <yod-red> is the \"assertive\" copula. This copula is used with the second and third person pronouns and implies a definite assertion by the speaker. It can usually be translated three ways according to context; \"there is/are,\" giving an existential sense, \"to be at,\" giving a certain location (situational sense) or by the verb \"to have,\" giving a possessive sense. Its negative form is ཡོད་མ་རེད་ <yod-ma-red>.\n\nIt can also be preceded by a qualifying adjective to form the attributive sense in which it can be translated as \"to be.\"\n\nའདུག་ <'dug> is the \"testimonial\" copula. It is translated in the same way as ཡོད་རེད་ <yod-red> in all cases but it differs in a subtle way. It implies that the speaker was a witness to what is being stated. Its negative form is མི་འདུག་ <mi-'dug>.\n\nIt can also, like ཡོད་རེད <yod-red> be preceded by a qualifying adjective to form the attributive sense in which it can be translated as \"to be.\"\n\nཡོད <yod> is the \"egophoric\" copula. Like ཡིན་ <yin> it is associated with the first person but it instead marks possession (I have) and location (I am (at)). It may also be used to express the speaker's opinion of something or an acquaintance with something. Its negative form is མེད་ <med>.\n\n"}

{"id": "4754463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4754463", "title": "Northern Khmer dialect", "text": "Northern Khmer dialect\n\nNorthern Khmer, also called Khmer Surin ( - \"Khmer Soren\"), is the dialect of the Khmer language spoken by approximately 1.4 million Khmer native to the Thai provinces of Surin, Sisaket, Buriram and Roi Et as well as those that have migrated from this region into Cambodia.\n\nNorthern Khmer differs from the standard language, based on a dialect of Central Khmer, in the number and variety of vowel phonemes, consonantal distribution, lexicon, grammar, and, most notably, pronunciation of syllable-final , giving Northern Khmer a distinct accent easily recognizable by speakers of other dialects. Some speakers of Northern Khmer may understand other varieties of Khmer but speakers of standard Khmer who have not been exposed to Northern Khmer often have trouble understanding Northern Khmer at first. The two varieties are 80–85% cognate on a basic 270-word list. These facts have led some linguists to advocate considering Northern Khmer a separate, but closely related language.\n\nAfter the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border, leaving the Khmer north of the mountains increasingly under the sphere of influence of Lan Xang. The conquests of Cambodia by Naresuan the Great for Ayutthaya furthered the political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period.\n\nSubsequently, the Isan area was claimed by the Lao Kingdom of Champasak in 1718 and in 1893, the region became part of the Kingdom of Siam (Thailand) as a result of the Franco-Siamese War. Throughout this period, the Northern Khmer people shared the rural mountainous highlands with the Lao, Thai and various Mon-Khmer groups such as the Kuy, leading to a high degree of multilingualism. These varied influences and unique history have resulted in a distinct accent, with characteristics of the surrounding tonal languages, lexical differences through borrowing from Lao, Kuy and Thai, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants.\n\nNorthern Khmer has the typical Mon-Khmer consonant and syllable structure although there is no phonemic phonation. The primary divergences from Central Khmer phonology are in the realizations of some syllable-final consonants and in the vowel inventory. Northern Khmer is also losing the sesquisyllabic pattern of its sister languages. Many dysllables have lost all but the first consonant of the pre-syllable, creating a great number of consonant clusters. In many dialects of Northern Khmer, however, inserting a generic syllable, , after an initial consonant is still optional, returning some words to their original sesquisyllabic structure.\n\nThe consonant inventory of Northern Khmer is identical to that of Central Khmer. It is laid out below as reported by Thomas.\n\nSyllable-initial consonants are pronounced as in Central Khmer. When appearing as a syllable-final, however, the , and that would be expected in Central Khmer are often realized as , and , respectively, in Northern Khmer. Additionally, as mentioned above, syllable-final which has become silent in all other dialects is markedly pronounced.\n\nThe biggest distinction between Northern Khmer of Thailand and Central Khmer of Cambodia is in the inventory of vowel phonemes. Smalley described 14 pure vowels that occur both long and short.\n\nSmalley also described three \"vowels with offglides\" that he treated as monophthongs, namely , and , for a total of 17 vowel phonemes. All 17 vowels may occur in closed syllables and all but have been found in open syllables. With 14 basic vowel positions, and having more back vowels than front, Northern Khmer is atypical. By contrast, standard Central Khmer only has 9 or 10 basic vowel positions, depending on the analysis.\n\nNorthern Khmer is, for the most part, a spoken language as most speakers are unable to read or write their native tongue due to Thaification policies either enacted or supported by the Thai government. However, recent renewed interest and enthusiasm in Khmer language and culture has resulted in a two-fold increase in the use of Northern Khmer since 1958 and the consequential need for a formalized method of writing the language. Since the Thai language is the medium of public education and, until the 21st century, the media, Khmer is taught at home or by monks in the local Khmer temples, often supported by Khmers in Cambodia or Western nations.\n\nIn Thailand, Northern Khmer is written in the Thai script. As many sounds occur in Northern Khmer that would be impossible to write according to the rules of Thai orthography, a few innovations are necessary such as using ฮ (initial /h/ in Thai) at the end of words to represent syllable-final /h/ and ญ (initial , final in Thai) to represent Northern Khmer's palatal nasal /ɲ/. Special diacritics are also sometimes used with the vowels because Northern Khmer has more vowel positions than Thai.\n\nWithin Cambodia, Northern Khmer is written in the Khmer script as the words are spelled in standard Khmer, regardless of the Northern Khmer pronunciation. This is seen most often in the context of kantrum music karaoke DVDs which are increasingly popular in Cambodia and with Cambodians overseas.\n\n\" ฺ \" (the pinthu mark) or \" ํ \" are used to alter the pronunciation of vowels, similar to the \"bântăk\" punctuation mark (a small vertical line on the final consonant of a syllable) in the Khmer alphabet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1004626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1004626", "title": "Old Japanese", "text": "Old Japanese\n\nOld Japanese was written using Chinese characters, using an increasingly standardized and phonetic form that eventually evolved into \"man'yōgana\". Typically for a Japonic language and for a step in the evolutionary line of modern Japanese, Old Japanese was a primarily agglutinative language with subject–object–verb word ordering. However, the language was marked by a few phonemic differences from later forms of Japanese, such as a simpler syllable structure and distinctions between several pairs of syllables pronounced identically in Early Middle Japanese and later. The phonetic realization of this differentiation is uncertain.\n\nLinguistic changes are gradual, and the periodization of Japanese is \"both delicate and controversial\", with multiple competing methods and criteria for division. For both practical and conventional reasons, these divisions often correlate to political events, particularly shifts in power or changes of capital.\n\nOld Japanese is usually defined as the language of the Nara period (710–794), when the capital was Heijō-kyō (present-day Nara).\nThis is the period of the earliest connected texts in Japanese, the 112 songs included in the \"Kojiki\" (712).\nThe other major literary sources of the period are the 128 songs included in the \"Nihon Shoki\" (720) and the \"Man'yōshū\" (c. 759), a compilation of over 4,500 poems.\nShorter samples are 25 poems in the \"Fudoki\" (720) and the 21 poems of the \"Bussokuseki-kahi\" (c. 752).\nThe latter has the virtue of being an original inscription, whereas for all the other texts the oldest surviving manuscripts are the results of centuries of copying, with the attendant risk of scribal errors.\nProse texts are more limited, but are thought to reflect the syntax of Old Japanese more accurately than verse.\nThe most important are the 27 \"Norito\" (liturgies) recorded in the \"Engishiki\" (compiled in 927) and the 62 \"Senmyō\" (imperial edicts) recorded in the \"Shoku Nihongi\" (797).\n\nA limited number of Japanese words, mostly personal names and place names, are recorded phonetically in ancient Chinese texts such as the \"Wei Zhi\" portion of the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" (3rd century AD), but the transcriptions by Chinese scholars are unreliable.\nThe oldest surviving native inscriptions, dating from the 5th or early 6th centuries, include those on the Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror, the Inariyama Sword and the Eta Funayama Sword.\nThese inscriptions are written in Classical Chinese, but contain several Japanese names transcribed phonetically using Chinese characters.\nSuch inscriptions become more common from the Suiko period (592–628).\nThese fragments are usually considered a form of Old Japanese.\n\nArtifacts inscribed with Chinese characters dated as early as the 1st century AD have been found in Japan, but it appears that detailed knowledge of the script did not arrive in the islands until the early 5th century.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", it was brought by scholars from Baekje (southwest Korea).\nThe earliest texts found in Japan are written in Classical Chinese, probably by immigrant scribes.\nLater \"hybrid\" texts show the influence of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, placing the verb after the object).\n\nChinese and Koreans had long used Chinese characters to write non-Chinese terms and proper names phonetically, by selecting characters for Chinese words that sounded like each syllable.\nKoreans also used the characters phonetically to write Korean particles and inflections added to Chinese texts as an aid to reading (Idu script).\nIn Japan, the practice was developed into \"man'yōgana\", a complete script for the Japanese language using Chinese characters phonetically, and the ancestor of modern kana syllabaries.\nThis system was already in use in the verse parts of the \"Kojiki\" (712) and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (720).\nFor example, the first line of the first poem in the \"Kojiki\" was written with five characters:\n\nThis method of writing Japanese syllables by using characters for their Chinese sounds (\"ongana\") was supplemented with indirect methods in the complex mixed script of the \"Man'yōshū\" (c. 759).\n\nIn \"man'yōgana\", each Old Japanese syllable was represented by a Chinese character. Although any one of several characters could be used for a given syllable, a careful analysis revealed that 88 syllables were distinguished in the \"Kojiki\":\n\nThe system has the same gaps of \"yi\" and \"wu\" found in later forms of Japanese.\nHowever, many syllables that have a modern \"i\", \"e\" or \"o\" occurred in two forms, termed types and , denoted by subscripts 1 and 2 respectively in the above table.\nThe syllables \"mo\" and \"mo\" are not distinguished in the slightly later \"Nihon Shoki\" and \"Man'yōshū\", reducing the syllable count to 87.\nAll of these pairs had merged by the Early Middle Japanese of the Heian period.\n\nSeveral different notations for the type A/B distinction are found in the literature, including:\nThere is no consensus on the pronunciation of the syllables distinguished by \"man'yōgana\".\nOne difficulty is that the Middle Chinese pronunciations of the characters used are also disputed, and since their reconstruction is partly based on Sino-Japanese pronunciations, there is a danger of circular reasoning.\nAdditional evidence has been drawn from phonological typology, subsequent developments in the Japanese pronunciation, and comparative study of the Ryukyuan languages.\n\nOld Japanese had open syllables, of the form (C)V, subject to additional restrictions:\n\nIn 1934, Arisaka Hideyo proposed a set of phonological restrictions permitted in a single morpheme.\n\"Arisaka's Law\" states that \"-o\" is generally not found in the same morpheme as \"-a\", \"-o\" or \"-u\".\nSome scholars have interpreted this as a vestige of earlier vowel harmony, but it is very different from patterns observed in e.g. the Turkic languages.\n\nThe Chinese characters chosen to write syllables with the Old Japanese vowel \"a\" suggest that it was an open unrounded vowel .\nThe vowel \"u\" was a close rounded back vowel , unlike the unrounded of Modern Standard Japanese.\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been advanced to explain the A/B distinctions made in \"man'yōgana\". The issue is hotly debated, and there is no consensus.\nThe widely accepted traditional view, first advanced by Kyōsuke Kindaichi in 1938, is that there were eight pure vowels, with the type B vowels being more central than their type A counterparts.\nOthers, beginning in the 1930s but more commonly since the work of Roland Lange in 1968, attribute the type A/B distinction to medial or final glides and .\nThe diphthong proposals are often connected to hypotheses about pre-Old Japanese, but all exhibit an uneven distribution of glides.\n\nThe distinction between \"mo\" and \"mo\" is only seen in \"Kojiki\" and vanished afterwards.\nDistributionally, there may have once been *\"po\", *\"po\", *\"bo\" and *\"bo\".\nIf this is true, then a distinction was made between C\"o\" and C\"o\" for all consonants C except for \"w\". Some take this as support that C\"o\" may have represented C\"wo\".\n\nMost scholars derive the Old Japanese vowel system from an earlier four-vowel system, with the most common Old Japanese vowels \"a\", \"u\", \"i\" and \"o\" reflecting earlier *a, *u, *i and *ə respectively.\nInternal reconstruction suggests that the other, less common, Old Japanese vowels are derived from fusions of these vowels.\nFor example, the place name \"take\"\"ti\" is derived from a compound of \"taka-\" 'high' and \"iti\" 'market'.\nAnother piece of evidence is that many nouns have different forms when used independently and when used within compounds.\nAn example is \"sake\" 'rice wine', which becomes \"saka-\" in compounds such as \"sakaduki\" 'saké cup'.\nIn such cases the bound form is considered basic, and the independent form may be explained by postulating a suffix *-i that fused with the final vowel of the root.\nThe following reductions are proposed:\nThere are also alternations suggesting \"e\" < *əi, such as:\nSome authors believe these belong to an earlier layer than \"i\" < *əi, while others reconstruct two central vowels *ə and *ɨ, which merge everywhere except before *i.\nOther authors attribute this variation to different reflexes in different dialects, noting that *əi yields \"e\" in Ryukyuan languages.\nSome authors also suggest that *e and *o are required to account for word-final \"e\" and \"o\" respectively.\n\nMiyake 2003 reconstructs the following inventory, in addition to a zero vowel-initial onset :\n\nThe voiceless obstruents had the voiced prenasalized counterparts .\nThis prenasalization was still present in the late 17th century (according to the Korean textbook \"Chephay sine\"), and is found in some modern Japanese and Ryukyuan dialects, but has disappeared in Modern Japanese, except for the intervocalic nasal stop allophone of .\nThe sibilants and may have been palatalized before \"e\" and \"i\".\n\nComparative evidence from Ryukyuan languages suggests that Old Japanese \"p\" derives from an earlier voiceless bilabial stop *p.\nThere is general agreement that word-initial \"p\" had become a voiceless bilabial fricative by Early Middle Japanese, as suggested by its transcription as \"f\" in later Portuguese works and as \"ph\" or \"hw\" in the Korean textbook \"Chephay sine\".\nIn Modern Standard Japanese, it is romanized as \"h\" and has different allophones before various vowels.\nIn medial position, it became in Early Middle Japanese, and has since disappeared except before \"a\".\nMany scholars argue that \"p\" had already lenited to by the Old Japanese period, but Miyake argues that it was still a stop.\n\nInternal reconstruction suggests that the Old Japanese voiced obstruents, which always occurred in medial position, arose from weakening of earlier nasal syllables before voiceless obstruents:\nIn some cases there is no evidence for a preceding vowel, leading some scholars to posit final nasals at the earlier stage.\n\nSome linguists suggest that Old Japanese \"w\" and \"y\" derive respectively from *b and *d at some point before the oldest inscriptions in the 6th century.\nSouthern Ryukyuan varieties such as Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni retain and in these words:\nHowever, many linguists, especially in Japan, argue that the Southern Ryukyuan voiced stops are local innovations.\nSome supporters of *b and *d also add *z and *g, both disappearing in Old Japanese, for reasons of symmetry.\nHowever, there is very little Japonic evidence for these.\n\nVowel elision occurred to prevent vowel clusters.\nWhen a monosyllabic morpheme is followed by a polysyllabic morpheme beginning with a vowel, the second vowel is dropped:\nIn other environments, the first vowel is dropped:\n\nAlthough modern Japanese dialects have pitch accent systems, these are usually not shown in \"man'yōgana\".\nHowever, in one part of the \"Nihon Shoki\", the Chinese characters appear to be chosen to represent a pitch pattern similar to that recorded in the \"Ruiju Myōgishō\", a dictionary compiled in the late 11th century.\nIn this section, a low pitch syllable is represented by a character with the Middle Chinese level tone, and a high pitch is represented by a character with one of the other three Middle Chinese tones.\nThus it appears that the Old Japanese accent system was similar to that of Early Middle Japanese.\n\nAs in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese word order was predominantly subject–object–verb, with adjectives and adverbs preceding the nouns and verbs they modify, and auxiliary verbs and particles consistently appended to the main verb.\n\nMany Old Japanese pronouns had both a short form and a longer form with attached \"-re\" of uncertain etymology.\nWhere the pronoun occurred in isolation, the longer form would be used.\nWith genitive particles or in nominal compounds, the short form was used, whereas in other situations either form was possible.\n\nPersonal pronouns were distinguished by taking the genitive marker \"ga\", in contrast to the marker \"no\" used with demonstratives and nouns.\n\nDemonstratives often distinguished proximal (to the speaker) and non-proximal forms marked with \"ko\"- and \"so\"- respectively.\nMany forms had corresponding interrogative forms \"i(du)-\".\n\nIn Early Middle Japanese, the non-proximal \"so-\" forms were re-interpreted as hearer-based (medial), and the formerly speaker-based forms divided into proximal \"ko-\" forms and distal \"ka-\"/\"a-\" forms, yielding the three-way distinction still found in Modern Japanese.\n\nOld Japanese had a richer system of verbal suffixes than later forms of Japanese.\nOld Japanese verbs used inflection for modal and conjunctional purposes.\nOther categories, such as voice, tense, aspect and mood, were expressed using optional suffixed auxiliaries, which were also inflected.\n\nAs in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese verbs had a large number of inflected forms.\nIn traditional Japanese grammar, these are represented by six forms (\"katsuyōkei\", 活用形) from which all the others may be derived, in a similar fashion to the principal parts used for Latin and other languages:\nThis system has been criticized because the six forms are not equivalent, with one being solely a combinatory stem, three solely word forms, and two being both.\nIt also fails to capture some inflected forms.\nHowever, five of the forms are basic inflected verb forms, and the system also describes almost all extended forms in a consistent way.\n\nJapanese verbs are classified into eight conjugation classes, each characterized by different patterns of inflected forms.\nThree of these classes are grouped as consonant bases:\n\nThe distinctions between \"i\" and \"i\" and between \"e\" and \"e\" are lost after \"s\", \"z\", \"t\", \"d\", \"n\", \"y\", \"r\" and \"w\".\n\nThere are five vowel-base conjugation classes:\nEarly Middle Japanese also had a \"\" (lower monograde or \"e\"-monograde) category consisting of a single verb \"kwe-\" 'kick', which reflects the Old Japanese lower bigrade verb \"kuwe-\".\n\nThe bigrade verbs seem to belong to a later layer than the consonant-base verbs.\nMany \"e\"-bigrade verbs are transitive or intransitive counterparts of consonant-stem verbs.\nIn contrast, \"i\"-bigrade verbs tend to be intransitive.\nSome bigrade bases also appear to reflect pre-Old-Japanese adjectives with vowel stems combined with an inchoative *-i suffix:\n\nThere were two types of adjectives: regular adjectives and adjectival nouns.\n\nThe regular adjective is sub-classified into two types: those where the adverbial form () ends in \"-ku\" and those that end in \"-siku.\" This creates two different types of conjugations:\n\nThe \"-kar-\" and \"-sikar-\" forms are derived from the adverbial conjugation (\"-ku\" or \"-siku\") suffixed with verb \"ar-\" \"be, exists\". The conjugation yields to the R-irregular conjugation of \"ar-\". As Old Japanese avoids vowel clusters, the resulting \"-ua-\" is reduced to \"-a-\".\n\nThe adjectival noun has a single conjugation:\n\nAlthough the majority of Old Japanese writing represents the language of the Nara court in central Japan, some sources come from eastern Japan:\nThey record Eastern Old Japanese dialects, with features such as:\n\n\n\n"}

Online therapy is a clinical arrangement where the patient and a speech-language certified pathologist communicate and interact face-to-face over the Internet. The session involves a suite of therapeutic exercises including listening, speaking, reading and writing. The recorded videos are assessed by the pathologist to generate an activity report for evaluating progress and usage.\n\nTelepractice is a method of reaching students and individuals in any distant location. Telepractice is defined by the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association (ASHA) as the use of technology to provide speech therapy services to remote regions. Janet Brown, the Director of Healthcare services in SLP at ASHA has stated \"research shows that with telepractice a speech-language pathologist can provide speech therapy services, with the same results, as being there in person.\"\n\nAssessment for online speech therapy consists of an informal oral exam by a licensed trained professional through video conferencing or a web application. Patients are initially screened for communication disorders with diagnosis and consultation for provision counseling including cognitive aspects of communication, syntax, hypophonia and upper aerodigestive functions. The therapist and patient communicate via telecommunication technology where they can interact in real time. Therapy may cover speech sound production, fluency, language, cognition and written language.\n\nThe therapists create an assessment document or report that is updated after every session. The document is reported to the parents or the referral source in compliance with HIPAA and FERPA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA is a federal law that protects patient medical records. HIPAA specifically protects “individually identifiable health information.” The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act known as FERPA is a federal law that protects student education records. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records until they turn 18 or transfer to a school higher than the high school level, thus making them “eligible students.” Clinical departments in Universities also offer speech and language therapy services where they keep recorded video of sessions between clinicians and patients secured through password security services.\n\nOnline speech therapy courses are offered by professional associations, Universities and cyber schools for treatment of communication disorders. The minimum eligibility for an online speech therapy course is a bachelor's degree for Master's entry-level field and master's degree for CScD offered by professional associations and Universities in the United States. The speech therapist course is not available for Bachelors or under graduate degree level in the United States. The pathologists are required to attain a minimum of 400 clinical hours to complete the course.

{"id": "217115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217115", "title": "Ordination", "text": "Ordination\n\nOrdination is the process by which individuals are consecrated, that is, set apart as clergy to perform various religious rites and ceremonies. The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by religion and denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordination.\n\nThe tradition of the ordained monastic community (\"sangha\") began with the Buddha, who established orders of monks and later of nuns. The procedure of ordination in Buddhism is laid down in the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha's teachings:\n\nSaicho repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei, and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks/nuns were ordained using the Hinayana precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the Bodhisattva precepts as listed in the Brahma Net Sutra.\n\n\"Pabbajja\" is an ordination procedure for novice Buddhist monks in the Theravada tradition.\n\nThe legitimacy of fully ordained nuns (\"bhikkhuni/bhiksuni\") has become a significant topic of discussion in recent years. Texts passed down in every Buddhist tradition record that Gautama Buddha created an order of fully ordained nuns, but the tradition has died out in some Buddhist traditions such as Theravada Buddhism, while remaining strong in others such as Chinese Buddhism (Dharmaguptaka lineage). In the Tibetan lineage, which follows the Mulasarvastivadin lineage, the lineage of fully ordained nuns was not brought to Tibet by the Indian Vinaya masters, hence there is no rite for the ordination of full nuns. However th 14th Dalai Lama has endeavored for many years to improve this situation. In 2005, he asked fully ordained nuns in the Dharmaguptaka lineage, especially Jampa Tsedroen, to form a committee to work for the acceptance of the \"bhiksuni\" lineage within the Tibetan tradition, and donated €50,000 for further research. The \"1st International Congress on Buddhist Women’s Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages\" was held at the University of Hamburg from July 18–20, 2007, in cooperation with the University’s Asia-Africa Institute. Although the general tenor was that full ordination was overdue, the Dalai Lama presented a pre-drafted statement saying that more time was required to reach a decision, thus nullifying the intentions of the congress.\n\nIn Medieval Sōtō Zen, a tradition of posthumous ordination was developed to give the laity access to Zen funeral rites. Chinese Ch’an monastic codes, from which Japanese Sōtō practices were derived, contain only monastic funeral rites; there were no provisions made for funerals for lay believers. To solve this problem, the Sōtō school developed the practice of ordaining laypeople after death, thus allowing monastic funeral rites to be used for them as well.\n\nThe Buddhist ordination tradition of the New Kadampa Tradition-International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT-IKBU) is not the traditional Buddhist ordination, but rather one newly created by Kelsang Gyatso. Although those ordained within this organisation are called 'monks' and 'nuns' within the organisation, and wear the robes of traditional Tibetan monks and nuns, in terms of traditional Buddhism they are neither fully ordained monks and nuns (Skt.: bhikshu, bhikshuni; Tib.: gelong, gelongma) nor are they novice monks and nuns (Skt.: sramanera, srameneri; Tib.: gestul, getsulma).\n\nUnlike most other Buddhist traditions, including all Tibetan Buddhist schools, which follow the Vinaya, the NKT-IKBU ordination consists of the Five Precepts of a lay person, plus five more precepts created by Kelsang Gyatso. He is said to view them as a “practical condensation” of the 253 Vinaya vows of fully ordained monks.\n\nThere are also no formal instructions and guidelines for the behaviour of monks and nuns within the NKT. Because the behaviour of monks and nuns is not clearly defined “each Resident Teacher developed his or her own way of ‘disciplining’ monks and nuns at their centres …”.\n\nKelsang Gyatso's ordination has been publicly criticised by Geshe Tashi Tsering as going against the core teachings of Buddhism and against the teachings of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa school from which Kelsang Gyatso was expelled\n\nOrdination is one of the seven sacraments, variously called holy orders or \"cheirotonia\" (\"Laying on of Hands\").\n\nApostolic succession is considered an essential and necessary concept for ordination, in the belief that all ordained clergy are ordained by bishops who were ordained by other bishops tracing back to bishops ordained by the Apostles who were ordained by Christ, the great High Priest (, ), who conferred his priesthood upon his Apostles (, , , and ).\n\nThere are three \"degrees\" of ordination (or holy orders): deacon, presbyter, and bishop. Both bishops and presbyters are priests and have authority to celebrate the Eucharist. In common use, however, the term \"priest\", when unqualified, refers to the rank of presbyter, whereas \"presbyter\" is mainly used in rites of ordination and other places where a technical and precise term is required.\n\nOrdination of a bishop is performed by several bishops; ordination of a priest or deacon is performed by a single bishop. The ordination of a new bishop is also called a consecration. Many ancient sources specify that at least three bishops are necessary to consecrate another, e.g., the 13th Canon of the Council of Carthage (AD 394) states, \"A bishop should not be ordained except by many bishops, but if there should be necessity he may be ordained by three,\" and the first of \"The Canons of the Holy and Altogether August Apostles\" states, \"Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops,\" while the second canon thereof states, \"Let a presbyter, deacon, and the rest of the clergy, be ordained by one bishop\"; the latter canons, whatever their origin, were imposed on the universal church by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea, in its first canon.\n\nOnly a person ordained to the priesthood may administer certain sacraments (most especially, hear confessions, serve as the ordinary minister of giving the host during Communion, anointing the sick- unction, presiding at Requiem or Memorial services or religious marriages involving a Mass, or celebrating any Mass- the Eucharist).\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that one bishop is sufficient to consecrate a new bishop validly (that is, for an episcopal ordination actually to take place). In most Christian denominations that retain the practice of ordination, only an already ordained (consecrated) bishop or the equivalent may ordain bishops, priests, and deacons. However, Canon Law requires that bishops always be consecrated with the mandate (approval) of the Roman Pontiff, as the guarantor of the Church's unity. Moreover, at least three bishops are to perform the consecration, although the Apostolic See may dispense from this requirement in extraordinary circumstances (for example, in missionary settings or times of persecution).\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, those deacons destined to be ordained priests are often termed \"transitional deacons\"; those deacons who are married before being ordained, as well as any unmarried deacons who chose not to be ordained priests, are called \"permanent deacons\". Those married deacons who become widowers have the possibility of seeking ordination to the priesthood in exceptional cases.\n\nWhile some Eastern churches have in the past recognized Anglican ordinations as valid, the current Anglican practice, in many provinces, of ordaining women to the priesthood—and, in some cases, to the episcopate—has caused the Orthodox generally to question earlier declarations of validity and hopes for union. The Roman Catholic Church has never recognized Anglican orders as valid. Anglicanism recognizes Roman Catholic and Orthodox ordinations; hence, clergy converting to Anglicanism are not \"re-ordained\".\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox churches recognize Roman Catholic ordinations while others \"re-ordain\" Roman Catholic clergy (as well as Anglicans) who convert. However, both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches recognize Orthodox ordinations.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, ordinations have traditionally been held on Ember Days, though there is no limit to the number of clergy who may be ordained at the same service. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, ordinations may be performed any day of the year on which the Divine Liturgy may be celebrated (and deacons may also be ordained at the Presanctified Liturgy), but only one person may be ordained to each rank at any given service, that is, at most one bishop, one presbyter, and one deacon may be ordained at the same liturgy.\n\n\nIn most Protestant churches, ordination to the pastoral office is the rite by which their various churches:\nFor the sake of authorization and church order, and not for reason of 'powers' or 'ability', individuals in most mainline Protestant churches must be ordained in order to preside at the sacraments (Baptism, Holy Absolution and Holy Communion), and to be installed as a called pastor of a congregation or parish.\n\nSome Protestant traditions have additional offices of ministry to which persons can be ordained. For instance:\n\nFor most Protestant denominations that have an office of bishop, such as Lutheranism and Methodism, this is not viewed as a separate ordination or order of ministry. Rather, bishops are ordained ministers of the same order as other pastors, simply having been \"consecrated\" or installed into the \"office\" (that is, the job) of bishop. However, some Lutheran churches also claim valid apostolic succession.\n\nSome Protestant Churches – especially Pentecostal and Charismatic ones – also have an informal tier of ministers. Those who graduate from a Bible College or take a year of prescribed courses are licensed ministers. Two more years of courses or graduation from a seminary or theological graduate school, as well as an exam by senior ministers, will result in one becoming an ordained minister. Licensed ministers are addressed as \"Minister\" and ordained ministers as \"Reverend.\"\n\nIn Christianity, the term non-denominational refers to those churches that have not formally aligned themselves with an established denomination, or remain otherwise officially autonomous. This, however, does not preclude an identifiable standard among such congregations. Non-denominational congregations may establish a functional denomination by means of mutual recognition of or accountability to other congregations and leaders with commonly held doctrine, policy and worship without formalizing external direction or oversight in such matters. Some non-denominational churches explicitly reject the idea of a formalized denominational structure as a matter of principle, holding that each congregation must be autonomous.\n\nNon-denominational is generally used to refer to one of two forms of independence: political or theological. That is, the independence may come about because of a religious disagreement or political disagreement. This causes some confusion in understanding. Some churches say they are non-denominational because they have no central headquarters (though they may have affiliations with other congregations.) Other churches say they are non-denominational because their belief structures are unique.\n\nMembers of non-denominational churches often consider themselves simply \"Christians\". However, the acceptance of any particular stance on a doctrine or practice (for example, on baptism), about which there is not general unanimity among churches or professing Christians, may be said to establish a de facto credal identity. In essence, this would mean that each non-denominational church forms its own unofficial \"denomination\" with a specific set of tenets as defined by the beliefs and practices of its own congregation.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses consider an adherent's baptism to constitute ordination as a minister. Governments have generally recognized that Jehovah's Witnesses' full-time appointees (such as their \"regular pioneers\") qualify as ministers regardless of sex or appointment as an elder or deacon (\"ministerial servant\"). The religion asserts ecclesiastical privilege only for its appointed elders, but the religion permits any baptized adult male in good standing to officiate at a baptism, wedding, or funeral.\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a rite of ordination is performed to bestow either the Aaronic or Melchizedek priesthood (Hebrews 5:4–6) upon a worthy male member. As in the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions, great care is taken to assure that the candidate for priesthood is ordained by those with proper authority and ordained properly and validly; thorough records of priesthood ordination are kept by the church. Ordination is performed by the laying on of hands. Ordination to the office of priest in the Aaronic priesthood gives the ordained person the authority to:\n\nOrdination to the Melchizedek priesthood includes the authority to perform all the duties of the Aaronic priesthood, as well as ordain others to the Melchizedek or Aaronic priesthood, perform confirmations, bless and anoint the sick with oil, bless and dedicate graves, and other such rites. There are five offices within the Melchizedek Priesthood to which one could potentially be ordained:\n\"Ordination to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the bishop or branch president. Ordination to an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the stake or mission president. To perform a priesthood ordination, one or more authorized priesthood holders place their hands lightly on the person’s head.\"\n\nLatter-day Saints believe in a line of priesthood authority that traces back to Jesus Christ and his apostles. LDS adherents believe the church's founder, Joseph Smith, was ordained under the hands of apostles Peter, James, and John, who appeared to Smith as angelic messengers in 1829.\n\nMuslims do not formally ordain religious leaders. Ordination is viewed as a distinct aspect of other religions and is rejected. Islam does not have a formal and separated clergy.\n\nReligious leaders are usually called Imams or Sheikhs or Maulana. The title Imam (when used outside the historic Shi'ite context) refers to someone who leads in prayer and can also be used in a linguistic sense for anyone who leads other Muslims in congregational prayers. Sheikh is an Arabic word meaning \"old man\" and is used as an honorable title for a learned man; Shaikhah refers to a woman learned in Islamic issues. This title is usually more prevalent in the Arabic countries. The word Maulana is a title bestowed upon students who have graduated from a Madrasa (Islamic theological school) throughout the Indian subcontinent region. Although different Muslim schools, universities or madrasas might follow different graduation ceremonies upon a student's completion of a 4-year B.A. of Islamic Studies or a 7–8 Alim Course, these ceremonies do not in any way symbolize ordination.\n\n\"Semikhah\" (, \"leaning [of the hands]\"), also \"semichut\" (, \"ordination\"), or \"semicha lerabanim\" (, \"rabbinical ordination\") is derived from a Hebrew word which means to \"rely on\" or \"to be authorized\". It generally refers to the ordination of a rabbi or hazzan within Judaism. While the Hebrew word \"semikhah\" is rendered as \"ordination\" in English, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah, not a priest. For example, for many religious purposes such as prayer a minyan (quorum) of ten people (men or adults in different streams of Judaism) is both necessary and sufficient; it is said that \"nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan, but ten cobblers can\"—the presence of a rabbi is not necessary.\n\nAs Unitarian Universalism features very few doctrinal thresholds for prospective congregation members, ordinations of UU ministers are considerably less focused upon doctrinal adherence than upon factors such as possessing a Masters of Divinity degree from an accredited higher institution of education and an ability to articulate an understanding of ethics, spirituality and humanity.\n\nIn the Unitarian Universalist Association, candidates for \"ministerial fellowship\" are approved by Ministerial Fellowship Committee (MFC). However, individual congregations of the UUA possess final voting rights on ordination of ministers, and congregations may sometimes even hire or ordain ministers who have not received ministerial fellowship.\n\nIn the Neo-Pagan religion of Wicca, a person's initiation is regarded as an induction and ordination as a priestess or priest. The rites which a person undergoes to become a priestess or priest, and the education and years of study required differ according to denomination.\n\nThe ordination of women is often a controversial issue in religions where either the office of ordination, or the role that an ordained person fulfills, is traditionally restricted to men, for various theological reasons.\n\nThe Christian priesthood has traditionally been reserved to men. Some claim that women were ordained deacons in the first millennium of Christianity, but their claims are disputed. After the Protestant Reformation and the loosening of authority structures within many denominations, most Protestant groups re-envisioned the role of the ordained priesthood. Many did away with it altogether. Others altered it in fundamental ways, often favoring a rabbinical-type married minister of teaching (word) and discarding any notion of a sacrificial priesthood. A common epithet used by Protestants (especially Anglicans) against Catholics was that Catholics were a 'priest-ridden' people. Hatred for priests was a common element of anti-Catholicism and pogroms against Catholics focused on expelling, killing, or forcefully 'laicizing' priests.\n\nBeginning in the twentieth century, many Protestant denominations began re-evaluating the roles of women in their churches. Many now ordain women. A woman named Deborah was a judge of the ancient Israelites according to the biblical book of Judges. Based partially upon this precedent, other Protestant and non-denominational organizations grant ordination to women. Other denominations refute the claim of a precedent based on Deborah's example because she is not specifically described as ruling over Israel, rather giving judgments on contentious issues in private, not teaching publicly, neither did she lead the military. Her message to her fellow judge Barak in fact affirmed the male leadership of Israel. The United Church of Canada has ordained women since 1932. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ordains women as pastors, and women are eligible for election as bishops. The Episcopal Church in the United States of America ordains women as deacons, priests and bishops. The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church ordains women at all levels including deacon, priest and bishop. Other denominations leave the decision to ordain women to the regional governing body, or even to the congregation itself; these include the Christian Reformed Church in North America and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The ordination of women in the latter half of the 20th century was an important issue between Anglicans and Catholics since the Catholic Church viewed the ordination of women as a huge obstacle to possible rapprochement between the two churches.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not changed its view or practice on the ordination or women, and neither have any of the Orthodox churches; these churches represent approximately 65% of all Christians worldwide. In response to the growing call for the ordination of women, Pope John Paul II issued the statement \"Ordinatio Sacerdotalis\" in 1995. In it, he gave reasons why women cannot be ordained, and defined that the Holy Spirit had not conferred the power to ordain women upon the Church. In the wake of this definitive statement, many theologians considered the issue settled, but many continue to push for the ordination of women in the Catholic Church. Some have even begun protest churches.\n\nPolicy regarding the ordination of women differs among the different denominations of Judaism. Most Orthodox congregations do not allow female rabbis, while more liberal congregations began allowing female rabbis by the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nMost Abrahamic religions condemn homosexuality; only recently have a minority of denominational or non-denominational sects of Christianity and Judaism endorsed the ordination of openly LGBT people.\n\nThe United Church of Christ ordained openly gay Bill Johnson in 1972, and lesbian Anne Holmes in 1977.\n\nWhile Buddhist ordinations of openly LGBT monks have occurred, more notable ordinations of openly LGBT novitiates have taken place in Western Buddhism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38539820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38539820", "title": "Proto-Slavic", "text": "Proto-Slavic\n\nProto-Slavic is the unattested, reconstructed proto-language of all the Slavic languages. It represents Slavic speech approximately from the 5th to 9th centuries AD. As with most other proto-languages, no attested writings have been found; scholars have reconstructed the language by applying the comparative method to all the attested Slavic languages and by taking into account other Indo-European languages.\n\nRapid development of Slavic speech occurred during the Proto-Slavic period, coinciding with the massive expansion of the Slavic-speaking area. Dialectal differentiation occurred early on during this period, but overall linguistic unity and mutual intelligibility continued for several centuries, into the 10th century or later. During this period, many sound changes diffused across the entire area, often uniformly. This makes it inconvenient to maintain the traditional definition of a proto-language as the \"latest reconstructable common ancestor\" of a language group, with no dialectal differentiation. (This would necessitate treating all pan-Slavic changes after the 6th century or so as part of the separate histories of the various daughter languages.) Instead, Slavicists typically handle the entire period of dialectally-differentiated linguistic unity as Common Slavic.\n\nOne can divide the Proto-Slavic/Common-Slavic time of linguistic unity roughly into three periods:\n\n\nAuthorities differ as to which periods should be included in Proto-Slavic and in Common Slavic. The language described in this article generally reflects the middle period, usually termed \"Late Proto-Slavic\" (sometimes \"Middle Common Slavic\") and often dated to around the 7th to 8th centuries. This language remains largely unattested, but a late-period variant, representing the late 9th-century dialect spoken around Thessaloniki in Greek Macedonia, is attested in Old Church Slavonic manuscripts.\n\nThe ancestor of Proto-Slavic is Proto-Balto-Slavic, which is also the ancestor of the Baltic languages, e.g. Lithuanian and Latvian. This language in turn is descended from Proto-Indo-European, the parent language of the vast majority of European languages (including English, Irish, Spanish, Greek, etc.). Proto-Slavic gradually evolved into the various Slavic languages during the latter half of the first millennium AD, concurrent with the explosive growth of the Slavic-speaking area.\n\nThere is no scholarly consensus concerning either the number of stages involved in the development of the language (its periodization) or the terms used to describe them. For consistency and convenience, this article adopts the following scheme.\n\nProto-Slavic is divided into periods. One division is made up of three periods:\n\nAnother division is made up of four periods:\n\nThis article considers primarily \"Middle Common Slavic\", noting when there is slight dialectal variation. It also covers \"Late Common Slavic\" when there are significant developments that are shared (more or less) identically among all Slavic languages.\n\nTwo different and conflicting systems for denoting vowels are commonly in use in Indo-European and Balto-Slavic linguistics on one hand, and Slavic linguistics on the other. In the first, vowel length is consistently distinguished with a macron above the letter, while in the latter it is not clearly indicated. The following table explains these differences:\n\nFor consistency, all discussions of words in Early Slavic and before (the boundary corresponding roughly to the monophthongization of diphthongs, and the Slavic second palatalization) use the common Balto-Slavic notation of vowels. Discussions of Middle and Late Common Slavic, as well as later dialects, use the Slavic notation.\n\n\nFor Middle and Late Common Slavic, the following marks are used to indicate tone and length distinctions on vowels, based on the standard notation in Serbo-Croatian:\n\nThere are unfortunately multiple competing systems used to indicate prosody in different Balto-Slavic languages (see Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Notation for more details). The most important for this article are:\n\nThe following is an overview of the phonemes that are reconstructible for Middle Common Slavic.\n\nMiddle Common Slavic had the following vowel system:\n\nThe columns marked \"central\" and \"back\" may alternatively be interpreted as \"back unrounded\" and \"back rounded\" respectively, but rounding of back vowels was distinctive only between the vowels *y and *u. The other back vowels had optional non-distinctive rounding. Thus:\n\nThe vowels described as \"short\" and \"long\" were simultaneously distinguished by length and quality in Middle Common Slavic. Vowel length evolved as follows:\n\nSome authors avoid the terms \"short\" and \"long\", using \"lax\" and \"tense\" instead.\n\nMiddle Common Slavic had the following consonants:\n\nThe phonetic value (IPA symbol) of most consonants is the same as their traditional spelling. Some notes and exceptions:\n\nIn most dialects, non-distinctive palatalization was probably present on all consonants that occurred before front vowels. When the high front yer *ь/ĭ was lost in many words, it left this palatalization as a \"residue\", which then became distinctive, producing a phonemic distinction between palatalized and non-palatalized alveolars and labials. In the process, the palatal sonorants *ľ *ň *ř merged with alveolar *l *n *r before front vowels, with both becoming *lʲ *nʲ *rʲ. Subsequently, some palatalized consonants lost their palatalization in some environments, merging with their non-palatal counterparts. This happened the least in Russian and the most in Czech. Palatalized consonants never developed in Southwest Slavic (modern Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian), and the merger of *ľ *ň *ř with *l *n *r did not happen before front vowels (although Serbian and Croatian later merged *ř with *r).\n\nAs in its ancestors, Proto-Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European, one syllable of each Common Slavic word was accented (carried more prominence). The placement of the accent was free and thus phonemic; it could occur on any syllable and its placement was inherently part of the word. The accent could also be either mobile or fixed, meaning that inflected forms of a word could have the accent on different syllables depending on the ending, or always on the same syllable.\n\nCommon Slavic vowels also had a pitch accent. In Middle Common Slavic, all accented long vowels, nasal vowels and liquid diphthongs had a distinction between two pitch accents, traditionally called \"acute\" and \"circumflex\" accent. The acute accent was pronounced with rising intonation, while the circumflex accent had a falling intonation. Short vowels (*e *o *ь *ъ) had no pitch distinction, and were always pronounced with falling intonation. Unaccented (unstressed) vowels never had tonal distinctions, but could still have length distinctions. These rules are similar to the restrictions that apply to the pitch accent in Slovene.\n\nIn the Late Common Slavic period, several sound changes occurred. Long vowels bearing the acute (long rising) accent were usually shortened, resulting in a short rising intonation. Some short vowels were lengthened, creating new long falling vowels. A third type of pitch accent developed, known as the \"neoacute\", as a result of sound laws that retracted the accent (moved it to the preceding syllable). This occurred at a time when the Slavic-speaking area was already dialectally differentiated, and usually syllables with the acute and/or circumflex accent were shortened around the same time. Hence it is unclear whether there was ever a period in any dialect when there were three phonemically distinct pitch accents on long vowels. Nevertheless, taken together, these changes significantly altered the distribution of the pitch accents and vowel length, to the point that by the end of the Late Common Slavic period almost any vowel could be short or long, and almost any accented vowel could have falling or rising pitch.\n\nMost syllables in Middle Common Slavic were open. The only closed syllables were those that ended in a liquid (*l or *r), forming liquid diphthongs, and in such syllables, the preceding vowel had to be short. Consonant clusters were permitted, but only at the beginning of a syllable. Such a cluster was syllabified with the cluster entirely in the following syllable, contrary to the syllabification rules that are known to apply to most languages. For example, \"wealth\" was divided into syllables as *bo-ga-tь-stvo, with the whole cluster *-stv- at the beginning of the syllable.\n\nBy the beginning of the Late Common Slavic period, all or nearly all syllables had become open as a result of developments in the liquid diphthongs. Syllables with liquid diphthongs beginning with *o or *e had been converted into open syllables, for example *TorT became *TroT, *TraT or *ToroT in the various daughter languages. The main exception are the Northern Lechitic languages (Kashubian, extinct Slovincian and Polabian) only with lengthening of the syllable and no metathesis (*TarT, e.g. PSl. > Kashubian \"gard\"; > Polabian \"*gard\" > \"gord\"). In West Slavic and South Slavic, liquid diphthongs beginning with *ь or *ъ had likewise been converted into open syllables by converting the following liquid into a syllabic sonorant (palatal or non-palatal according to whether *ь or *ъ preceded respectively). This left no closed syllables at all in these languages. The South Slavic languages, as well as Czech and Slovak, tended to preserve the syllabic sonorants, but in the Lechitic languages (such as Polish), they fell apart again into vowel-consonant or consonant-vowel combinations. In East Slavic, the liquid diphthongs in *ь or *ъ may have likewise become syllabic sonorants, but if so, the change was soon reversed, suggesting that it may never have happened in the first place.\n\nProto-Slavic retained several of the grammatical categories inherited from Proto-Indo-European, especially in nominals (nouns and adjectives). Seven of the eight Indo-European cases had been retained (nominative, accusative, locative, genitive, dative, instrumental, vocative). The ablative had merged with the genitive. It also retained full use of the singular, dual and plural numbers, and still maintained a distinction between masculine, feminine and neuter gender. However, verbs had become much more simplified, but displayed their own unique innovations.\n\nAs a result of the three palatalizations and the fronting of vowels before palatal consonants, both consonant and vowel alternations were frequent in paradigms, as well as in word derivation.\n\nThe following table lists various consonant alternations that occurred in Proto-Slavic, as a result of various suffixes or endings being attached to stems:\n\nVowels were fronted when following a palatal or \"soft\" consonant (*j, any iotated consonant, or a consonant that had been affected by the progressive palatalization). Because of this, most vowels occurred in pairs, depending on the preceding consonant.\n\nMost word stems therefore became classed as either \"soft\" or \"hard\", depending on whether their endings used soft (fronted) vowels or the original hard vowels. Hard stems displayed consonant alternations before endings with front vowels as a result of the two regressive palatalizations and iotation.\n\nAs part of its Indo-European heritage, Proto-Slavic also retained ablaut alternations, although these had been reduced to unproductive relics. The following table lists the combinations (vowel softening may alter the outcomes).\nAlthough qualitative alternations (e-grade versus o-grade versus zero grade) were no longer productive, the Balto-Slavic languages had innovated a new kind of ablaut, in which length was the primary distinction. This created two new alternation patterns, which did not exist in PIE: short *e, *o, *ь, *ъ versus long *ě, *a, *i, *y. This type of alternation may have still been productive in Proto-Slavic, as a way to form imperfective verbs from perfective ones.\n\nMost of the Proto-Indo-European declensional classes were retained. Some, such as u-stems and masculine i-stems, were gradually falling out of use and being replaced by other, more productive classes.\n\nAdjective inflection had become more simplified compared to Proto-Indo-European. Only a single paradigm (in both hard and soft form) existed, descending from the PIE o- and a-stem inflection. I-stem and u-stem adjectives no longer existed. The present participle (from PIE *-nt-) still retained consonant stem endings.\n\nProto-Slavic had developed a distinction between \"indefinite\" and \"definite\" adjective inflection, much like Germanic strong and weak inflection. The definite inflection was used to refer to specific or known entities, similar to the use of the definite article \"the\" in English, while the indefinite inflection was unspecific or referred to unknown or arbitrary entities, like the English indefinite article \"a\". The indefinite inflection was identical to the inflection of o- and a-stem nouns, while the definite inflection was formed by suffixing the relative/anaphoric pronoun to the end of the normal inflectional endings. Both the adjective and the suffixed pronoun were presumably declined as separate words originally, but already within Proto-Slavic they had become contracted and fused to some extent.\n\nThe Proto-Slavic system of verbal inflection was somewhat simplified from the verbal system of Proto-Indo-European (PIE), although it was still rich in tenses, conjugations and verb-forming suffixes.\n\nThe PIE mediopassive voice disappeared entirely except for the isolated form \"vědě\" \"I know\" in Old Church Slavonic (< Late PIE *woid-ai, a perfect mediopassive formation). However, a new analytic mediopassive was formed using the reflexive particle , much as in the Romance languages. The imperative and subjunctive moods disappeared, while the old optative came to be used as the imperative instead.\n\nIn terms of PIE tense/aspect forms, the PIE imperfect was lost or merged with the PIE thematic aorist, and the PIE perfect was lost other than in the stem of the irregular verb \"to know\" (from PIE *woyd-). The aorist was retained, preserving the PIE thematic and sigmatic aorist types (the former is generally termed the \"root aorist\" in Slavic studies), and a new \"productive aorist\" arose from the sigmatic aorist by various analogical changes, e.g. replacing some of the original endings with thematic endings. (A similar development is observed in Greek and Sanskrit. In all three cases, the likely trigger was the phonological reduction of clusters like *-ss-, *-st- that arose when the original athematic endings were attached to the sigmatic *-s- affix.) A new synthetic imperfect was created by attaching a combination of the root and productive aorist endings to a stem suffix *-ěa- or *-aa-, of disputed origin. Various compound tenses were created, e.g. to express the future, conditional, perfect and pluperfect.\n\nThe three numbers (singular, dual and plural) were all maintained, as were the different athematic and thematic endings. Only five athematic verbs exist: \"to know\", \"to be\", \"to give\", \"to eat\" and \"to have\". (*dati has a finite stem *dad-, suggesting derivation by some sort of reduplication.) A new set of \"semi-thematic\" endings were formed by analogy (corresponding to modern conjugation class II), combining the thematic first singular ending with otherwise athematic endings. Proto-Slavic also maintained a large number of non-finite formations, including the infinitive, the supine, a verbal noun, and five participles (present active, present passive, past active, past passive and resultative). In large measure these directly continue PIE formations.\n\nProto-Indo-European had an extensive system of aspectual distinctions (\"present\" vs. \"aorist\" vs. \"perfect\" in traditional terminology), found throughout the system. Proto-Slavic maintained part of this, distinguishing between aorist and imperfect in the past tense. In addition, Proto-Slavic evolved a means of forming lexical aspect (verbs inherently marked with a particular aspect) using various prefixes and suffixes, which was eventually extended into a systematic means of specifying grammatical aspect using pairs of related lexical verbs, each with the same meaning as the other but inherently marked as either imperfective (denoting an ongoing action) or perfective (denoting a completed action). The two sets of verbs interrelate in three primary ways:\n\n\nIn Proto-Slavic and Old Church Slavonic, the old and new aspect systems coexisted, but the new aspect has gradually displaced the old one, and as a result most modern Slavic languages have lost the old imperfect, aorist, and most participles. A major exception, however, is Bulgarian (and also Macedonian to a fair extent), which has maintained both old and new systems and combined them to express fine shades of aspectual meaning. For example, in addition to imperfective imperfect forms and perfective aorist forms, Bulgarian can form a perfective imperfect (usually expressing a repeated series of completed actions considered subordinate to the \"major\" past actions) and an imperfective aorist (for \"major\" past events whose completion is not relevant to the narration).\n\nProto-Slavic also had paired motion verbs (e.g. \"run\", \"walk\", \"swim\", \"fly\", but also \"ride\", \"carry\", \"lead\", \"chase\", etc.). One of the pair expresses \"determinate\" action (motion to a specified place, e.g. \"I walked to my friend's house\") and the other expressing \"indeterminate\" action (motion to and then back, and motion without a specified goal). These pairs are generally related using either the suffixing or suppletive strategies of forming aspectual verbs. Each of the pair is also in fact a pair of perfective vs. imperfective verbs, where the perfective variant often uses a prefix \"*po-\".\n\nMany different PIE verb classes were retained in Proto-Slavic, including (among others) simple thematic presents, presents in *-n- and *-y-, stative verbs in *-ē- (cf. similar verbs in the Latin \"-ēre\" conjugation), factitive verbs in *-ā- (cf. the Latin \"-āre\" conjugation), and o-grade causatives in *-éye-.\n\nThe forms of each verb were based on two basic stems, one for the present and one for the infinitive/past. The present stem was used before endings beginning in a vowel, the infinitive/past stem before endings beginning in a consonant. In Old Church Slavonic grammars, verbs are traditionally divided into four (or five) conjugation classes, depending on the present stem, known as Leskien's verb classes. However, this division ignores the formation of the infinitive stem. The following table shows the main classes of verbs in Proto-Slavic, along with their traditional OCS conjugation classes. The \"present\" column shows the ending of the third person singular present.\n\nOriginally in Balto-Slavic, there were only two accent classes, \"barytonic\" (with fixed stem accent) and \"mobile\" (with mobile accent), corresponding to Slavic classes A and C. There was no class with fixed accent on the ending. Both classes originally had both acute and circumflex stems in them. After the operation of Dybo's law, three basic accent classes emerged for nominals (nouns, adjectives, pronouns, participles):\n\n\nFor this purpose, the \"stem\" includes any morphological suffixes (e.g. a diminutive suffix), but not generally on the inflectional suffix that indicates the word class (e.g. the \"-ā-\" of feminine \"ā\"-stem nouns), which is considered part of the ending. Verbs also had three accent classes (A, B and C) with similar characteristics to the corresponding noun classes. However, the situation is somewhat more complicated due to the large number of verb stem classes and the numerous forms in verbal paradigms.\n\nDue to the way in which the accent classes arose, there are certain restrictions:\n\n\nSome nouns (especially \"jā\"-stem nouns) fit into the class A pattern but have neoacute accent on the stem, which can have either a short or a long syllable. A standard example is \"will\", with neoacute accent on a short syllable. These nouns earlier belonged to class B; as a result, grammars may treat them as belonging either to classes A or B.\n\nDuring the Late Common Slavic period, the class B paradigm became mobile as a result of a complex series of changes that moved the accent leftward in certain circumstances, producing a neoacute accent on the newly stressed syllable. The paradigms below reflect these changes. All languages subsequently simplified the class B paradigms to varying degrees; the older situation can often only be seen in certain nouns in certain languages, or indirectly by way of features such as the Slovene neo-circumflex tone that carry echoes of the time when this tone developed. See History of Proto-Slavic#Accentual developments for more details.\n\nThe following tables are examples of Proto-Slavic noun-class paradigms, based on . There were many changes in accentuation during the Common Slavic period, and there are significant differences in the views of different scholars on how these changes proceeded. As a result, these paradigms do not necessarily reflect a consensus. The view expressed below is that of the Leiden school, following Frederik Kortlandt, whose views are somewhat controversial and not accepted by all scholars.\n\nNote that all class A stems are long. This is because all such stems had Balto-Slavic acute register in the root, which can only occur on long syllables. (Short syllables, and long syllables with Balto-Slavic circumflex register, became class B nouns in Common Slavic.)\n\nThe distribution of short and long vowels in the stems without /j/ reflects the original vowel lengths, prior to the operation of Van Wijk's law, Dybo's law and Stang's law, which led to class B nouns and the differing lengths in /j/ stems.\n\nClass B \"jā\"-stem nouns are not listed here. The combination of Van Wijk's law and Stang's law would have originally produced a complex mobile paradigm in these nouns, different from the mobile paradigm of \"ā\"-stem and other nouns, but this was apparently simplified in Common Slavic times with a consistent neoacute accent on the stem, as if they were class A nouns. The class B \"jo\"-stem nouns were also simplified, but less dramatically, with consistent ending stress in the singular but consistent root stress in the plural, as shown. Class B \"s\"-stem noun are not listed here, because there may not have been any.\n\nThe accent pattern for the strong singular cases (nominative and accusative) and all plural cases is straightforward:\n\nFor the weak singular cases, it can be observed:\n\nNote also that the long-rising versus short-rising accent on ending-accented forms with Middle Common Slavic long vowels reflects original circumflex versus acute register, respectively.\n\nThe same three classes occurred in verbs as well. Middle Common Slavic class B verbs in \"*-ī́tī\" had a neoacute retraction in Late Common Slavic in the present tense; that is, these verbs had original acute accent on the *-i- inflectional suffix in the infinitive, but neoacute accent on the stem in the present tense. This is due to the same process that caused neoacute retraction in class B \"jā\"-stem nouns (see above).\n\nAugust Schleicher wrote a fable in the PIE language he had just reconstructed, which though it has been updated a few times by others still bears his name. Below is a rendering of this fable into Proto-Slavic.\n\n\"Proto-Slavic\"\n\n\"English\"\n\n\"Proto-Slavic\"\n\n\"English\"\n\n\n\n"}

Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring. In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a \"big fight feel\".\n\nThe ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the variations are much more numerous and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.\n\nWhen an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.\n\nIn professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.\n\nEven further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains.\n\nIn a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6210412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6210412", "title": "Selvage", "text": "Selvage\n\nA selvage (US English) or selvedge (British English) is a \"self-finished\" edge of fabric, keeping it from unraveling and fraying. The term \"self-finished\" means that the edge does not require additional finishing work, such as hem or bias tape, to prevent fraying.\n\nIn woven fabric, selvages are the edges that run parallel to the warp (the longitudinal threads that run the entire length of the fabric), and are created by the weft thread looping back at the end of each row. In knitted fabrics, selvages are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither cast on nor bound off. Historically, the term selvage applied only to loom woven fabric, though now can be applied to flat-knitted fabric.\n\nThe terms \"selvage\" and \"selvedge\" are a corruption of \"self-edge\", and have been in use since the 16th century.\n\nIn textile terminology, threads that run the length of the fabric (longitudinally) are warp ends. Threads running laterally from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are weft picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the fabric cloth. Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as . Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.\n\nThere is a slight difference between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial looms originally very closely mimicked handweaving looms, modern industrial looms are very different. A loom with a shuttle, such as most hand weaving looms, will produce a very different selvage from a loom without a shuttle, like some of the modern industrial looms. Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.\n\nSelvages of fabrics formed on weaving machines with shuttles, such as hand looms, are formed by the weft turning at the end of each pick (pass of the weft thread) or every second pick. To prevent fraying, various selvage motions (or \"styles\") are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth. Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e. burnishing, dyeing and washing) but ideally should not detract from the finished cloth via ripples, contractions or waviness.\n\nIn handweaving the selvage is generally the same thickness as the rest of the cloth, and the pattern may or may not continue all the way to the edge, thus the selvage may or may not be patterned. A plain weave selvage is the other option, where the last few threads on either side are woven in plain weave.\n\nIn industry the selvage may be thicker than the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they \"finish\" the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous \"criss-cross\" \"simple\" or \"tabby\" weave, referred to in industry as taffeta weave. Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.\n\nIn the decorative embellishment of garments, especially in decorative pleat or ruffles, a selvage used as a ruffle is \"self-finished\", that is, it does not require additional finishing work such as hem or bias tape to prevent fraying.\n\nVery often fabric near the selvage is unused and discarded, as it may have a different weave pattern, or may lack pile or prints that are present on the rest of the fabric, requiring that the selvage fabric be cut off or hidden in a hem. Since industrial loomed fabric often has selvages that are thicker than the rest of the fabric, the selvage reacts differently. It may shrink or \"pucker\" during laundering and cause the rest of the object made with it to pucker also.\n\nThicker selvages are also more difficult to sew through. Quilters especially tend to cut off the selvage right after washing the fabric and right before cutting it out and sewing it together.\n\nFor garments, however, the selvage can be used as a structural component as there is no need to turn under that edge to prevent fraying if a selvage is used instead. Using the selvage eliminates unnecessary work, thus the garment article can be made faster, the finished garment is less bulky and can be stitched entirely by machine. This is of major benefit for the mass-produced ready-to-wear clothing of modern society. However, it is less used in homemade clothes because of the tendency of the selvage to pucker.\n\nApplying the term \"selvage\" to a hand-knitted object is still relatively new. Most books on fabric define a selvage as the edge of a woven cloth. However, the term is coming into usage for hand-knitted objects. The edges of machine-knitted fabric on the other hand are rarely if ever referred to as selvages.\n\nSelvages in knitting can either bear a special pattern worked into the first and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric. The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge. The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of slipping the first stitch purlwise and purling the last stitch. The slipped garter edge is made by slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last in every row. Other selvages include a garter stitch border one stitch wide, or a combination of the above techniques.\n\nKnitting selvages makes the fabric easier to sew together than it would be otherwise. It also makes it easier to pick up stitches later, and is a good basis for crocheting a further decorative edge.\n\nIn the print industry, selvage is the excess area of a printed or perforated sheet of any material, such as the white border area of a sheet of stamps or the wide margins of an engraving etc.\n"}
{"id": "29025306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29025306", "title": "Shahabuddin Nagari", "text": "Shahabuddin Nagari\n\nShahabuddin Nagari (born 6 October 1955) is a modern poet of Bangladesh, who appeared in the 1970s and gained pre-eminence as a lyricist. According to literary critic Abdul Mannan Syed, \"Shahabuddin Nagari is one of those few powerful poets of 1970s whose mastery of mixing romanticism with instinct is amazing\". As of February 2016, he has published more than seventy five titles to his credit. Nagari is most noted for his songs and works for the children. He was a senior bureaucrat of the government of Bangladesh. In 1971, he actively participated in the liberation war of Bangladesh.\n\nHe married Dr. Aftabun Nahar Maksuda (1958) on 9 September 1983 at the age of 28. His wife's paternal residence is in Shalgaria, Pabna. At that time his wife was working as an Assistant Surgeon in the Chittagong Medical College and Hospital. His wife, having served as a government physician for a long time, was appointed as a Deputy Secretary to the Government of Bangladesh in 2006. At present she is the Additional Secretary to the Government and working in the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock.\n\nNagari started his education in Dinajpur. After studying grade one and two in Dinajpur Bangla School, he got admitted into the Dinajpur Zilla School in grade three. At the middle of his grade five, his father was transferred to Barisal and he shifted with his mother and siblings to his village home. There, after finishing grade five in Shibnagar Primary School, he got admitted into Kansat High School in grade six. After getting promoted to grade eight, he moved with his family to Dhaka. At that time his father was working at the Dhaka DLR & SS Office, Tejgaon, having been transferred from Barisal. After coming to Dhaka, he got admitted into the Rajabazar Nazneen High School. When he was a student of this school, he joined in a movement started in the country against the textbook \"Pakistan : Desh O Krishti\" (en: Pakistan : Country and Culture). From this school he passed SSC in 1972. By that time, since his father was transferred to Chittagong, he also shifted to Chittagong and got admitted into the higher secondary class in the Chittagong College. He passed HSC in 1974 from this college. Although he wanted to study English for Honours, he yielded to the desire of his family and got admitted into the Zoology Department of the Chittagong University in 1974. After completing his BSc (Honours) in 1978, he continued in the same department in the Thesis Group for Masters. The topic of his thesis was \"Rice Field Spiders in Chittagong\". He was the only entomologist who worked on spiders for the first time in Bangladesh (1978–80). He finished his academic education in 1980. For some time he worked as a Research Fellow of the University Grants Commission under the supervision of Professor (Dr.) Shafique Haider Chowdhury. Again his focus of research was spiders.\n\nAt the beginning of 1981, Nagari joined the Zoology Department of Chittagong University as a lecturer. However, inspired by his father, he appeared in the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination which he passed successfully and was appointed as Assistant collector of Customs & Excise. He left the University job and joined the government service in the early December 1983. As a government officer he worked in various offices in different ranks and positions throughout the country under National Board of Revenue ( NBR ) of Ministry of Finance. He has retired from Government Service since March 2016.\n\nFrom the very childhood Shahabuddin Nagari has been involved in writing. When he was a student of his village school, he attempted to write some rhymes. His uncle late Abdul Mannan, then a student of Rajshahi University, would come to the village every week (1966–67) and arrange literary gathering. There, the youngest member Shahabuddin Nagari would read out his rhymes. After moving to Dhaka in 1968, he became a regular subscriber of 'Mukuler Mahfil' (The Daily Azad) and 'Kachi Kachar Ashor' (The Daily Ittefaq). About that time he started to send his compositions for publishing. On 30 July 1969, his first rhyme 'Ami Kobi' (I am a Poet) was published in the 'Mukuler Mahfil'. After fighting the liberation war in 1971, he went back to Chittagong and resumed literary activity. When a son of the famous politician late Jahur Ahmed Chowdhury published a weekly called 'Rajanigandha', he started to contribute there. Then he started writing in the children's section of 'The Daily Michhil'. Besides the newspapers of Chittagong, he started to write for children in almost all the national newspapers and magazines of Dhaka. His first book of rhymes \"Nil Paharer Chhara\" (1978) was published by the-then famous publishing house of Dhaka 'Muktodhara' (The Swadhin Bangla Sahittya Parishad). He published this book by directly contacting late Chittaranjan Saha, the founder of Muktodhara Publications. His second book \"Mahakaler Batighar\" contained articles on literature and was published by Caucus Publishers, Chittagong in 1986. The same year his collection of rhymes \"Mouly Tomar Chhara\" was published by Dolna Prakashani of Chittagong.\n\nNagari is essentially a romantic poet whose focal point of writing is a reflection of his sensitivity. Love constitutes a key component in his poetic thought. Also, a yearning for the past, for social issues and the occasional sadness that encircles human life are also highlighted in his work. The portrayal of Nagari's feelings comes through the exceptionally descriptive. Not only does it paint a vivid picture of his memories, it also allows one to virtually live the experiences Nagari acquired as an adolescent. He writes mostly in free verse.\n\n\"Midnight Locomotive and Other Poems\" is an anthology of eighty six poems by Shahabuddin Nagari, translated into English from original in Bengali by different hands. The culture of Bangladesh and a love for his country is a critical factor in Nagari's writing. This fact is unmistakably etched in the poem, \"Our Dreams\":\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nI touch the river, water fills up and it flows to the brim\nbrim full of water abounds in silvery \"hilsa\"\nIf I look at a barren garden it is full with flowers, rose, marigold, \"hasnahena\"\nIf I dream, Bangladesh also dreams a better future super powers bow down to our dreams.\nmonir\n</poem>\n\n\"The Black Cat and Other Poems\" is a new book of poetry of Shahabuddin Nagari. It has been published by Authorhouse, USA in Sep. 2011. Nagari's passion for woman and nature combined together is amply demonstrated in a number of poems. His passionate love for his beloved is well depicted in the following lines :\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nIn the mid-night doorbell rang in your door\nSoundless movement like soft steps of the cats\nSmell of pheromone can be felt from inside the shoe\nYou didn't understand, put on the shoe, light flickered from it\nSound can be heard of feline steps on marble floor\nI've made that pair of shoes with my skin\nUnder your feet lies my skin.\n</poem>\n\nShahabuddin Nagari is a figure in the cultural sphere of Bangladesh. At once he is a vocalist, songwriter, composer, playwright and a script-writer. Considering his enthusiasm for music, his father got him admitted into the-then Pakistan Cultural Academy situated in Green Road, Dhaka. At that time he was a student of grade nine in the school. There Nagari learned both modern and classical music. He was taught modern song by M.A Hamid (now living in the USA), late Mahmudunnabi and Mohammad Abdul Jabbar. After the liberation in 1971, he learned music from Ustad Syed Anwar Mufti of Bangladesh Betar, Chittagong. In 1977 he appeared for audition and became a listed singer in Bangladesh Television. A long hiatus from the world of music became inevitable due to studies and job. However, in 1994 he returned to music by singing for the BTV drama \"Keu Fere Keu Fere Na\". In 1995, he developed acquaintance with two famous composers of the country, namely, Subal Das and Pranab Ghosh. In 1996, under the supervision of Subal Das his first audio album 'Bishonno Mon' was published and this gave birth to a new Shahabuddin Nagari. By 2004 he has had ten solo albums published. He has sung more than 200 songs. HMV (now RPG) of Kolkata has published his audio CD under the title \"Premer Gaan\" in 1999. In 2003 the song 'Bhalobasha Bhag Kora Jay Na' became widely popular throughout Bangladesh. In 2004 he wrote the story, dialogue, script and gave music direction for the feature film \"Ak Khando Jomi\" produced by Impress Telefilm Limited. The film was based on his poem 'Ak Khando Jomi' included in his book \"Aguner Ful Fote Thonte\".\n\nAfter his debut publication in 1978, a book of rhymes titled Nil Paharer Chhara, Nagari had never looked back. He wrote and published every year. Till date, he has published sixteen volumes of poetry including two in English translation. The count is seventeen for book of rhymes, six for juvenile novels and short stories and four for essays and articles. He has also written one novel and one travelogue. In addition he has compiled and edited with others three volumes of poems and rhymes. His introductory write-up on Bengali rhymes (1947–87) (adopted as the Introduction of Bangladesher Chhara, 1987) is the first research work on Bangladeshi rhymes and recognised as the first reference in our literature. A complete list of his books is given below :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4600562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4600562", "title": "Surface finish", "text": "Surface finish\n\nSurface finish, also known as surface texture or surface topography, is the nature of a surface as defined by the three characteristics of lay, surface roughness, and waviness. It comprises the small, local deviations of a surface from the perfectly flat ideal (a true plane).\n\nSurface texture is one of the important factors that control friction and transfer layer formation during sliding. Considerable efforts have been made to study the influence of surface texture on friction and wear during sliding conditions. Surface textures can be isotropic or anisotropic. Sometimes, stick-slip friction phenomena can be observed during sliding, depending on surface texture.\n\nEach manufacturing process (such as the many kinds of machining) produces a surface texture. The process is usually optimized to ensure that the resulting texture is usable. If necessary, an additional process will be added to modify the initial texture. The latter process may be grinding (abrasive cutting), polishing, lapping, abrasive blasting, honing, electrical discharge machining (EDM), milling, lithography, industrial etching/chemical milling, laser texturing, or other processes.\n\nLay is the direction of the predominant surface pattern, ordinarily determined by the production method used. The term is also used to denote the winding direction of fibers and strands of a rope.\n\nSurface roughness, commonly shortened to \"roughness,\" is a measure of the total spaced surface irregularities. In engineering, this is what is usually meant by \"surface finish.\" A Lower number constitutes less of these irregularities on the surface.\n\nWaviness is the measure of surface irregularities with a spacing greater than that of surface roughness. These irregularities usually occur due to warping, vibrations, or deflection during machining.\n\nSurface finish may be measured in two ways: \"contact\" and \"non-contact\" methods. Contact methods involve dragging a measurement stylus across the surface; these instruments are called profilometers. Non-contact methods include: interferometry, confocal microscopy, focus variation, structured light, electrical capacitance, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and photogrammetry.\n\nIn the United States, surface finish is usually specified using the ASME Y14.36M standard. The other common standard is International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 1302.\n\nMany factors contribute to the surface finish in manufacturing. In forming processes, such as molding or metal forming, surface finish of the die determines the surface finish of the workpiece. In machining, the interaction of the cutting edges and the microstructure of the material being cut both contribute to the final surface finish.\n\nIn general, the cost of manufacturing a surface increases as the surface finish improves. Any given manufacturing process is usually optimized enough to ensure that the resulting texture is usable for the part's intended application. If necessary, an additional process will be added to modify the initial texture. The expense of this additional process must be justified by adding value in some way—principally better function or longer lifespan. Parts that have sliding contact with others may work better or last longer if the roughness is lower. Aesthetic improvement may add value if it improves the saleability of the product.\n\nA practical example is as follows. An aircraft maker contracts with a vendor to make parts. A certain grade of steel is specified for the part because it is strong enough and hard enough for the part's function. The steel is machinable although not free-machining. The vendor decides to mill the parts. The milling can achieve the specified roughness (for example, ≤ 3.2 µm) as long as the machinist uses premium-quality inserts in the end mill and replaces the inserts after every 20 parts (as opposed to cutting hundreds before changing the inserts). There is no need to add a second operation (such as grinding or polishing) after the milling as long as the milling is done well enough (correct inserts, frequent-enough insert changes, and clean coolant). The inserts and coolant cost money, but the costs that grinding or polishing would incur (more time and additional materials) would cost even more than that. Obviating the second operation results in a lower unit cost and thus a lower price. The competition between vendors elevates such details from minor to crucial importance. It was certainly possible to make the parts in a slightly less efficient way (two operations) for a slightly higher price; but only one vendor can get the contract, so the slight difference in efficiency is magnified by competition into the great difference between the prospering and shuttering of firms.\n\nJust as different manufacturing processes produce parts at various tolerances, they are also capable of different roughnesses. Generally, these two characteristics are linked: manufacturing processes that are dimensionally precise create surfaces with low roughness. In other words, if a process can manufacture parts to a narrow dimensional tolerance, the parts will not be very rough.\n\nDue to the abstractness of surface finish parameters, engineers usually use a tool that has a variety of surface roughnesses created using different manufacturing methods.\n"}

{"id": "2607843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2607843", "title": "Transfer window", "text": "Transfer window\n\nThe transfer window is the period during the year in which a football club can transfer players from other playing staff into their playing staff. Such a transfer is completed by registering the player into the new club through FIFA. \"Transfer window\" is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of \"registration period\" as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Player. According to the rules, each national football association decides on the time (such as the dates) of the 'window' but it may not exceed 12 weeks. The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks.\n\nThe transfer window of a given football association governs only international transfers into that football association. International transfers out of an association are always possible to those associations that have an open window. The transfer window of the association that the player is leaving does not have to be open.\n\nThe window was introduced in response to negotiations with the European Commission. The system has been used in many European leagues before being brought into compulsory effect by FIFA during the 2002–03 season. English football was initially behind the plans when they were proposed in the early 1990s, in the hope that it would improve teams' stability and prevent agents from searching for deals all year around, but by the time it was eventually introduced they had to be persuaded that it would work. However, the exact regulations and possible exceptions are established by each competition's governing body rather than by the national football association.\n\nFIFA regulates in general that there shall be two windows, a longer one (max. twelve weeks) in the break between seasons and a shorter one (max. one month) in the middle of a season. The specific periods depend on the league's season cycle and are determined by the national football authorities.\n\nMost major European leagues commence in the second half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. May), resulting in a close season window in the Summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.\n\nThe periods are different when a league runs throughout a single calendar year, as in most Nordic countries due to weather constraints, Major League Soccer due to both weather and competition from other locally popular sports (notably basketball and American football), or as the traditional season in the Southern Hemisphere. The first window generally opens from 1 March until midnight of 30 April, followed by the in-season window from 1 to 31 August.\n\nPremier League clubs in England voted to end the summer window on the Thursday before the start of the season - on August 9 in 2018, instead of August 31. Because FIFA demands the window must be open for 12 weeks, the window will open around May 17, shortly after the final games of the season on May 13. Clubs will be able to sell players until August 31 but not buy replacements after the deadline of August 9.\n\nAlthough, in England, transfers between clubs in the same league can take place as soon as the last competitive fixtures for the season have been played, many transfers will not be completed until 1 July because many players' contracts expire on 30 June. International transfers into the English leagues (including the Premier League) cannot be made until the window has opened on 17 May. Outside the transfer window, a club may still sign players on an emergency basis, usually if they have no goalkeeper available. Special dispensation from their competition's governing body, for example the Premier League, is required. The transfer window restriction does not apply to clubs in or below the National League division.\n\nIf the last day of a transfer window is on a weekend, the deadline can be extended to the following Monday at the request of those involved for business reasons. The first shift of the deadline since its inception took place in summer 2008, when the deadline was extended by 24 hours to fall on Monday 1 September at midnight. The transfer deadline in England was similarly extended to 5 pm 1 September 2009, due to the August Bank Holiday. The German football league announced an extension of the January 2009 deadline to 2 February.\n\nFree agents can be signed by a club at any time during the season, if they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window. A club can request to sign a player on emergency basis, e.g. if several goalkeepers are injured at the same time. Outside the transfer window in England, once seven days have passed following the end of a transfer window, clubs from the English Football League (Regulation 53.3.4) and (provided the player is not registered with a club from any league below the National League division) National League division (Rule 6.6.4) can loan in players i) in the first half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in November and ii) in the second half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in March. An existing loan deal can be made permanent at any time outside the transfer window.\n\nThe day upon which a window closes is known as transfer deadline day, and is usually one of the busiest days of the window, generating a flurry of transfers, often because a number of interdependent transfers are completed resembling a housing chain, generating much media interest.\n\nSteve Coppell, former manager of Reading in England's Premier League, and others have called for the transfer window to be scrapped in favour of the previous system, where deals could be struck throughout the season until the closing weeks. Coppell said that the transfer window breeds panic and encourages \"scurrilous\" transfer activity adding that \"I cannot see the logic in a transfer window. It brings on a fire-sale mentality, causes unrest via the media and means clubs buy too many players\" adding that \"The old system, where if you had a problem you could look at loans or make a short-term purchase, was far better than this system we have at the moment\". Former England Manager Sven-Göran Eriksson has also questioned the value of the transfer window, commenting: \"You do wonder at times if it is right to have a window, it was easier when it was open all the time and perhaps fairer for the players. I am sure much of the business being done on the last day is a little bit desperate and that is not right. I think it was better before, but then I am old\".\n\nIn January 2013 Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger asked for the January transfer window to be limited to two transfers per window and claimed it is \"unfair\" in its current form. He cited Newcastle United transfer activity as an example. The following year, Wenger hit out at Manchester United's £37m purchase of Juan Mata from rivals Chelsea. Wenger argued that the transfer was unfair because United and Chelsea had already played each other twice during the season, but United would still have to play Arsenal, and said that \"the rules should be adapted more for fairness\". Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini backed the sentiment of Wenger, disagreeing that a player \"can go from one team to another team in the same league at this part of the year\" and also said that the winter transfer window was unbalanced in favour of big clubs, saying \"a club with money can take the best players from the other teams\".\n\nFormer Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew questioned why the Premier League transfer window remains open after the start of the season after Arsenal made a bid for midfielder Yohan Cabaye during his time as Newcastle United manager in August 2013.\n\nIn January 2015, FIFPro said that the current transfer window system is \"failing football and its players\", one of the main issues being that players are released from clubs without explanation or compensation.\n\n\n"}

The practice originated from the alt-right blog \"The Right Stuff\"; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of Jews caused their surnames to \"echo throughout history\". The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for online harassment, such as Jewish political journalists critical of Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign.\n\nUse of the notation was brought to mainstream attention by an article posted by Mic in June 2016. The reports also led Google to remove a browser extension meant to automatically place the \"echo\" notation around Jewish names on web pages, and the notation being classified as a form of hate speech by the Anti-Defamation League. In the wake of these actions, some users, both Jews and non-Jews, have intentionally placed their own names within triple parentheses as a sign of solidarity.\n\nPrior to its use in this manner, ((( \"screen name\" ))) had been used in online communities such as AOL to indicate that a user was \"cyberhugging\" the user with the specified screen name.\n\nThe use of the \"echo\" originated from a 2014 episode of \"The Daily Shoah,\" a podcast produced by the alt-right, antisemitic, white nationalist blog \"The Right Stuff.\" The podcast includes a segment known as the \"Merchant Minute\", where Jewish names are spoken with a cartoonish echo effect to single them out. The editors of \"The Right Stuff\" explained that the use of an echo, represented in text using triple parentheses, was an internal meme meant to symbolize an opinion that the actions of Jews in the past cause their names to \"echo throughout history\". From the inside out, each parenthesis represents perceived Jewish involvement in mass media, mass immigration, and global Zionism.\n\nThe triple parentheses have since been used on social networking services such as Twitter by antisemites, alt-righters, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists as a signal to target Jews for harassment. A number of Jewish journalists told the website Mic that after their names were mentioned in echoes, they began to receive messages from trolls containing antisemitic messages, Holocaust photos, and death threats. \"The Jerusalem Post\" reported that the triple parentheses had \"emerged as a weapon in the arsenal of the so-called 'alt-right', an amorphous, primarily online conservative movement that has been becoming more visible and vocal in the midst of Donald Trump's presidential campaign\", and that these tactics were increasingly being used to target Jewish journalists posting content that was critical of the Republican Party candidate. A user who engages in these \"dog-piling\" actions described the echo notation as being like a \"dog whistle\". Search engines typically ignore punctuation contained in a query, meaning that it can be difficult to intentionally locate posts containing this notation.\nIn a June 2016 article detailing the phenomenon, Mic also reported that an extension had been developed for the Google Chrome web browser known as \"Coincidence Detector\", which automatically places the triple parentheses around the names of individuals who \"[have] been involved in certain political movements and media empires\". The extension contains a list of 8,771 names, including common Jewish names and surnames, those of media personalities who have been critical of Trump, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as organizations such as Ben & Jerry's and Kars4Kids.\n\nThe absurdist Twitter user dril sparked controversy in June 2016 after posting a tweet in which he made satirical use of the triple parentheses. Specifically, dril tweeted \"i refuse to consume any product that has been created by, or is claimed to have been created by, the (((Keebler Elves)))\". Journalist Jay Hathaway wrote that most of dril's followers understood the tweet to be an ironic joke exploring the uncertain \"etiquette around this very 2016 expression of bigotry ... Can a non-Jew apply the (((echoes))) to his own name as a show of allyship? Is it OK to use the parentheses in a joke at the white supremacists' expense? There's no clear consensus.\" Regardless, some far-right users of Twitter saw the tweet as a genuine signal of support for antisemitism, and others found the tweet to be in poor taste even as a joke.\n\nOn June 3, 2016, following the publishing of the Mic article, Google pulled the Coincidence Detector extension from the Chrome Web Store, citing a violation of its policies prohibiting “promotions of hate or incitement of violence”. It had been downloaded around 2,500 times before its removal. In the wake of Google’s removal of the extension, some Twitter users, including Jews and non-Jews, intentionally put triple parentheses around their usernames in an act of solidarity. White nationalists, in turn, put inverted echo parentheses - like )))this(((   - around their usernames to indicate their non-Jewish heritage. Author Jeffrey Goldberg from \"The Atlantic\" said that he hoped that Jews could reclaim the symbolism in the same way as some LGBT people had reclaimed the word \"queer\". Jonathan Weisman, an editor at \"The New York Times\", included the triple parentheses in the title of his 2018 book release, \"(((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump\".\n\nTwitter’s policies forbid users from engaging in targeted abuse or harassment of other users; European head of public policy Karen White stated that “hateful conduct has no place on Twitter and we will continue to tackle this issue head on alongside our partners in industry and civil society”. On May 31, 2016, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review valid notifications of illegal hate speech posted on their services within 24 hours.\n\nOn June 6, 2016, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) announced that it had placed the triple parentheses in its database of symbols that it considers hate speech. CEO Jonathan Greenblatt explained that the symbol was “the online equivalent of tagging a building with anti-Semitic graffiti or taunting someone verbally”, and that the ADL was “working with our partners in the tech industry to investigate this phenomenon more deeply”.\n\n"}

These bilingual grammatical notes, dated 1801, were designed no doubt to teach other Greek-speakers Albanian. On page 187, there is a list of names of living things. Page 191 starts the Greek-Albanian phraseologies. On page 217, there is a mini-dictionary with trees names, human body parts, and vegetable names. The alphabet shows in page 219.\nAppendixed to the grammatical notes is also a letter dated 30 October 1801, written in Albanian in Vellara's handwriting from the village of Vokopolë, south of Berat, where the physician had been obliged to follow Veli during the latter's military campaign against Ibrahim of Berat.\n\nThe alphabet comprises 30 letters. It leans towards the Latin script, and less the Greek one, with some special characters for Albanian's particular sounds. Albanian alphabet's \"c\" and \"x\" are covered by a single letter (\"x\" is never found in Vellara's writings). Today's \"ë\" is represented by \"e\", and \"e\" by \"é\". There are no letters for today's digraphs \"ll\", \"rr\", \"zh\", and \"y\". Instead, \"y\" is substituted with \"u\" or \"i\". Today's \"nj\" is represented by a cyrillic letter.\n\nThe first scholar to study the script was the French geographer Conrad Malte-Brun in his \"Universal Geograpraphy\" (1827). He thought that the script is without doubt a ecclesiastical one (and not Vellara's original), which resembles ancient alphabets, and emerged during important milestones that Christianity passed in the area.\n\nVilara's letter signed by him as \"30 Oktomvrit 1801 Vagopolja, mik tëndë Jatroi Vellara\" (October 30th 1801, Vokopolja, your friend Doctor Vellara), shows that the alphabet was known and used by other people at that time.\n<br>During the Albanian National Renaissance, the script was made known to the Albanian circles, first published in 1898 by the \"Albania\" magazine in Brussels.\n\n"}

Linguistically, Yiddish should be divided in distinct Eastern and Western dialects. From Eastern Yiddish, Northeastern dialects were dominant in 20th-century Yiddish culture and academia, while Southern dialects of Yiddish are now the most commonly spoken, preserved by many Hasidic communities.\n\nYiddish dialects are generally grouped into either Western Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish. Western Yiddish developed from the 10th century in Western Europe, in the region which was called Ashkenaz by Jews, while Eastern Yiddish developed its distinctive features in Eastern Europe after the movement of large numbers of Jews from western to central and eastern Europe. \n\nGeneral references to the \"Yiddish language\" without qualification are normally taken to apply to Eastern Yiddish, unless the subject under consideration is Yiddish literature prior to the 19th century, in which case the focus is more likely to be on Western Yiddish.\n\nWestern Yiddish included three dialects: Northwestern (spoken in Northern Germany and the Netherlands), Midwestern (spoken in central Germany), and Southwestern (spoken in southern Germany, France, and neighboring regions extending into Northern Italy). These have a number of clearly distinguished regional varieties, such as Judeo-Alsatian, plus many local subvarieties. \n\nThe language traditionally spoken by the Jews of Alsace is \"Yédisch-Daïtsch\" or Judeo-Alsatian, originally a mixture of German, Hebrew and Aramaic idioms and virtually indistinguishable from mainstream Yiddish. From the 12th century onwards, due among other things to the influence of the nearby Rashi school, French linguistic elements aggregated as well, and from the 18th century onwards, some Polish elements due to immigrants blended into Yédisch-Daïtsch too. \n\nAccording to C. J. Hutterer (1969), \"In western and central Europe the WY dialects must have died out within a short time during the period of reforms [i.e. the movements toward Jewish emancipation] following the Enlightenment.\" Western Yiddish is no longer spoken natively.\n\nEastern Yiddish is split into Northern and Southern dialects. Northeastern Yiddish, also known as \"Litvish\" or \"Lithuanian Yiddish\", was spoken in modern-day Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, and portions of northeastern Poland, northern and eastern Ukraine, and western Russia. The Southern dialects are again subdivided: \"Mideastern\" or \"Polish Yiddish\" was spoken in Poland, western Galicia and much of Hungary, while \"Southeastern\" or \"Ukrainian Yiddish\" was spoken in Volhynia, Podolia, and Bessarabia (Romania). \n\nUkrainian Yiddish was the basis for standard theater Yiddish, while Lithuanian Yiddish was the basis of standard literary and academic Yiddish. \n\nAbout three-quarters of contemporary Yiddish speakers speak Southern Yiddish varieties, the majority speaking Polish Yiddish. Most Hasidic communities use southern dialects, with the exception of Chabad which uses \"Litvish\"; many Haredim in Jerusalem also preserve Litvish Yiddish. \n\nJews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan (the Yiddish appellation is \"dos udmurtishe yidntum\") formed the local dialect until the 1930s and features of Yiddish of migrants \"joined\" into it (in the 1930s and 1940s); as a result up to the 1970s and 1980s the Udmurt dialect (\"Udmurtish\") was divided into two linguistic subgroups: the central subgroup (with centers Izhevsk, Sarapul and Votkinsk) and the southern subgroup (with centers Kambarka, Alnashi (see the rural Jewish community of Alnashsky District), Agryz and Naberezhnye Chelny). \n\nOne of the characteristic features of the Udmurt dialect is a noticeable number of Udmurt and Tatar loan words.\n\nThe primary differences between the contemporary dialects are in the quality of stressed vowels, though there are also differences in morphology, lexicon, and grammar. \n\nNorthern dialects are more conservative in vowel quality, while southern dialects have preserved vowel quantity distinctions.\n\nStressed vowels in the Yiddish dialects may be understood by considering their common origins in the Proto-Yiddish sound system. Yiddish linguistic scholarship uses a system developed by M. Weinreich (1960) to indicate the descendent diaphonemes of the Proto-Yiddish stressed vowels. \n\nEach Proto-Yiddish vowel is given a unique two-digit identifier, and its reflexes use it as a subscript, for example Southeastern \"o\" is the vowel /o/, descended from Proto-Yiddish */a/. The first digit indicates Proto-Yiddish quality (1-=*[a], 2-=*[e], 3-=*[i], 4-=*[o], 5-=*[u]), and the second refers to quantity or diphthongization (-1=short, -2=long, -3=short but lengthened early in the history of Yiddish, -4=diphthong, -5=special length occurring only in Proto-Yiddish vowel 25). \n\nVowels 23, 33, 43 and 53 have the same reflexes as 22, 32, 42 and 52 in all Yiddish dialects, but they developed distinct values in Middle High German; Katz (1978) argues that they should be collapsed with the -2 series, leaving only 13 in the -3 series.\n\nLitvish Yiddish has /ej/ for standard academic and literary /ɔj/ everywhere except for vowel 54.\n\nSome dialects have final consonant devoicing.\n\nMerger of into was common in Litvish Yiddish in previous generations. Known as \"Sabosdiker losn\", it has been stigmatized and deliberately avoided by recent generations of Litvaks.\n\nAs with many other languages with strong literary traditions, there was a more or less constant tendency toward the development of a neutral written form acceptable to the speakers of all dialects. In the early 20th century, for both cultural and political reasons, particular energy was focused on developing a modern Standard Yiddish. This contained elements from all three Eastern dialects but its phonetic attributes were predominantly based on Northeastern pronunciation. A separate article describes the resulting modern Standard Yiddish phonology, without detailing the phonetic variation among the three contributing dialects or the further distinctions among the myriad local varieties that they subsume.\n\nA useful early review of the differences between the three main Eastern dialects is provided by the Yiddish lexicographer Alexander Harkavy in a \"Treatise on Yiddish Reading, Orthography, and Dialectal Variations\" first published in 1898 together with his Yiddish-English Dictionary (Harkavy 1898). A scanned facsimile is available online. The relevant material is presented there under the heading Dialects.\n\nHarkavy, like others of the early standardizers, regards Litvish as the \"leading branch\". That assertion has, however, been questioned by many authors and remains the subject of keen controversy. YIVO, the Jewish Scientific Institute, is often seen as the initiating agent in giving phonetic preference to Litvish, but Harkavy's work predates YIVO's and he was not exclusively describing personal preference. A broad-based study provided in the \"Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry\" (discussed in detail below under the heading Documentation) provides a clearer picture of the more recent YIVO perspective.\n\nThe heart of the debate is the priority given to the dialect with the smallest number of speakers. One of the alternative proposals put forward in the early discussion of standardizing spoken Yiddish was to base it on the pronunciation of the Southeastern dialect, which was the most widely used form in the Yiddish theatre (c.f. \"Bühnendeutsch\", the stage pronunciation, as a common designation for Standard German.)\n\nThere is nothing unusual about heated debate over language planning and reform. Such normative initiatives are, however, frequently based on legislative authority – something which, with the exception of regulation in the Soviet Union, has never applied to Yiddish. It might therefore be expected that the controversy about the development of Standard Yiddish would be particularly intense.\n\nThe acrimony surrounding the extensive role played by YIVO is vividly illustrated by in remarks made by Birnbaum:\n\nRecent criticism of modern Standard Yiddish is expressed by Michael Wex in several passages in Wex 2005. Regardless of any nuance that can be applied to the consideration of these arguments, it may be noted that modern Standard Yiddish is used by very few mother-tongue speakers and is not evoked by the vast bulk of Yiddish literature. It has, however, become a norm in present-day instruction of Yiddish as a foreign language and is therefore firmly established in any discourse about the development of that language.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2000, YIVO published a three-volume \"Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry\", commonly referred to as the \"LCAAJ\". This provides a detailed description of the phonetic elements of what is presented as an Eastern-Western dialect continuum, and mapping their geographic distribution. A more recent extensive phonetic description, also of both Eastern and Western Yiddish, is given by Neil G. Jacobs in Jacobs 2005.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37958692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37958692", "title": "Zareh Vorpuni", "text": "Zareh Vorpuni\n\nZareh Vorpouni (; May 24, 1902 in Ordu, Ottoman Empire - December 1, 1980 in Paris, France) was an Armenian novelist, editor, and writer.\n\nZareh Vorpouni was born Zareh Euksuzian in Ordu, a city in Turkey on the southeastern shore of the Black Sea. He received his early education at the local Movsesian school. His father was killed during the 1915 Armenian genocide, but his mother managed to flee to Sevastopol, Crimea, with her four children, Zareh, Nourhan, Melanoush and Garabed. After a year the family moved to Constantinople, where Zareh attended (1919–22) the Berberian school, and in 1922 they moved to France. They lived in Marseille for two years, then in Paris (1924–30) and Strasbourg (1930-37). From his early days in France Zareh was an avid reader, acquainting himself with European intellectual trends and prominent works of French literature, particularly those of Marcel Proust.\n\nVorpuni belonged to the group of promising young Armenian intellectuals-among them Nigoghos Sarafian, Vazken Shushanian, Shahan Shahnur, and Hrach Zartarian: mostly orphans of the Armenian genocide-who emigrated to France in the early 1920s and produced literature that derived its themes from the social, cultural, moral, and psychological distresses of the emigres and their deep concerns about the eventual loss of their ethnic identity. In Paris he and Bedros Zaroyan jointly edited two short-lived periodicals, \"Nor Havadk\" (New Faith, 1924) and \"Lusapats\" (Daybreak, 1938–39). In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, he was called up for service in the French army. He was captured and held prisoner of war in Germany until the end of the war in 1945. Recollections of his prison days appear in a cycle of ten short stories called \"I Khorots Srdi\" (From the bottom of my heart).\n\nHis first novel, \"Portse\" (The Attempt, 1929) depicts the hard life of an Armenian immigrant family of four plucked out of their native land and transplanted to Marseilles, where they suffer the impact of a totally strange environment. \"Portse\" is the first volume of a quartet, intended by the author to be published under the collective title \"Haladzvadznere\" (The Persecuted). However, the succeeding three volumes - \"Tegnadzun\" (The candidate, 1967), \"Asfalte\" (Asphalt, 1972), and \"Sovoragan or me\" (An ordinary day, 1974) were not published until much later. In \"Tegnadzun\" the main character, Vahakn, embodies the tormented young generation that bore the psychological trauma of the Armenian genocide and remained its victims, leaving a moral legacy to the entire nation. In the other two volumes the author delves more deeply into the psychology of his characters, probing the sources of their anguish. However, almost all his characters, no matter how battered, are firmly determined to survive.\n\nOf primary significance among Vorpuni's writing are his three volumes of short stories, \"Vartsu Senyag\" (Room for rent, 1946), \"Antsrevod orer\" (Rainy days, 1958), and \"Badmvadzkner\" (Stories, 1966). In these tales he bares the hidden emotions and mental anguish of his characters and deplores the disintegration of the Armenian identity as it gradually becomes a burden for the new generation. The subtle presence of the Armenian genocide is felt through these narratives.\n\nIn 1946 Vorpuni visited Soviet Armenia and recorded his impressions in \"Tebi Yergir\", \"Husher Hayreniki n Hayreniken\" (Memories from the homeland, 1947). Another important work is the novel \"Yev yeghev mart\" (And there was man, 1965). The title was later reused for a collection of his works published in Yerevan in 1967 that includes \"Portse,\" \"Yev yeghev mard\", and other short stories.\n\nZareh Vorpouni's first work to appear in English translation is Zareh Vorpouni, \"The Candidate: A Novel\", trans. Jennifer Manoukian and Ishkhan Jinbashian (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2016). In the translator's introduction, Manoukian writes, \"From this footnote has emerged a translation that resists, much like in the spirit of the original. It resists the isolation and insularity of literature written in a minority language; it resists the idea that culture in diaspora is fossilized, stagnant, or in decline; and it resists the notion that Armenians have only their century-old plight to offer the world outside their national cocoon.\"\n"}
