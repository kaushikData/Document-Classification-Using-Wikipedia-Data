{"id": "597785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=597785", "title": "Adverse possession", "text": "Adverse possession\n\nAdverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as \"squatter's rights\", is a legal principle that applies when a person who does not have legal title to a piece of propertyusually land (real property)attempts to claim legal ownership based upon a history of possession or occupation of the land without the permission of its legal owner.\n\nIn general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorized possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, in the English common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property springs up in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as five years to as many as 40 years.\n\nAlthough the elements of an adverse possession action are different in every jurisdiction, a person claiming adverse possession is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period.\n\nPersonal property, traditionally known as \"chattel\", may also be adversely possessed, but owing to the differences in the nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, and favor the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve works of art.\n\nIn Roman law, \"usucapio\" laws allowed someone who was in possession of a good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner didn't show up after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code, adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, adverse possession generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.\n\nParliament passed England's first general statute limiting the right to recover possession of land in 1623. At common law, if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a right to possession was not allowed to allege that the land had come into his possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been \"put into seisin\") at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognized a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute—first to the reign of Henry II, and then to the reign of Richard I. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient. A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the limitation period in most common law jurisdictions.\n\nAt traditional English common law, it was not possible to obtain title to property of the Crown by means of adverse possession. This principle was embodied by the Latin maxim \"nullum tempus occurrit regi\" (\"no time runs against the king\"). In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession. Land with \"registered title\" in some Torrens title systems is also immune, for example, land that has been registered in the Hawaii Land Court system.\n\nIn the common law system of England and its historical colonies, local legislatures—such as Parliament in England or American state legislatures—generally create statutes of limitations that bar the owners from recovering the property after a certain number of years have passed.\n\nAdverse possession is one of the most contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the middle ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.\n\nA more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. Squatting in England has been a way for land to be efficiently utilised, particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the \"adverse possessor\" would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1623, just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims. Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of \"possession\" that was \"adverse\" were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. Different rules are in place for the limitation periods of adverse possession in unregistered land and registered land. However, in the Land Registration Act 2002 adverse possession of registered land became much harder.\n\nThe rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor is entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.\n\nBefore the considerable hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, the time when adverse possession began was when \"possession\" was taken. This had to be more than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But \"possession\" did not require actual occupation. So in \"Powell v McFarlane\", it was held to be \"possession\" when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered \"adverse\" if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in \"BP Properties Ltd v Buckler\", Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.\n\nIn \"JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham\", Mr and Mrs Graham had been let a part of Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting planning permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under ECHR Protocol 1, article 1 to \"peaceful enjoyment of possessions\". The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules. Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired. However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to prevent adverse possession.\n\nFor registered land, adverse possession claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the date the 2002 Act came into force) are governed by section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act of 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the adverse possessor. The adverse possessor can then apply to be the new registered proprietor of the land.\n\nFor registered land, adverse possession claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure. Where land is registered, the adverse possessor may henceforth apply to be registered as owner after 10 years of adverse possession and the Land Registry must give notice to the true owner of this application. This gives the landowner a statutory period of time [65 business days] to object to the adverse possession, object to the application on the ground that there has not actually been the necessary 10 years’ adverse possession, and/or to serve a \"counter-notice\". If a counter-notice is served, then the application fails unless\n\nOtherwise, the squatter becomes the registered proprietor according to the land registry. If the true owner is unable to evict the squatter in the two years following the first [unsuccessful] application, the squatter can apply again after this period and be successful despite the opposition of the owner. The process effectively prevents the removal of a landowner's right to property without his knowledge, while ensuring squatters have a fair way of exercising their rights.\n\nWhere a tenant adversely possesses land, there is a presumption that he is doing so in a way that will benefit his landlord at the end of his term. If the land does not belong to his landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the reversion. If the land does belong to his landlord, it would seem that it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of his term.\n\nSince September 2012, squatting in a residential building is a criminal offence, but this does not prevent title being claimed by reason of adverse possession even if the claimant is committing a criminal offence.\n\nThe party seeking title by adverse possession may be called the \"disseisor\", meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an adverse possession claim may be different in a number of states, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, in a manner that is open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were his own. Some states impose additional requirements. Many of the states have enacted statutes regulating the rules of adverse possession. Some states require a hostility requirement to secure adverse possession. While most states take an objective approach to the hostility requirement, some states require a showing of good faith. Good faith means that claimants’ must demonstrate that they had some basis to believe that they actually owned the property at issue. Four states east of the Mississippi that require good faith in some form are Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe disseisor must physically use the land as a property owner would, in accordance with the type of property, location, and uses (merely walking or hunting on land does not establish actual possession). The actions of the disseisor must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner.\n\nIn \"Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Cone failed to establish actual possession by occasionally visiting the land and hunting on it, because his actions did not change the land from a wild and natural state.\n\nThe disseisor must have entered or used the land without permission from the true owner. The disseisor's motivations may be interpreted by the court in several ways, depending upon state law and precedent:\nSome jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession, as might occur as the result of a surveying error that places the boundary line between properties in the wrong location.\n\nRenters, hunters or others who enter the land with permission are not taking possession that is hostile to the title owner's rights. (mistaken possession in some jurisdictions does not constitute hostility)\n\nThe disseisor must possess the property in a manner that is capable of being seen. That is, the disseisor's use of the property must be sufficiently visible and apparent that it gives notice to the legal owner that someone may assert claim, and must be of such character that would give notice to a reasonable person. If legal owner has actual knowledge of the use, this element is met; it can be also met by fencing, opening or closing gates or an entry to the property, posted signs, crops, buildings, or animals that a diligent owner could be expected to know about.\n\nThe disseisor claiming adverse possession must hold that property continuously for the entire statute of limitations period, and use it as a true owner would for that time.\n\nGenerally, the disseisor's openly hostile possession must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, but breaks in use that are consistent with how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If at any time during the statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.\n\nThe statute of limitations applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another disseisor who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, it may be possible for the second disseisor to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as \"tacking\".\n\nThe disseisor holds the land to the exclusion of the true owner. There may be more than one adverse possessor, taking as tenants in common, so long as the other elements are met. But adverse possession cannot be successfully claimed if, any time during the statutory period, the true owner uses the land for any reason.\n\nIn addition to the basic elements of an adverse possession case, state law may require one or more additional elements to be proved by a person claiming adverse possession. Depending upon the state, additional requirements may include:\n\n\nA disseisor will be committing a civil trespass on the property he has taken and the owner of the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass (\"ejectment\") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.\n\nIn 2008, due to the volume of adverse possession and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession. Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner’s rights. Approximately eight (8) years after the 2008 amendment, on June 30, 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of adverse possession where title had vested prior to 2008. The Court specifically held that title to the adversely possessed property vested when the plaintiff \"[S]atisfie[d] the requirement of the statute in effect at the relevant time.\" In other words, if title had vested at some time \"after\" the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have to satisfy the adverse possession standards amended by the New York State Legislature in 2008; however, if title vested at some time \"before\" the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have lawfully acquired title to the disputed area by satisfying the pre-amendment standard for adverse possession. \"Hudson Square Hotel\" also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the air rights are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) \"where\" (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) \"what\" property rights are acquired as a result of title to the ground floor area (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff. In \"Hudson Square Hotel\" the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building. This argument was motivated, in part, by the fact that the zoning laws at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six (6) times the square footage of the ground floor area. For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of buildable square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession. The Court clarified, \"It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor.\" In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land. The Court also held, \"With title to land come air rights.\" In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land.\n\nIn other jurisdictions, the disseisor acquires merely an equitable title; the landowner is considered to be a trustee of the property for the disseisor.\n\nAdverse possession extends only to the property actually possessed. If the original owner had a title to a greater area (or volume) of property, the disseisor does not obtain all of it. The exception to this is when the disseisor enters the land under a color of title to an entire parcel, his continuous and actual possession of a small part of that parcel will perfect his title to the entire parcel defined in his color of title. Thus a disseisor need not build a dwelling on, or farm on, every portion of a large tract in order to prove possession, as long as his title does correctly describe the entire parcel.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a person who has successfully obtained title to property by adverse possession may (optionally) bring an action in land court to \"quiet title\" of record in his name on some or all of the former owner's property. Such action will make it simpler to convey the interest to others in a definitive manner, and also serves as notice that there is a new \"owner of record\", which may be a prerequisite to benefits such as equity loans or judicial standing as an abutter. Even if such action is not taken, the title is legally considered to belong to the new titleholder, with most of the benefits and duties, including paying property taxes to avoid losing title to the tax collector. The effects of having a stranger to the title paying taxes on property may vary from one jurisdiction to another. (Many jurisdictions have accepted tax payment for the same parcel from two different parties without raising an objection or notifying either party that the other had also paid.)\n\nAdverse possession does not typically work against property owned by the public.\n\nThe process of adverse possession would require a thorough analysis if private property is taken by eminent domain, after which control is given to a private corporation (such as a railroad), and then abandoned.\n\nWhere land is registered under a Torrens title registration system or similar, special rules apply. It may be that the land cannot be affected by adverse possession (as was the case in England and Wales from 1875 to 1926, and as is still the case in the state of Minnesota) or that special rules apply.\n\nAdverse possession may also apply to territorial rights. In the United States, Georgia lost an island in the Savannah River to South Carolina in 1990, when South Carolina had used fill from dredging to attach the island to its own shore. Since Georgia knew of this yet did nothing about it, the U.S. Supreme Court (which has original jurisdiction in such matters) granted this land to South Carolina, although the Treaty of Beaufort (1787) explicitly specified that the river's islands belonged to Georgia.\n\nMost cases of adverse possession deal with boundary line disputes between two parties who hold clear title to their property. The term \"squatter's rights\" has no precise and fixed legal meaning. In some jurisdictions the term refers to temporary rights available to squatters that prevent them, in some circumstances, from being removed from property without due process. For example, in England and Wales reference is usually to section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. In the United States, no ownership rights are created by mere possession, and a squatter may only take possession through adverse possession if the squatter can prove all elements of an adverse possession claim for the jurisdiction in which the property is located.\n\nAs with any adverse possession claim, if a squatter abandons the property for a period, or if the rightful owner effectively removes the squatter's access even temporarily during the statutory period, or gives his permission, the \"clock\" usually stops. For example, if the required period in a given jurisdiction is twenty years and the squatter is removed after only 15 years, the squatter loses the benefit of that 15-year possession (i.e., the clock is reset at zero). If that squatter later retakes possession of the property, that squatter must, to acquire title, remain on the property for a full 20 years after the date on which the squatter retook possession. In this example, the squatter would have held the property for a total of 35 years (the original 15 years plus the later 20 years) to acquire title.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, one squatter may or may not pass along continuous possession to another squatter, known as \"tacking\". Tacking is defined as \"The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period.\" There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and Privity of Estate. One of the three types of privity is required in order for one adverse possessor to \"tack\" their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating \"color of title.\" A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary \"continuous and hostile\" element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.\n\n'Squatting' became a criminal offence in England/Wales under Section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.\n\nThis section also inserted an immediate power of entry to the premises into Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\n\nIn the United States, the concept of squatter's rights are generally used to refer to a specific form of adverse possession where the disseisor holds no title to any properties adjoining the property under dispute. In most jurisdictions of the United States, few squatters can meet the legal requirements for adverse possession. \n\nAdverse possession is in some ways similar to homesteading. Like the disseisor, the homesteader may gain title to property by using the land and fulfilling certain other conditions. In homesteading, however, the possession of the property is not hostile; the land is either considered to have no legal owner or is owned by the government. The government allows the homesteader to use the land with the expectation that the homesteader who fulfills the requirements necessary for the homestead will gain title to the property.\n\nThe principles of homesteading and squatter's rights embody the most basic concept of property and ownership, which can be summarized by the adage \"possession is nine-tenths of the law,\" meaning the person who uses the property effectively owns it. Likewise, the adage, \"use it or lose it,\" applies. The principles of homesteading and squatter's rights predate formal property laws; to a large degree, modern property law formalizes and expands these simple ideas.\n\nThe principle of homesteading is that if no one is using or possessing property, the first person to claim it and use it consistently over a specified period owns the property. Squatter's rights embodies the idea that if one property owner neglects property and fails to use it, and a second person starts to tend and use the property, then after a certain period the first person's claim to the property is lost and ownership transfers to the second person, who is actually using the property.\n\nThe legal principle of homesteading, then, is a formalization of the homestead principle in the same way that the right of adverse possession is a formalization of the pre-existing principle of squatter's rights.\n\nThe essential ideas behind the principles of homesteading and squatter's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or possession. In modern law, homesteading and the right of adverse possession refer exclusively to real property. In the realm of personal property, the same impulse is summarized by the adage \"finders/keepers\" and is formalized by laws and conventions concerning abandoned property.\n\nSome legal scholars have proposed the extension of the concept of adverse possession to intellectual property law, in particular to reconcile intellectual property and antitrust law or to unify copyright law and property law.\n\nSome jurisdictions merge the concept of adverse possession with that of prescription, so that adverse possession may be used to gain various incorporeal rights to land as well as land itself.\n\nUnder this theory, adverse possession grants only those rights in the disseized property that are 'taken' by the disseisor. For example, a disseisor might choose to take an easement rather than the entire fee title to the property. In this manner, it is possible to disseize an easement, under the legal doctrine of prescription. This must also be done openly but need not be exclusive. Prescription is governed by different statutory and common law time limits to adverse possession. It is common practice in cities such as New York, where builders often leave sidewalk space or plazas in front of their buildings to meet zoning requirements, to close public areas they own periodically to prevent the creation of a permanent easement that would cloud their exclusive property rights. For the same reason, city sidewalks may have embedded markers along the property line around a plaza or open area announcing \"This Space Not Dedicated\" to indicate that although the public may use the space within the markers, it is still private property.\n\nIf a property owner interferes with an easement upon his property in a manner that satisfies the requirements for adverse prescription (e.g. locking the gates to a commonly used area, and nobody does anything about it), he will successfully extinguish the easement. This is another reason to quiet title after a successful adverse possession or adverse prescription: it clarifies the record of who should take action to preserve the adverse title or easement while evidence is still fresh.\n\nFor example, given a deeded easement to use someone else's driveway to reach a garage, if a fence or permanently locked gate prevents the use, nothing is done to remove and circumvent the obstacle, and the statutory period expires, then the easement ceases to have any legal force, although the deed held by the fee-simple owner stated that the owner's interest was subject to the easement.\n\nStrictly speaking, prescription works in a different way to adverse possession. Adverse possession is concerned with the extinction of the title of the original owner by a rule of limitation of actions. Prescription, on the other hand, is concerned with acquiring a right that did not previously exist.\n\nIn the law of England and Wales adverse possession and prescription are treated as being entirely different doctrines. The former being entirely statutory deriving from the Limitation Act 1980, the latter being possible under purely common law principles.\n\nSome non-common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, Louisiana has a legal doctrine called acquisitive prescription, which is derived from French law.\n\nAdverse possession exists to cure potential or actual defects in real estate titles by putting a statute of limitations on possible litigation over ownership and possession. Because of the doctrine of adverse possession, a landowner can be secure in title to his land. Otherwise, long-lost heirs of any former owner, possessor or lien holder of centuries past could come forward with a legal claim on the property. The doctrine of adverse possession prevents this. This means the law may be used to reward a person who possesses the land of another for a requisite period of time. Failure of a landowner to exercise and defend his property rights for a certain period may result in the permanent loss of the landowner's interest in the property. In economic terms, adverse possession encourages and rewards productive use of land.\n\n"}
{"id": "24205238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24205238", "title": "Albertson conjecture", "text": "Albertson conjecture\n\nIn combinatorial mathematics, the Albertson conjecture is an unproven relationship between the crossing number and the chromatic number of a graph. It is named after Michael O. Albertson, a professor at Smith College, who stated it as a conjecture in 2007; it is one of his many conjectures in graph coloring theory. The conjecture states that, among all graphs requiring \"n\" colors, the complete graph \"K\" is the one with the smallest crossing number.\nEquivalently, if a graph can be drawn with fewer crossings than \"K\", then, according to the conjecture, it may be colored with fewer than \"n\" colors.\n\nIt is straightforward to show that graphs with bounded crossing number have bounded chromatic number: one may assign distinct colors to the endpoints of all crossing edges and then 4-color the remaining planar graph. Albertson's conjecture replaces this qualitative relationship between crossing number and coloring by a more precise quantitative relationship. Specifically,\na different conjecture of states that the crossing number of the complete graph \"K\" is\nIt is known how to draw complete graphs with this many crossings, by placing the vertices in two concentric circles; what is unknown is whether there exists a better drawing with fewer crossings. Therefore, a strengthened formulation of the Albertson conjecture is that every \"n\"-chromatic graph has crossing number at least as large as the right hand side of this formula. This strengthened conjecture would be true if and only if both Guy's conjecture and the Albertson conjecture are true.\n\nA weaker form of the conjecture, proven by M. Schaefer, states that every graph with chromatic number \"n\" has crossing number Ω(\"n\"), or equivalently that every graph with crossing number \"k\" has chromatic number \"O\"(\"k\"). published a simple proof of these bounds, by combining the fact that every minimal \"n\"-chromatic graph has minimum degree at least \"n\" − 1 (else one could (\"n\" − 1)-color it by removing a low-degree vertex, coloring the remaining graph, and use any available color for the removed vertex) together with the crossing number inequality according to which every graph \"G\" = (\"V\",\"E\") with |\"E\"|/|\"V\"| ≥ 4 has crossing number Ω(|\"E\"|/|\"V\"|). Using the same reasoning, they show that a counterexample to Albertson's conjecture for the chromatic number \"n\" (if it exists) must have fewer than 4\"n\" vertices.\n\nThe Albertson conjecture is vacuously true for \"n\" ≤ 4: \"K\" has crossing number zero, and all graphs have crossing number greater than or equal to zero. The case \"n\" = 5 of Albertson's conjecture is equivalent to the four color theorem, that any planar graph can be colored with four or fewer colors, for the only graphs requiring fewer crossings than the one crossing of \"K\" are the planar graphs, and the conjecture implies that these should all be at most 4-chromatic. Through the efforts of several groups of authors the conjecture is now known to hold for all \"n\" ≤ 18. For every integer c ≥ 6, Luiz and Richter presented a family of \"(c+1)\"-colour-critical graphs that do not contain a subdivision of the complete graph \"K\" but have crossing number at least that of \"K\".\n\nThere is also a connection to the Hadwiger conjecture, an important open problem in combinatorics concerning the relationship between chromatic number and the existence of large cliques as minors in a graph. A variant of the Hadwiger conjecture, stated by György Hajós, is that every \"n\"-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of \"K\"; if this were true, the Albertson conjecture would follow, because the crossing number of the whole graph is at least as large as the crossing number of any of its subdivisions. However, counterexamples to the Hajós conjecture are now known, so this connection does not provide an avenue for proof of the Albertson conjecture.\n\n"}

{"id": "222677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222677", "title": "Animacy", "text": "Animacy\n\nAnimacy (antonym: inanimacy) is a grammatical and semantic feature, existing in some languages, expressing how sentient or alive the referent of a noun is. Widely expressed, animacy is one of the most elementary principles in languages around the globe, and is a distinction acquired as early as six months of age.\n\nConcepts of animacy constantly vary beyond a simple animate and inanimate binary; many languages function off of a hierarchical General Animacy Scale that ranks animacy as a \"matter of gradience.\" Typically (with some variation of order and of where the cutoff for animacy occurs), the scale ranks humans above animals, then plants, natural forces, concrete objects, and abstract objects, in that order. In referring to humans, this scale contains a hierarchy of persons, ranking the first and second person pronouns above the third person, partly a product of empathy, involving the speaker and interlocutor. Additionally, the hierarchy tends to place singular persons over plural (as seen in the heavy difference between \"I regret to inform you\" and \"We regret to inform you\"), but it carries exceptions, such as thousands of people signing a petition.\n\nThe distinction between \"he\", \"she\", and other personal pronouns, on one hand, and \"it\", on the other hand is a distinction in animacy in English and in many Indo-European languages. The same can be said about distinction between \"who\" and \"what\". Some languages, such as Turkish and Spoken Finnish do not distinguish between \"s/he\" and \"it\". In Finnish, there is a distinction in animacy between \"hän\" \"he/she\" and \"se\" \"it\", but in Spoken Finnish, \"se\" can mean \"he/she\". English shows a similar lack of distinction between \"they\" animate and \"they\" inanimate in the plural but, as shown above, it has such a distinction in the singular.\n\nThere is another example of how animacy plays some role in English. For example, the higher animacy a referent has, the less preferable it is to use the preposition \"of\" for possession (that can also be interpreted in terms of alienable or inalienable possession):\n\nExamples of languages in which an animacy hierarchy is important include the Totonac language in Mexico and the Southern Athabaskan languages (such as Western Apache and Navajo) whose animacy hierarchy has been the subject of intense study. The Tamil language has a noun classification based on animacy.\n\nBecause of the similarities in morphology of feminine and masculine grammatical gender inflections in Indo-European languages, there is a theory that in an early stage, the Proto-Indo-European language had only two grammatical genders: \"animate\" and \"inanimate/neuter\"; the most obvious difference being that inanimate/neuter nouns used the same form for the nominative, vocative, and accusative noun cases. The distinction was preserved in Anatolian languages like Hittite, all of which are now extinct.\n\nThe animate gender would then later, after the separation of the Anatolian languages, have developed into the feminine and masculine genders. The plural of neuter/inanimate nouns is believed to have had the same ending as collective nouns in the singular, and some words with the collective noun ending in singular were later to become words with the feminine gender. Traces can be found in Ancient Greek in which the singular form of verbs was used when they referred to neuter words in plural. In many Indo-European languages, such as Latin and the Slavic languages, the plural ending of many neuter words in the merged nominative–accusative–vocative corresponds to the feminine singular nominative form.\n\nLike most other Athabaskan languages, Southern Athabaskan languages show various levels of animacy in their grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, Navajo nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young & Morgan 1987: 65-66):\n\nHuman > Infant/Big Animal > Medium-sized Animal > Small Animal > Natural Force > Abstraction\n\nGenerally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, either noun can occur in the first position. Both sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The \"yi-\" prefix on the verb indicates that the first noun is the subject and \"bi-\" indicates that the second noun is the subject.\n\nSentence (3), however, sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:\n\nIn order to express that idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that the word order, per se, is not the important factor. Instead, the verb construction usually interpreted as the passive voice (eg. \"the girl was pecked by the bird\") instead indicates that the more animate noun allowed the less animate noun to perform the action (eg. \"the girl let herself be pecked by the bird\"). The idea is that things ranked higher in animacy are presumed to be in control of the situation, and that the less-animate thing can only act if the more-animate thing permits it.\n\nAlthough nouns in Japanese are not marked for animacy, it has two existential/possessive verbs; one for implicitly animate nouns (usually humans and animals) and one for implicitly inanimate nouns (often nonliving objects and plants). The verb \"iru\" (いる, also written 居る) is used to show the existence or possession of an animate noun. The verb \"aru\" (ある, sometimes written 在る when existential or 有る when possessive) is used to show the existence or possession of an inanimate noun.\n\nAn animate noun, there 'cat,' is marked as the subject of the verb with the subject particle \"ga\" (が), but no topic or location is marked. That implies the noun is indefinite and merely exists.\n\nIn the second example, a topic is introduced, in this case \"I\", with the topic particle \"wa\" (は). The animate noun is again marked with a subject particle, and no location is denoted. That implies that the topic owns or is holding onto the noun.\n\nIn the third example, the noun is marked as the topic (and by default functions as the subject of the verb) while a location, there the top of a chair, is marked with the location particle \"ni\" (に). That implies that the noun is a definite noun and is at the specified location.\n\nIn all those cases, if the noun is not animate, such as a stone, instead of a cat, the verb \"iru\" must be replaced with the verb \"aru\" (ある or 有る[possessive]/在る[existential,locative]).\n\nIn some cases in which 'natural' animacy is ambiguous, whether a noun is animate or not is the decision of the speaker, as in the case of a robot, which could be correlated with the animate verb (to signify sentience or anthropomorphism) or with the inanimate verb (to emphasise that is a nonliving thing).\n\nThe Ryukyuan languages, spoken in the Ryukyu Islands agree in animacy in their case systems.\n\nRussian has a somewhat complex hierarchy of animacy in which syntactically animate nouns may include both animate and inanimate objects (like mushrooms and dances). Overall, the border between animate and inanimate places humans and animals in the former and plants, etc., in the latter, thus basing itself more so on sentience than life.\n\nAnimacy functions as a subgender through which noun cases intersect in a phenomenon called syncretism, which here can be either nominative-accusative or genitive-accusative. Inanimate nouns have accusative forms that take on the same forms as their nominative, with animate nouns marked by having their genitive forms resemble the nominative.\nFor example, syncretism conditioned by referential animacy results in forms like the following:\n\n\nThat syncretism also occurs when restricted by declension class, resulting in syncretism in multiple pronominal forms, such as the reflexive pronoun \"sebja\", personal pronouns, and the indefinite interrogative and relative pronoun \"kto\".\n\nIn their plural forms, nouns of all genders may distinguish the categories of animate vs. inanimate by that syncretism, but only masculine nouns of the first declension (and their modifiers) show it in the singular (Frarie 1992:12), and other declensions and genders of nouns \"restrict (morphological) expression of animacy to the plural\" (Frarie 1992:47).\nElsewhere, animacy is displayed syntactically, such as in endings of modifiers for masc nouns of the second declension.\n\nWhile animacy is viewed as primarily semantic when approached diachronically, a synchronic view suggests animacy as a sublevel of gender. Syntactic gender is defined through patterns in agreement, not necessarily semantic value. For example, Russian has \"common gender\" nouns that refer to traditionally masculine roles but act as syntactically feminine.\n\nAnimacy occurs as a subgender of nouns and modifiers (and pronouns only when adjectival) and is primarily reflected in modifier-head agreement (as opposed to subject-predicate agreement).\n\nSome consider the system to be based on marking inanimacy in which case the gen-acc distinguishes a \"non-inanimate\" subgender of nouns and modifiers, and others claim that ultimately it is indeed animacy that is marked.\n\nIn spoken Sinhala, there are two existential/possessive verbs: හිටිනවා \"hiţinawā\" / ඉන්නවා \"innawā\" are used only for animate nouns (humans and animals), and තියෙනවා \"tiyenawā\" for inanimate nouns (like nonliving objects, plants, things):\n\nIn Spanish, the preposition \"a\" (meaning \"to\" or \"at\") has gained a second role as a marker of concrete animate direct objects:\nThe usage is standard and is found around the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nSpanish personal pronouns are generally omitted if the subject of the sentence, but when they are explicitly stated, they are used only with people or humanized animals or things. The inanimate subject pronoun in Spanish is \"ello\", like \"it\" in English.\n\nSpanish direct object pronouns (\"me, te, lo, la, se, nos, os, los, las\") do not differentiate between animate and inanimate entities, and only the third persons have a gender distinction. Thus, for example, the third person singular feminine pronoun, \"la\", could refer to a woman, an animal (like \"mariposa\", butterfly), or an object (like \"casa\", house), if their genders are feminine.\n\nWith pronouns, there is a tendency to use \"le\" (which is usually an indirect object pronoun, meaning \"to him/her\") as a direct-object pronoun, at the expense of the direct-object pronouns \"lo/la\", if the referent is animate. That tendency is especially strong if (a) the pronoun is being used as a special second-person pronoun of respect, (b) the referent is male, (c) certain verbs are used, (d) the subject of the verb happens to be inanimate. There is great regional variation as regards that usage.\n\nIn Classical and Modern Standard Arabic and some other varieties of Arabic, animacy has a limited application in the agreement of plural and dual nouns with verbs and adjectives. Verbs follow nouns in plural agreement only when the verb comes after the subject. When a verb comes before an explicit subject, the verb is always singular. Also, only animate plural and dual nouns take plural agreement; inanimate plural and dual nouns are always analyzed as singular feminine for the purpose of agreement. Thus, Arabic (\"Al-muhandisūn yuṭīrūn 'ilā 'Almāniyā\", \"The engineers fly to Germany\") is masculine plural agreement, but (\"Al-ṭā'irāt tuṭīr 'ilā 'Almāniyā\", \"The planes fly to Germany\") is feminine singular. Compare them to (\"Tuṭīr al-muhandisat 'ilā 'Almāniyā\") and (\"Al-muhandisāt yuṭīrna 'ilā 'Almāniyā\") for \"The [female] engineers fly to Germany.\"\n\nIn general, Arabic divides animacy between (thinking, or rational) and (unthinking, or irrational). Animals fall in the latter category, but their status may change depending on the usage, especially with personification. Different writers might use (\"Al-ghurbān yuṭīrūn 'ilā 'Almāniyā\") or (\"Al-ghurbān tuṭīr 'ilā 'Almāniyā\") for \"The ravens fly to Germany.\"\n\nAnimacy can also condition the nature of the morphologies of split-ergative languages. In such languages, participants more animate are more likely to be the agent of the verb, and therefore are marked in an accusative pattern: unmarked in the agent role and marked in the patient or oblique role.\n\nLikewise, less animate participants are inherently more patient-like, and take ergative marking: unmarked when in the patient role and marked when in the agent role. The hierarchy of animacy generally, but not always, is ordered:\n\nThe location of the split (the line which divides the inherently agentive participants from the inherently patientive participants) varies from language to language, and, in many cases, the two classes overlap, with a class of nouns near the middle of the hierarchy being marked for both the agent and patient roles.\n\nIn a direct–inverse language clauses with transitive verbs can be expressed with either a direct or an inverse construction. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in salience or animacy. The inverse construction is used when the \"notional object\" outranks the \"notional subject\".\n\nA noun essentially requires the traits of animacy in order to receive the role of Actor and Experiencer. Additionally, the Agent role is generally assigned to the NP with highest ranking in the animacy hierarchy – ultimately, only animate beings can function as true agents. Similarly, languages universally tend to place animate nouns earlier in the sentence than inanimate nouns.\nAnimacy is a key component of agency – combined with other factors like “awareness of action”. Agency and animacy are intrinsically linked – with each as a “conceptual property” of the other.\n\n\n"}

It survives today as a separate religious dialect within some parts of the Haredi community, even alongside modern Hebrew in Israel, although its use amongst non-Israeli Ashkenazi Jews has greatly diminished.\n\nAs it is used parallel with modern Hebrew, its phonological differences are clearly recognized:\n\nThere are considerable differences between the Lithuanian, Polish (also known as Galician), Hungarian, and German pronunciations. \n\nIn addition to geographical differences, there are differences in register between the \"natural\" pronunciation in general use and the more prescriptive rules advocated by some rabbis and grammarians, particularly for use in reading the Torah. For example:\n\n\nThere are several theories on the origins of the different Hebrew reading traditions. The basic division is between those who believe that the differences arose in medieval Europe and those who believe that they reflect older differences between the pronunciations of Hebrew and Aramaic current in different parts of the Fertile Crescent, that is to say Judaea, Galilee, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and Babylonia proper. Within the first group of theories, Zimmels believed that the Ashkenazi pronunciation arose in late medieval Europe and that the pronunciation prevailing in France and Germany in the time of the Tosafists was similar to the Sephardic. His evidence for this was the fact that Asher ben Jehiel, a German who became chief rabbi of Toledo, never refers to any difference of pronunciation, though he is normally very sensitive to differences between the two communities.\n\nThe difficulty with the latter grouping of theories is that we do not know for certain what the pronunciations of these countries actually were and how far they differed. Since the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 (or before) the Sephardic pronunciation of the vowels became standard in all these countries, ironing out any differences that previously existed. This makes it harder to adjudicate between the different theories on the relationship between today's pronunciation systems and those of ancient times.\n\nLeopold Zunz believed that the Ashkenazi pronunciation was derived from that of Palestine in Geonic times (7th–11th centuries CE), while the Sephardi pronunciation was derived from that of Babylonia. This theory was supported by the fact that, in some respects, Ashkenazi Hebrew resembles the western dialect of Syriac while Sephardi Hebrew resembles the eastern, e.g. Eastern Syriac \"Peshitta\" as against Western Syriac \"Peshito\". Ashkenazi Hebrew in its written form also resembles Palestinian Hebrew in its tendency to \"male\" spellings (see Mater lectionis).\n\nOthers, including Abraham Zevi Idelsohn, believed that the distinction is more ancient, and represents the distinction between the Judaean and Galilean dialects of Hebrew in Mishnaic times (1st−2nd centuries CE), with the Sephardi pronunciation being derived from Judaean and the Ashkenazi from Galilean. This theory is supported by the fact that Ashkenazi Hebrew, like Samaritan Hebrew, has lost the distinct sounds of many of the guttural letters, while there are references in the Talmud to this as a feature of Galilean speech. Idelsohn ascribes the Ashkenazi (and, on his theory, Galilean) pronunciation of kamatz gadol as [o] to the influence of Phoenician: see Canaanite shift.\n\nIn the time of the Masoretes (8th−10th centuries CE) there were three distinct notations for denoting vowels and other details of pronunciation in Biblical and liturgical texts. One was the Babylonian; another was the Palestinian; the third was the Tiberian, which eventually superseded the other two and is still in use today.\n\nIn certain respects the Ashkenazi pronunciation provides a better fit to the Tiberian notation than do the other reading traditions: for example, it distinguishes between \"pataḥ\" and \"qamaṣ gadol\", and between \"segol\" and \"șere\", and does not make the \"qamaṣ\" symbol do duty for two different sounds. A distinctive variant of the Tiberian notation was in fact used by Ashkenazim, before being superseded by the standard version. On the other hand, it is unlikely that in the Tiberian system \"ṣere\" and \"ḥolam\" were diphthongs as they are in Ashkenazi Hebrew: they are more likely to have been closed vowels. (On the other hand, these vowels sometimes correspond to diphthongs in Arabic.) For more details of the reconstructed pronunciation underlying the Tiberian notation, see Tiberian vocalization.\n\nIn other respects Ashkenazi Hebrew resembles Yemenite Hebrew, which appears to be related to the Babylonian notation. Shared features include the pronunciation of \"qamaṣ gadol\" as and, in the case of Lithuanian Jews and some but not all Yemenites, of \"ḥolam\" as . These features are not found in the Hebrew pronunciation of today's Iraqi Jews, which as explained has been overlaid by Sephardi Hebrew, but are found in some of the Judeo-Aramaic languages of northern Iraq and in some dialects of Syriac.\n\nAnother possibility is that these features were found within an isogloss that included Syria, northern Palestine and northern Mesopotamia but not Judaea or Babylonia proper, and did not coincide exactly with the use of any one notation (and the \"ḥolam\" = shift may have applied to a more restricted area than the \"qamaṣ gadol\" = shift). The Yemenite pronunciation would, on this hypothesis, be derived from that of northern Mesopotamia and the Ashkenazi pronunciation from that of northern Palestine. The Sephardic pronunciation appears to be derived from that of Judaea, as evidenced by its fit to the Palestinian notation.\n\nAccording to the Maharal of Prague and many other scholars, including Rabbi Yaakov Emden, one of the leading Hebrew grammarians of all time, Ashkenazi Hebrew is the most accurate pronunciation of Hebrew preserved. The reason given is that it preserves distinctions, such as between \"pataḥ\" and \"qamaṣ\", which are not reflected in the Sephardic and other dialects. Only in the Ashkenazi pronunciation are all seven \"nequdot\" (the Hebrew vowels of the ancient Tiberian tradition) distinguished: Yemenite, which comes close, does not distinguish \"pataḥ\" from \"segol\".\n\nOn the other hand, this view does not appear to be supported by any non-Ashkenazi scholars. Some scholars argue in favour of the greater authenticity of the Yemenite pronunciation on the ground that it is the only Hebrew pronunciation to distinguish all the consonants.\n\nAlthough modern Hebrew was intended to be based on Mishnaic spelling and Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation, the language as spoken in Israel has adapted to the popular (as opposed to the strict liturgical) Ashkenazi Hebrew phonology in the following respects:\n\n\n\n"}

ATC is a branch of natural language processing, which in turn is a branch of artificial intelligence. \n\nA taxonomy is a model used to organize and index knowledge (stored as documents, articles, videos, etc.) so that users can find the information they are searching for. Taxonomies are typically tree structured and divide a domain into categories based on the value of properties called taxa. Taxonomies were first used by biologists to group organisms into categories such as \"kingdom\", \"phylum\", \"genus\", and \"species\". Taxonomies are often represented as \"is-a\" hierarchies where each level is more specific (in mathematical language \"a subset of\") the level above it. For example, a basic biology taxonomy would have concepts such as \"mammal\", which is a subset of \"animal\", and \"dogs\" and \"cats\", which are subsets of \"mammal\". This kind of taxonomy is called an is-a model because the specific objects are considered instances of a concept. For example, \"Fido\" is-a instance of the concept \"dog\" and \"Fluffy\" is-a \"cat\". \n\nIn linguistics, is-a relations are called hyponymy. Words that describe categories are called hypernyms and words that are examples of categories are hyponyms. In the simple biology example \"dog\" is a hypernym and \"Fido\" is one of its hyponyms. A word can be both a hyponym and a hypernym. For example, \"dog\" is a hyponym of \"mammal\" and also a hypernym of \"Fido\". In ATC programs one of the most important tasks is the discovery of hypernym and hyponym relations among words. \n\nThe development and maintenance of a taxonomy is a knowledge-intensive task requiring significant time and resources. Also, domain modelers have their own point of view which inevitably, even if unintentionally, work their way into the model. ATC uses artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate a taxonomy for a domain in order to avoid these problems. There are several approaches to ATC. One approach is to use rules to detect patterns in the corpus and use those patterns to infer relations such as hyponymy. Other approaches use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian inferencing and Artificial Neural Networks.\n\nATC systems have been used to automatically generate large ontologies for domains such as insurance and finance. They have also been used to enhance existing large networks such as Wordnet to make them more complete and consistent.\n\n\n"}

During the last century, Baghdad Arabic has become the lingua franca of Iraq, and the language of commerce and education. It is a subvariety of Mesopotamian Arabic.\n\nAn interesting sociolinguistic feature of Baghdadi Arabic is the existence of three distinct dialects: Muslim, Jewish and Christian Baghdadi Arabic. Muslim Baghdadi belongs to a group called \"gilit\" dialects, while Jewish Baghdadi (as well as Christian Baghdadi) belongs to \"qeltu\" dialects.\n\nBaghdadi \"gilit\" Arabic, which is considered the standard Baghdadi Arabic, shares many features with varieties spoken in some parts of eastern Syria. \"Gilit\" Arabic is of Bedouin provenance, unlike Christian and Jewish Baghdadi, which is believed to be descendant of Medieval Iraqi Arabic. Until the 1950s Baghdad Arabic contained a large inventory of borrowings from English, Turkish, Persian or Kurdish language.\n\nDuring the first decades of the 20th century, when the population of Baghdad was less than a million, some inner city quarters had their own distinctive speech characteristics, maintained for generations. From about the 1960s, with the population movement within the city, and the influx of large numbers of people hailing mainly from the south, Baghdad Arabic has become more standardized, and has come to incorporate some rural Bedouin features and Modern Standard Arabic loanwords.\n\nDistinct features of Muslim Baghdadi Arabic include the use of 'ani' as opposed to the fusha 'ana' meaning 'I am' and the addition of the suffix 'ich' to verbs with female direct objects, e.g. 'ani gilitlich' meaning 'I told you' whereas maslawis would say: 'ana qeltolki'.\n\nEven in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background. Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the 28 consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Note that Arabic is particularly rich in uvular, pharyngeal, and pharyngealized (\"emphatic\") sounds. The emphatic coronals (, , , and ) cause assimilation of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants. The phonemes ⟨پ⟩ and ⟨ڤ⟩ (not used by all speakers) are not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory, as they exist only in foreign words and they can be pronounced as ⟨ب⟩ and ⟨ف⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.\nPhonetic notes: \n\n\n\n\n"}

Every week in the broadcast calendar starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday, and every month has either four or five such weeks. Broadcast calendar months thus have either 28 or 35 days.\n\nThe key link between the broadcast and Gregorian calendars is that the first week of every broadcast month always contains the Gregorian calendar first of the month. For example, if January 1 falls on a Saturday, then the broadcast calendar year would begin on the preceding Monday, December 27. Broadcast January would then have five weeks, ending on January 30, and the four weeks of broadcast February would begin on January 31. The number of weeks in a broadcast month is based on the number of Sundays that fall in that month with the period ending on the last Sunday of the month.\n\nDays and weeks in a broadcast calendar are often referred to by number rather than name, as in Week 47, Day 3. Since each week starts on a Monday, day three is always a Wednesday, while week 47 is always the 47th week of the broadcast calendar year. The Gregorian equivalent in a given year can be looked up on any number of published calendars that are freely available for download on the Web.\n\nBroadcast calendar years can have either 52 or 53 weeks. A broadcast calendar will have 53 weeks in a leap year where January 1 falls on a Saturday or Sunday, or in a common year where January 1 falls on a Sunday. In the 21st century, 53-week broadcast calendar years are 2006, 2012, 2017, 2023, 2028, 2034, 2040, 2045, 2051, 2056, 2062, 2068, 2073, 2079, 2084, 2090, and 2096.\n\nThe broadcast calendar often closely matches certain specialized financial calendars, such as the 4-4-5 calendar, but the length of a broadcast month can vary year to year. The broadcast year differs in most years from the ISO week year, although both start the week on Monday, because ISO starts with the week containing the first Thursday (and January 4) instead of the first Sunday (and January 1).\n\nFurthermore, start of a broadcast day is typically not at midnight, but near morning, usually at or near 5 a.m. local time.\n\n"}

While the NIMBY phenomenon is typically related to development issues, CAVE people, as the name implies, oppose virtually everything. This attitude is manifested in opposition to changes in public policy as varied as tax levies, sewer rates, public transportation routes, parking regulations and municipal mergers or annexations. CAVE People often express their views publicly by attending community meetings, writing letters to the local newspaper, or calling in to talk radio shows.\n\nA reference to the term \"CAVE dwellers\" can be found in the September 30, 1990 edition of the \"Orlando Sentinel\". The term was used by the author of the opinion piece, \"Is latest criticism worthwhile talk or just worthless?\", which references another, unnamed, Florida newspaper, indicating that the term existed even before the publication of this article.\n\n\n"}

It is parchment copy of an ownership document from the cartulary of the Benedictine monastery of St John the Baptist. It is one of the oldest Croatian cultural and linguistic records, which through its content provides a number of interesting insights into the various aspects of the time in which it was made. The first modern edition was published in 1881 by Franjo Rački in his book \"Starine\" (\"Antiquities\").\n\nIt is written in Bosnian Cyrillic script by Ivan, the canon of the Cathedral Church of Split and a Hvar notary, at the request of the Povlja abbot Ivan, and by order of the Bishop of Hvar Nikola. The template for the first part of the charter was Prince Brečko's charter from 1184, which regulated territorial relations between the estate of the monastery and the island's prince and župan. That template charter is almost entirely included within the Charter of Povlja.\n\nThe terse list of monastic estates reveal the Old Croatian tribal and clan common law procedures, and legal formulations contain recognizable vernacular and literary expressions, absent in later legal documents. Today it is kept in the parish office in Pučišća.\n\nIn the text of the Charter, two language layers can be seen: the common national language, which is the Chakavian dialect of Brač, its linguistic superstructure is provided by the contemporary literary language, which is Old Church Slavonic of Croatian recension, that gave the whole text a more formal feel. There are also a considerable number of words of Romance origin.\n\nIts undifferentiated writing shows the author’s knowledge of various contemporary Cyrillic schools on one side and the influence of Latin writing customs on the other. These influences reveal an important linguistic information. Namely, the unusualness of the use of graphs in the graphic series \"ѣ\" (yat), \"ы\" (yery), \"i\" and \"e\" indicates that in those region at that time there was already established an Ikavian reflex of the yat (with the possibility of some words being Ekavian).\n\n"}

He was born at Hostilia, a village in Cisalpine Gaul not far from Verona. \n\nNepos's Cisalpine birth is attested by Ausonius, and Pliny the Elder calls him \"Padi accola\" (\"a dweller on the River Po\", \"Naturalis historia\" III.127). He was a friend of Catullus, who dedicates his poems to him (I.3), Cicero and Titus Pomponius Atticus. Eusebius places him in the fourth year of the reign of Augustus, which is supposed to be when he began to attract critical acclaim by his writing. Pliny the Elder notes he died in the reign of Augustus (\"Natural History\" IX.39, X.23).\n\nHis simple style of writing has made him, in the UK at least, a standard choice for passages of unseen translation in Latin exams, from prep school, even up to degree level.\n\nNearly all of Nepos's writings are lost, but several allusions to them survive in works by other authors. Aulus Gellius's \"Attic Nights\" are of special importance in this respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPliny the Younger mentions verse written by Nepos, and in his own \"Life of Dion\", Nepos himself refers to a work of his own authorship, \"De Historicis\". If a separate work, this would be from a hypothesized \"De Historicis Latinis\", only one book in the larger \"De Viris Inlustribus\" (see below), although exclusively comprising biographies of Romans. Pliny also mentions a longer \"Life of Cato\" at the end of the extant \"Life of Cato\", written at the request of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the \"complete biography\" now lost.\n\nHis only surviving work is the \"Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae\". This book is in fact only one volume of Nepos' larger \"De Viris Illustribus,\" originally containing \"descriptions of foreign and Roman kings, generals, lawyers, orators, poets, historians, and philosophers,\" in addition to this sole surviving (and thought to be complete) book of commanders and generals (\"imperatores\"). It appeared in the reign of Theodosius I, as the work of the grammarian Aemilius Probus, who presented it to the emperor with a dedication in Latin verse. He claims it to have been the work of his mother or father (the manuscripts vary) and his grandfather. Despite the obvious questions (such as why the preface addressed to someone named Atticus when the work was supposedly dedicated to Theodosius), no one seemed to have doubted Probus's authorship. Eventually Peter Cornerus discovered in a manuscript of Cicero's letters the biographies of Cato and Atticus. He added them to the other existing biographies, despite the fact that the writer speaks of himself as a contemporary and friend of Atticus, and that the manuscript bore the heading \"E libro posteriore Cornelii Nepotis\" ('from the last book of Cornelius Nepos'). At last Dionysius Lambinus's edition of 1569 bore a commentary demonstrating on stylistic grounds that the work must have been of Nepos alone, and not Aemilius Probus. This view has been tempered by more recent scholarship, which agrees with Lambinus that they are the work of Nepos, but that Probus probably abridged the biographies when he added the verse dedication. The \"Life of Atticus\", however, is considered to be the exclusive composition of Nepos.\n\n\n"}

Cross bracing can increase a building’s capability to withstand seismic activity. Bracing is important in earthquake resistant buildings because it helps keep a structure standing. Cross bracing is usually seen with two diagonal supports placed in an X shaped manner; these support compression and tension forces. Depending on the forces, one brace may be in tension while the other is slack. It helps make buildings sturdier and more likely to withstand lateral forces. Cross bracing can be applied to any rectangular frame structure, such as chairs and bookshelves. In steel construction, steel cables may be used due to their great resistance to tension (although not resistant at all to compression). \nThe common uses for cross bracing includes bridge (side) supports, along with structural foundations. This method of construction maximizes the weight of the load a structure is able to support. It is a usual application when constructing earthquake-safe buildings.\n"}

{"id": "9251584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9251584", "title": "European Islam", "text": "European Islam\n\nEuropean Islam or Modern Islam is a hypothesized new branch of Islam, (reformed Islam) in Southeastern Europe, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania.\n\nIn recent years, research on Muslim communities in Europe has shifted from labor and social policy concerns to issues of 'religion' and 'culture'. In particular, there has been a growing interest in the possible emergence of a specifically 'European Islam'. The collective hypothesis that seems to be forming is - according to sociologist that currently is adapting and in coming years Islam will adapt to 'new' European structures in a way that will enable Muslims to consider themselves full European citizens.\n\nThe term euro Islam was introduced at a conference in Birmingham in the UK in 1988. Leader and initiator of the conference was Carl E. Olivestam, senior lecturer at Umea University, also Director at the Board of Universities and Colleges in Sweden. Islam in England, Germany and France, examples of European countries with large Islamic populations, could be named Euroislam. The term was first published in the Swedish handbook: Kyrkor och alternativa rörelser. (Churches and alternative Movements). There are two European Muslims who dominate the debate on Euro-Islam: Bassam Tibi, and Tariq Ramadan, who adopted the term in 1999 but are using it in a different meaning.\n\nTariq Ramadan is considered to be one of the coiners of the term \"European Islam\". Ramadan calls for creating a new European-Muslim identity in his book \"To Be a European Muslim\" (1999). He demands participation of Muslims in social and cultural life in conformation with European culture and Muslim ethics and says Muslims should disassociate themselves from Saudi Arabia and from terrorism. He also thinks that European Muslims \"need to separate Islamic principles from their cultures of origin and anchor them in the cultural reality of Western Europe.\" However, Ramadan says that \"Europeans also must start considering Islam as a European religion.\"\n\nGerman-Syrian Bassam Tibi coined in 1992 the term \"Euro-Islam\" to describe a type of Islam that embraces Western political values, such as pluralism, tolerance, and the separation of church and state. He argued that Muslims in Europe must create a specific form of Islam that can coexist with European values. The term reflects a concept for the integration of Muslims as European citizens, often assuming a liberal and progressive interpretation based on the idea of Europeanizing Islam. Bassam Tibi dissociates himself from the Islamists, who reject Euro-Islam. He estimates that they amount to 3%-5% of the Muslims currently living in Europe. He says they are nevertheless a dangerous minority since they want to \"hijack\" the Muslim community and other values of civil society. Tibi speaks of the need of Muslims to become \"European citizens of the heart\". Tibi insists that Euro-Islam means secularity, the acceptance of separation between religion and state, as well as that Muslims embrace European values. As contrast he sees the ghettoization of the Muslims with potential for conflict. Therefore, Euro-Islam is for Tibi a way out from the issue of the ethnicization of Muslim migration in Europe and a democratic alternative to the so-called \"ethnicity of fear\". But after 25 years of leadership towards promoting an Euro-Islam, Bassam Tibi announced in the magazine Cicero (June issue) \"I capitulate\", stating that the \"headscarf Islam\" has triumphed over the \"Euro-Islam\".\n\nMaria Luisa Maniscalco, professor of Sociology at the University of Roma Tre, in her book \"European Islam. Sociology of an encounter\", considers that in a process of \"Europeanisation\" of Muslims and \"Islamization\" of Europe directions of change are diverse. While family law, the status of women, religious freedom, social justice and criminal laws are still areas of high controversy within Islam, in Europe and elsewhere, and in comparison with European societies, attempts to Islamize modernity performed in European territory and in dialogue with Europe express creativity and innovation capacity. According to Maniscalco, when different segments of the Muslim world in Europe will propose themselves and will act as \"active minorities\", being able to take leadership and provide new impetus towards a dynamic and positive meeting, this will be significant for the future of Europe.\n\nXavier Bougarel, research fellow at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in the Ottoman and Turkish Studies unit, thinks that Balkan Muslims are playing an important role in the evolution of Islam in Europe towards a European Islam. With the possible EU enlargement towards the Balkans, about eight million Muslims would become EU citizens, doubling the number of Muslims in the EU-27 bloc. Bougarel explores Balkan Islam which is often called \"European Islam \" because it resulted from indigenous and largely secularized in opposition to \"a non- European Islam\" that embody not only the predominantly Muslim countries but also the Muslim populations newly settled in Western Europe. Xavier Bougarel proposes to replace these culturalist visions by an accurate comparison taking into account the nuances of the realities of Islam in Western Europe and in the Balkans.\n\nJocelyne Cesari, research associate at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University and director of Islamopedia Online, says that while Islam is perceived as colliding with European secular values \"Islam is simply a religion.\" According to Cesari, Muslims need to reveal the \"genuine tolerant face of Islam, to show its diversity and reveal to the world that an intellectual such as Muhammad Abduh is the best example for a modern thinker.\"\n\nCesari talks of the secularization of individual Islamic practices and of Islamic institutions, as well as the efforts Muslims are making to maintain the relevancy of Islamic legal systems and what she calls the \"gender jihad\" She thinks that Islam should be merged into European culture and that Islamic culture should be added to Europe's educational curricula.\n\nJørgen S. Nielsen, professor of Islamic studies at the University of Copenhagen says that \"Europeanizing\" Islam \"requires changes in relations between the sexes, in relations between parents and children, significant changes in attitudes to people of other religions, and in attitudes toward the state.\" Nielsen believes that this is happening. While only a minority of Muslims is assimilating completely with secular European culture, \"the majority are sticking to their religion but divorcing it from the cultural tradition and redressing it in a new culture.\" Nielsen also argues that the emergence of a European Islam is not only linked to the Muslim communities in Europe, but also to structures inherited from European society and the State.\n\nRobert S. Leiken says that both the multiculturalism and assimilation methods failed and that an integration policy still needs to be developed, something which will not happen overnight.\n\nFollowing the failed car bomb attacks in London and the failed Glasgow airport attack in June 2007, the European Commission started pooling ideas on how to tackle radical Islam and create a \"European Islam\", i.e. an Islam which is a more tolerant \"European\" branch of the faith. EU home affairs commissioner Franco Frattini also sent out an 18-question survey asking EU member states how they address violent radicalisation, mainly related to an abusive interpretation of Islam. In addition, Mr Frattini wants to pursue and further the idea of establishing a so-called \"European Islam\" or \"Islam de l'Europe\" – something floated by France's then interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy in 2006.\n\n\n"}

It usually serves as an emotionally loaded substitute for authoritarian.\n\nAs early as 1944, British writer George Orwell commented that following its widespread use in the European press, \"the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless\" due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.\n\nThe Bolshevik movement and later the Soviet Union made frequent use of the \"fascist\" epithet coming from its conflict with the early German and Italian fascist movements. It was widely used in press and political language to describe either its ideological opponents (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement (for example, social democracy which was called social fascism). Also the Nazi movement in Germany was described as \"fascist\" until 1939, when the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi–Soviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda.\n\nAfter the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, \"fascist\" was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism–Leninism, fascism was the \"final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie\", which \"in fascism sought refuge\" from \"inherent contradictions of capitalism\". As a result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was \"fascist\", with the Third Reich being just the \"most reactionary\" one. After 1941, \"fascist\" was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as \"fascist libel\" and the Warsaw Uprising as \"illegal and organised by fascists\". Communist Służba Bezpieczeństwa described Trotskyism, Titoism and imperialism as \"variants of fascism\".\n\nIn the 1980s, the term was used by leftist critics to describe the Reagan administration. The term was later used in the 2000s to describe the administration of George W. Bush by its critics and in the late 2010s to describe the candidacy and administration of Donald Trump. In her 1970 book \"Beyond Mere Obedience\", radical activist and theologian Dorothee Sölle coined the term \"Christofascist\" to describe fundamentalist Christians.\n\nIn 2004, Samantha Power (lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University) reflected Orwell's words from 60 years prior when she stated: \"Fascism – unlike communism, socialism, capitalism, or conservatism – is a smear word more often used to brand one's foes than it is a descriptor used to shed light on them\".\n\nIn 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found contrary to the Article 10 (freedom of expression) of ECHR fining a journalist for calling a right-wing journalist \"local neo-fascist\", regarding the statement as a value-judgment acceptable in the circumstances.\n\nIn 2014, with the outbreak of the war in Donbass the Russian nationalists and media returned to the \"fascist\" rhetoric, frequently describing the Ukrainian government after Euromaidan as \"fascist\", \"Nazi\" etc., at the same time accusing them of \"Jewish influence\" or spreading \"gay propaganda\".\n\nIn response to multiple authors claiming that the then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump was a \"fascist\", a 2016 article for \"Vox\" cited five historians who study fascism—including Roger Griffin, author of \"The Nature of Fascism\"—who stated that Trump does not hold (and is even opposed to) several political viewpoints that are integral to fascism, including viewing violence as an inherent good and an inherent rejection or opposition to a democratic system.\n\nSeveral Marxist theories back up particular uses of fascism beyond its usual remit. For instance, Poulantzas's theory of state monopoly capitalism could be associated with the idea of a military-industrial complex to suggest that 1960s America had a fascist social structure, though this kind of Maoist or Guevarist analysis often underpinned the rhetorical depiction of Cold War authoritarians as fascists.\n\nSome Marxist groups – such as the Indian section of the Fourth International and the Hekmatist groups in Iran and Iraq – have provided analytical accounts as to why the term \"fascist\" should be applied to groups such as the Hindutva movement, the 1979 Islamic Iranian regime or the Islamist sections of the Iraqi insurgency. Other scholars contend that the traditional meaning of the term fascism does not apply to Hindutva groups and may hinder an analysis of their activities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4879618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4879618", "title": "Friulian literature", "text": "Friulian literature\n\nFriulian literature is the literature of the autonomous Italian region of Friuli, written in the local Friulian language.\nReaders be aware that there is an alternative spelling for the adjective derived from Friuli: friulan, as influenced by the Veneto dialect form 'furlan'. The printed example of this is the \"Friulan Dictionary: English-Friulan, Friulan-English.\" edited by Gianni Nazzi & Deborah Saidero and published by Ent Friul tal Mond, 2000.\n\nEven if the first poems in Friulian date from the 14th century (anonymous works written in Cividale such as \"Piruç myò doç inculurit\" and \"Soneto furlan\", close to the Italian poetic movement Dolce Stil Novo), the birth of a full flavoured Friulian literature dates back only to the 19th century, when Friuli, after the Congress of Vienna, fell entirely under the control of the Austrian empire. This late flourishing had several causes: first, the language of the culture and administration had never been Friulian, but Latin and partly German under the Patriarchal State of Aquileia and Italian, mixed with Venetian under the Serenissima rule. Moreover, Friuli never saw the formation of a literate bourgeoisie that could have fostered the language, in order to have a literary development similar to other European languages. During the 16th century for example, there were only limited poetic forms in Friulian inspired by the works of Francesco Petrarca, including the poems of Nicolò Morlupino from Venzone (1528-1570) and Girolamo Biancone from Tolmezzo (1515-1580). Also, until 1800 there were no printed works in Friulian, so the diffusion of poetry and other works was restricted to a small number of persons.\n\nDuring this period, the most important Friulian authors were Eusebi Stele (\"Eusebio Stella\") of Spilimbergo (1602-1671), born to a noble family, who composed poems in a playful and ironic style about his life and love adventures; and the count Ermes di Colorêt (1622-1692), notable mainly for his use of the \"koinè\" from Udine, that would become the most notable literary language and the basis of today's standard Friulian. Ermes was educated at Medici's court in Florence, then took part in the Thirty Years' War, worked in the service of the Venetian Republic and Leopold I of Habsburg; in the last part of his life he returned to his homeland to focus on writing poetry, most of which centers on the theme of love.\n\nThis century was undoubtedly poor in the development of Friulian literature, probably due to the increasing influence of Venetian language in the city of Udine. Noteworthy, though, was the publication of the first Friulian almanac (\"strolic\" or \"lunari\" in Friulian) in 1742. The almanac contained short stories, poems and agricultural advice, with an item for each day of the year; these kinds of works would be very popular in the following centuries.\n\nThe first half of the century was similar to the previous one. The primary Friulian author of the 19th century, and today probably the best known in all of Friulian literature, was Pieri Çorut (Pietro Zorutti, 1792–1867). Çorut's poetry was plain, far removed from the popular romanticism of the period; he devoted himself mainly to the almanacs, called \"Strolic furlans\", published yearly from 1821 until 1867. His most famous work is \"Plovisine\", composed in 1833. Çorut enjoyed great popularity in Friuli during his life and many tried to imitate his style. Today he is respected mainly for his usage of Central Friulian, which he sought to elevate to a literary language. Another author of almanacs was Antoni Broili (1796–1876), who achieved better results from the literary point of view.\n\nIn the second half of the century, the city of Gorizia was generally more vivacious than that of Udine; there was a different feeling of \"Friulanity,\" and the environment was mitteleuropean, since the city (part of the county of Gorizia and Gradisca) was under the rule of Austro-Hungarian empire, while Udine was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866. In Gorizia, many tried to use the Friulian language in different fields, such as the applied sciences, with good results; one example from the period is the almanac \"Il me paîs. Strenna popolâr pal 1855\" by Federico de Comelli of Gradisca (1826-1892). Carlo Favetti from Gorizia also published several books of poetry and plays in the local Friulian dialect.\n\nAn important literary event, although very late in comparison to other European languages, was the publication of the first Friulian vocabulary, composed by abbot Jacopo Pirona and his nephew Giulio Andrea (1871), which is still a valuable language resource today. In 1873, Graziadio Isaia Ascoli published an analysis of Friulian. Ascoli started the so-called \"Questione Ladina\".\n\nAlso deserving of mention is Caterina Percoto, who has an important role in Italian literature of this century, but who left only a few works in Friulian, mainly regarding popular traditions.\n\nAt the beginning of 1900 Friuli seemed far from the numerous avant-gardes of the period, at least in part due to its difficult historical situation; the regional request for autonomy received no response from the Italian authorities, and in 1933 the fascist regime prohibited any publications in Friulian. The most important authors of this time were Vittorio Cadel of Fanna (1884-1917), who composed poems with a sensual background, concealing a deep feeling of sadness and discouragement; Ercole Carletti (1877-1946) of Udine, author of poems in a style close to Italian \"crepuscolarismo\"; and Celso Cescutti. A rare example of political and civil themes can be found in Giovanni Minut's \"Rimis furlanis\" (1921). Minut, born in Visco in 1895, was forced to flee to Uruguay when the fascists came to power; he died there in 1967.\n\nIn the area of Gorizia, Delfo Zorzut of Cormons composed various collections of short stories (\"La furlane\", \"Sturiutis furlanis\") and gathered many popular legends and traditions, useful to keep alive an interest in the language.\n\nBut the most important Friulian work of the 20th century was the \"Academiuta di lenga furlana\", founded by Pier Paolo Pasolini. Pasolini collected a group of writers in order to go beyond the old poetry inspired by Pieri Çorut's works, which was still imitated, to create a new and modern Friulian poetry. Other noteworthy figures in the movement include Domenico Naldini (Pasolini's cousin) and Riccardo Castellani. Neither, however, reached the poetical heights of their leader. Their works were in the \"Concordiese\" dialect of Friulian, in polemic with the use of Central Friulian as the only literary standard.\n\nOther developments after World War II included the lyrical works of Franco de Gironcoli, from Gorizia. Gironcoli studied and analysed poems from Ermes di Colorêt and the Pirona vocabulary, and from 1944 on he composed several short lyrics, dedicated mainly to the flowing of time.\n\nJosef Marchet, a priest, began the difficult work of promoting and standardizing the language; he tried to arrange a Friulian grammatic in \"Lineamenti di grammatica friulana,\" with the purpose of developing a standard variant of the language. In 1950 he also published the collection \"Risultive,\" wherein were gathered the works of several interesting Friulian poets of the time (including Novella Cantarutti from Spilimbergo; Dino Virgili, composer of the novel \"L'aghe dapit la cleve\"; and Lelo Cjanton (\"Aurelio Cantoni\")).\n\n1971 saw the publication of a translation with the title \"Prime di sere\" of the novel \"Il vento nel vigneto\", written in Italian by the Friulian writer Carlo Sgorlon, which enjoyed a good success.\n\nWhile poets and song writers in Friuli continue to keep the language alive, Friulan has been used in Toronto, Canada, for many years by immigrants from Friuli.

{"id": "4412427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4412427", "title": "Grüß Gott", "text": "Grüß Gott\n\nThe expression grüß Gott (; from \"grüß dich Gott\", originally '(may) God bless (you)') is a greeting, less often a farewell, in Southern Germany and Austria (more specifically the Upper German Sprachraum especially in Bavaria, Franconia, Swabia, Austria, and South Tyrol). The greeting was promoted in the 19th century by the Catholic clergy and along with its variants has long been the most common greeting in Southern Germany and Austria. \n\nIt is almost always misunderstood by speakers from other regions to mean the imperative \"greet God(!)\" and therefore often receives a sarcastic response from Northern (and thus mainly Protestant) Germans such as \"If I see Him\" (\"Wenn ich ihn sehe\") or \"Hopefully not too soon\" (\"Hoffentlich nicht so bald\"). \"Grüß Gott\" is however the shortened form of both \"(es) grüße dich Gott\" and its plural \"(es) grüße euch Gott\" (literally in modern German 'may God greet you'). In addition, in Middle High German, the verb \"grüßen\" (\"grüezen\") used to mean not only 'to greet' but also 'to bless', so the greeting in fact preserves the original meaning 'God bless you', though even speakers in Southern Germany and Austria are only very rarely aware of this and think it means 'may God greet you'. \n\nSuch a religious expression in a greeting only exists in a few countries. For example, people wish one another a simple 'good day' in Poland (\"dzień dobry\"), Spain (\"buenos días\"), and Portugal (\"bom dia\"), while in Gaelic-speaking Ireland the popular greeting is \"Dia dhuit\" ('God with you'), similar to the English \"goodbye\", a contraction of \"God be with ye\"; today, \"goodbye\" has a less obviously religious meaning. Also similar to the Catalan formal expression \"adéu-siau\" (\"\"be with God\", in archaic Catalan). A religious origin is still obvious in French \"adieu\", Spanish \"adiós\", Italian \"addio\", Portuguese \"adeus\", and Catalan \"adéu\" (\"to God\", probably a contraction of \"I entrust you to God\"\"). In Finland, a religious group named Laestadians uses the form \"Jumalan terve\" (\"God's greeting\").\n\nLike many other greetings, \"grüß Gott\" can range in meaning from deeply emotional to casual or perfunctory. The greeting's pronunciation varies with the region, with, for example, \"grüß dich\" sometimes shortened to \"grüß di\" (the variation \"grüß di Gott\" may be heard in some places). In Bavaria and Austria \"griaß di\" and \"griaß eich\" are commonly heard, although their Standard German equivalents are not uncommon either. A common farewell analogous to \"grüß Gott\" is \"pfiat' di Gott\", a contraction of \"behüte dich Gott\" ('God protect you'), which itself is not common at all. This is likewise shortened this to \"pfiat' di/eich\" or, if the person is addressed formally \"pfia Gott\" in Altbayern, Austria, and South Tyrol (Italy).\n\nIn its standard German form, \"grüß Gott\" is mostly stressed on the second word and in many places is used not only in everyday life, but is also common in the official communications of the aforementioned states. Use of the greeting \"guten Tag\" ('good day') is less prevalent, but there are those who dislike \"grüß Gott\" on account of its religious nature. In Bavaria, \"guten Tag\" is considered prim and distant and sometimes leads to misunderstandings; however, if the person addressed is from Northern Germany, they may see it as a friendly gesture.\n\n\n"}

AH 75/694×90/709 CE), or simply Layla Al Akheeliyya (Ar. ليلى الأخيليّة) was a famous Umayyad Arab poet who was renowned for her poetry, eloquence, strong personality as well as her beauty. Nearly fifty of her short poems survive. They include elegies for her lover Tawba ibn Humayyir and ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan; 'lewd satires' exchanged with the poet al-Nabigha al-Ja‘di; and panegyrics for leading Umayyad officials and caliphs: Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf, Caliph Marwan I, and Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan.\n\nShe was born to the Banu 'Uqayl section of the Banu 'Amir tribe, coincidentally the same tribe as Qays ibn al-Mullawah and Layla Al-Aamiriya. However, unlike them she was a city dweller not a bedouin.\n\nIn her early years she was known for her love of Tawba ibn Humayyir but her father refused the marriage and she married a man called Abi Al-Athla’, Tawba continued to visit her despite her marriage until her husband complained to the Caliph, who made Tawba leave. Her husband could not bear the jealousy so he divorced her. She then married an unknown poet and had many children, little is known about them.\n\nHer strong personality and fame gave her access to the courts of the Umayyads and others.\n\nShe was one of the few early female Arab poets who dared to speak of her love in public; this poetry is particularly associated with Tawba b. al-Ḥumayyir: 'Laylā and Tawba had fallen in love with each other. But when Tawba asked for Laylā's hand in marriage, her father refused, and married Laylā to another man. Later, Tawba was killed, and this inspired the laments of Laylā'. What made this even more daring was that she was married to another (Sawwār b. Awfā al-Qushayrī). Nevertheless love poetry was not her only genre as her poems were diverse in subjects although she avoided politics. This helped her to continue her relations with politically influential people despite changing times and powers. Here work includes exchanges of satires with Nābigha al-Ja‘dī (apparently between 40/660 and 63/683) and Ḥumayda bint Nu‘mān ibn Bashīr.\n\nHer poetry was often compared to that of Al-Khansa. However, Layla had more diverse imagery, not confined to the desert, and used more than one genre, not confining herself to one subject. Her poetry also contained some philosophical aspects and wisdom, usually attributed to her extensive travel. On the other hand, Layla depended highly on her poetry for income where she was awarded with money for some poems, and her poetry provided her with connections to rich and powerful people while Al-Khansa depended on her family’s traditional pastoralism.\n\nShe died in 704 near the city of Samawa in Iraq while traveling.\n\nExample of her poetry: \n\nالمنـايا بكـف الله حيث تراها\nتتبـع أقصـى دائـها فشفـاها\nغـلام إذا هـز القنـا سقـاها\nإذا جمحت يوماً وخفيـف أذاها\nأعـد لها قبـل النـزول قراها\n\n"}

{"id": "4812954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4812954", "title": "Microdistrict", "text": "Microdistrict\n\nMicrodistrict, or microraion (, \"mikrorajón\"; , \"mikrarajon\"; , ), is a residential complex—a primary structural element of the residential area construction in the Soviet Union and in some post-Soviet and former Communist states. Residential districts in most of the cities and towns in Russia and the republics of the former Soviet Union were built in accordance with this concept.\n\nAccording to the Construction Rules and Regulations of the Soviet Union, a typical microdistrict covered the area of 10–60 hectares (30–160 acres), up to but not exceeding 80 hectares (200 acres) in some cases, and comprised residential dwellings (usually multi-story apartment buildings) and public service buildings. As a general rule, major motor roads, greenways, and natural obstacles served as boundaries between microdistricts, allowing an overall reduction in city road construction and maintenance costs and emphasizing public transportation. Major motor roads or through streets were not to cross microdistricts' territories. The entrances to a microdistrict's territory were to be located no further than 300 meters (1000 ft) apart.\n\nStandards also regulated the accessibility of the public service buildings (excluding schools and pre-school facilities) by imposing a 500-meter (1,500–foot) limit as the farthest distance from any residential dwelling. One of the city-planners' tasks was to ensure that the fewest public buildings were built to cover the microdistrict's territory in accordance with the norms. Typical public service structures include secondary schools, pre-school establishments (usually combined kindergarten and nursery), grocery stores, personal service shops, cafeterias, clubs, playgrounds, and building maintenance offices, as well as a number of specialized shops. The exact number of buildings of each type depended on the distance requirement and the microdistrict's population density and was determined by means of certain per capita standards.\n\nThe history of microdistricts as an urban planning concept dates back to the 1920s when the Soviet Union experienced a very fast rate of urbanization. Under the Soviet urban planning ideologies of the 1920s, residential complexes—compact territories with residential dwellings, schools, shops, entertainment facilities, and green spaces—started to prevail in urban planning practices as they allowed for more careful and efficient planning of the rapid spatial expansion. These complexes were seen as an opportunity to build a collective society, an environment suitable and necessary for the new way of life.\n\nIn the 1930s, residential complexes grew in size, covering territories of up to five to six hectares. A system of building residential complexes was gradually replaced with a concept of a city block. Such blocks generally comprised residential buildings along the perimeter, and residential buildings intermingled with public service buildings in the inner area. However, it was unfeasible to provide all public services within every city block due to the latter's relatively compact size, so it was not unusual when a school, a kindergarten, or a store served the population of several blocks, which were often separated by major motor roads. The system of the city blocks also required a developed network of roads, thus increasing the maintenance and construction costs and complicating organization of the public transportation.\n\n1940s and 1950s saw further enlargement and grouping of the city blocks. However, new construction was based on the same principles as in the previous decades and could not keep up with the increasing housing demand. Labor-intensive industrialization of the country demanded more workers, which was hard to achieve with housing accommodations lacking.\n\nSoviet authorities revisited issues of urban planning in the mid-1950s. The new urban planning concept built on the concept of residential districts (with 10,000–30,000 inhabitants each), consisting of several microdistricts (with 8,000–12,000 inhabitants each), which in their turn comprised several residential complexes (with 1,000–1,500 inhabitants each). In larger cities, residential districts were grouped into urban zones, the population of which could reach one million. Each microdistrict provided the population with facilities needed on a daily basis, whereas services in lesser demand were available on the residential-district level. This concept was backed up with reorganization of the Soviet construction industry—panel-block apartment buildings became widespread as they allowed for fast, although often low-quality, construction, reduced costs, and economies of scale. The whole construction process became simplified and standardized, leading to the erection of the rows and rows of faceless grey rectangular apartment-buildings which now prevail in every city and town of the countries of the former Soviet Union. Such drastic reduction of building costs was necessary because flats in the new blocks were given to the citizens free of charge at the time. Humorous insights into the potential consequences of living in such a bland and repetitive atmosphere appear in the hugely popular Mosfilm production \"The Irony of Fate\" (1976).\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a sharp decline in the volume of residential construction. During the 1990s, urban planning was mostly ignored as there was virtually no new construction. 2000s brought slow growth to the volume of housing construction, as well as heightened criticisms of the microdistrict model. Urban planning, no longer the direct responsibility of central governments, was delegated to the regions; some (including Ukraine and Moldova) of which are now coping with the task of maintaining deteriorating Soviet-era housing assets. Since the mid-2000s, many apartment blocks have either been modernised or replaced with modern skyscrapers.\n\nIn China, this type of neighbourhood unit is known as Xiaoqu (). First built in the 1980s, preceding the Chinese economic reform, they were very similar to the concept as known in the Soviet Union. Xiaoqu similarly promoted a sense of community among the inhabitants. However, after the economy was opened up more for commercial real estate developers, Xiaoqu continued to be built, but evolved in several ways such as differentiation in luxury, safety and available services. The apartments are owned by the inhabitants, and the Xiaoqu is often enclosed by a wall, with the entrance gate being guarded.\n\n\n"}

Madhavan (born 9 September 1948) is a leading writer of contemporary Malayalam literature, whose short stories, novels, football columns and travel articles enjoy a wide readership in Malayalam speaking areas of India.\n\nMadhavan was born in the port city of Cochin where he attended the Sree Rama Varma High School. After graduating in economics from Maharajas College, Ernakulam he moved to Thiruvananthapuram to study for his masters at the Department of Economics, University of Kerala. During this period he began writing, and in 1970 won the top prize for his first published short story 'Sisu', in a contest organised by the Malayalam literary magazine Mathrubhumi. In 1975, Madhavan joined the Indian Administrative Service where he was seconded to the Bihar cadre. His civil service career followed the usual path of initially administering sub-districts and districts, then jobs in the state and union secretariats followed by the running departments and corporations.\n\nIn the 1980s, Madhavan went through a decade-long period of writer's block, until the release of his story 'Higuita' in 1990. In this work, Madhavan models his protagonist, priest Father Geevarghese, on René Higuita, the 1990 FIFA World Cup goalkeeper for Colombia. Higuita's unconventional playing style whereby he would often abandon his goal and try to score goals, occupies the priest's imagination. Likewise, he temporarily abandons his cassock and saves a tribal girl Lucie from the clutches of the trafficker Jabbar. The short story was adjudged the best in hundred years of Malayalam literature.\n\nSince then he has published four collections of stories, a novel and one collection of plays. Among the stories, ‘Thiruthu’, based on the Babri masjid demolition, is particularly notable. Madhavan's works of short fiction are:\nMadhavan's contribution to the short story genre, which is dying in most parts of the world, is reckoned by critics to be unique and noteworthy. As a short-fiction writer, his art gives importance to minute details and exemplifies the manifest skill and compact craft that writing short fiction demands. In Madhavan's works the subtle connections of criss-crossing dialogues and interlacing plots ultimately reveal an integrated narrative continuum.\n\nAfter thirty-three years as a writer, Madhavan published his debut novel in 2003 as \"Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal\", translated as \"Litanies of the Dutch Battery\" in 2010. It was well received by Malayalam readers and has been reprinted many times. The novel is about life on an imaginary island in the Kochi backwater, named after a 17th-century battery (\"bathery\" in Malayalam) of five cannons installed on its promontory by the Dutch (\"Lanthans\" in Malayalam). Jessica, the young narrator of the story, is the scion of a family of carpenters with a long tradition of boat building. Her remniscences start from the days when she was inside her pregnant mother's womb. The novel presents an intimate picture of life of the Latin Christians of the Kerala coast, descendants of poor, low-caste Hindus who were converted to Christianity by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century.\n\nThe novel it is set between 1951 and 1967, the first sixteen years of Jessica life, but draws upon history going back to the time of Vasco Da Gama. She was born at a time when people used to run away from cow-pox vaccinators as well as the period when Kerala embraced communism, which the novelist calls the 'watermelon years' – an allusion to the verdant green-canopied Kerala with its hidden red watermelons. There are captivating descriptions of Latin Christian residents of the Dutch Battery preparing themselves for months prior to the staging of Karalman Chavittu Nadakam, an operatic play about Charlemagne, originally written in Tamil and pidgin Latin by Chinnathambi Annavi in the 16th century. Set against the background of the city of Madhavan's birth, Kochi, the \"Lanthan Batheriyile Luthiniyakal\" is a roller coaster ride through micro histories, the nascent days of a newly independent country, the growth and decline of ideas, and the randomness of events affecting human lives. Well-known Malayalam novelist M. Mukundan made the following assessment after reviewing the novel, \"N.S. Madhavan has rejuvenated Malayalam fiction.\" He summarises the novel thus: \"[The book] is all about history and imagination—the protogonists of new fiction that is in vogue.\" Mukundan added, \"The novel is heavily populated with communists, priests, carpenters, cooks, boatmen, librarians, school teachers, even tailors. At times you will come across history makers from faraway Russia – Joseph Stalin, Imre Nagy, Nikita Khrushchev...\"\n\nThe English translation was shortlisted for the 2011 The Hindu Literary Prize, translated by Rajesh Raja Mohan.\n\nIn 2006, Madhavan published his first book of plays:\n\nMadhavan's novel \"Lanthanbatheriyile Luthiniyakal\" was translated into English by Rajesh Rajamohan under the title \"Litanies of Dutch Battery\" and published in October 2010 by Penguin Books. It was selected for the Man Asian Literary Prize long list, and was the winner of the 2010 Vodafone Crossword Book Award (Fiction Translation).\n\nWhen Big Trees Fall, a short story by Madhavan, is about the homicidal attacks on the Sikhs that occurred following the 1984 assassination of the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and has been filmed as the Hindi movie, \"Kaya Taran\" by Sashi Kumar in 2004.\n\nMadhavan is married to Sheela Reddy, book editor of \"Outlook\", an English magazine published in New Delhi. Their daughter, Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan is a well-known blogger and the author of 2 English novels, \"You Are Here\", \"Confessions of a Listmaniac\" and the best-seller Cold Feet.\n\n\nEnglish translations of his Malayalam stories\nWrite-up\nArticles\n"}

Crane, Elder Olson, Richard McKeon, Wayne Booth, and others — which means.\n\"A view of literature and criticism which takes a pluralistic attitude toward the history of literature and seeks to view literary works and critical theories intrinsically\" \n\nNeo-Artistotelianism was one of the first rhetorical methods of criticism. Its central features were first suggested in Herbert A. Wichelns' \"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\" in 1925. It focused on analyzing the methodology behind a speech's ability to convey an idea to its audience. In 1943, Neo-Aristotelianism was further publicized, gaining popularity after William Norwood Brigance published A History and Criticism of American Public Address.\n\nUnlike rhetorical criticism, which concentrates on the study of speeches and the immediate effect of rhetoric on an audience, Neo-Aristotelianism \"led to the study of a single speaker because the sheer number of topics to cover relating to the rhetor and the speech made dealing with more than a single speaker virtually impossible. Thus, various speeches by different rhetors related by form of topic were not included in the scope of rhetorical criticism.\"\n\nWichelns' work was one of the first that introduced Neo-Aristotelianism. It narrowed down speech to 12 key topics to be studied, similar to many of the topics discussed by Aristotle in the Rhetoric. His topics for speech critique include:\nAccording to Mark S. Klyn, author of Towards a Pluralistic Rhetorical Criticism, \"The Literary Criticism of Oratory\" provided \"substance and structure to a study which heretofore had been formless and ephemeral [...] it literally created the modern discipline of rhetorical criticism.\" Thus regardless of the lack of detail on these topics, it provided a modern structure of critiquing and analyzing speech via Neo-Aristotelianism, according to Donald C. Bryant.\n\n"}

Examples of occupations with a patter might include the auctioneer, salesperson, dance caller, magician, or comedian.\n\nThe term may have been a colloquial shortening of \"Pater Noster\", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling prayers quickly and mechanically.\n\nFrom this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a cant language used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a cheap-jack employs to pass off his goods. Many illusionists, e.g., card magicians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.\n\nIt is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a patter-song, in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance caller may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.\n\nIn some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of \"patter\": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of onomatopoeia.\n\nIn certain forms of entertainment, peep shows (in the historical meaning) and Russian \"rayok\", patter is an important component of a show.

{"id": "50388178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50388178", "title": "Political views of American academics", "text": "Political views of American academics\n\nThe political views of American academics began to receive attention in the 1930s, and investigation into faculty political views expanded rapidly after the rise of McCarthyism. Demographic surveys of faculty that began in the 1950s and continue to the present have found higher percentages of liberals than of conservatives, particularly among those who work in the humanities and social sciences. Researchers and pundits disagree about survey methodology and about the interpretations of the findings.\n\nCarol Smith and Stephen Leberstein have documented investigations of professors' political views at the City College of New York (CCNY) during the 1930s and 1940s. Citing the tactics of private hearings, requiring respondents to name others, and denying rights of legal representation, Smith calls the investigations a \"dress rehearsal for McCarthyism\". Smith described the case of Max Yergan, who was the first African American professor hired at the CCNY. After complaints that he expressed liberal and progressive views in his classes on Negro History and Culture, Yergan was terminated in 1936. In 1938, the U.S. House of Representatives created the House Un-American Activities Committee; one of the committee's first actions was to attempt to investigate the political views of faculty in the New York public colleges.\n\nIn 1940, Bertrand Russell was denied employment as a philosophy professor at CCNY because of his political beliefs. That same year, the New York State Legislature created the Rapp-Coutert Committee, which held hearings in 1940–41 during which faculty accused of holding communist political beliefs were interrogated. More than 50 faculty and staff at CCNY resigned or were terminated as a result of the hearings. One professor, Morris Schappes, served a year in prison for refusing to name colleagues who may have been affiliated with the Community party. Smith believes that the investigations caused the largest political purge on one campus in the history of the US.\n\nIn 1942, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), began investigating the political views of W.E.B. DuBois, an African American sociologist who taught at Atlanta University. The investigation centered on DuBois's 1940 autobiography, \"Dusk of Dawn.\" Although the investigation was dismissed, Atlanta University fired DuBois in 1943. Public outcry led the university to reinstate DuBois, but he retired in 1944. In 1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee summoned faculty members from the University of Washington, and three tenured faculty members were fired.\n\nPublic concern about the political opinions of college teachers intensified after World War II ended in 1945. Sociologists who were investigated by the FBI for their political beliefs during this period include Ernest Burgess, William Fielding Ogburn, Robert Staughton Lynd, Helen Lynd, E. Franklin Frazier, Pitirim A. Sorokin, Talcott Parsons, Herbert Blumer, Samuel Stouffer, C. Wright Mills, and Edwin H. Sutherland.\n\nAlthough government employees and entertainment figures were most often investigated for alleged communist sympathies during the \"Second Red Scare\" of the 1950s, many university faculty were accused as well. In their 1955 study of 2,451 social scientists who taught at American colleges and universities, Lazarsfeld and Thielens noted that the period of 1945–55 was especially marked by suspicion and attacks on colleges for the political views of their faculty. These authors label this period \"the difficult years.\"\n\nIn 1950, the University of California Board of Regents and its administration began to require faculty to sign a two-part political loyalty oath: one part required faculty to declare they were not Communists, and did not believe in the tenets of Communism; the other part was an oath of loyalty to the state of California and the US Constitution in accordance with the Levering Act. In early March, 1950, the faculty, who numbered 900, unanimously refused to sign even though the Regents threatened non-signers with termination. Faculty who refused to sign the loyalty oath were terminated, although most of the terminations were later overturned by a California state court. In 1951, members of the American Legion began accusing various university faculty of being communists. University administrations responded by banning left-wing student groups and communist speakers. Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee investigated 18 faculty members at Sarah Lawrence College, some of whom were pressured to resign.\n\nAccording to historian Ellen Schrecker, \"it is very clear that an academic blacklist was in operation during the McCarthy era.\" An estimated 100 university faculty were terminated during the McCarthy era due to suspicions about their political beliefs. In 1970, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover sent an open letter to US college students, advising them to reject leftist politics, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the FBI conducted a secret counterintelligence program in libraries.\n\nIn 1955, Robert Maynard Hutchins led an effort within the Ford Foundation to document and analyze the effects of McCarthyism on academic freedom. He commissioned sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to conduct a study of university faculty in the United States, and the results were published by Lazarsfeld and Wagner Thielens in a book, \"The Academic Mind\". As part of a survey of faculty views about academic freedom during the \"Second Red Scare\", they asked 2,451 professors of social science a large number of questions, and found that about two thirds of these faculty members had been visited by the FBI and had been asked questions about the political beliefs of their colleagues, students, and themselves. They also included a few questions about political party affiliations and recent voting patterns, and reported that there were more Democrats than , 47% to 16%. According to sociologist Neil Gross, the study was significant because it was the first effort to poll university faculty specifically about their political views.\n\nThe Lazarsfeld and Thielens study had examined a sample of 2451 social science faculty members. A second study, conducted in 1969 on behalf of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, was the first to be performed with a large survey sample, extensive questions about political views, and what Neil Gross characterized as highly rigorous analytic methods. The study was conducted in 1969 by political scientist Everett Carll Ladd and sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, who surveyed 60,000 academics in multiple fields of study at 303 institutions about their political views. Publishing their results in the 1975 book \"The Divided Academy\", Ladd and Lipset found that about 46% of professors described themselves as liberal, 27% described themselves as moderates, and 28% described themselves as conservative. They also reported that faculty in the humanities and social sciences tended to be the most liberal, while those in \"applied professional schools such as nursing and home economics\" and in agriculture were the most conservative. Younger faculty tended to be more liberal than older faculty, and faculty across the political spectrum tended to disapprove of the student activism of the 1960s.\n\nSmaller follow-up surveys on behalf of the Carnegie Foundation held in 1975, 1984, 1989, and 1997 showed an increased trend among professors toward the left, apart from a small movement to the right in 1984. By the 1997 study, 57% of the professors surveyed identified as liberals, 20% as moderates, and 24% as conservatives.\n\nAs later surveys were published, some scholars pointed to the harmful effects of a political imbalance in the faculty, and one editorial described the effects as \"ruining college\". Other scholars said that there were serious methodological problems that led to overestimates of the disparity between liberals and conservatives, and that there were political motivations for such overestimates.\n\nBeginning in 1989, the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at the University of California, Los Angeles has conducted a survey of full-time faculty at American four-year colleges and universities every three years. The HERI Faculty Survey gathers comprehensive information about the faculty experience, such as position, field, institutional details, and personal opinion and views, including a single question asking respondents to self-identify their political orientation as \"far left\", \"liberal\", \"moderate/middle of the road\", \"conservative\", or \"far right\". Between 1989 and 1998, the survey showed negligible change in the number of professors who described themselves as far left or liberal, approximately 45%. , surveying 16,112 professors, the percentage of liberal/far left had increased to 60%. When asked in 2012 about the significance of the findings on political views, the director of HERI, Sylvia Hurtado, said that the numbers on political views attract a lot of attention, but that this attention may be misplaced because there may be trivial reasons for the shifts.\n\nLadd and Lipset, who had conducted the original Carnegie survey, designed a telephone survey in 1999 of approximately 4000 faculty, administrators, and students, called the North American Academic Survey Study (NASS). Stanley Rothman, the project lead after the passing of Ladd and Lipset, published a paper using NAASS data along with Neil Nevitte and S. Robert Lichter which concluded \"complaints of ideologically-based discrimination in academic advancement deserve serious consideration and further study\". Rothman along with co-authors Matthew Woessner and April Kelly-Woessner reported their extended findings in a book titled \"The Still Divided Academy\".\n\nNeil Gross and Solon Simmons conducted a survey starting in 2006 called the \"Politics of the American Professoriate\" which led to several study papers and books. They designed their survey to improve on past studies which they felt had not included community college professors, addressed low response rates, or used standardized questions. The survey drew upon a sample size of 1417 full-time professors from 927 institutions.\n\nIn 2007, Gross and Simmons concluded in \"The Social and Political Views of American Professors\" that the professors were 44% liberal, 46% moderates, and 9% conservative. \"Inside Higher Ed\" reported that economist Lawrence H. Summers made his own analysis of the data collected by Gross and Simmons and found a larger gap among faculty teaching \"core disciplines for undergraduate education\" at elite research universities, but the report also concluded that \"there was widespread praise for the way the survey was conducted, with Summers and others predicting that their data may become the definitive source for understanding professors' political views.\"\n\nGross published a more extensive analysis in his 2013 book \"Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?\" and, with Simmons, in their 2014 compilation \"Professors and Their Politics\". They strongly criticized what they saw as conservative political influence on the interpretation of data about faculty political views, arising from activists and think tanks seeking political reform of American higher education. Sociologist Joseph Hermanowicz described \"Professors and Their Politics\" as \"a welcome addition to sociological literature examining higher education, which, in the case of its intersection with politics, has not received serious attention since Paul Lazarsfeld and Wagner Theilen's classic study of 1958 and Seymour Martin Lipset and Everett Carll Ladd's 1976 work.\"\n\nSeveral studies have found that the political views of academics vary considerably between different regions of the United States, and between academic disciplines. In a 2016 opinion column in \"The New York Times\", for example, political scientist Samuel J. Abrams used HERI data to argue that the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty varied greatly between regions. According to Abrams, the ratio of liberal to conservative professors was highest in New England, where this ratio was 28:1, compared to 6:1 nationally. Abrams also commented on these findings that \"This previously unspecified ideological imbalance on campuses has led to cries of discrimination against right of center professors and scores of reports from both academic and popular press sources which have chronicled the concerns with this \"beleaguered\" and \"oppressed\" minority on campus... The data clearly reveal that conservative faculty are not only as satisfied with their career choice – if not more so – as their liberal counterparts, but that these faculty are also as progressive in their teaching methods and maintain almost identical outlooks toward their personal and professional lives.\"\n\nMitchell Langbert examined variations in political party registration in 2018, describing a higher concentration of Democrats in elite liberal arts institutions in the northeast, and found more Democrats among female faculty than male faculty. He also found the greatest ratio of Democrats to Republicans in interdisciplinary studies and the humanities, and the lowest ratio in professional studies and science and engineering.\n\nFocusing specifically on social psychology academics, a 2014 study found that \"[b]y 2006, however, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans had climbed to more than 11:1.\" The six authors, all from different universities and members of the Heterodox Academy, also said, by 2012, \"that for every politically conservative social psychologist in academia there are about 14 liberal psychologists\" according to Arthur C. Brooks. Academy member Steven Pinker described the study as \"one of the most important papers in the recent history of the social sciences\". Russell Jacoby questioned the focus of the study on the social sciences rather than STEM fields saying that the \"reason is obvious: Liberals do not outnumber conservatives in many of those disciplines\".\n\nSince the modern conservative movement in the United States began in the mid-20th century, conservative authors have argued that college students are unduly influenced or indoctrinated as a result of the prevalence of liberal faculty at their schools. William F. Buckley's \"God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of \"Academic Freedom\"\", Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\", Dinesh D'Souza's \"Illiberal Education\", and Roger Kimball's \"Tenured Radicals\" have made such arguments. George Yancey argues that there is little evidence that the political orientation of faculty members affects the political attitudes of their students. A study by Mack D. Mariani and Gordon J. Hewitt published in 2008 examined ideological changes in college students between their first and senior years and found that these changes correlated with that of most Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 during the same time period, and there was no evidence that faculty ideology was \"associated with changes in students' ideological orientation\" and concluded that students at more liberal schools \"were not statistically more likely to move to the left\" than students at other institutions. Similarly, Stanley Rothman, April Kelly-Woessner, and Mathew Wossner found in 2010 that students' \"aggregate attitudes do not appear to vary much between their first and final years,\" and wrote that this \"raises some questions about charges that campuses politically indoctrinate students.\" Analysis of a survey of students' political attitudes by M. Kent Jennings and Laura Stoker found that the tendency of college graduates to be more liberal is largely due to \"the fact that more liberal students are more likely to go to college in the first place.\"\n\nRothman, Kelly-Woessner, and Woessner also found in 2010 that 33% of conservative faculty say they are \"very satisfied\" with their careers, while 24% of liberal faculty say so. Over 90% of Republican-voting professors said that they would still become professors if they could do it all over again. The authors concluded that, although such numbers are not definitive as to how faculty members feel that they have been treated, they provide some evidence against the idea that conservative faculty members are systematically discriminated against. Woessner and Kelly-Woessner also examined what might have given rise to the differences in the numbers of liberals and conservatives. They looked at the choices made by undergraduate students when planning future careers. They found that there were no differences in intellectual ability between conservative and liberal students, but that liberal students were significantly more likely to choose to pursue PhD degrees and academic careers, whereas conservative students of identical academic accomplishments were more likely to pursue business careers. They concluded that the greater numbers of liberal than conservative professors could be accounted for by self-selection in career paths, rather than by bias in hiring or promotion.\n\nLawrence Summers said at a symposium about \"The Social and Political Views of American Professors\" that he considers it a problem that some academics express an \"extreme hostility\" to conservative opinions. He observed that faculty who were invited to give Tanner Lectures on Human Values were almost always liberals, and expressed concern that an imbalance in political representation at universities could impede rigorous examination of issues. He also attributed the small numbers of conservative professors largely to the career choices made by people comparing academic careers with other options.\n\nOne outcome of these controversies was the founding of the Heterodox Academy in 2015, a bipartisan organization of professors seeking to increase the acceptance of diverse political viewpoints in academic discourse. As of February 2018, over 1500 college professors had joined Heterodox Academy. The group publishes a ranking which rates the top 150 universities in the United States based on their commitment to diversity of viewpoint.\n\nJon Shields and Joshua Dunn surveyed 153 conservative professors for their 2016 study \"Passing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University\". The authors wrote that these professors sometimes have to use \"coping strategies that gays and lesbians have used in the military and other inhospitable work environments\" in order to preserve their political identity. One tactic used by about one-third of the professors was to \"pass\" (or pretend) to hold liberal views around their colleagues. Shields stated his view that the populist right may overstate the bias that does exist and that conservatives can succeed using mechanisms like academic tenure to protect their freedom.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30138690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30138690", "title": "Proto-Italic language", "text": "Proto-Italic language\n\nThe Proto-Italic language is the ancestor of the Italic languages, including notably Latin and thus its descendants, the Romance languages. It is not directly attested in writing, but has been reconstructed to some degree through the comparative method. Proto-Italic descended from the earlier Proto-Indo-European language.\n\n\n\nProto-Italic had the following diphthongs:\n\nOsthoff's law remained productive in Proto-Italic. This caused long vowels to shorten when they were followed by a sonorant and another consonant in the same syllable: VːRC > VRC. As the long diphthongs were also VːR sequences, they could only occur word-finally, and were shortened elsewhere. Long vowels were also shortened before word-final . This is the cause of the many occurrences of short in, for example, the endings of the ā-stems or of ā-verbs.\n\nProto-Italic words had a fixed stress on the first syllable. This stress pattern probably remained in most descendants. In Latin, it remained during the Old Latin period, after which it was replaced with the \"Classical\" penultimate stress pattern.\n\nNouns could have one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. They declined for seven of the eight Proto-Indo-European cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. The instrumental case had been lost. Nouns also declined for number in singular and plural. The dual number was no longer distinguished, although a few remnants (like Latin , ) still preserved some form of the inherited dual inflection.\n\nThis is the \"second declension\" of Latin. It descends from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. Most nouns in this class were masculine or neuter, but there may have been some feminine nouns as well.\n\n\nThis class represents the \"first declension\" of Latin. It derives primarily from Proto-Indo-European nouns in , and contained mostly feminine nouns, but maybe a few masculines.\n\n\nThis class contained nouns with stems ending in a variety of consonants. They included root nouns, n-stems, r-stems, s-stems and t-stems among others. They are grouped in Latin under the \"third declension\", which also includes the i-stems, originally a distinct class.\n\nMasculine and feminine nouns declined alike, while neuters had different forms in the nominative/accusative/vocative.\n\nNouns in this class often had a somewhat irregular nominative singular form. This created several subtypes, based on the final consonant of the stem.\n\n\nOther notes:\n\nThis class represents the nouns of the Latin \"third declension\" that had the genitive plural ending \"-ium\" (rather than \"-um\"). In Latin, the consonant stems gradually merged with this class. This process continued into the historical era; e.g. in Caesar's time (c. 50 BC) the i-stems still had a distinct accusative plural ending \"-īs\", but this was replaced with the consonant-stem ending \"-ēs\" by the time of Augustus (c. 1 AD). In Proto-Italic, as in the other Italic languages, i-stems were still very much a distinct type and showed no clear signs of merging.\n\nMasculine and feminine nouns declined alike, while neuters had different forms in the nominative/accusative/vocative.\n\n\nThe u-stems form what is the \"fourth declension\" in Latin. They were historically parallel to the i-stems, and still showed many similar forms, with \"j/i\" being replaced with \"w/u\". However, sound changes had made them somewhat different over time.\n\n\nAdjectives inflected much the same as nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives did not have inherent genders. Instead, they inflected for all three genders, taking on the same gender-form as the noun they referred to.\n\nAdjectives followed the same inflectional classes of nouns. The largest were the o/ā-stem adjectives (which inflected as o-stems in the masculine and neuter, and as ā-stems in the feminine), and the i-stems. Present active participles of verbs (in \"*-nts\") and the comparative forms of adjectives (in \"*-jōs\") inflected as consonant stems. There were also u-stem adjectives originally, but they had been converted to i-stems by adding i-stem endings onto the existing u-stem, thus giving the nominative singular \"*-wis\".\n\nDeclension of Personal Pronouns:\n\nNote: For the third person pronoun, Proto-Italic would have been used.\n\nDeclension of Relative Pronouns:\n\nDeclension of Interrogative Pronouns:\n\nDeclension of Demonstrative Pronouns:\n\nPresent Aspect\n\nFrom Proto-Indo-European, the Proto-Italic present aspect changed in a couple of ways. Firstly, a new past indicative suffix of was created. This likely occurred due to the elision of word-final within the Indo-European primary verb endings (E.g. PIE Present Indicative > PIt , but also PIE Past Indicative ). Secondly, the desiderative suffix of became the future suffix in Proto-Italic. The subjunctive of this desiderative-future, with a suffix of both -s- and a lengthening of the following vowel, was used to represent a \"potentialis\" and \"irrealis\" mood. Finally, while the subjunctive and the optative of PIE were still in principle different moods, the moods became merged in Post-PIt developments (E.g. PIt subjunctive vs optative which became Latin present subjunctive ).\n\nThe PIE dual person was also lost within PIt verbs just as it was in PIt nouns.\n\nFirst Conjugation\n\nThis Conjugation pattern was derived from the PIE suffix , and formed primarily denominative verbs (I.e. deriving from a noun or an adjective).\n\nExample Conjugation: *donā- (to give)\n\nSecond Conjugation Causative\n\nThis conjugation pattern was derived from PIE *-éyeti, and formed causative verbs (I.e. expressing a cause) from \"basic\" 3rd conjugation verbs.\n\nExample Conjugation: *mone- (to warn)\n\nSecond Conjugation Stative\n\nThis conjugation pattern was derived from PIE *-éh₁ti (or the extended form *-eh₁yéti), and formed stative verbs (I.e. indicating a state of being).\n\nExample Conjugation: *walē- (to be strong)\n\nThird Conjugation\n\nThe bulk of Proto-Italic verbs were third-conjugation verbs, which were derived from Proto-Indo-European root thematic verbs. However, some are derived from other PIE verb classes, such as *linkʷō (PIE nasal-infix verbs) and *dikskō (PIE *sḱe-suffix verbs).\n\nExample Conjugation: *ed-e/o- (to eat)\n\nThird Conjugation jō-variant\n\nThis conjugation was derived from PIE *ye-suffix verbs, and went on to form most of Latin 3rd conjugation \"io\"-variant verbs as well as some 4th conjugation verbs.\n\nExample Conjugation: *gʷen-je/jo- (to come)\n\nAthematic Verbs\n\nOnly a handful of verbs remained within this conjugation paradigm, derived from the original PIE Root Athematic verbs.\n\nExample Conjugation: *ezom (copula, to be),\n\nIn addition to these conjugation, Proto-Italic also has some deponent verbs, such as *ōdai (Perfect-Present), as well as *gnāskōr (Passive-Active).\n\nPerfective Aspect\n\nAccording to Rix(2002), if a verb stem is present in both the Latino-Faliscan and Osco-Umbrian (\"Sabellian\") branches, the present stem is identical in 90% of cases, but the perfect in only 50% of cases. This is likely because the original PIE aorist merged with the perfective aspect during the Proto-Italic period. Thus, the discrepancy in the similarities of present versus perfect stems in the two groupings of the Italic clade is likely attributed to different preservations in each group. The new common perfect stem in Latino-Faliscan derives mostly from the PIE Perfective, while the perfect stem in Osco-Umbrian derives mostly from the PIE aorist.\n\nIn the Proto-Italic period, the root perfect of PIE was lost with Ablaut being no longer productive. However, other PIE perfect and aorist stems were preserved, such as the reduplicated perfect and lengthened-vowel perfect stems, as well as the sigmatic aorist stem (found in Latin \"dīcō, dīxī\").\n\nSometimes, multiple perfect forms for each stem. For example, De Vaan gives the forms \"*fēk-, *fak-\" for the perfect stem of \"*fakiō\", and the reduplicated form <FHEFHAKED> is also attested on the Praeneste fibula in Old Latin.\n\nIn addition, there were some new innovations within the perfective aspect, with the -v- perfect (in Latin \"amō, amāvī\") and the -u- perfect (\"moneō, monuī\") being later innovations, for example.\n\nExample Long-Vowel Conjugation: *fēk- (to have done). Alternatively *θēk- (from PIE \"*dʰeh₁-\") if PIt is reconstructed at a stage before /xʷ/ and /θ/ had merged with /f/ [ɸ].\n\nExample Reduplicated Conjugation: *fefu- (to have been)\n\nA list of regular phonetic changes from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Italic follows. Because Latin is the only well-attested Italic language, it forms the main source for the reconstruction of Proto-Italic. It is therefore not always clear whether certain changes apply to all of Italic (a pre-PI change), or only to Latin (a post-PI change), because of lack of conclusive evidence.\n\n\n\nThe laryngeals are a class of hypothetical PIE sounds *\"h₁\", *\"h₂\", *\"h₃\" that usually disappeared in late PIE, leaving coloring effects on adjacent vowels. Their disappearance left some distinctive sound combinations in Proto-Italic. In the changes below, the # follows standard practice in denoting a word boundary; that is, # at the beginning denotes word-initial. H denotes any of the three laryngeals.\n\nThe simpler Italic developments of laryngeals are shared by many other Indo-European branches:\n\nMore characteristic of Italic are the interactions of laryngeals with sonorant consonants. Here, R represents a sonorant, and C a consonant.\n\n\nFurther changes occurred during the evolution of individual Italic languages. This section gives an overview of the most notable changes. For complete lists, see History of Latin and other articles relating to the individual languages.\n\n\n"}

There are three registers in Burmese, which have traditionally been considered three of the four \"tones\". (The fourth is not actually but a closed syllable, called \"entering tone\" in translations of Chinese phonetics.) Jones (1986) views the differences as \"resulting from the intersection of both pitch registers and voice registers... Clearly Burmese is not tonal in the same sense as such other languages and therefore requires a different concept, namely that of pitch register.\"\n\nSimilarly, several Vietnamese \"tones\" are largely distinguished by characteristics other than pitch. For example, in Northern Vietnamese, a \"ngã\" syllable is distinguished from the \"sắc\" primarily by the presence of a glottalization in the vowel. The \"nặng\" and \"huyền\" syllables are distinguished primarily by having a short creaky vowel, as opposed to a long breathy vowel.\n\nKhmer is sometimes considered to be a register language. It has also been called a \"restructured register language\" because both its pitch and phonation can be considered allophonic. If they are ignored, the phonemic distinctions that they carry remain as differences in diphthongs and vowel length.\n\nAn example of a non-Asian language with register distinctions is Latvian, at least in the central dialects underlying the standard form. Long vowels in stressed syllables are often said to take one of three pitch accents that are conventionally called \"rising\", falling\", and \"broken\". However, the \"broken tone\" is distinguished not by pitch but by glottalization, much like the \"ngã\" register of Northern Vietnamese.\n"}

Along with section 16, section 20 is one of the few sections under the title \"Official Languages of Canada\" that guarantees bilingualism outside Parliament, legislatures and courts. This also makes it more extensive than language rights in the \"Constitution Act, 1867\". Section 20's specific function is to establish a right to English and French services from the governments of Canada and New Brunswick.\n\nSection 20 reads:\n\nSection 20 applies to services from offices of Parliament and the government of Canada, including government departments and the bureaucracy. According to some judicial decisions, it also applies to services from police departments and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, although not all police officers need to be bilingual. The section's requirements are fully applicable to the \"main\" of these offices on the federal level. Section 20 limits its rights only when dealing with the lower-level offices, where there must be considerable interest for services in both languages, or if the offices are filling a function that one would expect should be carried out in both languages.\n\nAs section 20 applies to offices besides Parliament and the courts, it is more extensive than sections 17-22 of the \"Charter\" and language rights in section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\". As far as the text is concerned, these rights are even more extensive in respect to the government of New Brunswick, where there are no requirements for considerable interest for the right to exist.\n\nAs constitutional scholar Peter Hogg notes, other provinces are not required to provide bilingual services under section 20, but some choose to do so under provincial legislation.\n\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada case \"Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents\" (1986), Justice Bertha Wilson remarked that the limited rights in section 20 seemed to contrast with section 16, which encourages growth in government bilingualism. However, she speculated Parliament could use section 16 to heighten expectations for bilingualism in section 20, by giving the requirement for considerable interest in bilingualism a flexible interpretation. Wilson did, however, write that courts could not employ this flexible interpretation.\n\nThe requirement for considerable interest was interpreted in \"Saulnier v. The Queen\", (1989), in which it was found that the Department of Fisheries violated section 20 by providing English-only services, (1) by simply presuming there was no need for French services, (2) because there were penal consequences for anyone who disobeyed the law not provided in French, and (3) even though some French Canadians understood English, French was still their first language. In \"Professional Institute of the Public Service v. The Queen\" (1993), it was added that relevant factors for requiring bilingualism should include the number of people in a minority language community, interest among the population, and relations between the people and the government. Statistics and the practices of the office might be of use in measuring these things.\n\nIn \"R. v. Haché\", (1993), it was found the government is not under any obligation to tell people that they have rights under section 20.\n\nIn 1989, a few political scientists published a survey on the public's opinion on section 20. It indicated that French Canadians strongly support French services outside Quebec and in almost equal measure support the same rights for English Quebec. Ninety-seven percent of English Canadians support the right for English Quebeckers, and 65% of English Canadians supported the rights of French Canadians under section 20.\n\n"}

The impact of vocabulary on proficiency in second language performance \"has become […] an object of considerable interest among researchers, teachers, and materials developers\"Huckin & Coady, 1999, p. 182). From being a \"neglected aspect of language learning\" (Meara, 1980, as cited in Xu & Hsu, 2017) vocabulary gained recognition in the literature and reclaimed its position in teaching. Educators shifted their attention from accuracy to fluency by moving from the Grammar translation method to communicative approaches to teaching. As a result, incidental vocabulary teaching and learning became one of the two major types of teaching programs along with the deliberate approach. \n\nThere are two major types of vocabulary learning: deliberate and incidental. vocabulary learning types and low-frequency are important components in a vocabulary teaching program. The two major types of vocabulary learning are deliberate and low-frequency. It is important to treat these types as complementary -rather than mutually exclusive- by using different vocabulary learning strategies and their combinations.\n\nScott Thornbury (2002) describes these types by stating that \"some of the words will be learned actively\", while others \"will be picked up incidentally\" (p. 32). Dodigovic (2013) and Nation (2006) emphasize the same distinction - only using a different term for the one side of this dichotomy: deliberate vocabulary learning. Nation (2006) also adds another nuance to this concept by calling it \"deliberate, decontextualized vocabulary learning\" (p. 495). Elgort (2011) to uses the term \"deliberate\", while DeCarrico (2001) prefers to talk about \"explicit versus implicit learning\" (p. 10). Other authors, although employing various terminology are also in favor of this same distinction. For example, throughout their article, Alemi and Tayebi (2011) talk of “incidental and intentional” vocabulary learning, as does also Hulstijn (2001). Expanding the terminology even further, Gu (2003) uses the terms “explicit and implicit learning mechanisms” throughout his article in discussing the second language learning strategies. Whatever terminology is used in the literature by different authors, the two major types of vocabulary learning are discussed: explicit and incidental. These two concepts should not be perceived as competitors but rather as \"mutually reinforcing\" (Nation, 2006b).\n\nIn both types of vocabulary learning or their combination, the efficiency of learning is achieved by following one or more of the vocabulary learning strategies. Different researchers look into the nature of this concept from various perspectives. Given that vocabulary learning strategies are very diverse, Schmitt(2000) suggests a summary of major vocabulary learning strategies and classify them into five groups: determination, social, memory, cognitive and meta-cognitive. Building on this classification, Xu and Hsu (2017) suggest two major categories of vocabulary learning strategies – direct and indirect. The first category includes four types of strategies: memory, cognitive and compensation strategies; the second category contains the meta-cognitive, effective and social strategies. Based on their research, Lawson and Hogben (1996) distinguish repetition as the major strategy of vocabulary learning, while Mokhtar et al. (2009) explain that ESL students prefer vocabulary strategies such as guessing and using a dictionary. \n\nOne of the major types of vocabulary learning in language acquisition is deliberate vocabulary learning. Before moving on to presenting the literature, it is important to mention that when talking about deliberate vocabulary learning, various terminologies are used by different linguists and writers. Elgort and Warren (2014), as well as Schmitt (2000), use the term explicit (which is mostly used for grammar teaching), while Nation (2006) uses the word decontextualized vocabulary learning and contrasts the term with \"learning from context\" (p. 494) without explicitly using the term incidental vocabulary learning. Intentional vocabulary learning (Dodigovic, Jeaco & Wei, 2017; Hulstijn, 2001), active learning (Thornbury, 2002), and direct instruction (Lawrence et al., 2010) are also used. However, throughout this paper, the term deliberate (Elgort, 2011; Nation, 2006) will be used to refer to this concept.\nThe advocates of deliberate vocabulary learning paradigm -for example, Coady, 1993; Nation, 1990, 2001, as cited in Ma & Kelly, 2006- agree that context is the main source for vocabulary acquisition. However, they also believe that in order to be able to build up sufficient vocabulary and acquire the necessary strategies to handle the context when reading, learners need support. Thus, extensive reading may be sufficient for developing advanced students’ vocabulary, but it has to be supplemented with deliberate vocabulary learning at lower proficiency levels (Elgort & Warren, 2014). Kennedy (2003) supports this notion and argues that deliberate learning is more appropriate for students with up to an intermediate level of proficiency, while incidental learning, which can occur outside the classroom, is more valuable with higher proficiency students. The limited classroom time should be spent on the deliberate teaching of vocabulary (Schmitt, 2000), as the main problem of vocabulary teaching is that only a few words, or a small part of what is required to know a word, can be taught at a time (Ma & Kelly, 2006). Ma and Kelly (2006) argue that learning a word requires more “deliberate mental effort” than merely being engaged in meaning-focused activities. However, according to the authors, the advocates of deliberate approach believe that it should be combined with incidental learning to be more efficient. \n\nSchmitt (2000) demonstrates that deliberate vocabulary learning, unlike incidental learning, is \"time-consuming\", and \"too laborious\". Moreover, according to Nation (2005), deliberate vocabulary learning is “one of the least efficient ways” to improve students’ vocabulary knowledge. Yet, he claims that it is a vital component in vocabulary teaching programs. However, Schmitt (2000) states that deliberate vocabulary learning gives the learners the “greatest chance” for acquiring vocabulary, as it focuses their attention directly on the target vocabulary. He presents an important concept from the field of psychology: “the more one manipulates, thinks about, and uses mental information, the more likely it is that one will retain that information” (p. 121). The deeper the processing, the more likely it is for the newly learned words to be remembered. Therefore, explicit attention should also be given to vocabulary, especially when the aim is language-focused learning (Nation, 2006b). According to Ellis (1994, as cited in Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001), while the meaning of a word requires “conscious processing” and is learned deliberately, the articulation of its form is learned incidentally because of frequent exposure. Ma and Kelly (2006) mention the necessity of establishing a link between the meaning and form of a word by various strategies, e.g., “direct memorization,” which is a strategy of deliberate vocabulary teaching.\n\nIn vocabulary teaching programs, it is also necessary to consider the frequency of the words (Nation, 2006b). Thus, high-frequency words deserve to be taught explicitly (Kennedy, 2003) and sometimes even low-frequency words can be taught and learned deliberately, for example through word cards, word part analysis, and dictionary as recommended by Nation (2006b). However, when measuring the difficulty by the results, deliberate vocabulary learning is easier than incidental learning, yet it needs more focused effort. Therefore, directing deliberate attention to the particular aspect can lighten \"the learning burden\" (Nation, 2006a).\n\nTo sum up, deliberate vocabulary learning is essential to reach a \"threshold\" of the vocabulary size and it is a \"prerequisite\" to incidental learning (Schmitt, 2000).\n\nAnother type of vocabulary learning is called incidental vocabulary learning. By its nature, incidental vocabulary learning is one of the key aspects of language acquisition. This concept, which is also referred to as passive learning (Shmidth, 1990; as cited in Alemi & Tayebi, 2011) or implicit learning (Gu, 2003), is the process of acquiring vocabulary without placing the focus on specific words to be learned (Paribakht & Wesche, 1999). It is deemed that, this type of learning should occur with low-frequency words (Nation, 2005) as the first few thousand words are better learned through deliberate learning approach (Huckin & Coady 1999). However, this may be hampered by the fact that several encounters with a word are needed before it is committed to memory (Nation, 1990), which may not be possible with low-frequency words (Nation 1990).\nAelmi and Tayebi (2011) as well as Schmitt (2000) link incidental vocabulary learning with the communicative context. The formers stress that incidental vocabulary learning occurs by \"picking up structures and lexicon of a language, through getting engaged in a variety of communicative activities\" (p. 82), while the latter indicates that producing language for \"communicational purposes\" results in incidental learning.\n\nThere is a number of factors which affect the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning. Most of the scholars agree that the best way is through extensive reading (Jian-ping, 2013; Restrepo Ramos, 2015). Restrepo Ramos (2015) indicates that “there is strong evidence that supports the occurrence of incidental vocabulary learning through reading for meaning comprehension” (p. 164). However, as research shows, 95% of the words must be familiar to the reader to understand a text (Hirsh & Nation, 1992; Laufer, 1989). According to Nation (2009), this figure is even higher, i.e., 98 percent. Huckin & Coady (1999), on the other hand, argue that \"extensive reading for meaning does not automatically lead to the acquisition of vocabulary. Much depends on the context surrounding each word, and the nature of the learner's attention\" (p. 183). While Dodigovic (2015) finds that it is the approach that matters, i.e., the bottom-up processing of readings is better than the top-down. Thus, to develop incidental vocabulary learning, the learners should be exposed to the words in different informative contexts, following the bottom-up processing of the readings.\n\n"}

However, the original meaning of the term referred to independence, being \"free as a bird\"; the current negative meaning developed only in the 16th century. It then came to predominate through the influence of Baroque poetry and of Jacob Grimm's \"Deutsche Grammatik\" (German Grammar; 1819).\n\nOriginally, the word \"vogelfrei\" merely meant \"as free as a bird, not bound.\" That is the usage in older sources. Even Luther and Zwingli used the word still in its original meaning.\n\nMuch later the term was linked to a person being banned. This resulted from the formulas:\n\nAs you have been lawfully judged and banished for murder, so I remove your body and good from the state of peace and rule them strifed and proclaim you free of any redemption and rights \"and I proclaim you as free as the birds in the air\" and the beasts in the forest and the fish in the water, and you shall not have peace nor company on any road or by any ruling of the emperor or king.\n\nand\n\nhis body should be free and accessible to all people and beasts, to the birds in the air and the fish in water so that none can be made liable for any crimes committed against him\n\nThis ban also implied that persons sentenced thus were not to be granted any dwelling. In the case of death one's body was not buried, but left for the birds to feed on.\n\nAccording to modern research the cause for the spreading of the pejorative meaning is not to be sought there but rather in the language of the mercenaries and soldiers of that time. This theory is supported by the loan word \"Preis\" [price] in German (, ), which in this context is synonymous with the word \"booty\". Malicious people would be \"\"preis gegeben und vogelfrey\" [lit: given away and free as the birds].\n\nIn his magnum opus, \"Das Kapital\" Volume I, Marx uses the term \"vogelfrei\" to refer to the emergence of the proletariat during the decay of feudalism:\n\nThe proletariat created by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible expropriation of the people from the soil, this free and rightless* [\"vogelfrei\"] proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by the nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world. On the other hand, these men, suddenly dragged from their accustomed mode of life, could not immediately adapt themselves to the discipline of their new condition. They were turned in massive quantities into beggars, robbers and vagabonds, partly from inclination, in most cases under the force of circumstances. Hence at the end of the fifteenth and during the whole of the sixteenth centuries, a bloody legislation against vagabondage was enforced throughout Western Europe. The fathers of the present working class were chastised for their enforced transformation into vagabonds and paupers. Legislation treated them as ‘voluntary’ criminals, and assumed that it was entirely within their powers to go on working under the old conditions which in fact no longer existed.\n\nMarx calls this second group free or “bird-free” (\"vogelfrei\"), meaning at one and the same time that while the proletariat are not property (as slaves), they are themselves without property and cast out of the community of property owners.\n\n\n"}
