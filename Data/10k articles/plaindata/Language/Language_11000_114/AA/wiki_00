Each party competes to produce more weapons, larger military, superior military technology, etc. in a technological escalation.\n\nInternational conflict specialist Theresa Clair Smith, defines the term as \"the participation of two or more nation-states in apparently competitive or interactive increases in quantity or quality of war material and/or persons under arms.\"\n\nThe term is also used to describe any long-term escalating competitive situation where each competitor focuses on out-doing the others.\n\nFrom 1897 to 1914, a naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany took place. British concern about rapid increase in German naval power resulted in a costly building competition of \"Dreadnought\"-class ships. This tense arms race lasted until 1914, when the war broke out. After the war, a new arms race developed among the victorious Allies, which was temporarily ended by the Washington Naval Treaty.\n\nIn addition to the British and Germans, contemporaneous but smaller naval arms races also broke out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire; the Ottomans and Greece; France and Italy; the United States and Japan; and Brazil, Argentina, and Chile.\n\nA nuclear arms race developed during the Cold War, an intense period between the Soviet Union and the United States and some other countries. This was one of the main causes that began the cold war, and perceived advantages of the adversary by both sides (such as the \"missile gap\" and “bomber gap”) led to large spending on armaments and the stockpiling of vast nuclear arsenals. Proxy wars were fought all over the world (e.g. in the Middle East, Korea, Vietnam) in which the superpowers' conventional weapons were pitted against each other. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, tensions decreased and the nuclear arsenal of both countries were reduced.\n\nMore generically, the term \"arms race\" is used to describe any competition where there is no absolute goal, only the relative goal of staying ahead of the other competitors in rank or knowledge. An arms race may also imply futility as the competitors spend a great deal of time and money, yet end up in the same situation as if they had never started the arms race. \n\nAn evolutionary arms race is a system where two populations are evolving in order to continuously one-up members of the other population. This concept is related to the Red Queen's Hypothesis, where two organisms co-evolve to overcome each other but each fails to progress relative to the other interactant.\n\nIn technology, there are close analogues to the arms races between parasites and hosts, such as the arms race between computer virus writers and antivirus software writers, or spammers against Internet service providers and E-mail software writers.\n\n\n"}

In early ships the crow's nest was simply a barrel or a basket lashed to the tallest mast. Later it became a specially designed platform with protective railing.\n\nAccording to a popular naval legend, the term derives from the practice of Viking sailors, who carried crows or ravens in a cage secured to the top of the mast. In cases of poor visibility, a crow was released, and the navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird's flight path because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land. Some naval scholars have found no evidence of the masthead crow cage and suggest the name was coined simply because the lookout platform resembled a crow's nest in a tree. As ships grew in size and complexity, that station came to be mounted on the highest mast of the oceangoing vessel, and it came to be known as the \"crow's nest\". The simplest construction to providing a lookout and setting course direction for the ship was to lash a barrel to the mast. A member of the crew experienced in the matters of navigation was charged with manning this perch and came to be colloquially known as a barrelman.\n\nIn Newfoundland the term \"barrelman\" was synonymous with the word \"scunner\".\n\n"}
{"id": "7998206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7998206", "title": "Bengali dialects", "text": "Bengali dialects\n\nThe dialects of the Bengali language (বাংলা উপভাষাসমূহ \"Bangla Upobhashashomuho\") are part of the Eastern Indo-Aryan language group of the Indo-European language family widely spoken in the Bengal region of South Asia. Although the spoken dialects of Bengali are mutually intelligible with neighbouring dialects, they sometimes lack mutual intelligibility with the Standard Bengali language and sometimes would not be understood by a native speaker of Standard Bengali. However, the Standard Bengali emerges from the West-Central or Rarhi dialect spoken mainly in Kolkata and Nadia districts.\n\nBengali dialects can be thus classified along at least two dimensions: spoken vs. literary variations, and prestige vs. regional variations.\n\nSuniti Kumar Chatterji and Sukumar Sen classified Bengali Dialects in 5 classes by their phonology & pronunciation. They are:\n\n1. Rarhi dialect: This dialect is spoken in the much Southern part of West Bengal. Spoken form Presidency Division, Murshidabad, Hooghly & Eastern Burdwan are fallen under this dialect.\n\n2. Bangali dialect: Bangali is the most widely spoken dialect of Bengali language. Spoken form of Khulna Division, Barisal Division, Dhaka Division, Mymensingh Division, Comilla Division and Tripura are fallen under Bangali dialect.\n\n3. Varendri dialect: This variety is spoken in Malda, South Dinajpur & much of Rajshahi Division (previously part of Varendra or Barind division).\n\n4. Jharkhandi dialect: Jharkhandi is spoken in western most districts like Burdwan, Bankura, Medinipur & Purulia in West Bengal and it is the dialect of Bengali spoken in Santhal Pargana division and Kolhan division in Jharkhand and its nearby Bengali spoken regions.\n\n5. Rajbanshi dialect: This dialect is spoken in Rangpur Division of Bangladesh & northernmost district of West Bengal like North Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar & it's nearby Bengali spoken areas.\n\n6. Sundarbani dialect: Some linguists have also mentioned this. Dialect of Satkhira District & 24 Parganas district don't share the common features of both Bangali & Rarhi dialects. So that this dialect is classified as a unique dialect.\n\nIn addition to the six above, there is also Sylheti, which is considered by some as a dialect while others consider it as a separate language due to the history of the Greater Sylhet region and the fact that the language has had its own script in the past. Secondly, there is the Chittagonian language which is also does not fit the other categories due to it being equally similar to both the Bengali language and the Rohingya language.\n\nMore than other languages of South Asia, Bengali exhibits strong diglossia between the formal, written language and the vernacular, spoken language. Two styles of writing, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax, have emerged :\n\nSpoken Bengali exhibits far more variation than written Bengali. Formal spoken Bengali, including what is heard in news reports, speeches, announcements, and lectures, is modelled on Choltibhasha. This form of spoken Bengali stands alongside other spoken dialects, or \"Ancholik Bangla\" (আঞ্চলিক বাংলা) (i.e. 'regional Bengali'). The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one dialect – often, speakers are fluent in Choltibhasha, one or more Ancholik dialect, and one or more forms of \"Gramyo Bangla\" (গ্রাম্য বাংলা) (i.e. 'rural Bengali'), dialects specific to a village or town.\n\nTo a non-Bengali, these dialects may sound or look vastly different, but the differences are mostly in phonology and vocabulary, and not so much a grammatical one, one exception is the addition of grammatical gender in some eastern dialects. Many dialects share features with the so-called \"Shadhu Bhasha\" or \"pure language\", which was the written standard until the 19th century. Comparison of Bengali dialects gives us an idea about archaic forms of the language as well.\n\nDuring standardisation of Bengali in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cultural elite were mostly from the regions of Kolkata, Hooghly, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and Nadia. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect. While the language has been standardised today through two centuries of education and media, variation is widespread, with many speakers familiar with or fluent in both their socio-geographical variety as well as the standard dialect used in the media.\n\nDialectal differences in Bengali manifest themselves in three forms: standardised dialect vs. regional dialect, literary language vs. colloquial language and lexical (vocabulary) variations. The name of the dialects generally originates from the district where the language is spoken.\n\nWhile the standard form of the language does not show much variation across the Bengali-speaking areas of South Asia, regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a dialect continuum. Mostly speech varies across distances of just few miles and takes distinct forms among the religious communities. Apart from the present dialects, there are a few more which have disappeared. For example, 'Bikramapuri', Sātagāiyã' (this is the name used in East Bengal for the dialect of South-western Rarh region). The present dialects of Bengali are listed below with an example sentence meaning:\n\nThese dialect are mostly spoken in and around the Bhagirathi River basin, in West Central Bengal. The standard form of the colloquial language (\"Choltibhasha\") has developed out of the Nadia dialect.\n\nhut/hola asilo. (P)\n\nThis dialect is mainly spoken in the districts of North Bengal. These are the only dialects in Bangladesh that pronounce the letters চ, ছ, জ, and ঝ as affricates , , , and , respectively, and preserve the breathy-voiced stops in all parts of the word, much like Western dialects (including Standard Bengali). The dialects of Rangpur and Pabna do not have contrastive nasalised vowels.\n\nThis dialect is spoken in the area which is known as Manbhum.\n\nThe latter two, along with Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia, are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Rajbangsi and Hajong are considered separate languages, although they are very similar to North Bengali dialects. There are many more minor dialects as well, including those spoken in the bordering districts of Purnea and Singhbhum and among the tribals of the eastern Bangladesh like the Hajong and the Chakma.\n\nThere are marked dialectal differences between the speech of Bengalis living on the পশ্চিম \"Poshchim\" (western) side and পূর্ব \"Purbo\" (eastern) side of the Padma River.\n\nBengali dialects include Eastern and Southeastern Bengali dialects: The Eastern dialects serve as the primary colloquial language of the Dhaka district. In contrast to Western dialects where ট　 and ড are unvoiced and voiced retroflex stops respectively, most Eastern and Southeastern dialects pronounce them as apical alveolar and , especially in less formal speech. These dialects also lack contrastive nasalised vowels or a distinction in approximant র , tap ড় and flap ঢ় , pronouncing them mostly as , although some speakers may realise র when occurring before a consonant or prosodic break. This is also true of the Sylheti language, which has a lot in common with the Kamrupi dialect of Assam in particular, and is often considered a separate language. The Eastern dialects extend into Southeastern dialects, which include parts of Chittagong. The Chittagongian dialect has Tibeto-Burman influences.\n\nIn the dialects prevalent in much of eastern Bangladesh (Barisal, Chittagong, and Dhaka), many of the stops and affricates heard in Kolkata Bengali are pronounced as fricatives.\n\nPoshchim Bengali (Western Bengali) palato-alveolar affricates চ , ছ , জ , and ঝ correspond to Purbo Bengali (Eastern Bengali) চʻ ~, ছ় ~, জʻ ~, and ঝ় . A similar pronunciation is also found in Assamese, a related language across the border in India.\n\nThe aspirated velar stop খ and the aspirated labial stop ফ of Poshchim Bengali correspond to খ় ~ in some and ফ় ~ in many dialects of Purbo Bengali. \n\nMany Purbo Bengali dialects share phonological features with Assamese, including the debuccalisation of শ to হ or খ় .\n\nThe influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Purbo Bengali (Bangladesh) is seen through the lack of nasalised vowels, an alveolar articulation for the Retroflex stops ট , ঠ , ড , and ঢ , resembling the equivalent phonemes in languages such as Thai and Lao and the lack of distinction between র and ড়/ঢ় . Unlike most languages of the region, some Purbo Bengali dialects do not include the breathy voiced stops ঘ , ঝ , ঢ , ধ , and ভ . Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bengali, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. In dialects such as Hajong of northern Bangladesh, there is a distinction between \"উ\" and \"ঊ\" , the first corresponding exactly to its standard counterpart but the latter corresponding to the Japanese sound . There is also a distinction between \"ই\" and \"ঈ\" in many northern Bangladeshi dialects. \"ই\" representing the sound whereas \"ঈ\" represents a .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6701893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6701893", "title": "Bornholmsk dialect", "text": "Bornholmsk dialect\n\nBornholmsk is a Danish dialect spoken on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. It was originally part of the East Danish dialect continuum, which includes the dialects of southern Sweden, but became isolated in the Danish dialect landscape after 1658, when Sweden annexed Skåne, Halland and Blekinge.\n\nThe language is more generally spoken than written, despite the existence of several Bornholmsk-Danish dictionaries and a regular Bornholmsk article in the local newspaper. Even words that are never used in Standard Danish are spelled according to the standard orthography.\n\nThe dialect is endangered, as the inhabitants of Bornholm have been shifting to standard Danish over the past century. \"Bevar Bornholmsk\" is an organization whose purpose is to preserve Bornholmsk. Its main organization is KulturBornholm, the editor of books with CDs with the text in Bornholmsk.\n\nThe small island has only about 40,000 inhabitants, yet the language is divided into five main dialects, not counting standard Danish. As an example, \"eye\" would be spelled \"iva\" in some regions, but elsewhere it would be \"øja\", which is quite close to the Danish word \"øje\".\n\nThe northern part of the island would have more influence by Swedish than the rest of the island, due to the relatively large number of Swedish immigrants on those shores closest to Sweden. The differences are actually large enough so that the north-Bornholm dialect is called \"Allinge-svensk\" (\"Allinge-Swedish\") in Danish – \"Âlinga-svænsk\" in Bornholmsk.\n\nLike in the case of the closely related Scanian dialect spoken in Southern Sweden, the question whether the dialect is Danish or Swedish cannot be separated from the political and ideological burden attached to language as an ethnic marker. Therefore, Danes from other parts of the country may accuse people from Bornholm for speaking Swedish as a kind of insult (using derogatory nicknames like \"reservesvensker\", \"auxiliary Swede\").\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, the Scandinavian languages form a continuum, and the dialects of Skåne and Bornholm are a natural bridge between \"sjællandsk\" (the dialect of Zealand) and \"götamål\" (the dialect of Götaland). One may define \"Danish\" and Swedish\" in two different ways:\nAccording to both criteria, Bornholmsk is indeed a Danish dialect (whereas Scanian would be Swedish according to the second one).\n\nBornholmsk has indeed many phonetical features in common with Swedish (most of them archaisms, though, which are irrelevant for the classification of the dialect). Yet, in most cases where the vocabularies of Swedish and Danish differ, Bornholmsk stands with Danish.\n\nAn official standardised orthography of Bornholmsk does not exist since Standard Danish is taught in schools and is the language of all public communication. However, dialect texts use a simplified phonetical alphabet (invented by K.J. Lyngby in the 19th century and also employed in Espersen's dictionary of Bornholmsk):\n\nA stressed syllable always contains either a long vowel or a long consonant (like in Swedish, but unlike Standard Danish, where there are no long consonants). Bornholmsk does not have the stød characteristic of most varieties of Danish, but on the other hand, it does not have the musical accent characteristic of Swedish and Norwegian either.\n\nIn the list, there is special emphasis on the developments that set Bornholmsk apart from Standard Danish. For the sake of convenience, Old Norse (i.e. Old Icelandic) forms have been quoted instead of Old Danish forms.\n\nBornholmsk has retained three distinct grammatical genders, like Icelandic or Norwegian, and unlike standard Danish or Swedish. The gender inflection exists not only in the definite article (like in Norwegian and certain Danish dialects), but also in the adjectives:\n\n\"-er\" is the old ending of the masculine nominative still extant in German (\"-er\"), Icelandic (\"-ur\") and Faroese (\"-ur\"), but lost in the other Scandinavian dialects (except for certain old phrases like Danish \"en ungersvend\", originally \"en unger svend\", \"a young fellow\"). In Bornholmsk, it is used in all cases (since the dialect has not retained the Old Danish case flexion).\n\nMasculine nouns normally have the plural ending \"-a\" - and this is also the case when the singular ends in a vowel (where Standard Danish would have \"-er\"), e.g. \"skâwwa\" \"woods\" (sg. \"skâww\"), \"tima\" \"hours\" (sg. \"tima\"). Feminine nouns have \"-er\" or, when they end in a vowel in the singular, \"-ar\". Neuter nouns have zero ending, and the definite article of the neuter plural is \"-en\", e.g. \"huz\" \"houses\", \"huzen\" \"the houses\" (sg. \"huz\")\n\nBornholmsk has an enclitic form of the personal pronoun that is unknown in the other Danish dialects, namely masculine \"-iń\" \"him\" and feminine \"-na\" \"her\". They originate from the old accusatives \"hann\" and \"hana\" still used in Icelandic, whereas the Scandinavian languages, apart from dialects of for example Swedish, normally use the old dative form for the oblique case (Danish \"ham\", \"hende\", Swedish \"honom\", \"henne\"). These enclitic forms also occur in spoken Norwegian, where \"-n\" is masculine and \"-a\" is feminine. Colloquial and dialectal Swedish has them as well: jag har sett'n/sett'na \"I have seen him/her\".\n\nUntil the 20th century, Bornholmsk inflected the verbs in number, e.g. \"jâ bińńer\" \"I bind\" ~ \"vi bińńa\" \"we bind\", \"jâ bânt\" \"I bound\" ~ \"vi bonne\" \"we bound\". Spoken Danish gave up this inflection in the 18th century already, even though it was still practiced in the literary language until it was officially cancelled in 1900 (\"jeg binder\" ~ \"vi binde\").\n\nBornholmsk also has special endings for the 2nd person, when a pronoun follows immediately after the ending, namely \"-st\" in the singular and \"-en\" in the plural:\n\nBeginning of a poem printed in Espersen's \"Bornholmsk Ordbog\" (the orthography has been slightly changed).\n\nInterview with a native speaker from Ibsker.

{"id": "17672359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17672359", "title": "Carbon diet", "text": "Carbon diet\n\nA carbon diet refers to reducing the impact on climate change by reducing greenhouse gas production specifically, CO2 production. In today’s society, humans produce CO2 in every day activities such as driving, heating, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. It has been found that carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heat is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions. For years, governments and corporations have been attempting to balance out their emissions by participating in carbon-offsetting — the practice in which they invest in renewable energy to compensate for the global-warming pollution that they produce. Despite these efforts the results are still far off and we continue to see growth in CO2 concentration. Now, a growing number of individuals are trying to make a reduction in the amount of CO2 that is being produced by participating in low carbon dieting. This small adjustment in household CO2 production has the potential to reduce emissions much more quickly than other kinds of changes and it deserves explicit consideration as part of climate policy. It can potentially help avoid “overshoot” of greenhouse gas concentration targets; provide a demonstration effect; reduce emissions at low cost; and buy time to develop new technologies, policies, and institutions to reach long-term greenhouse gas emission targets and to develop adaptation strategies.\n\nGlobal carbon dioxide concentrations are beginning to rise on an annual basis. According to senior NASA scientist Roy Spencer, the reality of global warming should not be disputed and that we should instead turn our attention towards the growth per year. The past decade has produced nine of the eleven hottest years recorded this century. The resulting buildup of carbon in areas such as the atmosphere, oceans, and soil contain a major threat to life. The threat of global warming has been an issue we have discovered due to high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but have not addressed as a global community. Not only is climate change an environmental issue, it is also a humanitarian and economical one as well because of the massive global impact it has. We continue to live our lives as if we are not at the forefront of the problem as politicians tell us that global warming is a natural occurrence instead of a man-made one. As human beings, we are the focal point of the problem. It is our duty to be the ones who salvage the remaining resources we have left for future generations. An idea that has been put forth by multiple carbon resource management agencies recently is the utilization of cap-and-trade market systems. With cap-and-trade systems, these agencies are able to trade permits for carbon sources so that the reservoirs are partitioned amongst various groups. Implementing such a system will result in a decrease of carbon dioxide emissions over time as long as it is utilized effectively from all parties involved. However, as long as there is economic growth there is lesser chance of governing bodies providing sufficient amounts of funding in order to repair the damage that has been done by pollution. The budget that governments allocate to resource preservation initiatives are far below the amount that needs to be allocated in order to see real change. It is estimated that the value of emissions permits will be roughly $60 billion a year in 2012 and will continue to increase up to $113 billion 2025.\n\nThere are many ways that individual households can participate in low carbon dieting. Reducing electricity expenditure by using energy efficient light bulbs and appliances can drastically shift the impact of CO2 emissions created by modern households. Common examples of alternate energy sources are hydro and wind systems as they are cleaner than natural gas and other alternate forms of energy production. The development of hybrid cars have been a popular idea amongst car companies in order to provide customers with an option that is economically and environmentally appealing. A common behavior that severely impacts the environment is idling in a vehicle for long periods of time; leading to upwards of 17% of the gasoline being burned into the atmosphere. Driving less and using alternate forms of transportation such as bicycles can also help reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Some other research conducted by the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan found some interesting facts on the impact of CO2 in the United States and how to reduce CO2 emissions in U.S households. It was found that washing clothes on ‘cold’ reduces CO2 emissions by 1.2-14.9 pounds per laundry load, depending on washing machine type, hot water temperature, and electricity source. It was also found that eating all locally grown food for one year could save the greenhouse gas equivalent of driving 1,000 miles, while eating a vegetarian meal one day a week could save the equivalent of driving 1,160 miles. \nA vegetarian diet greatly reduces an individual’s carbon footprint, but switching between different types of meat can have a major impact as well. For example, replacing all beef consumption with chicken for one year leads to an annual carbon footprint reduction of 882 pounds of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalency).\n\nClimate change mitigation policies tend to focus on the energy sector, while the livestock sector receives surprisingly little attention, despite the fact that it accounts for 18% of the greenhouse gas emissions. There has been some research conducted by using an integrated assessment model finding a global food transition to less meat, or even a complete switch to plant-based protein food to have a dramatic effect on land use. Up to 2,700 Mha of pasture and 100 Mha of cropland could be abandoned, resulting in a large carbon uptake from regrowing vegetation. Additionally, methane and nitrous oxide emission would be reduced substantially. Some food choices supply energy more efficiently than others, for instance, 20 kilograms of feed must be provided to cattle in order to produce 1 kilogram of edible produce. If an organism is placed high on the trophic level the greater the loss of energy due to digestion and metabolism. A cow needs to eat a lot of food in order to maintain its body mass and muscle tissue, but the nutritional benefits of the food is diminished once it is digested and metabolized. A diet developed around plant based food items are seen as energy efficient as they utilize the Sun’s energy for photosynthesis. Based on an average 2,000 kcal diet, the high meat diet had 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions than the average 2,000 kcal vegan diet.\n\nThe production of CO2 continues to be a global issue in relation to climate change. Although the research has only been conducted for certain countries thus far, these strategies to reduce CO2 emissions per household can be effective globally if acted upon. The simplicity of carbon dieting in households and its potential for significant change needs to become an idea that is promoted around the world. If carbon dieting becomes a norm in households we could see a major change in greenhouse gas emissions and therefore a reduction in global warming.\n\nA carbon diet is similar to a food diet. It starts with assessing weight (measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide) and then determining where the ideal weight should be. The following outlines the steps of a carbon diet:\n\n\n"}

Catastrophic failures often lead to cascading systems failure. The term is most commonly used for structural failures, but has often been extended to many other disciplines in which total and irrecoverable loss occurs. Such failures are investigated using the methods of forensic engineering, which aims to isolate the cause or causes of failure.\n\nFor example, catastrophic failure can be observed in steam turbine rotor failure, which can occur due to peak stress on the rotor; stress concentration increases up to a point at which it is excessive, leading ultimately to the failure of the disc.\n\nIn firearms, catastrophic failure usually refers to a rupture or disintegration of the barrel or receiver of the gun when firing it. Some possible causes of this are an out-of-battery gun, an inadequate headspace, the use of incorrect ammunition, the use of ammunition with an incorrect propellant charge, a partially or fully obstructed barrel, or weakened metal in the barrel or receiver.

{"id": "1971206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971206", "title": "Coercion (linguistics)", "text": "Coercion (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, coercion is a term applied to a process of reinterpretation that is triggered by a mismatch between the semantic properties of a selector and the semantic properties of the selected element. The term was first used in the semantic literature by Marc Moens and Mark Steedman, who adopted it on \"loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages\". In the framework of the generative lexicon (a formal compositional approach to lexical semantics), Pustejovsky (1995:111) defines coercion as \"a semantic operation that converts an argument to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error.\" \"Coercion\" in the Pustejovsky framework includes complement coercion and aspectual coercion.\n\nAn example of complement coercion is the sentence \"I began the book\", where the predicate \"began\" is assumed to be a selector which requires its complement to denote an event, but \"a book\" denotes an entity, not an event. So, on the coercion analysis, \"begin\" coerces \"a book\" from an entity to an event involving that entity, allowing the sentence to be interpreted to mean, e.g., \"I began to read a book,\" or \"I began to write a book.\" \n\nAn example of aspectual coercion involving temporal connectives is \"Let's leave after dessert\" (Pustejovsky 1995:230). Another example of aspectual coercion from psycholinguistics research includes sentences such as \"The tiger jumped for an hour,\" where the prepositional phrase \"for an hour\" coerces the lexical meaning of \"jump\" to be iterative across the entire duration.\n\nCoercion is closely related to the notions of active zone, construal/conceptualization, and syntactic accommodation known from various schools within the cognitive linguistics movement.\n"}
{"id": "3777235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3777235", "title": "Deleted scene", "text": "Deleted scene\n\nA deleted scene is footage that has been removed from the final version of a film or television show. \n\nA related term is extended scene, the longer version of a scene that was shortened for the final version of the film. Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with for instance, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and \"Serenity\".\n\nScenes are often removed from films at the request of a studio or network, or to reduce running time or to improve narrative flow.\n\nThe studio or network planning to air or distribute it may be uncomfortable with a certain scene. It may ask for it be altered, removed, or replaced.\n\nThat is most common in the production of television series since networks and channels often must be mindful of how viewers, critics, or censors will react to programming. There may be a fear of losing ratings, being punished by fines or otherwise, or having trouble finding advertisers.\n\n\n\nConcerns about running time may also cause scenes to be removed or shortening.\n\nIn feature films, scenes may be cut to reduce the length of the film's theatrical cut. In television serials, however, running time becomes an even greater concern because of the strict timeslot limitations, especially on channels supported by advertisements, and there may be only 20 minutes of actual show per half-hour timeslot. Depending on the station and the particular format of the show, that may or may not include opening credits or closing credits; many ad-supported stations now \"squish\" the closing credits or force them into a split-screen to show more advertising. Most programs are in either a half-hour or a one-hour timeslot. That forces producers of television serials to break up the acts in a manner that will (hopefully) make the viewer want to continue watching after the ad break and to avoid exceeding the stricter running time limits.\n\nThough the quality of the initial and the final cuts of a film is subjective, a scene or version of a scene in a film may have an adverse effect on the film as a whole. It may slow the film down, provide unnecessary details or exposition, or even explain points that should be implied or said more subtly. It is common to remove such scenes at the editing level, but they may be released on the home video release, as a bonus feature.\n\nThere are at least a few examples, including a number of the deleted scenes on the DVD release of the sequel film \"Serenity\" (in fact, the audio commentary on the DVD's deleted scenes collection quite often mentions the plot or the tension being disrupted or slowed by including a scene or too much expositional as the main reason for the scene's removal from the final theatrical cut. Another well known example is the cocoon sequence in the film \"Alien\". The scene added a lot of information about the fate of several crew members and new information on the life cycle of the creature, but it was ultimately deleted, as it was thought to slow down and to disrupt the tension of the end of the film.\n\nDeleted or extended scenes may be in any of several different formats. They may or may not feature finished special effects (especially in science fiction and fantasy films in which visual effects are more expensive), and the film quality may or may not be the same as in the rest of the film, but that may depend only on how much post-production editing was done.\n\nAdditionally, deleted scenes of animated films may not be in the form of a fully animated scene but instead be included in the form of an animatic or a blooper form, as is the case with the deleted scenes on the DVD release of Pixar's \"Toy Story\" and \"Finding Nemo\".\n\nThe DVD release for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s feature film also featured not only a handful of regular deleted scenes but also two spoof \"Really Deleted\" scenes.\n\n\"YTV\"s ZAPX sometimes makes \"deleted scenes\" that are not genuine deleted scenes but random scenes of the movie with footage of the program's host, Simon, inserted into the clip, for that purpose.\n\nOn the DVD for \"UHF\", \"Weird Al\" Yankovic provides commentary of the deleted scenes and emphasizes that there are hours of film footage but that they were all removed for good reasons.\n\n"}

{"id": "10803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10803", "title": "Finno-Ugric languages", "text": "Finno-Ugric languages\n\nFinno-Ugric ( or ), Finno-Ugrian or Fenno-Ugric is a traditional grouping of all languages in the Uralic language family except the Samoyedic languages. Its commonly accepted status as a subfamily of Uralic is based on criteria formulated in the 19th century and is criticized by some contemporary linguists. The three most-spoken Uralic languages, Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, are all included in Finno-Ugric, although linguistic roots common to both branches of the traditional Finno-Ugric language tree (Finno-Permic and Ugric) are distant.\n\nThe term \"Finno-Ugric\", which originally referred to the entire family, is sometimes used as a synonym for the term \"Uralic\", which includes the Samoyedic languages, as commonly happens when a language family is expanded with further discoveries.\n\nThe validity of Finno-Ugric as a genetic grouping is under challenge, with some feeling that the Finno-Permic languages are as distinct from the Ugric languages as they are from the Samoyedic languages spoken in Siberia, or even that none of the Finno-Ugric, Finno-Permic, or Ugric branches has been established. Received opinion has been that the easternmost (and last-discovered) Samoyed had separated first and the branching into Ugric and Finno-Permic took place later, but this reconstruction does not have strong support in the linguistic data.\n\nAttempts at reconstructing a Proto-Finno-Ugric protolanguage, a common ancestor of all Uralic languages except for the Samoyedic languages, are largely indistinguishable from Proto-Uralic, suggesting that Finno-Ugric might not be a historical grouping but a geographical one, with Samoyedic being distinct by lexical borrowing rather than actually being historically divergent. It has been proposed that the area in which Proto-Finno-Ugric was spoken reached between the Baltic Sea and the Ural Mountains.\n\nTraditionally, the main set of evidence for the genetic proposal of Proto-Finno-Ugric has come from vocabulary. A large amount of vocabulary (e.g. the numerals \"one\", \"three\", \"four\" and \"six\"; the body-part terms \"hand\", \"head\") is only reconstructed up to the Proto-Finno-Ugric level, and only words with a Samoyedic equivalent have been reconstructed for Proto-Uralic. That methodology has been criticised, as no coherent explanation other than inheritance has been presented for the origin of most of the Finno-Ugric vocabulary (though a small number has been explained as old loanwords from Proto-Indo-European or its immediate successors). \n\nThe Samoyedic group has undergone a longer period of independent development, and its divergent vocabulary could be caused by mechanisms of replacement such as language contact. (The Finno-Ugric group is usually dated to approximately 4000 years ago, the Samoyedic a little over 2000.) Proponents of the traditional binary division note, however, that the invocation of extensive contact influence on vocabulary is at odds with the grammatical conservatism of Samoyedic.\n\nThe consonant \"*š\" (voiceless postalveolar fricative, ) has not been conclusively shown to occur in the traditional Proto-Uralic lexicon, but it is attested in some of the Proto-Finno-Ugric material. Another feature attested in the Finno-Ugric vocabulary is that \"*i\" now behaves as a neutral vowel with respect to front-back vowel harmony, and thus there are roots such as \"*niwa-\" \"to remove the hair from hides\".\n\nRegular sound changes proposed for this stage are few and remain open to interpretation. Sammallahti (1988) proposes five, following Janhunen's (1981) reconstruction of Proto-Finno-Permic:\nSammallahti (1988) further reconstructs sound changes \"*oo\", \"*ee\" → \"*a\", \"*ä\" (merging with original \"*a\", \"*ä\") for the development from Proto-Finno-Ugric to Proto-Ugric. Similar sound laws are required for other languages as well. Thus, the origin and raising of long vowels may actually belong at a later stage, and the development of these words from Proto-Uralic to Proto-Ugric can be summarized as simple loss of \"*x\" (if it existed in the first place at all; vowel length only surfaces consistently in the Baltic-Finnic languages.) The proposed raising of \"*o\" has been alternately interpreted instead as a lowering \"*u\" → \"*o\" in Samoyedic (PU *\"lumi\" → \"*lomə\" → Proto-Samoyedic \"*jom\").\n\nJanhunen (2007, 2009) notes a number of derivational innovations in Finno-Ugric, including \"*ńoma\" \"hare\" → \"*ńoma-la\", (vs. Samoyedic \"*ńomå\"), \"*pexli\" \"side\" → \"*peel-ka\" → \"*pelka\" \"thumb\", though involving Proto-Uralic derivational elements.\n\nThe Finno-Ugric group is not typologically distinct from Uralic as a whole: the most widespread structural features among the group all extend to the Samoyedic languages as well.\n\nModern linguistic research has shown that Volgaic languages is a geographical classification rather than a linguistic one, because the Mordvinic languages are more closely related to the Finno-Lappic languages than the Mari languages.\n\nThe relation of the Finno-Permic and the Ugric groups is adjudged remote by some scholars. On the other hand, with a projected time depth of only 3,000 to 4,000 years, the traditionally accepted Finno-Ugric grouping would be far younger than many major families such as Indo-European or Semitic, and would be about the same age as, for instance, the Eastern subfamily of Nilotic. But the grouping is far from transparent or securely established. The absence of early records is a major obstacle. As for the Finno-Ugric Urheimat, most of what has been said about it is speculation.\n\nSome linguists criticizing the Finno-Ugric genetic proposal also question the validity of the entire Uralic family, instead proposing a Ural–Altaic hypothesis, within which they believe Finno-Permic may be as distant from Ugric as from Turkic. However, this approach has been rejected by nearly all other specialists in Uralic linguistics.\n\nOne argument in favor of the Finno-Ugric grouping has come from loanwords. Several loans from the Indo-European languages are present in most or all of the Finno-Ugric languages, while being absent from Samoyedic; many others also must be for phonological reasons dated as quite old.\n\nAccording to Häkkinen (1983) the alleged Proto-Finno-Ugric loanwords are disproportionally well-represented in Hungarian and the Permic languages, and disproportionally poorly represented in the Ob-Ugric languages; hence it is possible that such words have been acquired by the languages only after the initial dissolution of the Uralic family into individual dialects, and that the scarcity of loanwords in Samoyedic results from its peripheric location.\n\nThe number systems among the Finno-Ugric languages are particularly distinct from the Samoyedic languages: only the numerals \"2\" and \"5\" have cognates in Samoyedic, while also the numerals, \"1\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"10\" are shared by all or most Finno-Ugric languages.\n\nBelow are the numbers 1 to 10 in several Finno-Ugric languages. Forms in \"italic\" do not descend from the reconstructed forms.\n\nThe number '2' descends in Ugric from a front-vocalic variant *kektä.\n\nThe numbers '9' and '8' in Finnic through Mari are considered to be derived from the numbers '1' and '2' as '10–1' and '10–2'. One reconstruction is *\"yk+teksa\" and *\"kak+teksa\" respectively, where *\"teksa\" cf. \"deka\" is an Indo-European loan; notice that the difference between /t/ and /d/ is not phonemic, unlike in Indo-European. Another analysis is *\"ykt-e-ksa\", *\"kakt-e-ksa\", with *\"e\" being the negative verb.\n\n100-word Swadesh lists for certain Finno-Ugric languages can be compared and contrasted at the Rosetta Project website:\nFinnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Erzya.\n\nThe four largest groups that speak Finno-Ugric languages are Hungarians (14.5 million), Finns (6.5 million), Estonians (1.1 million), and Mordvins (0.85 million). Three (Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit independent nation-states, Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, while the Mordvins have an autonomous Mordovian Republic within Russia. The traditional area of the indigenous Sami people is in Northern Fenno-Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula in Northwest Russia and is known as Sápmi. Some other Finno-Ugric peoples have autonomous republics in Russia: Karelians (Republic of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic), Mari (Mari El Republic), and Mordvins (Moksha and Erzya; Republic of Mordovia). Khanty and Mansi peoples live in the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug of Russia, while Komi-Permyaks live in Komi-Permyak Okrug, which used to be an autonomous okrug of Russia, but today is a territory with special status within Perm Krai.\n\nThe linguistic reconstruction of the Finno-Ugric language family has led to the postulation that the ancient Proto–Finno-Ugric people were ethnically related, and that even the modern Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples are ethnically related. Such hypotheses are based on the assumption that heredity can be traced through linguistic relatedness, although it must be kept in mind that language shift and ethnic admixture, a relatively frequent and common occurrence both in recorded history and most likely also in prehistory, confuses the picture and there is no straightforward relationship, if at all, between linguistic and genetic affiliation. Still, the premise that the limited community of speakers of a proto-language must have been ethnically homogeneous remains accepted.\n\nModern genetic studies have shown that the Y-chromosome haplogroup N3, and sometimes N2, is almost specific though certainly not restricted to Uralic or Finno-Ugric speaking populations, especially as high frequency or primary paternal haplogroup. These haplogroups branched from haplogroup N, which probably spread north, then west and east from Northern China about 12,000–14,000 years before present from father haplogroup NO (haplogroup O being the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup in Southeast Asia).\n\nSome of the ethnicities speaking Finno-Ugric languages are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For the sake of clarity, this article focuses primarily on the early fringe; see the article on late night television for an in-depth discussion of the late fringe slots.\n\nDuring the first two decades of American television, the early fringe was considered a part of prime time, which began programming a half-hour earlier than it did in the present day. In 1971, in an effort to loosen the hegemony the Big Three television networks had on television in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission implemented two rules, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (fin-syn), which prohibited the networks from owning interests in syndicators; and the Prime Time Access Rule, which prohibited networks from programming a one-hour slot in the evening hour, the slot now known as fringe time.\n\nThe intent of the new rules was to encourage individual station licensees to produce more local programming. In practice, this failed, and the slot was (and largely remains) dominated by syndicated programming. Game shows already airing in daytime on the Big Three networks quickly filled many of the new slots, ostensibly funneled through syndicators but produced on the same sets with most of the same personnel (except sometimes a different host) as their network counterparts, defeating much of the purpose of the new rule. One such program, \"Wheel of Fortune\", has survived in syndication since that era, outlasting the show's network run. Sister program \"Jeopardy!\", after a failed attempt at syndication in 1974 near the end of its network run, returned as an independent show a decade later, with both it and \"Wheel\" being fringe time fixtures ever since.\n\nAlthough during the early days of these new rules, local stations typically carried a hodge-podge of weekly shows, by the 1980s almost all fringe time programming was stripped at least five and sometimes six days a week, a pattern that remains to the present day.\n\nOther formats frequently used to fill fringe time include newsmagazines (mostly syndicated entertainment-based programs) and off-network reruns, usually sitcoms. Local news, occasionally seen in the time slot in the early years of television, has seen a renaissance in the time slot in the 21st century. Occasionally other formats more commonly seen in daytime such as talk shows or court shows are used to program the slot, but because it leads into the network prime time lineups, these shows are expected to be highly rated and retain a large audience, and thus only the highest-rated shows in these genera (such as \"Judge Judy\") are ever used in this manner.\n\nBoth fin-syn and the Prime Time Access Rule have since been repealed; the networks, although they have reacquired most of the syndicators they were forced to spin off, have never resumed directly programming the fringe time slots they were forced to abandon.\n\nIndependent stations and non-Big Three network affiliates, because they lack access to network late-night shows, have had to program both the early fringe and the late fringe with similar approaches.\n\n"}

The German name for it is \"Altkölnisch\". This classification is primarily based on the research and publications, including a dictionary, of Prof. Dr. Adam Wrede (1875-1960), a linguist at the University of Cologne. He also published a dictionary of Modern Colognian, which is still having reprints today. It was Wrede who coined the term \"Altkölnisch\".\n\nSince the middle of the 5th Century, Cologne was under the rule of the Franks, who took over after almost 500 years of Roman rule. The Franks brought their own language, which gradually replaced Latin as the common language of the residents. The Old Colognian language developed later than the 12th Century, evolving from a mixture of the then old fashioned Ripuarian and Low Franconian dialects and Old High German. Old Franconian developed into a huge variety of dialects, including most of Middle High German and later Luxembourgish, while Old Low Franconian developed into Middle Low German, Dutch, Afrikaans and others. Old High German developed into New High German and Modern German. So Old Colognian was already influenced by High German in the Middle Ages.\n\nOld Colognian was not a mere dialect. It was the language of the Electorate of Cologne, spoken and written every day by both the ecclesiastical and secular authorities as well as the residents of the city and its surrounding area. So it was very well preserved through the Middle Ages and into the Modern times, with a rich variety arising from everyday use. Contemporary literature was written and later printed in Old Colognian. Beginning in the first half of the 16th century, even mundane literary sources exist.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the influence of the New High German language increased in Cologne and along the Rhine River, changing the way of writing used by the monasteries, authorities, and printers. But it did not affect the spoken language of the ordinary citizens. This is evident from the written accounts of the 18th Century, when Colognian was revived for the literature, and they show the development of Old Colognian into Modern Colognian, at least in its spoken form.\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, the Low Franconian writing system was gradually abandoned by printers and offices in favor of the developing New High German writing system. Since then, spoken and written languages diverged in Cologne, and documents written in Old Colognian have grown scarce.\n"}

This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing or saying a specific word out loud. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if \"there's no way it is an actual word\".\n\nThe phenomenon is often grouped with \"déjà vu\" and \"presque vu\", or \"tip of the tongue\".\n\nTheoretically, as seen below, a \"jamais vu\" feeling in a sufferer of a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false double or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalisation; hence, \"jamais vus\" of oneself, or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization and derealization, respectively.\n\nA study by Chris Moulin of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of \"jamais vu\", such as beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic \"jamais vu\".\n\n\"Jamais vu\" can be caused by epileptic seizures.\n\n\n"}

Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the Japonic language family, but they are separate languages, and are not mutually intelligible with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered.\n\nIn Hokkaido, there is the Ainu language, which is spoken by the Ainu people, who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaido Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by UNESCO.\n\nIn addition, languages such as Orok, Evenki, and Nivkh spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern Sakhalin are becoming more and more endangered. After the Soviet Union took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist but in small numbers.\n\nSpeakers of Korean, Chinese, and Zainichi Korean, which stems from Korean, also reside in Japan.\n\nEvidence shows that people inhabited Japan and its islands from the beginning of the Palaeolithic Age. It is believed that these people spoke a language; however it is unknown what kind of language they might have spoken. Characters resembling written language have been found at Stone Age excavation sites; however there are differing opinions as to what language it may be.\n\nNot until shortly after the turn of the second century did indications of language spoken appear in Chinese history books. Chinese characters were adopted and records of spoken language were made in Japan. Hiragana and katakana characters were incorporated as a relatively accurate way to represent the sounds of Chinese characters.\n\nChinese characters were first introduced to Ryukyuan languages shortly into the 13th century. Details concerning the language before then are not well known. Fourteenth-century records indicate that gifts from Ryukyu Islands to China used hiragana, which indicates that these languages were tied to mainland Japanese at the time.\n\nThere exist places in and around Tōhoku whose names were derived from Ainu languages. It is well known that people in Hokkaido, Karafuto, and the Kuril Islands used Ainu languages, but it is also thought that people in the eastern part of mainland Japan once spoke these languages. According to 16th-century records, Ainu languages didn’t have an alphabet. Only from the 19th century did Ainu languages begin to use katakana.\n\nThe Orok language emerged before the common era. Records show that they were used during the latter part of the Edo period in Hokkaido, Karafuto, and the Kuril Islands; however, there are only a few speakers still in existence.\n\nLike Orok, the Nivkh language was spoken in Hokkaido, Karafuto, and the Kuril Islands, but also along the Amur River. It is unknown whether speakers of Nivkh still remain in Japan.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, owing to visits from Europeans, Japanese has adopted a number of foreign words.\n\nThe oral languages spoken by the native peoples of the insular country of Japan at present and during recorded history belong to either of two primary phyla of human language:\n\nIn addition to these two indigenous language families, there is Japanese Sign Language, as well as significant minorities of ethnic Koreans and Chinese, who make up respectively about 0.5% and 0.4% of the country's population and many of whom continue to speak their ethnic language in private (see Zainichi Korean). There is also a notable history of use of \"Kanbun\" (Classical Chinese) as a language of literature and diplomacy in Japan, similar to the status of the Latin language in medieval Europe, which has left an indelible mark on the vocabulary of the Japanese language. \"Kanbun\" is a mandatory subject in the curricula of most Japanese secondary schools.\n\n"}

This homogeneity is probably inherited from the trading network among cities in the Ottoman Empire. It may also represent an older state of affairs. As a matter of facts, there is a current trend to diverge from this unity, the language of the cities taking on some of the features of their neighboring villages (e.g. Jerusalem used to say as Damascus ('we') and ('they') at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural and nowadays.). The table below shows the main historical variants which have shibboleth role, most of the rest of the language remaining the same.\n\nRural Levantine Arabic can be divided into two groups of mutually intelligible subdialects.

{"id": "1368353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1368353", "title": "Lishán Didán", "text": "Lishán Didán\n\nLishán Didán is a modern Jewish Aramaic language, often called \"Neo-Aramaic\" or \"Judeo-Aramaic\". It was originally spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan, in the region of Lake Urmia, from Salmas to Mahabad. Most speakers now live in Israel.\n\nThe name \"Lishán Didán\" means 'our language'; other variations are \"Lishanán\", 'our-language', and \"Lishanid Nash Didán\", 'the language of our selves'. As this causes some confusion with similarly named dialects (Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan), scholarly sources tend simply to use a more descriptive name, like \"Persian Azerbaijani Jewish Neo-Aramaic\".\n\nTo distinguish it from other dialects of Jewish Neo-Aramaic, Lishán Didán is sometimes called \"Lakhlokhi\" (literally 'to-you(f)-to-you(m)') or \"Galihalu\" ('mine-yours'), demonstrating a difference of prepositions and pronominal suffixes. Lishán Didán is written in the Hebrew alphabet. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written.\n\nVarious Neo-Aramaic dialects were spoken across a wide area from Lake Urmia to Lake Van (in Turkey), down to the plain of Mosul (in Iraq) and back across to Sanandaj (in Iran again).\n\nThere are two major dialect clusters of Lishán Didán. The northern cluster of dialects centered on Urmia and Salmas in West Azarbaijan, and extended into the Jewish villages of the Turkish province of Van. The southern cluster of dialects was focused on the town of Mahabad and villages just south of Lake Urmia. The dialects of the two clusters are intelligible to one another, and most of the differences are due to receiving loanwords from different languages: Persian, Kurdish and Turkish languages especially.\n\nMany of the Jews of Urmia worked as peddlers in the cloth trade while others were jewelers or goldsmiths. The degree of education for the boys was primary school with only some advancing their Jewish schooling in a Talmud yeshiva. Some of these students earned their livelihood by writing talisman and amulets. There was a small girls school with only twenty pupils. There were two main synagogues in Urmia, one large one and one smaller one. The large synagogue was called the synagogue of Sheikh Abdulla.\n\nThe upheavals in their traditional region after the First World War and the founding of the State of Israel led most of the Azerbaijani Jews to settle in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and villages in various parts of the country. By 1918, due to the assassination of the Assyrian Patriarch and the invasion of the Ottoman forces, many Jews were uprooted from their homes and fled. The Jews settled in Tbilisi or emigrated to Israel. Due to the persecution and relocation, Lishán Didán began to be replaced by the speech of younger generations by Modern Hebrew. Most of the native Lishan Didan speakers, speak Hebrew to their children now. Fewer than 5,000 people are known to speak Lishán Didan, and most of them are older adults, in their sixties, who speak Hebrew as well. The language faces extinction in the next few decades.\n\nThere are five main dialect groups of Neo-Aramaic. \n\nLishan Didan is called 'Jewish Azerbaijani Neo-Aramaic' by most scholars. Its speakers lived in Northern Iran in the townships of Northern Persian Azerbaijan (specifically Urmia, official name Rizaiye and Salamas, official name Shahpur). Lishan Didan, translated as 'our language' is often confused with other similar dialects called Lishanid Noshan (which is also referred to as Lishan Didan). The term targum is often used to describe the different dialects called Lishan Didan as it is a traditional and common term for the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects.\n\nAnother Lishan Didan dialect is called Manuscript Barzani or Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. Manuscript Barzani was spoken in a community in Iraqi Kurdistan of the Rewanduz/Arbel region. This dialect is also called 'Targum' as it follows distinct translation techniques used by Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. Most of the men of the Barzani family were Rabbi's and Torah scholars. The Rabbi's would travel around Kurdistan in order to set up and maintain many Yeshiva's in the towns of Barzan, Aqra, Mosul and Amediya. Much literature (commentaries on religious text, poetry, prayers, ritual instructions) has been compiled and published by the members of the Barzani family and their community.\n\n\"*h\" has been retained in some words in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic and other communities near Kurdistan. The following displays \"*h\" retention. \n\nThis is different from Jewish Urmia dialect as this dialect has the unvoiced pharyngeal /ḥ/ while Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic has regular pharyngealization with the voiced pharyngeal /ς/.\n\nMany scholars separate the dialects of Jewish Neo-Aramaic and Christian Neo-Aramaic because, as in almost all cases, both communities living side by side were unintelligible from one another. Lishan Didan is part of a large Jewish Trans-Zab continuum with dialects similar to other Jewish Neo-Aamaic dialects, while the Christian community in Salamas (neighboring the Jewish community in Salamas) is similar to dialects in the areas of Van, Northern Hakkari and across the Turkish border (in Sara, Timur, Gawar, Jilu and Dez). The Jews of Salamas lived in a small town called Kushneh Shahr which was a few miles away from Dilman which was the capital town of the district. The Christians of Salamas lived in the larger cities of Khosrava and Dilman itself.\n\nAnother Christian community settled in Urmia after the local Kurds and Turkish army forced them to flee their homes. Over ten thousand people died en route to Urmia. After additional trouble in Urmia, the Christian community left and settled in Ba‘quba near Baghdad. In the early 1930s some moved to Syria and lived near the Khabur river between Hassake and Ras el Ain.\n\nThe following displays examples of divergence in phonology, morphology, and lexicon between the Jewish and Christian Urmia dialects.\nLishán Didán, at the northeastern extreme of this area, is somewhat intelligible with the Jewish Neo-Aramaic languages of Hulaula (spoken further south, in Iranian Kurdistan) and Lishanid Noshan (formerly spoken around Kirkuk, Iraq).\n\nHowever, the local Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic are only mildly intelligible: Christian and Jewish communities living side by side developed completely different variants of Aramaic that had more in common with their co-religionists living further away than with their neighbors. The topography in many of the dialects of Neo-Aramaic is so distinct that small villages, (like the town of Arodhin which consisted of two Jewish families), had their own dialect.\n\nBelow is a general comparison of different Neo-Aramaic dialect differences in phonology: \nAs a trans-Zab dialect, Jewish Salamas *ḏ has a reflex \"l.\" Examples are:\n\nThe reflex for Jewish Salamas of *ṯ is \"l\". Examples are:\nJewish Salamas lost the trait of word emphasis. This is the only Neo-Aramaic dialect that has completely lost word emphasis. Below is a comparison of Jewish Salamas and Christian Salamas suprasegmental Emphesis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2525856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2525856", "title": "Machiavellianism", "text": "Machiavellianism\n\nMachiavellianism is defined as the political theory of Niccolò Machiavelli, especially the view that any means can be used if it is necessary to maintain power. The word comes from the Italian Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccolò Machiavelli, born in 1469, who wrote \"Il Principe\" (\"The Prince\"), among other works.\n\nIn modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the dark triad personalities, characterized by a duplicitous interpersonal style, a cynical disregard for morality, a lack of empathy, and a focus on self-interest and personal gain.\n\nAfter his exile from political life in 1512, Machiavelli took to a life of writing, which led to the publishing of his most famous work, \"The Prince.\" The book would become infamous for its recommendation for rulers to be ready to act in unscrupulous ways, such as resorting to deceit and cunning, political assassination, and the usage of fear as a means of keeping order.\n\nIn the 16th century, immediately following the publication of \"The Prince\", Machiavellianism was seen as a foreign plague infecting northern European politics, originating in Italy, and having first infected France. It was in this context that the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572 in Paris came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot Innocent Gentillet, who published his \"Discours contre Machievel\" in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years. Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's \"books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized [\"sic\"] courtiers\" in France (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) \"at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholomew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers\". In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, not that politicians telegraph their intentions in writing, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism.\n\nThe English playwrights William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe incorporated this view into some of their works. Shakespeare's Gloucester, later Richard III, refers to Machiavelli in \"Henry VI, Part III\", for instance:\n\n<poem>I can add colours to the chameleon,\nChange shapes with Proteus for advantages,\nAnd set the murderous Machiavel to school.</poem>\n\nIn \"The Jew of Malta\" (1589–90) \"Machievel\" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming not to be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, \"And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends\" (Prologue, lines 3–4). Marlowe's last play, \"The Massacre at Paris\" (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with the Duke of Guise and Catherine de' Medici both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start.\n\nThe \"Anti-Machiavel\" is an 18th-century essay by Frederick the Great, King of Prussia and patron of Voltaire, rebutting \"The Prince\", and Machiavellianism. It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king, and is one of many such works.\n\nDenis Diderot, the French philosopher, viewed Machiavellianism as \"an abhorrent type of politics\" and the \"art of tyranny\".\n\nMachiavellianism is also a term that some social, forensic and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the \"Machiavelli test\"). Their \"Mach - IV\" test, a twenty-statement personality survey, became the standard self-assessment tool of Machiavellianism. People scoring high on the scale (\"high Machs\") tend to endorse statements such as, \"Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it is useful to do so,\" (No. 1) but not ones like, \"Most people are basically good and kind\" (No. 4), \"There is no excuse for lying to someone else,\" (No. 7) or \"Most people who get ahead in the world lead clean, moral lives\" (No. 11). Using their scale, Christie and Geis conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of \"High Machs\" and \"Low Machs\" differ. Their basic results have been widely replicated. Measured on the \"Mach - IV\" scale, males are, on average, slightly more Machiavellian than females.\n\nA 1992 review described Machiavellian motivation as related to cold selfishness and pure instrumentality, and those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives (e.g. sex, achievement, sociality) in duplicitous ways. More recent research on the motivations of high Machs compared to low Machs found that they gave high priority to money, power, and competition and relatively low priority to community building, self-love, and family concerns. High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost.\n\nDue to their skill at interpersonal manipulation, there has often been an assumption that high Machs possess superior intelligence, or ability to understand other people in social situations. However, research has firmly established that Machiavellianism is unrelated to IQ. Furthermore, studies on emotional intelligence have found that high Machiavellianism actually tends to be associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both performance and questionnaire measures. Both emotional empathy and emotion recognition have been shown to have negative correlations with Machiavellianism. Additionally, research has shown that Machiavellianism is unrelated to a more advanced theory of mind, that is, the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social situations. If high Machs actually are skilled at manipulating others, this appears to be unrelated to any special cognitive abilities as such.\n\nMachiavellianism is one of the three personality traits referred to as the dark triad, along with narcissism and psychopathy. Some psychologists consider Machiavellianism to be essentially a subclinical form of psychopathy, although recent research suggests that while Machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap, they are distinct personality constructs. Psychopathy differs from Machiavellianism in impulsivity and a lack of self control.Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with Agreeableness (\"r\" = −0.47) and Conscientiousness (\"r\" = −0.34), two dimensions of the Big Five personality model (NEO-PI-R). However, Machiavellianism correlates more highly with the Honesty-humility dimension of the six-factor HEXACO model than with any of the Big Five dimensions. Machiavellianism has also been located within the interpersonal circumplex, which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and communion. Agency refers to motivation to succeed and to individuate the self, whereas communion refers to motivation to merge with others and to support group interests. Machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the circumplex defined by high agency and low communion. Machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally opposite from a circumplex construct called \"self-construal\", a tendency to prefer communion over agency. This suggests that people high in Machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve, they wish to do so at the expense of (or at least without regard to) others.\n\nIn 2002, the Machiavellianism scale of Christie and Geis was applied by behavioral game theorists Anna Gunnthorsdottir, Kevin McCabe and Vernon L. Smith in their search for explanations for the spread of observed behavior in experimental games, in particular individual choices which do not correspond to assumptions of material self-interest captured by the standard Nash equilibrium prediction. It was found that in a trust game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow homo economicus' equilibrium strategies while those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium, and instead made choices that reflected widely accepted moral standards and social preferences.\n\nAlthough there have been myriad proposed factor structures, two dimensions emerge most consistently within factor-analytic research - differentiating Machiavellian views from tactics. Although the Mach-IV scale is unable to reliably capture the two dimensions, a 10-item subset of the scale known as the Two-Dimensional Mach-IV (TDM-V), reproduces the views and tactics dimensions across countries, genders, sample types, and scale category length. The views dimension appears to capture the neurotic, narcissistic, pessimistic, and distrustful aspects of Machiavellianism, while the tactics component captures the more unconscientious, self-serving, and deceitful behavioural aspects (phenotypically similar to psychopathy). Although no research has so far identified the causal direction of the two-dimensions, it is likely that the views generate and validate the use of Machiavellian tactics.\n\nMachiavellianism in the workplace is the employment of cunning and duplicity in a business setting. It is an increasingly studied phenomenon. The root of the concept of Machiavellianism is the book \"The Prince\" by Machiavelli which lays out advice to rulers how to govern their subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with manipulative leadership, and morally bankrupt tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically only manipulates on occasions where it is necessary to achieve the required objectives.\n\nOliver James identifies Machiavellianism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and psychopathy.\n\nA new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:\n\nThe presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with counterproductive workplace behaviour and workplace deviance.\n\n\n"}

In 1745, she achieved her goal and with the help of her friend, Denis Diderot she published one of her first works entitled \"Les Caractères\" sometime in the year 1750.\n\nPuisieux also published one of her most famous works later that year entitled, \"\" (\"Woman is not inferior to man\"). This was a publication of a previously anonymous piece where Puisieux translated and brought up topics in the book about the equality of sexes. She based these questions found in the 1405 publication, \"La Cité des dames (\"The City of ladies\")\" by Christine de Pisan. The following year, it was republished under the title \"Le Triomphe des dames (\"The Triumph of the ladies.) It is sometimes debated whether Puisieux's future husband (1713–1772) helped Puisieux with the translations used in the final publication.\n\nBorn on November 28, 1713 and died in October 1772, Philippe was the French ambassador to Switzerland. Among other formalities, he was also a well-known lawyer at the Paris parliament. In the year 1750, Madeleine de Puisieux met and fell in love with Philippe-Florent de Puisieux, eventually marrying him.\n\nThroughout her relationships, Puisieux had no children. She however did seek opportunities to help the younger generation of girls by publishing advice books for girls. This made her name a well-known one among the population as Puisieux wanted to encourage girls to know about gender equality with feminism as her platform of teaching.\n\nWith the wide known success of her works, Puisieux was recognized by the late, Louis XV. After his death in 1774, she settled down with her husband and was awarded a state pension in 1795.\n\nOn April 12, 1798, Madeleine de Puisieux died in her hometown in Paris at the age of 78 years old.\n\nMadeleine de Puisieux had a relationship with longtime and fellow philosopher, art critic, Denis Diderot from 1746 to 1755. During that time she was a mistress. Although never married, she was the kept woman to Diderot during their time together. In that time, they worked together on some of Puisieux's works as he helped get the works published. Puisieux was not the only mistress to Diderot. She shared the title with Sophie Volland, and Mme de Maux.\n\n"}

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Albania. He authored 22 works.\n\nNaim Frashëri was born in 1846 in Frashër, a village of 1500 residents in the Vilayet of Janina. He was one of eight children of Halit bey (1797–1859) and Emine Hanım (1814–1861). His paternal family traditions held that they were descendants of timar holders that hailed from the Berat region before going to live in Frashër. While their mother Emine Hanım (1814–1861) was descended from Imrahor Ilyas Bey, a distinguished 15th century Ottoman Albanian commander from the Korçë area. Kristo Frashëri, an Albanian historian member of the family points out that the first Frashëri documented was an Albanian merchant in Thessaloniki. Although of distinct origin the family seemed to be of modest financial means by the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nNaim spent his childhood in Frashër, where he began learning Ottoman Turkish, Persian and Arabic. As a member of a family which gave him a strong Bektashi upbringing he spent a part of his time in a Bektashi tekke. After the death of their parents the family moved to Ioannina in 1865. The oldest of brothers, Abdyl (b. 1839), became the family head at the age of 22 and started working as a merchant. That year Naim and Sami enrolled in the Zosimaia secondary school. The education there provided Naim with the basics of a classical education along Western lines. Apart from languages he learned in the Zosiamaia (Ancient and Modern Greek, French and Italian), Naim took private lessons in Persian, Turkish and Arabic from two important local Bektashi. Frashëri showed interest in Bektashism, Persian poetry and Age of Enlightenment. Robert Elsie states that \"His education in Janina made of him a prime example of a nineteenth-century Ottoman intellectual equally at home in both cultures, the Western and the Oriental\". \n\nAfter he finished his studies in 1870, Naim worked for a few months at the press office in Istanbul (1870) but was forced to return to his home village because of tuberculosis. The climate of Frashër helped Naim and soon he started work in the Ottoman bureaucracy as a clerk in Berat and later in Saranda (1872-1877). However in 1876 Frashëri left the job and went to Baden, in modern Austria to cure his problems with rheumatism in a health resort. In 1879 along with his brother Sami and 25 other Albanians, Naim Frashëri founded and was a member of the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings in Istanbul that promoted Albanian language publications. Ottoman authorities forbid writing in Albanian that resulted in publications being published abroad and Frashëri used his initials N.H.F to bypass those restrictions for his works. \n\nAn Albanian magazine \"Drita\" appeared in 1884 under the editorship of Petro Poga and later Pandeli Sotiri with Naim Frashëri being a behind the scenes editor as Muslim Albanians were not allowed by Ottoman authorities to write in Albanian at that time. Naim Frashëri and other Albanian writers like his brother Sami Frashëri would write using pseudonyms in Poga's publication. Due to a lack of education material Naim Frashëri, his brother Sami and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in the Albanian language during the late 1880s for the Albanian school in Korçë. In a letter to Faik Konitza in 1887, Frashëri expressed sentiments regarding the precarious state of the Ottoman Empire that the best outcome for Albanians was a future annexation of all of Albania by Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn 1900 Naim Frashëri died in Istanbul. During the 1950s the Turkish government allowed for his remains to be sent and reburied in Albania.\n\nThrough his writings, Frashëri exerted a strong influence on later Albanian literature and society. In particular Albanian Bektashis were influenced by Frashëri's writings which promoted national unity and nationalism that made Bektashi order in Albania follow patriotic and nationalistic trends. Frashëri himself a Bektashi Muslim desired purity of the Albanian language and had attempted in his lifetime to Albanianize hierarchical terms of the order in his work \"Notebook of the Bektashis\" (1896) which also called for an Albanian Bektashism. During Frashëri's lifetime he published influential works of Albanian literature. His poem \"Bagëti e Bujqësi\" (Cattle and Land) in 1886 celebrated the natural beauty of Albania and the simple life of Albanians while expressing gratitude that Albania had bestowed upon him \"the name Albanian\". In 1889, another poem \"Skenderbeg\" long in verse celebrated his love for Albania by referring to the medieval battles of Albanians and Ottomans while highlighting Skenderbeg's Albanian origins and his fight for liberation. In the poem \"Our Language\" Frashëri called for fellow Albanians to honour their nation and write in Albanian, while in another poem \"Feja\" (Religion) he pleaded with Albanians not make religious distinctions among themselves as they all were of one origin that speak Albanian. \n\nThe independent Albanian state created an order of merit that bears his name, awarded to, amongst others, Mother Teresa. A publishing house in Tirana was named \"Naim Frashëri\". Some Albanian elementary schools are named \"Naim Frashëri\" in his honor.\n\nNaim Frashëri is depicted on the obverses of the Albanian 500 lekë banknote of 1992–1996, and the 200 lekë banknote issued since 1996.\n\n\n"}

English is the country's official language since independence in 1990. Because it is the second or third language for the majority of the Namibians, local usage can vary significantly from usage elsewhere in the English-speaking world. Namibian English, or Namlish, shares many similarities with South African English, having been influenced both by Afrikaans and indigenous African languages.\n\nNamlish comes from literal translations, mostly from Oshiwambo, Kavango languages and Afrikaans, but occasionally from Damara, Herero or other tribal languages. Namlish is generally spoken by the Oshiwambo and Kavango speaking people. In the Oshiwambo language, the \"l\" and \"r\" are exchanged. In Kavango, they are not exchanged.\n\n\nAs Namlish is its own dialect of English, it has its own pronunciation of English words. For instance, \"clothes\" is almost always pronounced with two syllables. Even Hifikepunye Pohamba (Namibia’s former president) pronounces it this way.\n\n"}

The escaping air tends to reduce the oral air pressure and impede the proper production of the consonant. Secondary effects sometimes noted with nasal emission are the development of improper compensatory pronunciation habits, including using a very soft voice that uses less breath pressure. Nasal emission can be detected by a number of simple techniques, such as looking for the fogging of a mirror held under the nares or measured more definitively by means of a nasal pneumotachograph, as in the Perci-Sar system or the NEM system system from Glottal Enterprises.\n\nThe measurement of nasal emission in consonants is linked with the measurement of nasalance in vowels under the term nasometry.\n\n"}

This alphabet was incapable of reproducing some vowels in Turkish. Being the script of Quran, it was considered to be unalterable. However, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, decided in 1928 to adopt Latin alphabet. The Turkish alphabet, actually extended Latin alphabet, has 29 letters, missing the letters \"Q\", \"W\", and \"X\". The other 23 letters are identical to those in the Latin alphabet. There are also umlaut versions of \"O\", \"U\" and \"I\" as well as \"Ç\", \"Ş\" and \"Ğ\".\n\nIn June 1928, Atatürk asked Mustafa Necati, the Minister of National Education to form a committee to adopt the Latin alphabet. On 9 August 1928, Atatürk announced that the Latin alphabet would replace the Arabic alphabet. On 1 November 1928, the parliament passed the law of the new Turkish alphabet as Act no 1353, and on 11 November 1928, the government decided to establish the \"nation’s school\". The project started on 24 November 1928. These schools were actually series of short courses for the adults. According to Falih Rıfkı Atay, a member of the committee, learning of the Latin alphabet was more difficult for the literate people, who already used Arabic alphabet than for the illiterate people. He added that if the rate of literacy was not so low, the alphabet reform would be impossible.\n\nThe first example of the Nation’s school was set in Dolmabahçe Palace. Beginning by 1 January 1929, many schools were opened all over the country. Mustafa Necati, who was responsible for these schools, died on the very same day the schools opened due to appendicitis. He is now considered as one of the pioneers of the Turkish alphabet.\n\nAccording to regulations, these schools were compulsory for everybody in the age group of 14–45 years. Two courses per week were offered to women while four courses a week were available for men. The duration was 2–4 months depending on the prior education of the participants. The courses were also offered to prisoners. In the 1930s, most villages had no schools. For these villages mobile teaching teams were formed. All particioants were expected to pass a final exam to obtain a certificate. The top scoring participant of each school received a signed photo of Atatürk and a book of the Turkish constitution.\n\nAtatürk, who earned the title \"başöğretmen\" (literally \"head teacher\") actively participated in the Nation’s school program, and taught the new alphabet at his travels.\n\nIn the first year, the number of schools, actually classrooms, was 20,487, and the number of participants was 1,075,500. 485,632 men and 111,378 women received certificates. At the end of the term in the 1930s, the total number of the graduates reached 1,217,144.\n\nBeginning by 1981, 24 November, being the start day of the project, is commemorated each year as \"Teacher's day\" in Turkey.\n\n"}

This is contrasted with locutionary and illocutionary acts (which are levels of description, rather than classifications of speech acts).\n\nUnlike the notion of illocutionary act, which describes the linguistic function of an utterance, a perlocutionary effect is in some sense external to the performance. It may be thought of, in a sense, as the effect of the illocutionary act via the locutionary act. Therefore, when examining perlocutionary acts, the effect on the hearer or reader is emphasized. \n\nAs an example, consider the following utterance: \"By the way, I have a CD of Debussy; would you like to borrow it?\" Its illocutionary function is an \"offer\", while its intended perlocutionary effect might be to impress the listener, or to show a friendly attitude, or to encourage an interest in a particular type of music.\n"}

He was the author of some of the bestselling Sinhalese novels in early 20th century. A follower of Anagarika Dharmapala, Siresena was the most popular novelist of the era and most of his novels were on nationalistic and patriotic themes. Piyadasa Sirisena used the novel as a medium through which to reform society and became one of the leaders in mass communication in the early part of the 20th century. Piyadasa Sirisena is widely considered as the father of Sinhalese novel. Some of his novel were reprinted even in the 21st century.\n\nPiyadasa Sirisena was born in 1875, in the countryside village called Athuruwella in Induruwa located three kilometers south of Bentota in Galle District. Sirisena was from a middle class influential family in the area. The main source of living in that area was the agriculture. He moved to Colombo after getting employment in a furniture establishment at a younger age. Piyadasa Sirisena who was inspired by Anagarika Dharmapala, was interested in the movement of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism. The wide range of Piyadasa Sirisena's skills made him a prolific thinker and writer during the early years of the 20th century. His impact on the revival of nationalism through his writings remains unrivaled in the modern history of Sri Lanka. \n\nSirisena began his career by making contributions to publications of Irvin Gunawardena who was a businessman. The publication-‘Situmina’ was first published in 1895 and subsequently Sirisena contributed articles of ‘Sarasavi Sandaresa‘ news paper edited by a leading journalist of that era known as Hemendra Sepala Perera. It was Perera who laid the platform for Piyadasa Sirisena to launch his distinguished literary career which impacted Ceylonese society to a larger extent. Piyadasa Sirisena published the Sinhalese newspaper \"Sinhala Jathiya\" in 1905. He also served as the editor of the 'Sinhala Baudhaya' published by the Mahabodhi Society at one time. In most of his literary and journalistic work, the core theme was nationalism and revival of Buddhism. Ceylon at this time had a increasing number of literate citizens who were well aware of their political rights and their ancient Buddhist heritage. \n\nIt was through 'Sarasavi Sandaresa' that Piyadasa Sirisea was able to produce his first novel Roslin and Jayatissa. He wrote over twenty novels out of which the first was Jayatissa and Rosalyn. It was the most successful novel of Sirisena’ novels as it was sold more than 25,000 copies in two editions. None of Sinhala novels of that period had been as successful as Jayatissa and Rosalyn. \nPiyadasa Sirisena also was the first novelist in the country to produce detective stories. He wrote five of detective novels and one of them \"Dingiri Menika\" was made into a highly successful film in the mid 1950s. Besides novels he was also a poet of exceptional talent. Most of the numerous poems he wrote were on Buddhist, nationalist and historical themes that invoked patriotic feelings in the readers mind. In addition to these Piyadasa Sirisena wrote books which included philosophical views.\n\nPiyadasa Sirisena had to undergo two jail terms during his life time, both after Sinhalese Muslim riots that took place in 1915 and 1918. His work as an Buddhist and independence activist always attracted suspicion of British Ceylon government. His first jail term was in 1916 and lasted 60 days when then government imposed Marshal law during the Sinhala-Muslim riots of that year which led to the imprisonment of many fellow patriots like D. S. Senanayake, F. R. Senanayake, the Hewavitharana brothers, Sir D B Jayatilleke etc. The trial- at- bar which he faced was for provocation. He had written an editorial in his newspaper in which it was alleged that Sirisena had encouraged the people to rise against the government. But the government prosecutors failed to prove the charges and Sirisena was released with a fine.\n\nThe colonial British governments' policy on liquor and the spread of liquor consumption as a result in Ceylon was a cause of growing displeasure among the Sinhalese Buddhists of the early 20th century. An anti-liquor campaign gently took shape and within a short time it had the support of the many leading Buddhists of the country. This soon formed a Temperance movement that conducted several anti-liquor campaigns in different parts of the country. Buddhist leaders such as Anagarika Dharmapala, Dr. W. A. de Silva, Arthur V. Dias and Walisinghe Harischandra took part in theses campaigns. Piyadasa Sirisana also took part as an active protester against liquor and soon became a leading figure of the Ceylonese Temperance movement. He used his Sinhala Jathiya newspaper to urge people against the habit of liquor. He also used his oratorical skills to popularize and move forward their temperance movement, whenever anti-liquor meetings were held in various parts of the country.\n\nSirisena was a tireless worker who slept only four hours a day. He was married to Cecilia and had a family of nine children. He was the head of a printing establishment with 40 employees, who all depended on his success as a literary figure. After rendering a yeoman service to his motherland Piyadasa Sirisena died on May 22, 1946 at the age 71 years. Sri Lanka Post issued a postage stamp to commemorate his services to the country in 1979.\n\nPiyadasa Sirisena was a skilled writer of both prose and verse in Sinhala and used the novel as an tool of educating the masses. His objective was to raise their awareness of the lost glory of the Sinhalese people. His first novel on a happy marriage with Jayatissa and Rosalin as the main characters was a bestseller by any standard in Sri Lanka. He was also a journalist and his newspaper called the “Sinhala Jatiya” (Sinhala Nation) reinforced the message of his novels. The following are some of his notable works.\n\n"}

His magnum opus is the \"Tradiciones peruanas\".\n\nAccording to the official account, Manuel Ricardo Palma y Carrillo was born on February 7, 1833, in Lima, inscribed as the son of Pedro Ramón Palma and Guillerma Carrillo y Pardos, possibly his grandmother. On April 6, 1837, his father married Dominga Soriano y Carrillo, Guillerma's daughter. However, the documentary evidence shows many contradictions that was pointed out by Monsignor Salvador Herrera Pinto who relying on oral traditions and written testimonies concludes that Ricardo Palma was born in the town of Talavera, province of Andahuaylas, Apurímac Region.\n\nHis family was living in Lima after migrating from the province. His mother was a mestiza with African roots. His parents separated when he was still young. He was educated at a Jesuit school and attended the University of San Carlos on an irregular basis. He suspended his studies to perform voluntary service in the Peruvian navy for six years.\n\nFrom a young age, he dabbled in politics as a member of the liberal camp. In 1860 he was believed to have participated in a failed plot against president Ramón Castilla which resulted in an exile to Chile from which he returned in October 1862. He made a trip to Europe in 1864-1865 and when he returned to Lima in 1865 he became involved again in political affairs and public service until 1876. He held the positions of Consul of Peru in Pará, Brazil, Senator for the Loreto and official in the Ministry of War and Navy.\n\nThe War of the Pacific (1879–1883) between Chile and Peru disrupted Palma's life and resulted in the virtually complete destruction of his own library as well as that housed in the National Library of Peru. After the war, Palma was named the director of the National Library, a post he held until his retirement in 1912. Palma successfully took on the task of rebuilding the National Library that was ransacked by the occupation forces of the Chilean army in 1881 following the battle of Lima during the War of the Pacific. Palma was able to bring the National Library back from the ashes so that it regained its previous stature and became recognized once again as one of the top libraries in South America. It was through his personal friendship with the then Chilean president Domingo Santa María that Palma was able to recover an estimated 10,000 books from Chilean hands, as well as many other works which were recovered through his own personal efforts.\n\nWith his lover Clemencia Ramínez in 1872, he had his son Clemente Palma, who became a prominent writer of fantastic tales, usually horror stories, that were influenced by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1876, he married Cristina Román y Olivier with whom he had seven children: Félix Vital, Angélica, Ricardo, Peregrina Augusta, Cristina, Cristián and Renée Cristina. His daughter Angélica Palma was also a writer and a member of the early feminist movement in Peru.\n\nRicardo Palma published his first verses and became the editor of a political and satiric newssheet called \"El Diablo\" (The Devil) at 15.\n\nDuring his early years, Ricardo Palma composed romantic dramas (which he later repudiated) and poetry. His first book of verse, \"Poesías\" (Poems), appeared in 1855. He gained an early reputation as a historian with his book on the activities of the Spanish Inquisition during the period of the Viceroyalty of Peru (\"Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico\", 1863).\n\nHe also wrote for the satirical press of Peru where he distinguished himself as a prolific columnist and one of the bastions of Peruvian political satire in the nineteenth century. He collaborated with the satirical sheet \"El Burro\" (The Donkey) and became later one of the principal contributors to the satirical magazine \"La Campana\" (The Bell). Later he founded the magazine \"La Broma\" (The Joke). He was also a regular contributor to serious publications such as \"El Mercurio\", \"El Correo\", \"La Patria\", \"El Liberal\", \"Revista del Pacífico\" and \"Revista de Sud América\". He was further active as a foreign newspaper correspondent during the War of the Pacific.\n\nPalma's literary reputation rests upon his creation and development of the literary genre known as \"tradiciones\", short stories that mix history and fiction, written both to amuse and educate, according to the author's declared intention. It was by creatively using poetic license and by deviating from \"pure\" history that Palma gained his large South American readership. His \"Tradiciones peruanas\" span several centuries, with an emphasis on earlier colonial and republican times in Peru.\n\nThe \"Tradiciones\" were published from 1872 to 1910 in a series of volumes, some of which are freely available on the internet (see the bottom of this page for links). There are also many different editions and selections of the \"Tradiciones\" commercially available. The \"Tradiciones peruanas\" do not meet formal historical standards of accuracy or reliability sufficiently to be considered \"history,\" but Palma never intended them to be read as \"pure\" history. Since they are primarily historical fiction, they should be understood and enjoyed as such.\n\nThe author's opinion, the opinions of the other primary sources or oral narrators of the stories he collects and transmits, as well as hearsay, play a large role in his stories. One of the best-known of the \"Tradiciones\", especially within American Spanish literature classes, is \"La camisa de Margarita\"..\n\nSome of the \"Tradiciones peruanas\" have been translated into English under the title \"The Knights of the Cape and Thirty-seven Other Selections from the Tradiciones Peruanas of Ricardo Palma\" (ed. by Harriet de Onís, 1945) and more recently under the title \"Peruvian Traditions\" (ed. by Christopher Conway and translated by Helen Lane, Oxford University Press, 2004).\n\nThe \"Tradiciones peruanas\" are recognised as a considerable contribution to Peruvian and South American literature. Some critics have classified the \"Tradiciones\" as part of nineteenth-century Romanticism.\n\nPalma's \"Tradiciones en Salsa Verde\" were published posthumously. These stories are similar to the \"Tradiciones peruanas\" but, because of their bawdy nature, they were not published during Palma's lifetime for fear of shocking the sedate Lima establishment.\n\nThroughout his life, Ricardo Palma published various articles and books on history, the results of his own historical research such as the \"Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico\" (1863) and \"Monteagudo y Sánchez Carrión\" (1877). He was a noted linguistic scholar and wrote a number of works on the subject including the \"Neologismos y americanismos\" and \"Papeletas lexográficas\". He campaigned for recognition by the Real Academia Española of the Latin-American and Peruvian contributions to the Spanish language.\n\nIn 1999, a well-known London auction house announced the sale of a batch of 50 letters that Ricardo Palma had written to an Argentinian friend. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru persuaded the National Library of Peru to participate in the auction. It had been more than 50 years since Peru had bought cultural heritage abroad. Today these letters are kept at the National Library of Peru. Ricardo Palma University has recently published the letters of Palma in three volumes (2005–2007).\n\n\n\n"}

However, the author of the language states that this was not the language's primary purpose; the conciseness of its meaningful units was meant to foster \"maximal communication of cognitive intent in the most efficient manner; a somewhat different purpose, in which brevity \"per se\" is irrelevant.\"\n"}
{"id": "16830632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16830632", "title": "Trace (deconstruction)", "text": "Trace (deconstruction)\n\nTrace () is one of the most important concepts in Derridian deconstruction. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida used this word in two of his early books, namely \"Writing and Difference\" and \"Of Grammatology\". \n\nIn French, the word \"trace\" has a range of meanings similar to those of its English equivalent, but also suggests meanings related to the English words \"track\", \"path\", or \"mark\". In the preface to her translation of \"Of Grammatology\", Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak wrote \"I stick to 'trace' in my translation, because it 'looks the same' as Derrida's word; the reader must remind himself of at least the track, even the spoor, contained within the French word\". Because the meaning of a sign is generated from the difference it has from other signs, especially the other half of its binary pairs, the sign itself contains a trace of what it does not mean, i.e. bringing up the concepts of woman, normality, or speech may simultaneously evoke the concepts of man, abnormality, or writing. Derrida does not positively or strictly define trace, and denies the possibility of such a project. Indeed, words like \"différance\", \"arche-writing\", \"pharmakos/pharmakon\", and especially \"specter\", carry similar meanings in many other texts by Derrida. His refusal to apply only one name to his concepts is a deliberate strategy to avoid a set of metaphysical assumptions that, he argues, have been central to the history of European thought.\n\nTrace can be seen as an always contingent term for a \"mark of the absence of a presence, an always-already absent present\", of the 'originary lack' that seems to be \"the condition of thought and experience\". Trace is a contingent unit of the critique of language always-already present: \"language bears within itself the necessity of its own critique\". Deconstruction, unlike analysis or interpretation, tries to lay the inner contradictions of a text bare, and, in turn, build a different meaning from that: it is at once a process of destruction and construction. Derrida claims that these contradictions are neither accidental nor exceptions; they are the exposure of certain \"metaphysics of pure presence\", an exposure of the \"transcendental signified\" always-already hidden inside language. This \"always-already hidden\" contradiction is trace.\n\nOne of the very many difficulties of expressing Jacques Derrida's project (deconstruction) in simple terms is the enormous scale of it. Just to understand the context of Derrida's theory, one needs to be acquainted intimately with philosophers, such as, Socrates–Plato–Aristotle, René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Charles Sanders Peirce, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Emmanuel Levinas, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger and others. Some have tried to write simplified versions of this theory, such as Deconstruction for Beginners and Deconstructions: A User's Guide, but their attempts have moved away from the original. The best way to learn about deconstruction is to read Derrida's own work; nonetheless, this short exposition of the relationship between \"trace\" and the Derrida's project may help orient his readers.\n\nDerrida's philosophy is chiefly concerned with metaphysics, although he does not define it rigorously, and takes it to be \"the science of presence\". In his own words:\n\nThe history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history of these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix—if you will pardon me for demonstrating so little and for being so elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal theme—is the determination of being as presence in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the center have always designated the constant of a presence--- eidos, arché, telos, energia, ousia, aletheia, transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.\n\nDerrida finds the root of this metaphysics, which he calls \"metaphysics of pure presence\", in logos, which is internal to language itself. He calls this \"logocentrism\", which is a tendency towards definitive truth-values through forced closure of structures. In his belief, it is the structure of language itself that forces us into metaphysics, best represented through truth-values, closures, speech as valorized by Socrates in \"Phaedrus\". In fact, according to Derrida, Logocentrism is so all-pervasive that the mere act of opposing it cannot evade it by any margin. On the other hand, Derrida finds his Nietzschean hope (his own word is \"affirmation\") in heterogeneity, contradictions, absence etc. To counter the privileged position of the speech (parole) or the phonè, he puts forward a new science of grammé or the unit of writing: grammatology.\n\nUnlike structuralists, Derrida does not see language as the one-to-one correspondence between signified and signifier; to him, language is a play of identity and difference, an endless chain of signifiers leading to other signifiers. In spite of all the logocentric tendencies towards closure and truth-values, language, or text for that matter, always contradicts itself. This critique is inherent in all texts, not through a presence, but an absence of a presence long sought by logocentric visions. Influenced by some aspects of Freudian psycho-analysis, Derrida presents us the strategy of deconstruction, an amalgamation of Heidegger's concept of Destruktion and Levinas's concept of the Other. \n\nDeconstruction as a strategy tries to find the most surprising contradictions in texts, unravel them, and built upon this; instead of finding the truth, the closure, or the steadfast meaning, it finds absence of presence, freeplay of meanings etc. . It is this absence of presence that is described as 'trace' by Derrida. However, he treats the word cautiously, and terms it thus only as a contingency measure, because the traditional meaning of the word 'trace' is a part of the scheme Derrida wants to uncloak. \n\nBy the virtue of trace, signifiers always simultaneously differ and defer from the illusive signified. This is something Derrida calls \"différance\". According to Derrida, \"Différance is the non-full, non-simple \"origin\"; it is the structured and differing origin of differences\". Further, language is labyrinthine, inter-woven and inter-related, and the threads of this labyrinth are the differences, traces. Along with \"supplement\", trace and différance convey a picture of what language is to Derrida. All these terms are part of his strategy; he wants to use trace to \"indicate a way out of the closure imposed by the system...\". Trace is, again, not presence but an empty simulation of it: \nThe trace is not a presence but is rather the simulacrum of a presence that dislocates, displaces, and refers beyond itself. The trace has, properly speaking, no place, for effacement belongs to the very structure of the trace. . . . In this way the metaphysical text is understood; it is still readable, and remains read.\n\n[I]t has been necessary to analyze, to set to work, within the text of the history of philosophy, as well as within the so-called literary text..., certain marks, shall we say... that by analogy (I underline) I have called undecidables, that is, unities of simulacrum, \"false\" verbal properties (nominal or semantic) that can no longer be included within philosophical (binary) opposition, resisting and disorganizing it, without ever constituting a third term, without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of speculative dialectics.\n\nTrace is also not linear or chronological in any sense of the word,\n\"This trace relates no less to what is called the future than what is called the past, and it constitutes what is called the present by the very relation to what it is not, to what it absolutely is not; that is, not even to a past or future considered as a modified present\".\nTrace is a contingent strategy, a \"bricolage\" for Derrida that helps him produce a new concept of writing (as opposed to the Socratic or Saussurean speech), where \"The interweaving results in each 'element' - phoneme or grapheme - being constituted on the basis of the trace within it of the other elements of the chain or system. This interweaving, this textile, is the text produced only in the transformation of another text\".\n\nDerrida's concept of \"trace\" is quite similar to Martin Heidegger's concept of Dasein, although from different perspectives. Here, we see the relationship between Heideggerian existentialism and the Derridian concept of \"trace\", which, in turn, will also work as an indicator of a very close relationship between existentialism and deconstruction.\n\nDerrida's first indebtedness to Heidegger lies in his use of the notion of \"sous rature\" ('under erasure'). To write 'Under erasure' is to write a word, cross it out, and then print both word and deletion. The word is inaccurate (which itself is an inaccurate word), hence the cross, yet the word is necessary, hence the printing of the word. This is one of the principal strategies of Derrida: \"(possibility) of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself\". This is similar to the concept of bricolage coined by anthropologist Lèvi-Strauss. Derrida himself explains:\n\nLèvi-Strauss will always remain faithful to this double-intention: to preserve as an instrument that whose truth-value he criticizes, conserving...all these old concepts, while exposing...their limits, treating them as tools which can still be of use. No longer is any truth-value [or rigorous meaning] attributed to them; there is a readiness to abandon them if necessary if other instruments should appear more useful. In the meantime, their relative efficacy is exploited, and they are employed to destroy this old machinery to which they belong and of which they themselves are pieces.\n\nHowever, now that we are done discussing this Derridian strategy, let us get back to the concept of sous rature. To understand it properly, we need to learn about Heidegger's existentialist theories. In doing so, we will also explore the link between existentialism and structuralism. Heidegger said that the possibility of 'being', or what he called \"Dasein\" (meaning being-there), is the presupposition behind any definition, any defined entity. He comes to this decision through the general problem of definition: if anything is to be defined as an entity, then the question of Being, in general, have to be answered affirmatively at first. Before we can think and decide that something exists, we must acknowledge the fact that anything can be. This Being is not an answer to a question, as it predates any thought, or possibility of thought: if the subject of your thought \"exists\", then the Being is always-already there. Yet, Heidegger refuses the metaphysicality of the word \"Being\", and tries to keep it to the human realm by crossing it out. When Heidegger puts \"Being\" before all concepts, he is trying to put an end to a certain trend of Western philosophy that is obsessed about the origin, and by the same token, the end. Putting \"Being\" under erasure is an attempt by Heidegger to save his concept of \"Being\" from becoming the metaphysical origin and the eschatological end of all entities. Yet, by making \"Dasein\" or \"Being\" his master-word, his function-word, Heidegger, nonetheless, fails to do so. Heidegger's concept of \"Dasein\" is similar to the Structuralist concept of the 'signified'. To put it simply, in Structuralism, all signifiers are directly connected to an extra-linguistic signified, the invariable ones. To 'mean' anything, a signifier must presuppose a signified already-always outside it. This is what Derrida terms as the \"transcendental signified\": as a signified, it belongs to the realm of language, but by being invariable, and by refusing any movement, it remains outside it [A word, if immovable, can mean nothing, or even exist. Only when an endless chain of other signifiers, other words, hints, get associated with it, it finally acquires meaning ('Camel' is understandable only when it is thinly associated with many related words, such as 'animal', 'desert', 'cigarette', 'long neck etc). In other words, language is this movement]. Dasein, by being under the erasure, claims to remain in the realm of physicality, but by being prior and anterior to any entity, and any thought, it remains outside them. In short, Heidegger's idea of \"Dasein\" fails to overcome the metaphysical trap. Derrida takes almost a similar strategy. But in his case, he puts the concept of \"trace\" under erasure. Trace, unlike \"Dasein\", is the absence of the presence, never itself the Master-word; it is the radically \"other\", it plays within a certain structure of difference. To Derrida, sign is the play of identity and difference; half of the sign is always \"not there\", and another half \"not that\" [We define everything negatively, a chair is 'not' a table, 'not' five-legged, one-legged, 'not' animate, 'not' of flesh. For detailed discussion, check Ferdinand de Saussure. The sign never leads to the extra-linguistic thing, it leads to another sign, one substituting the other playfully inside the structure of language. We do not feel the presence of a thing through a sign, but through the absence of other presences, we guess what it is. To Derrida, trace and not \"being-there\", difference and not-identity, create meaning inside language. This is the main difference between Heideggerian Dasein and Derridian trace.\n\n"}

When rendered, a whitespace character does not correspond to a visible mark, but typically does occupy an area on a page. For example, the common whitespace symbol , also ASCII 32, represents a blank space punctuation character in text, used as a word divider in Western scripts.\n\nWith many keyboard layouts, a horizontal whitespace character may be entered through the use of a . Horizontal whitespace may also be entered on many keyboards through the use of the key, although the length of the space may vary. Vertical whitespace is a bit more varied as to how it is encoded, but the most obvious in typing is the result which creates a 'newline' code sequence in applications programs. Older keyboards might instead say , abbreviating the typewriter keyboard meaning 'Carriage-Return' which generated an electromechanical return to the left stop (CR code in ASCII-hex &0D;) and a line feed or move to the next line (LF code in ASCII-hex &0A;); in some applications these were independently used to draw text cell based displays on monitors or for printing on tractor-guided printers—which might also contain reverse motions/positioning code sequences allowing text-based output devices to achieve more sophisticated output. Many early computer games used such codes to draw a screen (e.g. Kingdom of Kroz), and word processing software would use this to produce printed effects such as bold, underline, and strikeout.\n\nThe term \"whitespace\" is based on the resulting appearance on ordinary paper. However they are coded inside an application, whitespace can be processed the same as any other character code and programs can do the proper action as defined for the context in which they occur.\n\nThe most common whitespace characters may be typed via the space bar or the tab key. Depending on context, a line-break generated by the return or enter key may be considered whitespace as well.\n\nThe table below lists the twenty-five characters defined as whitespace (\"WSpace=Y\", \"WS\") characters in the Unicode Character Database. Seventeen use a definition of whitespace consistent with the algorithm for bidirectional writing (\"Bidirectional Character Type=WS\") and are known as \"Bidi-WS\" characters. The remaining characters may also be used, but are not of this \"Bidi\" type.\n\n\"Note: Depending on the browser and fonts used to view the following table, not all spaces may be displayed properly.\"\n\nUnicode also provides some visible characters that can be used to represent whitespace:\n\n\n\nText editors, word processors, and desktop publishing software differ in how they represent whitespace on the screen, and how they represent spaces at the ends of lines longer than the screen or column width. In some cases, spaces are shown simply as blank space; in other cases they may be represented by an interpunct or other symbols. Many different characters (described below) could be used to produce spaces, and non-character functions (such as margins and tab settings) can also affect whitespace.\n\nIn computer character encodings, there is a normal general-purpose space (Unicode character U+0020) whose width will vary according to the design of the typeface. Typical values range from 1/5 em to 1/3 em (in digital typography an em is equal to the nominal size of the font, so for a 10-point font the space will probably be between 2 and 3.3 points). Sophisticated fonts may have differently sized spaces for bold, italic, and small-caps faces, and often compositors will manually adjust the width of the space depending on the size and prominence of the text.\n\nIn addition to this general-purpose space, it is possible to encode a space of a specific width. See the table below for a complete list.\n\nEm dashes used as parenthetical dividers, and en dashes when used as word joiners, are usually set continuous with the text. However, such a dash can optionally be surrounded with a hair space, U+200A, or thin space, U+2009. The hair space can be written in HTML by using the numeric character references codice_1 or codice_2, or the named entity codice_3, but is not universally supported in browsers yet, The thin space is named entity codice_4 and numeric references codice_5 or codice_6. These spaces are much thinner than a normal space (except in a monospaced (non-proportional) font), with the hair space being the thinner of the two.\n\nThe International System of Units (SI) prescribes inserting a space between a number and a unit of measurement and between units in compound units. A thin space should be used as thousands separator. See unit symbols and numbers.\n\nIn programming language syntax, spaces are frequently used to explicitly separate tokens. Runs of whitespace characters (beyond the first) occurring within source code written in computer programming languages (outside of strings and other quoted regions) are ignored by most languages; such languages are called \"free-form\". In a few languages, including Haskell, occam, ABC, and Python, whitespace and indentation are used for syntactical purposes. In the satirical language called Whitespace, whitespace characters are the only valid characters for programming, while any other characters are ignored.\n\nStill, for most programming languages, excessive use of whitespace, especially \"trailing whitespace\" at the end of lines, is considered a nuisance. However correct use of whitespace can make the code easier to read and help group related logic.\n\nThe C language defines whitespace characters to be \"space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, and form-feed\". The HTTP network protocol requires different types of whitespace to be used in different parts of the protocol, such as: only the space character in the status line, CRLF at the end of a line, and \"linear whitespace\" in header values.\n\nIn commands processed by command processors, e.g., in scripts and typed in, the space character can cause problems as it has two possible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name separator. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces, or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters.\n\nSome markup languages, such as SGML, preserve whitespace as written.\n\nWeb markup languages such as XML and HTML treat whitespace characters specially, including space characters, for programmers' convenience. One or more space characters read by conforming display-time processors of those markup languages are collapsed to 0 or 1 space, depending on their semantic context. For example, double (or more) spaces within text are collapsed to a single space, and spaces which appear on either side of the \"codice_7\" that separates an attribute name from its value have no effect on the interpretation of the document. Element end tags can contain trailing spaces, and empty-element tags in XML can contain spaces before the \"codice_8\". In these languages, unnecessary whitespace increases the file size, and so may slow network transfers. On the other hand, unnecessary whitespace can also inconspicuously mark code, similar to, but less obvious than comments in code. This can be desirable to prove an infringement of license or copyright that was committed by copying and pasting.\n\nIn XML attribute values, sequences of whitespace characters are treated as a single space when the document is read by a parser. Whitespace in XML element content is not changed in this way by the parser, but an application receiving information from the parser may choose to apply similar rules to element content. An XML document author can use the codice_9 attribute on an element to instruct the parser to discourage the downstream application from altering whitespace in that element's content.\n\nIn most HTML elements, a sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single \"inter-word separator\", which may manifest as a single space character when rendering text in a language that normally inserts such space between words. Conforming HTML renderers are required to apply a more literal treatment of whitespace within a few prescribed elements, such as the codice_10 tag and any element for which CSS has been used to apply codice_10-like whitespace processing. In such elements, space characters will not be \"collapsed\" into inter-word separators.\n\nIn both XML and HTML, the non-breaking space character, along with other non-\"standard\" spaces, is not treated as collapsible \"whitespace\", so it is not subject to the rules above.\n\nSuch usage is similar to multiword file names written for operating systems and applications that are confused by embedded space codes—such file names instead use an underscore (_) as a word separator, as_in_this_phrase.\n\nAnother such symbol was . This was used in the early years of computer programming when writing on coding forms. Keypunch operators immediately recognized the symbol as an \"explicit space\". It was used in BCDIC, EBCDIC, and ASCII-1963.\n\n\n"}
