{"id": "98439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98439", "title": "Abdullah Öcalan", "text": "Abdullah Öcalan\n\nAbdullah Öcalan ( ; ; born about 1947), also known as Apo (short for both Abdullah and \"uncle\" in Kurdish), is a Kurdish leader and one of the founding members of the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\n\nÖcalan was arrested in 1999 by the Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT) with the support of the CIA in Nairobi and taken to Turkey, where he was sentenced to death under Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which concerns the formation of armed organisations. The sentence was commuted to aggravated life imprisonment when Turkey abolished the death penalty in support of its bid to be admitted to membership in the European Union. From 1999 until 2009, he was the sole prisoner on İmralı island, in the Sea of Marmara. Öcalan now argues that the period of armed warfare is past and a political solution to the Kurdish question should be developed. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has resulted in over 40,000 deaths, including PKK members, the Turkish military, and civilians, both Kurdish and Turkish.\n\nFrom prison, Öcalan has published several books, the most recent in 2015. Jineology, also known as the science of women, is a form of feminism advocated by Öcalan and subsequently a fundamental tenet of Kurdish nationalism.\n\nÖcalan was born in Ömerli, a village in Halfeti, Şanlıurfa Province in eastern Turkey. While some sources report his birthday as being 4 April 1948, no official birth records for him exist, and he himself claims not to know exactly when he was born, estimating the year to be 1946 or 1947. He is the oldest of seven children. According to some sources, Öcalan's grandmother was an ethnic Turk and (he once claimed that) his mother was also an ethnic Turk.\nAccording to Amikam Nachmani, lecturer at the Bar-Ilan University in Israel, Öcalan did not know Kurdish when he met him in 1991. Nachmani: \"\"He [Öcalan] told me that he speaks Turkish, gives orders in Turkish, and thinks in Turkish.\"\n\nÖcalan's brother Osman became a PKK commander, serving until defecting with several others to establish the Patriotic and Democratic Party of Kurdistan. His other brother, Mehmet Öcalan, is a member of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP).\n\nAfter graduating from a vocational high school in Ankara (), Öcalan started working at the Diyarbakir Title Deeds Office. He was relocated one month later to Bakırköy, Istanbul. Later, he entered the Istanbul Law Faculty but transferred after the first year to Ankara University to study political science.\nHis return to Ankara (normally impossible given his situation) was facilitated by the state in order to divide a militant group, Dev-Genç (Revolutionary Youth Federation of Turkey), of which Öcalan at the time was a member of. President Süleyman Demirel later regretted this decision, since the PKK was to become a much greater threat to the state than Dev-Genç.\n\nIn 1978, in the midst of the right- and left-wing conflicts which culminated in the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, Öcalan founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which launched a war against the Turkish government in order to set up an independent Kurdish state. In July 1979 he fled to Syria, where he remained until October 1998, when the Syrian government expelled him.\n\nÖcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with Murray Bookchin through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's \"student\" eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message \"My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them\". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as \"one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century\", and vowed to put his theory into practice.\n\nIn 1984, the PKK initiated a campaign of armed conflict, comprising attacks against government forces in Turkey as well as civilians in order to create an independent Kurdish state. As a result, the United States, European Union, NATO, Syria, Australia, Turkey, and many other countries have included the PKK on their lists of terrorist organizations.\n\nUntil 1998, Öcalan was based in Syria. On at least one occasion, in 1993, he was detained and held by Syria's General Intelligence Directorate but later released. As the situation deteriorated in Turkey, the Turkish government openly threatened Syria over its support for the PKK. As a result, the Syrian government forced Öcalan to leave the country, but did not turn him over to the Turkish authorities. Öcalan went to Russia first and from there moved to various countries, including Italy and Greece. In 1998 the Turkish government requested the extradition of Öcalan from Italy. He was at that time defended by Britta Böhler, a high-profile German attorney who argued that he fought a legitimate struggle against the oppression of ethnic Kurds.\n\nHe was captured in Kenya on 15 February 1999, while being transferred from the Greek embassy to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, in an operation by the Millî İstihbarat Teşkilâtı (Turkish National Intelligence Organization) reportedly with the help of the CIA. George Costoulas, the Greek consul who protected him, said that his life was in danger after the operation.\n\nSpeaking to Can Dündar on NTV Turkey, the Deputy Undersecretary of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization, Cevat Öneş, said that Öcalan impeded American aspirations of establishing a separate Kurdish state. The Americans transferred him to the Turkish authorities, who flew him back to Turkey for trial. His capture led thousands of Kurds to protest at Greek and Israeli embassies around the world. Kurds living in Germany have been threatened with deportation if they continue to hold demonstrations in support of Öcalan. The warning came after three Kurds were killed and 16 injured during the 1999 attack on the Israeli consulate in Berlin.\n\nAfter his capture, Öcalan was held in solitary confinement as the only prisoner on İmralı island in the Sea of Marmara. Although former prisoners at İmralı were transferred to other prisons, more than 1,000 Turkish military personnel were stationed on the island to guard him. A state security court consisting of three military judges was convened on the island to try him. Öcalan was charged with and convicted of treason and separatism, and sentenced to death. This sentence was commuted to life imprisonment upon the abolition of the death penalty in Turkey in August 2002. No one had been executed in Turkey since 1984. The Kurdish Human Rights Project (KHRP) may have aided this case's decision.\n\nFollowing the commutation, Öcalan remained imprisoned on İmralı, and was the sole inmate there. In November 2009, Turkish authorities announced that Öcalan would be relocated to a new prison on the island and that they were ending his solitary confinement by transferring several other PKK prisoners to İmralı. They said that Öcalan would be allowed to see them for ten hours a week. The new prison was built after the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited the island and objected to the conditions in which he was being held.\n\nIn 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey had violated articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights by granting Öcalan no effective remedy to appeal his arrest and sentencing him to death without a fair trial. Öcalan's request for a retrial was refused by the Turkish court.\n\nSince 27 July 2011 his lawyers have not been allowed to see Abdullah Öcalan anymore. The lawyers have appealed 700 times for visits, but all were rejected. The last time Abdullah Öcalan was visited was on 11 September 2016 by his brother Mehmet Öcalan.\n\nAbandoning his precapture policy, which involved violence targeting civilians as well as military personnel, Öcalan has advocated a relatively peaceful solution to the Kurdish conflict inside the borders of Turkey. Öcalan called for the foundation of a \"Truth and Justice Commission\" by Kurdish institutions in order to investigate war crimes committed by the PKK and Turkish security forces; a parallel structure began functioning in May 2006. In March 2005, Öcalan issued the \"Declaration of Democratic confederalism in Kurdistan\" calling for a border-free confederation between the Kurdish regions of Eastern Turkey (called \"Northern Kurdistan\" by Kurds), East Syria (\"Western Kurdistan\"), Northern Iraq (\"South Kurdistan\"), and West of Iran (\"East Kurdistan\"). In this zone, three bodies of law would be implemented: EU law, Turkish/Syrian/Iraqi/Iranian law and Kurdish law. This perspective was included in the PKK programme following the \"Refoundation Congress\" in April 2005.\n\nÖcalan had his lawyer, Ibrahim Bilmez, release a statement 28 September 2006, calling on the PKK to declare a ceasefire and seek peace with Turkey. Öcalan's statement said, \"The PKK should not use weapons unless it is attacked with the aim of annihilation,\" and that it is \"very important to build a democratic union between Turks and Kurds. With this process, the way to democratic dialogue will be also opened\".\n\nOn 31 May 2010, however, Öcalan said he was abandoning an ongoing dialogue between him and Turkey saying that \"this process is no longer meaningful or useful\". Turkey ignored his three protocols for negotiation that included (a) his terms of health and security (b) his release and (c) a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish issue in Turkey. Though the Turkish government received these protocols, they were never published. Öcalan stated that he would leave the top PKK commanders in charge of the conflict. However, he also said that his comments should not be misinterpreted as a call for the PKK to intensify its armed conflict with the Turkish state.\n\nMore recently, Öcalan has shown renewed cooperation with the Turkish government and hope for a peaceful resolution to three decades of conflict. On 21 March 2013, Öcalan declared a ceasefire between the PKK and the Turkish state. Öcalan's statement was read to hundreds of thousands of Kurds gathered to celebrate the Kurdish New Year and it states, \"Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratization and democratic politics. It's not the end. It's the start of a new era.\" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the statement and hope for a peaceful settlement has been raised on both sides.\n\nSoon after Öcalan's declaration was read, the functional head of the PKK, Murat Karayılan responded by promising to implement the ceasefire, stating, \"Everyone should know the PKK is as ready for peace as it is for war\".\n\nSince his incarceration, Öcalan has significantly changed his ideology, reading Western social theorists such as Murray Bookchin, Immanuel Wallerstein, Fernand Braudel, fashioned his ideal society as \"Democratic Confederalism\" (drawing heavily on Bookchin's libertarian socialist idea of \"Communalism\"), and refers to Friedrich Nietzsche as \"a prophet\". He also wrote books and articles on the history of pre-capitalist Mesopotamia and Abrahamic religions.\n\nWith his 2005 \"Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan\", Öcalan advocated for a Kurdish implementation of Bookchin's \"The Ecology of Freedom\" via municipal assemblies as a democratic confederation of Kurdish communities beyond the state borders of Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Öcalan promoted a platform of shared values: environmental defense, self-defense, gender equality, and pluralistic tolerance for religion, politics, and culture. While some of his followers questioned Öcalan's conversion from Marxism-Leninism, the PKK adopted Öcalan's proposal and began to form assemblies.\n\nFollowers of Öcalan and members of the PKK are known, after his diminutive name, as \"Apocu\" (Apo-ites) under his movement, \"Apoculuk\" (Apoism).\n\nÖcalan is the author of more than 40 books, four of which were written in prison. Many of the notes taken from his weekly meetings with his lawyers have been edited and published.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24698840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24698840", "title": "Aggregation (linguistics)", "text": "Aggregation (linguistics)\n\nAggregation is a subtask of natural language generation, which involves merging syntactic constituents (such as sentences and phrases) together. Sometimes aggregation can be done at a conceptual level.\n\nA simple example of syntactic aggregation is merging the two sentences \"John went to the shop\" and \"John bought an apple\" into the single sentence \"John went to the shop and bought an apple\".\n\nSyntactic aggregation can be much more complex than this. For example, aggregation can embed one of the constituents in the other; e.g., we can aggregate \"John went to the shop\" and \"The shop was closed\" into the sentence \"John went to the shop, which was closed\".\n\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, aggregating sentences together often suggests to the reader that these sentences are related to each other. If this is not the case, the reader may be confused. For example, someone who reads \"John went to the shop and bought an apple\" may infer that the apple was bought in the shop; if this is not the case, then these sentences should not be aggregated.\n\nAggregation algorithms must do two things:\n\nThe first issue, deciding when to aggregate, is poorly understood. Aggegration decisions certainly depend on the semantic relations between the constituents, as mentioned above; they also depend on the genre (e.g., bureaucratic texts tend to be more aggregated than instruction manuals). They probably should depend on rhetorical and discourse structure. The literacy level of the reader is also probably important (poor readers need shorter sentences). But we have no integrated model which brings all these factors together into a single algorithm.\n\nWith regard to the second issue, there have been some studies of different types of aggregation, and how they should be carried out. Harbusch and Kempen describe several syntactic aggregation strategies. In their terminology, \"John went to the shop and bought an apple\" is an example of forward conjunction Reduction \nMuch less is known about conceptual aggregation. Di Eugenio \"et al.\" show how conceptual aggregation can be done in an intelligent tutoring system, and demonstrate that performing such aggregation makes the system more effective (and that conceptual aggregation make a bigger impact than syntactic aggregation).\n\nUnfortunately there is not much software available for performing aggregation. However the simplenlg system does include limited support for basic aggregation. For example, the following code causes simplenlg to print out \"The man is hungry and buys an apple\".\n\n"}
{"id": "52951710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52951710", "title": "Alternative facts", "text": "Alternative facts\n\n\"Alternative facts\" was a phrase used by U.S. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway during a \"Meet the Press\" interview on January 22, 2017, in which she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false statement about the attendance numbers of Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. When pressed during the interview with Chuck Todd to explain why Spicer would \"utter a provable falsehood\", Conway stated that Spicer was giving \"alternative facts\". Todd responded, \"Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\"\n\nConway's use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" for demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including Dan Rather, Jill Abramson, and the Public Relations Society of America. The phrase was extensively described as Orwellian. Within four days of the interview, sales of the book \"1984\" had increased by 9,500%, which \"The New York Times\" and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.\n\nConway later defended her choice of words, defining \"alternative facts\" as \"additional facts and alternative information\".\n\nOn January 21, 2017, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held his first press briefing, he accused the media of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd for President Trump's inaugural ceremony and stated that the ceremony had drawn the \"largest audience to ever witness an inauguration – period – both in person and around the globe\". According to rapid transit ridership data and photographic evidence Spicer's claims and allegations were false. Aerial images showed that the turnout for Trump's inauguration was lower than the turnout for the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. Spicer claimed that 420,000 people rode the DC Metro on inauguration day 2017, compared to 317,000 in 2013. He did not offer a source for his claim, or clarify the time periods being compared. Actual ridership figures between midnight and 11 AM were 193,000 in 2017, 317,000 in 2013. Full-day ridership was 570,557 in 2017, 782,000 in 2013.\n\nSpicer also gave incorrect information about the use of white ground coverings during the inauguration. He stated that they were used for the first time during the Trump inauguration and were to blame for a visual effect that made the audience look smaller. The white ground coverings, however, had been used in 2013 when Obama was sworn in for the second term. Spicer did not take questions from the media at the press briefing.\n\nTrump's campaign strategist and counselor, Kellyanne Conway, defended Spicer's statements in a \"Meet the Press\" interview. In response to a question from Todd about Trump's false claims and the loss of credibility, Conway said, \"Our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to [these claims], but the point remains that...\" Todd interrupted her by saying \"Wait a minute. Alternative facts? ... Alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\" In her answer Conway argued that crowd numbers in general could not be assessed with certainty and objected to what she described as Todd's trying to make her look ridiculous.\n\nConway later defended her choice of words, defining \"alternative facts\" as \"additional facts and alternative information\".\n\nTwo days later, Spicer corrected his statements concerning the WMATA ridership levels, stating that he had been relying on statistics \"given to him\". He stood by his widely disputed claim that the inauguration was the most-viewed, stating he also included online viewership in addition to in-person and television in his figures.\n\nDuring the week following Conway's comments, she discussed \"alternative facts\", substituting the phrases \"alternative information\" and \"incomplete information\". Two days after the Todd interview she defended Trump's travel restrictions by talking about a nonexistent \"Bowling Green massacre\" (she later said she was referring to the arrest of two Iraqis in Bowling Green, Kentucky for sending aid to insurgents in Iraq), and by falsely claiming that President Obama in 2011 had \"banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months\". Her false statements were described as having \"taken 'alternative facts' to a new level\".\n\nThe phrase \"alternative facts\" was claimed to be similar to a phrase used in Trump's 1987 book, \"\". In that book, \"truthful hyperbole\" was described as \"an innocent form of exaggeration—and ... a very effective form of promotion\". The book claimed that \"people want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\" The ghostwriter of the book, Tony Schwartz, said he coined that phrase and claimed that Trump \"loved it\".\n\nConway later defended her remarks in an interview published in March 2017: \"Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts.\" In a radio interview with Mark Simone that was described by Salon in February 2018, she claimed that professional fact-checkers tend to be political liberals and are \"selecting what [they] think should be fact-checked...Americans are their own fact checkers. People know, they have their own facts and figures, in terms of meaning which facts and figures are important to them.\"\n\nSpicer's press conference and Conway's follow-up comments drew quick reactions on social media. Journalist Dan Rather posted a criticism of the incoming Trump administration on his Facebook page. Rather wrote:\nThese are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. When you have a spokesperson for the president of the United States wrap up a lie in the Orwellian phrase \"alternative facts\"... When you have a press secretary in his first appearance before the White House reporters threaten, bully, lie, and then walk out of the briefing room without the cojones to answer a single question... Facts and the truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy. And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it. Everyone must answer that question.\n\"The New York Times\" responded with a fact check of statements made during Spicer's press conference. This included a side-by-side photographic comparison of the crowds from Obama's 2009 inauguration and that of Trump.\n\nJournalist and former \"New York Times\" executive editor Jill Abramson characterized Conway's comments about alternative facts as \"Orwellian newspeak\", and said \"'Alternative facts' are just lies\". NBC News quoted two experts on the psychology of lying who said that the Trump administration was engaging in gaslighting, and reported that the website \"alternativefacts.com\" had been purchased and redirected to an article on the subject.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary website reported that lookups for the word \"fact\" spiked after Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\". They also got involved by tweeting about it: \"A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality.\" The tweet included a link to their article about Conway's use of the term.\n\nFollowing Conway's \"Meet the Press\" interview and the viral response on social media in which \"alternative facts\" was likened to Newspeak, a term from George Orwell's dystopian novel \"1984\", sales of the book increased by more than 9,500 percent, rising to the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com. \"The New York Times\" and others attributed this to Conway's statement. Penguin, the book's publisher, ordered a 75,000 unit reprint to meet demand.\n\nOn January 24, 2017, the Public Relations Society of America, a public relations trade group, put out a statement that said \"Encouraging and perpetuating the use of alternative facts by a high-profile spokesperson reflects poorly on all communications professionals.\"\n\nIn a Breitbart News article dated January 23, 2017, editor Joel Pollak defended Conway's use of \"alternative facts\" by arguing that it was a harmless and accurate term in a legal setting, \"where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide.\" \"The Guardian\" noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries, however, did not yield any results for the term.\"\n\nA week later, the conservative daily magazine \"American Thinker\" argued that the \"tidal wave of derision upon President Trump's senior adviser\" had been rather shocking to observe because the derision had been \"so spectacularly off base\". The magazine asserted that the phrase \"alternative facts\" was in common use in law and that it was known to most lawyers, including Conway, with her George Washington University Law School degree, adding that, \"it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying.\" After giving examples of legal and non-legal uses of the phrase \"alternative facts\", the article contended that when Chuck Todd upbraided Kellyanne Conway with the claim that \"alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods\", he was not only wrong, but \"propagating an ignorance born out of lazy and shallow thinking\".\n\nOn February 23, 2017, fifteen professors of law, some of whom are themselves obliged to adhere to the District of Columbia Bar Association's Rule of Professional Conduct, rule 8.4(a), filed a disciplinary complaint with the D.C. Bar's Office of Disciplinary Conduct. Their complaint applies against Conway, a lawyer in public office, on the grounds that under rule 8.4(c): \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\", because of Conway's pattern of misrepresentation as well as her misuse of words such as \"massacre\" at a time when she holds high public office. The letter of complaint makes a specific reference to the use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" as being involved in one of the cases of alleged misconduct, citing as a reference for its claim an opinion article by a \"New York Times\" Op-Ed columnist.\n\nThe term alternative facts has become a mainstay in popular culture, from late night comedians to more serious news outlets. Jimmy Fallon created a segment \"Two Truths and an Alternative Fact\" on \"The Tonight Show\". Stephen Colbert criticized Conway for saying she was not Inspector Gadget or \"in the job of having evidence\" on \"The Late Show\", claiming \"Kellyanne Conway has only one move: 'Go, go, alternative facts!'\"\n\nCNN's ad campaign \"Facts First\" was a direct response to the concept of alternative facts and fake news. \"USA Today\" listed it in their \"Glossary of Trump terms.\"\n\nBoth Robert De Niro and Steven Spielberg referenced alternative facts in their speech at The National Board of Review awards for the Spielberg film \"The Post\". \"We are in a fight and it's a fight not just about alternative facts but it's a fight for the objective truth\" said Spielberg after accepting the award.\n\nThe 2017 short film \"Alternative Math\" is a satire about the absurdity of the concept of alternative facts.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, German linguists declared the phrase \"alternative facts\" the non-word of the year 2017. It was also chosen by Austrian linguists as the non-word of the year in December 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914", "title": "Author", "text": "Author\n\nAn author is the creator or originator of any written work such as a book or play, and is thus also a writer. More broadly defined, an author is \"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.\n\nTypically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the author. If more than one person created the work, then a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met. In the copyright laws of various jurisdictions, there is a necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship. The United States Copyright Office, for example, defines copyright as \"a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of \"original works of authorship\". Holding the title of \"author\" over any \"literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, [or] certain other intellectual works\" gives rights to this person, the owner of the copyright, especially the exclusive right to engage in or authorize any production or distribution of their work. Any person or entity wishing to use intellectual property held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material. After a fixed amount of time, the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain, where it can be used without limit. Copyright laws in many jurisdictions – mostly following the lead of the United States, in which the entertainment and publishing industries have very strong lobbying power – have been amended repeatedly since their inception, to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder. However, copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work. Technically, someone owns their work from the time it's created. An interesting aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that, in many jurisdictions, it can be passed down to another upon one's death. The person who inherits the copyright is not the author, but enjoys the same legal benefits.\n\nQuestions arise as to the application of copyright law. How does it, for example, apply to the complex issue of fan fiction? If the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans, what is the limit before legal constraints from actors, music, and other considerations, come into play? Additionally, how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books? What powers do the original authors, as well as the publishers, have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction? This particular sort of case also illustrates how complex intellectual property law can be, since such fiction may also involved trademark law (e.g. for names of characters in media franchises), likeness rights (such as for actors, or even entirely fictional entities), fair use rights held by the public (including the right to parody or satirize), and many other interacting complications. Authors may portion out different rights they hold to different parties, at different times, and for different purposes or uses, such as the right to adapt a plot into a film, but only with different character names, because the characters have already been optioned by another company for a television series or a video game. An author may also not have rights when working under contract that they would otherwise have, such as when creating a work for hire (e.g., hired to write a city tour guide by a municipal government that totally owns the copyright to the finished work), or when writing material using intellectual property owned by others (such as when writing a novel or screenplay that is a new installment in an already established media franchise).\n\nIn literary theory, critics find complications in the term \"author\" beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting. In the wake of postmodern literature, critics such as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text.\n\nBarthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author. He writes, in his essay \"Death of the Author\" (1968), that \"it is language which speaks, not the author\". The words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for Barthes, and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production. Every line of written text is a mere reflection of references from any of a multitude of traditions, or, as Barthes puts it, \"the text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture\"; it is never original. With this, the perspective of the author is removed from the text, and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice, one ultimate and universal meaning, are destroyed. The explanation and meaning of a work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it, \"as if it were always in the end, through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction, the voice of a single person, the author 'confiding' in us\". The psyche, culture, fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting a text, because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language. To expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author, their tastes, passions, vices, is, to Barthes, to allow language to speak, rather than author.\n\nMichel Foucault argues in his essay \"What is an author?\" (1969) that all authors are writers, but not all writers are authors. He states that \"a private letter may have a signatory—it does not have an author\". For a reader to assign the title of author upon any written work is to attribute certain standards upon the text which, for Foucault, are working in conjunction with the idea of \"the author function\". Foucault's author function is the idea that an author exists only as a function of a written work, a part of its structure, but not necessarily part of the interpretive process. The author's name \"indicates the status of the discourse within a society and culture\", and at one time was used as an anchor for interpreting a text, a practice which Barthes would argue is not a particularly relevant or valid endeavor.\n\nExpanding upon Foucault's position, Alexander Nehamas writes that Foucault suggests \"an author [...] is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it\", not necessarily who penned the text. It is this distinction between producing a written work and producing the interpretation or meaning in a written work that both Barthes and Foucault are interested in. Foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation, because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation.\n\nLiterary critics Barthes and Foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work, because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of \"author\". They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice. Instead, readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as \"author\".\n\nSelf-publishing, self-publishing, independent publishing, or artisanal publishing is the \"publication of any book, album or other media by its author without the involvement of a traditional publisher. It is the modern equivalent to traditional publishing\".\n\nUnless a book is to be sold directly from the author to the public, an ISBN is required to uniquely identify the title. ISBN is a global standard used for all titles worldwide. Most self-publishing companies either provide their own ISBN to a title or can provide direction; it may be in the best interest of the self-published author to retain ownership of ISBN and copyright instead of using a number owned by a vanity press. A separate ISBN is needed for each edition of the book.\n\nThere are a variety of e-book formats and tools that can be used to create them. Because it is possible to create e-books with no up-front or per-book costs, this is a popular option for self-publishers. E-book publishing platforms include Pronoun, Smashwords, Blurb, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, CinnamonTeal Publishing, Papyrus Editor, ebook leap, Bookbaby, Pubit, Lulu, Llumina Press, and CreateSpace. E-book formats include e-pub, mobi, and PDF, among others.\n\nPrint-on-demand (POD) publishing refers to the ability to print high-quality books as needed. For self-published books, this is often a more economical option than conducting a print run of hundreds or thousands of books. Many companies, such as Createspace (owned by Amazon.com), Outskirts Press, Blurb, Lulu, Llumina Press, Readers Magnet, and iUniverse, allow printing single books at per-book costs not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.\n\nWith commissioned publishing, the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses.\n\nThe more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one.\n\nThe author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold. In Canada, this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts – how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement, the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.\n\nThis type of publisher normally charges a flat fee for arranging publication, offers a platform for selling, and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book. The author receives the rest of the money made.\n\nThe relationship between the author and the editor, often the author's only liaison to the publishing company, is often characterized as the site of tension. For the author to reach his or her audience, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act. There are three principal areas covered by editors – Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher), and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).\n\nPierre Bourdieu's essay \"The Field of Cultural Production\" depicts the publishing industry as a \"space of literary or artistic position-takings\", also called the \"field of struggles\", which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field. Bourdieu claims that the \"field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus\", meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality. In particular for the writer, their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity, and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity. However, it is the editor who has \"the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer\". As \"cultural investors,\" publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in \"cultural capital\" which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions.\n\nAccording to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors' expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception.\n\nA standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties. An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. An advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.\n\nAn author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).\n\nAn author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid. For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 – that is, $2 per book – the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.\n\nIn some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (educational lending right) and PLR (public lending right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.\n\nThese days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.\n\nGhostwriters, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.\n\n"}

{"id": "981746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=981746", "title": "Caret", "text": "Caret\n\nThe caret is an inverted V-shaped grapheme. It is the spacing character ^ in ASCII (at code point 5E) and other character sets that may also be called a \"hat\", \"control\", \"uparrow\", or, less frequently, \"chevron\", \"xor sign\",\" 'to the power of' \"(exponent), \"pointer\" (in Pascal), or \"wedge\". Officially, this character is referred to as \"circumflex accent\" in both ASCII and Unicode terminology (because of its historical use in overstrike), whereas \"caret\" refers to a similar but lowered Unicode character: . Additionally, there is a lowered variant with a stroke: .\n\nThe caret and circumflex are not to be confused with other chevron-shaped characters, such as or , which may occasionally be called carets, too.\n\nThe caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a proofreading mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document. The term comes from the Latin , \"it lacks\", from , \"to lack; to be separated from; to be free from\". The caret symbol is written below the line of text for a line-level punctuation mark, such as a comma, or above the line as an inverted caret (cf. ) for a higher character, such as an apostrophe; the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.\n\nA raised variant of the symbol can be found on some typewriters, where it is used to denote a circumflex in some languages, such as French and Portuguese. It is typically a dead key, which does not cause the carriage to advance and thus allows the following letter to strike the same spot (below the circumflex) on the paper.\n\nAs regards computer systems, the original 1963 version of the ASCII standard reserved the code point 5E for an up-arrow (↑). However, the 1965 ECMA-6 standard replaced the up-arrow with a circumflex (^), which was applicable as a diacritic as well, and two years later, the second revision of ASCII followed suit. As the early mainframes and minicomputers largely used teleprinters as output devices, it was possible to print the circumflex above a letter when needed. With the proliferation of monitors, however, this was seen insufficient, and precomposed characters, with the diacritic included, were instead introduced into appended character sets, such as Latin-1. The original circumflex character was left for other purposes, and as it did not need to fit above a letter anymore, it became larger in appearance.\n\nThe caret has many uses in programming languages. It can signify exponentiation, the bitwise XOR operator, string concatenation, and control characters in caret notation, among other uses. In regular expressions, the caret is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched.\n\nANSI C can transcribe the caret in the form of the trigraph codice_1, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. \nC++ additionally supports tokens like codice_2 (for codice_3) and codice_4 (for codice_5) to avoid the character altogether. \nRFC 1345 recommends to transcribe the character as digraph codice_6 when required.\n\nPascal uses the caret for declaring and dereferencing pointers. \nIn Smalltalk, the caret is the method return statement.\nIn C++/CLI, .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the codice_7 syntax.\nIn Apple's C extensions for Mac OS X and iOS, carets are used to create blocks and to denote block types.\nGo uses it as a bitwise NOT operator.\n\nIn mathematics, the caret can signify exponentiation (codice_8 for ), where the usual superscript is not readily usable (as on some graphing calculators). The caret is also now used to indicate a superscript in TeX typesetting. As Isaac Asimov described it in his 1974 \"Skewered!\" essay (on Skewes' number), \"I make the exponent a figure of normal size and it is as though it is being held up by a lever, and its added weight when its size grows bends the lever down.\" The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to ALGOL 60, which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used as a form of iterated exponentiation in Knuth's up-arrow notation.\n\nThe command-line interpreter, cmd.exe, of Windows family of operating systems uses the caret (^) to escape reserved characters.\n\n Show greater than: > pipe: | less than: < caret: ^ and %TMP% and &\n\nIn Italian, the caret is sometimes used in a similar manner to the ordinal indicator, most noticeably on tickets from Trenitalia, the primary operator of trains within Italy, and Rome's ATAC public transit system. On Trenitalia tickets, the travel class is often written as 1^ or 2^, meaning first class or second class respectively. This is due to the lack of the feminine ordinal indicator () used in Italian in the ASCII set (the masculine ordinal indicator is usually replaced by the degree sign when extended characters are not available or in less accurate typesetting).\n\nIn social network services such as Twitter, a caret placed before a word is used to tag that word as an individual's signature within a group account thus differentiating an individual's contribution from a group-authored contribution. The caret is also a trademarked symbol for denoting a Single Point of Contact or SPOC.\n\nIn internet forums, social networking sites such as Facebook, or in online chats, a caret or a series of carets may be used beneath or after the post of one user by another user. In this usage, the caret ^ represents an upwards-pointing arrow meaning for readers, posters or the original post (OP) to see the above line/post, and in addition to the arrow usage, can also mean that the user who posted the ^ agrees with the above post. Multiple carets may indicate the comment is replying to or relating to the post above that correlates with the number of carets used, or may simply be used for emphasis.\n\nA similar use has been adopted by programming language compilers such as Java compiler to point out where a compilation error has occurred. In addition to indicating the line number and column number of the error location, the compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single caret on the next line, padded by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location. The caret acts as an upwards-pointing arrow in the text-based print out of the error details.\n\nIn statistics or other forms of estimation, estimators of a parameter or dependent variable can be shown by use of a caret or hat symbol above the symbol for that parameter or dependent variable. For example, with observations of independent variable data formula_1 and dependent variable data formula_2, and assuming a model of formula_3, simple linear regression can lead to an estimated model of the form formula_4 where formula_5 is minimised by finding optimal values of formula_6 and formula_7 for the observed data.\n"}

{"id": "10358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10358", "title": "Ephrem the Syrian", "text": "Ephrem the Syrian\n\nEphrem the Syrian ( \"Mār Ap̠rêm Suryāyâ\", ; ; , also known as \"Saint Ephraem\", \"Ephrem\", or \"Ephraim\"; c. 306 – 373) was a Syriac Christian deacon and a prolific Syriac-language hymnographer and theologian of the fourth century.\n\nEphrem is especially beloved in the Syriac Orthodox Church, and counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted Monk) in the Eastern Orthodox Church. His feast day is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers. He was declared a Doctor of the Church in the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\nEphrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose exegesis. These were works of practical theology for the edification of the Church in troubled times. So popular were his works, that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of pseudepigraphal works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all of the fathers of the Syriac-speaking church tradition.\n\nEphrem was born around the year 306 in the city of Nisibis (now Nusaybin in Turkey), in the contested border region between Sassanid Assyria and Roman Mesopotamia, then-recently acquired by Rome.\nInternal evidence from Ephrem's hymnody suggests that both his parents were part of the growing Christian community in the city, although later hagiographers wrote that his father was a pagan priest. Numerous languages were spoken in the Nisibis of Ephrem's day, mostly dialects of Aramaic. The Christian community used the Syriac dialect. The culture included pagan religions, Judaism and early Christian sects.\n\nJacob, the second bishop of Nisibis, was appointed in 308, and Ephrem grew up under his leadership of the community. Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the First Council of Nicea in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a son of the covenant, an unusual form of syriac proto-monasticism. Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher (Syriac \"malp̄ānâ\", a title that still carries great respect for Syriac Christians). He was ordained as a deacon either at his baptism or later. He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a \"herdsman\" (, \"‘allānâ\"), to his bishop as the \"shepherd\" (, \"rā‘yâ\"), and to his community as a 'fold' (, \"dayrâ\"). Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis, which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 337, Emperor Constantine I, who had legalised and promoted the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire, died. Seizing on this opportunity, Shapur II of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North Mesopotamia. Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers. In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like Noah's Ark, floating to safety on the flood.\n\nOne important physical link to Ephrem's lifetime is the baptistery of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported. Constantius II was unable to respond; the campaign of Julian in 363 ended with his death in battle. His army elected Jovian as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia (also in 363) and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population.\n\nEphrem, with the others, went first to Amida (Diyarbakır), eventually settling in Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa) in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the School of Edessa. Edessa had always been at the heart of the Syriac-speaking world, and the city was full of rival philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called \"Palutians\" in Edessa, after a former bishop. Arians, Marcionites, Manichees, Bardaisanites and various gnostic sects proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, Jacob of Serugh, wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. The most reliable date for his death is 9 June 373.\n\nOver four hundred hymns composed by Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lost, Ephrem's productivity is not in doubt. The church historian Sozomen credits Ephrem with having written over three million lines. Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early Rabbinic Judaism, he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.\n\nThe most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns (, \"madrāšê\"). These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The madrāšê are written in stanzas of syllabic verse and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. Each madrāšâ had its \"qālâ\" (), a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these qālê are now lost. It seems that Bardaisan and Mani composed madrāšê, and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims. The madrāšê are gathered into various hymn cycles. Each group has a title — \"Carmina Nisibena\", \"On Faith\", \"On Paradise\", \"On Virginity\", \"Against Heresies\" — but some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection (for instance, only the first half of the \"Carmina Nisibena\" is about Nisibis). Each madrāšâ usually had a refrain (, \"‘ûnîṯâ\"), which was repeated after each stanza. Later writers have suggested that the madrāšê were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre.\n\nParticularly influential were his \"Hymns Against Heresies\". Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were \"tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles.\" He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as docetism. The \"Hymns Against Heresies\" employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ's unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ's nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ's followers with their false teachings.\n\nEphrem also wrote verse homilies (, \"mêmrê\"). These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madrāšê. The mêmrê were written in a heptosyllabic couplets (pairs of lines of seven syllables each).\n\nThe third category of Ephrem's writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the Diatessaron (the single gospel harmony of the early Syriac church), the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His \"Commentary on Genesis and Exodus\" is an exegesis of Genesis and Exodus. Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles and Pauline Epistles.\n\nHe also wrote refutations against Bardaisan, Mani, Marcion and others.\n\nEphrem is attributed with writing hagiographies such as \"The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot\", though this credit is called into question.\n\nEphrem wrote exclusively in the Syriac language, but translations of his writings exist in Classical Armenian, Coptic, Old Georgian, Koine Greek and other languages. Some of his works are only extant in translation (particularly in Armenian). Syriac churches still use many of Ephrem's hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.\n\nThe most complete, critical text of authentic Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the \"Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium\".\n\nAs Chronologist, St. Ephrem the Syrian has composed the history of the Patriarchs and Kings from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ, \"The Book of the Cave of Treasure\", translated by W. Budge from the Syriac text of the British Museum Mss Add. 25875, published by The Religious Tract Society, 1927.\n\nEphrem's writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios (the way, robe of glory, sons and daughters of the Covenant, wedding feast, harrowing of hell, Noah’s Ark/Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, medicine of life, mirror, pearl, Tree of life, paradise).\n\nEphrem's artful meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. This occurred to the extent that there is a huge corpus of Ephrem pseudepigraphy and legendary hagiography. Some of these compositions are in verse, often a version of Ephrem's heptosyllabic couplets. Most of these works are considerably later compositions in Greek. Students of Ephrem often refer to this corpus as having a single author called \"Greek Ephrem\", or \"Ephraem Graecus\" (as opposed to the real Ephrem the Syrian). This is not to say that all texts ascribed to Ephrem in Greek are by others, but many are. Although Greek compositions are the main source of pseudepigraphal material, there are also works in Latin, Slavonic and Arabic. There has been very little critical examination of these works, and many are still treasured by some churches as authentic.\n\nThe best known of these writings is the \"Prayer of Saint Ephrem\", which is recited at every service during Great Lent and other fasting periods in Eastern Christianity.\n\nSoon after Ephrem's death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier \"modifications\" is the statement that Ephrem's father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents. \n\nThe second legend attached to Ephrem is that he was a monk. In Ephrem's day, monasticism was in its infancy in Egypt. He seems to have been a part of the members of the covenant, a close-knit, urban community of Christians that had \"covenanted\" themselves to service and had refrained from sexual activity. Some of the Syriac terms that Ephrem used to describe his community were later used to describe monastic communities, but the assertion that he was monk is anachronistic. Later hagiographers often painted a picture of Ephrem as an extreme ascetic, but the internal evidence of his authentic writings show him to have had a very active role, both within his church community and through witness to those outside of it.\n\nEphrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in Eastern Christianity. In the Eastern Orthodox scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted Monk). His feast day is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers (Cheesefare Saturday), which is the Saturday before the beginning of Great Lent.\n\nEphrem is popularly believed to have taken legendary journeys. In one of these he visits Basil of Caesarea. This links the Syrian Ephrem with the Cappadocian Fathers and is an important theological bridge between the spiritual view of the two, who held much in common. Ephrem is also supposed to have visited Saint Pishoy in the monasteries of Scetes in Egypt. As with the legendary visit with Basil, this visit is a theological bridge between the origins of monasticism and its spread throughout the church.\n\nOn 5 October 1920, Pope Benedict XV proclaimed Ephrem a Doctor of the Church (\"Doctor of the Syrians\"). This proclamation was made before critical editions of Ephrem's authentic writings were available.\n\nThe most popular title for Ephrem is \"Harp of the Spirit\" (Syriac: , \"Kenārâ d-Rûḥâ\"). He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.\n\nHis Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years (1920–1969), it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.\n\nEphrem is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on June 10.\n\n\n\n\n"}

High-pressure jets are typically attached along its length to dislodge any obstructions (such as drill cuttings collecting in one spot) that may occur. \n\nThe possum belly is used to slow the flow of returning drilling fluid before it hits the shale shakers. This enables the shale shaker to clean the cuttings out of the drilling fluid before it is returned to the pits for circulation.\n\nAnother common add on is the sample box. This is a heavy duty rubber hose that is inserted at the end of the flow line and at the other end emplaced into the sample box itself. The sample box is used to capture samples of drill cuttings for geological logging. The box is typically equipped with a raising door that allows the water and cuttings to escape after a sample is collected.\n\nA stinger line is similar to a flow line, but unlike a flow line is not used to maintain circulation. The stinger line is attached to the blowout preventer to allow for the pressure from a blowout to be released. The stinger line usually will run parallel to the flow line.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2642299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2642299", "title": "Freepost", "text": "Freepost\n\nFreepost is a postal service provided by various postal administrations, whereby a person sends mail without affixing postage, and the recipient pays the postage when collecting the mail. Freepost differs from self-addressed stamped envelopes, courtesy reply mail, and metered reply mail in that the recipient of the freepost pays only for those items that are actually received, rather than for all that are distributed.\n\nIn one typical use of freepost, a business sends bulk mail to potential customers, the bulk mail including envelopes or postcards that potential customers can return to the business by freepost. In another typical use, magazines include subscription cards that potential subscribers can return by freepost. In yet another typical use, a seller can provide a merchandise return label bearing the appropriate freepost indicia (as described below) to a customer so that the customer can return the item to the seller by freepost upon issuance of a Return Merchandise Authorization.\n\nA non-commercial usecase would be to return lost items belonging to some business: the item will have printed on the back \"if found please return by freepost to <address>\". For example, UK's NHS worker's RFID access cards can be returned by freepost if lost & found.\n\nIn Australia, freepost is called Reply Paid. Specially printed envelopes are used, with the permit holder's address, the words \"Reply Paid\" with an authorization number. The stamp is replaced by three black stripes. The permit holder pays the postage plus a fee to the postal authority. The customer may write the Reply Paid envelope out by hand.\n\nAn important customer like the Taxation Office would have an RP number the same as the post code, to minimize errors even more.\n\nTo coordinate service with the United States, Canada Post uses the same terminology and the same standards as the USPS (as explained below), with the exception of the use of Canadian Postal codes.\n\nIn the United States, the United States Postal Service refers to freepost as business reply mail. A mailer wishing to receive mail by freepost must obtain a business reply permit and design the envelopes, postcards, or labels according to the standards specified by the USPS, including the use of an appropriate FIM B or C code. The address on the envelope, postcard, or label is the same as the address for regular mail, except that the ZIP+4 code is different. In some large cities, business reply mail has its own five-digit ZIP code or codes (e.g., 20077 and 20078 in Washington, D.C.). The envelope or postcard also includes space for the business reply permit number.\n\nIn the UK and NZ, freepost envelopes can be hand addressed by the sender; this simply requires including the word ‘FREEPOST’ and the recipient’s permit number as part of the address. (This technique can not be used to send mail to merely anyone, who would then have to pay for it; the permit number and the recipient address must match for the recipient to be billed.) \n\nIn the Netherlands, freepost is addressed exactly the same as normal mail. The recipient needs a special address: an answering number (antwoordnummer in Dutch). The sender can distinguish these addresses because they include the word 'antwoordnummer' and may choose whether or not to use a stamp. When no stamp is used, the recipient pays the costs plus a fee, but when the sender uses a stamp, no extra costs are made.\n\nIn Finland, there are two types of freepost. In the first one, that is used on order that company has sent and customer wants to return it (for example, an order from an e-commerce store), the customer can use the same envelope the company sent and simply write ‘PALAUTUS’ or ‘ASIAKASPALAUTUS’ (‘RETURN’ or ‘CUSTOMER RETURN’ in English). The company must have a contract with the Finnish postal service Itella. \n\nThe other option is to use following form:\n\nWhere \"‘tunnus’\" means ‘code’ and \"‘vastauslähetys’\" means ‘return delivery’. Postal code is always same for these deliveries. There is usually some text indicating that postage is paid on the upper-right corner. (where stamp would be located) Companies can, however design this text, or image, themselves to match the company logo instead of using the standard one. The company must also have contract with Itella. The address may be handwritten by the customer.\n\nOther countries use freepost as well, although the envelope designs required by those countries' postal authorities differ widely from that described above. A freepost address may have a special freepost number for use along with, or instead of, the address for regular mail.\n\nInternational freepost also exists and is known variously as ‘International Business Reply Service’, ‘International Business Reply Mail’, 'International Business Response Service', 'IBRS' and, in French, \"Correspondance Commerciale-Réponse Internationale\" (CCRI). Like USPS business reply mail, international business reply mail must conform to certain format requirements, including the prominent notice \"REPONSE PAYEE\" (French for \"reply paid\"), and a number indicating the account that will pay for the postage.\nInternational Business Reply Service is a convenient way for international customers to reply to the sender with pre-paid cards and envelopes, at no cost to them.\n\n"}

It was devised by Kenneth Garside while he was deputy librarian there. Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments. The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because \"none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character.\"\ninstead, it was modeled around the \"subject reading rooms\" into which the collection had been divided. The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.\n\nThe principles of the scheme were \"To provide the optimum arrangement of books in each subject; to permit the revision of the classification to meet a changing academic approach to a subject without disturbing in any way other parts of the scheme; and to provide as simple a shelf mark as possible to help the reader find the book he wants with the minimum mental effort.\" \n\nIn his article \"The basic principles of the new library classification at University College London\" Garside set out the generic structure of the system. The library would be divided into subject based reading rooms such as, in the below example, a dedicated space for biology related materials. These would then be subdivided according to the below table, using alphabetical characters:\nThe alphabetical sub-divisions were designed in consultation with the teaching department.\nThese subsections would then be divided by numbers:\nThe completed shelf mark would then include the first three letters of the author's surname.\n\ne.g. \"Basic concepts in population, quantitative, and evolutionary genetics\" by James F. Crow is shelved at BIOLOGY H 5 CRO.\n\nIn order to provide for a single subject card catalogue, Garside added a further table to which the top reading room divisions could be mapped.\n\nThe scheme is used at UCL. A adapted version is used by the Folklore Society. Garside instituted a similar scheme in his time at Leeds University.\n"}
{"id": "4825711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4825711", "title": "Greek orthography", "text": "Greek orthography\n\nThe orthography of the Greek language ultimately has its roots in the adoption of the Greek alphabet in the 9th century BC. Some time prior to that, one early form of Greek, Mycenaean, was written in Linear B, although there was a lapse of several centuries (the Greek Dark Ages) between the time Mycenaean stopped being written and the time when the Greek alphabet came into use.\n\nEarly Greek writing in the Greek alphabet was phonemic, different in each dialect. Since the adoption of the Ionic variant for Attic in 403 BC, however, Greek orthography has been largely conservative and historical.\n\nGiven the phonetic development of Greek, especially in the Hellenistic period, certain modern vowel phonemes have multiple orthographic realizations:\nThis affects not only lexical items but also inflectional affixes, so correct orthography requires mastery of formal grammar, \"e.g.\" 'the good one (fem. sing.)' \"vs.\" 'the good ones (masc. pl.)'; 'I call' \"vs.\" 'good (neut. sing.)'.\n\nSimilarly, the orthography preserves ancient doubled consonants, though these are now pronounced the same as single consonants, except in Cypriot Greek.\n\nA digraph is a pair of letters used to write one sound or a combination of sounds that does not correspond to the written letters in sequence. The orthography of Greek includes several digraphs, including various pairs of vowel letters that used to be pronounced as diphthongs but have been shortened to monophthongs in pronunciation. Many of these are characteristic developments of modern Greek, but some were already present in Classical Greek. None of them is regarded as a letter of the alphabet.\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, it became customary to write the silent iota in digraphs as an iota subscript.\n\nPolytonic spelling uses a variety of diacritics to represent aspects of the pronunciation of ancient Greek. Polytonic, along with lowercase letters, became standard in Byzantine Greek, although the ancient distinctions had disappeared, replaced by a simple stress accent. The orthographies of modern Greek, both \"katharevousa\" and \"dhimotiki\", used the polytonic system until 1982, when monotonic spelling was introduced. In some conservative contexts, such as the Church, polytonic spellings are still used.\n\nMonotonic orthography, adopted in 1982, replaces the ancient diacritics with just two: the acute accent (\"tónos\", e.g. ), used to mark the stressed syllable in polysyllabic words, and the diaeresis (\"dialytiká\", e.g. ), which indicates that the vowel is not part of a digraph.\n\nAncient Greek was written as without spacing or interpuncts. Over time, a variety of symbols appeared. A system of dots credited to Aristophanes of Byzantium was developed in the 3rd century BC: a low dot marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a middot marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a high dot marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed two dot punctuation to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three , four and , and five dots appeared. Such interline punctuation could be noted or replaced by a variety of , long marks which trailed between lines of text; these might also mark changes of speakers. Blank lines or various marked the ends of sections. (A separate was used to mark contractions; its early forms looked like an apostrophe between the two elided words.) Over time, the main punctuation came to be a full stop marked by a single dot at varying heights, a partial stop marked by various forms of commas, and the and papyrological hyphen or . These served to show whether an ambiguous series of letters should be read as (respectively) a single word or as a pair of words. Later Aristarchus of Samothrace modified this system (see: Aristarchian symbols).\n\nFollowing the advent of printing, most Greek punctuation was gradually standardized with French: the was fully unified with the comma, the comma serves as the decimal point (and in this use is called the ) and it also functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing (, \"whatever\") from (, \"that\"). The full stop serves as the thousands separator, and guillemets () and em-length quotation dashes () typically serve to indicate direct speech. The principal difference is the Greek question mark , which developed a shape so similar to the Latinate semicolon that Unicode decomposes its separate code point identically. The middot serves as the Greek semicolon but is so uncommon that it has often been left off of Greek keyboards. The exclamation mark () is mostly used as in English. The hyphen, the brackets, the colon, the ellipsis and the slash are also in use. The slash has the additional function of forming common abbreviations like for 'brothers'. The ligature kai (ϗ) is sometimes used for the same function as the English ampersand.\n\nThere are special rules for how to write Greek numerals. In modern Greek, a number of changes have been made. Instead of extending an overline over an entire number (like ), a (,  \"hornlike projection\") is placed to its upper right, a development of the short marks formerly used for single numbers and fractions. The modern is a symbol (ʹ) similar to the acute accent (´), but has its own Unicode character, encoded as U+0374. Alexander the Great's father Philip II of Macedon is thus known as in modern Greek. A lower left (Unicode: U+0375, \"Greek Lower Numeral Sign\") is now standard for distinguishing thousands: 2015 is represented as ͵ΒΙΕʹ (2000 + 10 + 5).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3732565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3732565", "title": "Kven language", "text": "Kven language\n\nThe Kven language (\"kvääni\" or \"kväänin kieli\"; \"kainu\" or \"kainun kieli\") is a Finnish dialect spoken in northern Norway by the Kven people. For political and historical reasons, it received the status of a minority language in 2005 within the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Linguistically, however, it is seen as a mutually intelligible dialect of the Finnish language, and grouped together with the Peräpohjola dialects such as Meänkieli, spoken in Torne Valley in Sweden.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the dialects spoken by the Kvens and Kainuu peoples are not closely related. The Kainuu dialect is one of the Savonian dialects that was formed from the 16th century onwards, when immigrants from Savonia started to settle in the northern wastelands.\n\nThe Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian loanwords, such as \"tyskäläinen\" (from the Norwegian word \"tysk\", meaning \"German\") instead of standard Finnish \"saksalainen\". The Kven language also uses some old Finnish words that are no longer used in Finland.\n\nThere are about 1,500 to 10,000 known native speakers of this language, most of whom are over the age of 60. This population uses it as their main way of communicating and speaks no other language. This is a growing concern because as this population ages and soon passes away, there is fear that the Kven language will die out as well. Middle aged speakers tend to have a passing knowledge of the language. They use it occasionally, but not frequently enough to keep it off the endangered list. People under the age of 30 are barely seen to speak or know the language. However, children in the community of Børselv can learn Kven in their primary schools.\n\nThere is no complete grammar for the language and scarce material, making it hard for this language to be learned. The Kven Assembly was formed in 2007 and plans to standardize a Kven written language. The term \"Kven\" first appeared in Othere's tales from the 800's along with the term \"Finn\" and \"Norwegian\". The area that the Kvens lived in was called Kvenland. They originally settled in Kvenland, which also expanded into the flat areas of the Bay of Bothnia. As the Kven community continued to grow and develop a long standing culture, the Norwegian state deemed the Kvens taxpayers and the term \"Kven\" soon became an ethical term. In 1992, The European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages was set into place. This charter was set in place to protect regional and minority languages, the agreement included Kven as a minority language. The Kven language, however protected under the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, is only considered a Level I. This means that the culture and language are barely protected under this charter and with the language dying out it is important that the language be moved up to a level III.\n\nThe Norwegian Kven Organization was established in 1987. The organization currently has about 700 members and about 8 different local branches. The duties of this organization include many different tasks. The members report to the government about the history and rights of the Kven people. The members also try and highlight Kven news by advancing Kvens media coverage. The organization has also been pushing the Norwegian government to establish a state secretary for Kven issues. Moving the language of Kven into kindergarten classrooms, as well as all other education levels is also a forefront issue that the organization is aiming to tackle. All advances made by the Norwegian Kven Organization is to promote the growth and conservation of the Kven language and culture.\n\nFrom the 1860s onwards the Norwegian government attempted to assimilate the Kvens. For example, the use of the Kven language became forbidden in schools and government offices, and Kven town names were replaced by Norwegian names. From the 1970s onwards, the Kvens and the Sami in Norway have openly been allowed to use their original native languages, the Kven language and the Sami languages, respectively, and to teach them to their children in schools. Despite its recent gain of status as a minority language, there is still a major discussion among the Kven about whether the Finnish orthography should be applied to the language or if a new orthography should be devised.\n\nSince 2006, it has been possible to study the Kven culture and language at the University of Tromsø, and in 2007 the Kven language board was formed at the Kven institute, a national centre for Kven language and culture in Børselv, Norway. The council will work out a written Kven language, but use Finnish orthography to maintain inter-Finnish language understanding.\n\nToday, most speakers of Kven are found in two Norwegian communities, Storfjord and Porsanger. A few speakers can be found other places, such as Bugøynes, Neiden, Vestre Jakobselv, Vadsø, and Nordreisa.\n\nIn northeastern Norway, mainly around Varanger Fjord, the spoken language is quite similar to standard Finnish, whereas the Kven spoken west of Alta, due to the area's close ties to the Torne Valley area along the border between Finland and Sweden, is more closely related to the Meänkieli Finnish spoken there.\n\nIn government report from 2005, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. However, there are very few young people who speak it, making it an endangered language.\n\nThe phonology of Kven is basically the same as that of Finnish.

After that he studied law at Odessa University for one year, then completed his studies at Kiev University, and went on to practice law in Kiev. He practiced law throughout his life, barely managing to make a living. In 1903 he moved to Belgium to work as a legal adviser for a firm there; upon falling ill in 1905, he returned to Kiev, where he died two years later.\n\nBy the influence of Abraham Goldfaden Warshawsky started to write songs and sing them in his circle of friends accompanied by a fortepiano. He did not take seriously his musical work and never recorded those songs, relying on his memory. Many of his works in this way were spread throughout the Jewish community of the Ukrainian region of the Russian Empire and most of them were simply adopted as folk songs.\n\nIn 1890 Warshawsky met with Sholem Aleichem. After listening to his songs, Sholem Aleichem wrote \"I simply hugged him and kissed him!\" And then, \nLater, by Aleichem's full cooperation, Warshavsky published his first collection, \"Yiddishe Volkslider\" (\"Jewish People's songs\", Kiev, 1900) with a heartily foreword from the great classic. That book was republished not only in Russia, but abroad as well. The collection included such songs as \"Der Alef-Beis\" (commonly known as Oyfn Pripetshik), \"A Brif fun Amerike\", \"Der Zeide mit der Babe\". The songs described the everyday life of Jews in the Russian Empire.\n\nTogether Sholem Aleichem and Warshawsky started to tour around Russia performing their own repertoire. They also had plans to travel to the United States, however those plans were left unfulfilled as Warshawsky suddenly became ill and died on November 26.

His translation (with Peter Geach) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.\n\nBorn in Baku, Azerbaijan, of Jewish descent, Black grew up in London, where his family had moved in 1912. He studied mathematics at Queens' College, Cambridge where he developed an interest in the philosophy of mathematics. Russell, Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, and Ramsey were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930 and was awarded a fellowship to study at Göttingen for a year.\n\nFrom 1931–36, he was mathematics master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle.\n\nHis first book was \"The Nature of Mathematics\" (1933), an exposition of \"Principia Mathematica\" and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nBlack had made notable contributions to the metaphysics of identity. In his \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\", Black presents an objection to Leibniz' Law by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz' second principle in his formulation of \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\". By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.\n\nHe lectured in mathematics at the Institute of Education in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the United States and joined the Philosophy Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1946 he accepted a professorship in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist William H. Gass.

{"id": "4543620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4543620", "title": "OmegaT", "text": "OmegaT\n\nOmegaT is a computer-assisted translation tool written in the Java programming language. It is free software originally developed by Keith Godfrey in 2000, and is currently developed by a team led by Didier Briel.\n\nOmegaT is intended for professional translators. Its features include customisable segmentation using regular expressions, translation memory with fuzzy matching and match propagation, glossary matching, dictionary matching, translation memory and reference material searching, and inline spell-checking using Hunspell spelling dictionaries.\n\nOmegaT runs on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 98 SE or higher, and requires Java 1.5. It is available in 27 languages. According to a survey in 2010 among 458 professional translators, OmegaT is used 1/3 as much as Wordfast, Déjà Vu and MemoQ, and 1/8 as much as the market leader Trados.\n\nOmegaT was first developed by Keith Godfrey in 2000. It was originally written in C++.\n\nThe first public release in February 2001 was written in Java. This version used a proprietary translation memory format. It could translate unformatted text files, and HTML, and perform only block-level segmentation (i.e. paragraphs instead of sentences).\n\nThe development of OmegaT is hosted on SourceForge. The development team is led by Didier Briel. As with many opensource projects, new versions of OmegaT are released frequently, usually with 2-3 bugfixes and feature updates each. There is a \"standard\" version, which always has a complete user manual and a \"latest\" version which includes features that are not yet documented in the user manual. The updated sources are always available from the SourceForge code repository.\n\nOmegaT handles a translation job as a project, a hierarchy of folders with specific names. The user copies non-translated documents into one named /source/ (or subfolders thereof). The Editor pane displays the source documents as individual “segments” for translation one segment at a time. OmegaT, when directed, generates the (partially) translated versions in the /target/ subfolder.\n\nOther named folders include ones for automatic consultation within the program: /tm/ for existing translation pairs in .tmx format, /tm/auto/ for automatic translation of 100% matches, /glossary/ for glossaries, /dictionary/ for StarDict (and .tbx) dictionaries.\n\nWhen the user goes to translate a segment in the Editor pane, OmegaT automatically searches the .tmx files in the /tm/ hierarchy for previous translation pairs with similar source sentences and displays them in the Fuzzy Matches pane for insertion into the Editor pane with a keyboard shortcut. The Glossary and Dictionary panes provide similar automatic look-up functions for any glossaries and dictionaries in the corresponding named folders in the project. The optional Machine Translation pane shows machine translations from Google Translate and similar services.\n\nWhen the user leaves a segment, OmegaT normally first adds the source-target pair to its database in memory. It subsequently saves that database to disk in Translation Memory eXchange (.tmx) format for use another day, in other projects, by other translators, and even with other CAT tools. No change, naturally enough, means no such update. Version 3.1 added a setting for blocking targets equal to their sources, a common slip, plus a keyboard shortcut for overriding it—numbers, source code in programming manuals, etc.\n\nAt any point, the user can create partially translated versions of the source files. Note that OmegaT copies source segments verbatim if they have yet to be translated. Before doing so, however, the user is advised to use the Validate menu command to check for tag and other errors. Version 3.1 added a menu command (and keyboard shortcut) for limiting operation to the current file—for partial delivery or quick update, for example.\n\nOmegaT shares many features with mainstream CAT tools. These include creating, importing and exporting translation memories, fuzzy matching from translation memories, glossary look-up, and reference and concordance searching.\n\nOmegaT also has additional features that are not always available in other CAT tools. These include:\n\n\nSeveral file types can be translated directly in OmegaT. OmegaT determines the file type by the file extension. The file extension handling and preferred encoding can be customised to override default settings.\n\nOmegaT handles formatted documents by converting formatting to tags, similar to other commercial CAT tools.\n\nThere are two processes that allow OmegaT to handle unsupported formats:\n\n\nThe program Rainbow from the Okapi Framework can convert certain file formats to an XLIFF format that OmegaT does support. Rainbow can also create complete OmegaT project folders from such documents, for easier handling in OmegaT.\n\nA number of file formats can be converted to Gettext Portable Object (PO) files, which can be translated in OmegaT. The Debian program po4a can convert formats such as LaTeX, TeX and POD to Gettext PO. The Translate Toolkit can convert Mozilla .properties and dtd files, CSV files, certain Qt .ts files, and certain XLIFF files to Gettext PO.\n\nMicrosoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents from version 97 to 2003 can be converted to Office Open XML (Microsoft Office 2007/2010) or ODF (OpenOffice.org) format. Conversion is not entirely lossless and may lead to loss of formatting.\n\nTrados® .ttx files can be treated using the Okapi TTX Filter.\n\nOmegaT's internal translation memory format is not visible to the user, but every time it autosaves the translation project, all new or updated translation units are automatically exported and added to three external TMX memories: a native OmegaT TMX, a level 1 TMX and a level 2 TMX.\n\n\nExported level 2 files include OmegaT's internal tags encapsulated in TMX tags which allows such TMX files to generate matches in TMX level 2 supporting CAT tools. Tests have been positive in Trados and SDLX.\n\nOmegaT can import TMX files up to version 1.4b level 1 as well as level 2. Level 2 files imported in OmegaT will generate matches of the same level since OmegaT converts the TMX level 2 tags of the foreign TMX. Here again, tests have been positive with TMX files created by Transit.\n\nFor glossaries, OmegaT mainly uses tab-delimited plain text files in UTF-8 encoding with the .txt extension. The structure of a glossary file is extremely simple: the first column contains the source language word, the second column contains the corresponding target language words, the third column (optional) can contain anything including comments on context etc. Such glossaries can easily be created in a text editor.\n\nSimilarly structured files in standard CSV format are also supported, as well as TBX files.\n\nOmegaT is open-source software and benefits from the help of volunteers. Programming is certainly the most important function, but it would benefit from greater support from volunteers in almost all areas. If you feel so inclined, you may also modify OmegaT to suit your own requirements.\n\nOmegaT's user interface and documentation have been translated into about 30 languages. Volunteer translators can translate either the user interface, the \"Instant Start\" short tutorial, or the entire user manual (or all three components). All the language files and all translations of the user manual are included in the standard distribution of OmegaT.\n\nA characteristic of the OmegaT user community is that deficiencies in OmegaT often prompt users to create macros, scripts and programs that perform those functions, although sometimes those features later become available in OmegaT itself. When OmegaT offered only paragraph segmentation, a user created OpenOffice.org macros for segmenting by sentence. When automatic leveraging of TMs in OmegaT still required TMs to be merged, a user created a TMX merging script. When OmegaT offered no spell-checking support, several users created scripts or found solutions to provide spell-checking as part of an OmegaT based translation process.\n\nAutshumato consists of a CAT tool, an aligner, a PDF extractor, a TMX editor, and a public TM based on crawled data. The finished version will include a terminology manager and a machine translator. The CAT tool element is built upon OmegaT, and requires OpenOffice.org to run. Development is funded by the South African government's Department of Arts and Culture.\n\nBenten is an Eclipse-based XLIFF editor. It uses OmegaT code to handle the TM matching process. It is partly funded by the Japanese government.\n\nBoltran is a web-based tool that mimicks the workflow of an OmegaT project. It is built upon the source code of OmegaT and can export OmegaT projects.\n\nOmegaT+ is a CAT tool that was forked from OmegaT version 1.4.5 in 2005. OmegaT+ works in a way similar to OmegaT. It has developed its own features but projects are not compatible with OmegaT.\n\nThe Directorate-General for Translation of the European Commission (DGT) uses OmegaT as an alternative CAT tool alongside a mainstream commercial tool. DGT maintains a fork of OmegaT (DGT-OmegaT) with adaptations/improvements/new features that meet DGT-specific requirements as well as a number of helper-applications to integrate OmegaT in its workflow: a Wizard to automate the creation, updating, revision and delivery of projects, Tagwipe to clean useless tags in docx documents and TeamBase to allow the sharing of memories in real-time. Those applications are made available by DGT as free open source software.\n\n\n\n"}

Singaram\n\nPa.Singaram () was an important Tamil writer from Sivagangai district who lived most of his adult life is South east Asia – mainly Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nP Singaram is considered to be one of the greatest Tamil novelist of the modern era despite having authored only two novels. His Puyalile Oru Thoni is considered by many Tamil literary giants to be one of the very important Tamil fiction of all time.\n\nSingaram was born on 12 August 1920 to Ku.Pazhanivel Nadar and Unnamalai Ammal in a village called Singampunari in Sivagangai district in Tamil Nadu. He was third of brothers Subramanian and Bhaskaran and his family was involved in clothes business along with his grand father Kumarasamy Nadar.\n\nHe had his primary education at Singampunari Primary school and further education at St.Mary's higher secondary school Madurai. He went to Medan, Indonesia when he was 18 years old to work there with S K Sinnamuthu Pillai.\n\nHe got married there but his wife and the baby died in pregnancy when he was 25. He came back to India after World War II and lived in Madurai\n\nHe moved to Medan when he was 18 – when the world slowly came together the second time for a great World War. The waters become treacherous and Singaram didn't get his share of Tamil-language magazines through ships. Penang library provided him solace and introduced Hemingway, Tolstoy, Faulkner, Chekhov and Dostoyevsky to him.\n\nHis influence of Hemingway was very evident in both his works and he considered A Farewell to Arms his favorite and masterpiece of Hemingway. He believed \"A Farewell to Arms\" an important milestone in American literature and rated \"Anna Karenina\" more than \"War and Peace\".\n\nSingaram has written only 2 novels and he was so frustrated by the difficulties he faced in publishing his novels that he never wrote anything after that. He said he was not encouraged when he wanted to write and he lost motivation after publishing the 2 novels he wrote. He has more than once spoke of Ernest Hemingway's influence in his works and lists him as his favourite writer.\n\nHis knowledge on Tamil literature was limited to short stories of Pudhumaipithan and Mouni he read before travelling to Indonesia. In his later years when asked whether he is aware of the present Tamil writers and their works he commented it lacked depth and he couldn't read past two pages of Sujatha and Sivasankari\n\nP Singaram wrote this novel in 1950 immediately after he returned to India. Though he sent the novel to many publishers the novel kept returning without getting published. A friend sent this novel to Kalaimagal publications for a novel contest. The novel won first prize in that novel contest. Finally, he was able to publish Kadalukku Appal in 1959 through Kalaimagal publications.\n\nThis novel was written in 1962 and it didn't find any publishers -after continuous efforts by a friend, Puyalile Oru Thoni was published in 1972 by Kalaignan publications. Many modern Tamil writers consider this as an important literary work published in Tamil in this century. The story happens in Sumatra in the background of Second World War.\n\nSeveral notable film-makers have expressed their desire to make this epic novel into a movie but conceding it's an impossible task to do justice to this book.\n\nSingaram returned to India in 1946 and had plans to go back to Indonesia. It was never materialized and in Madurai he joined Dinathandhi newspaper and worked there till he took voluntary retirement in 1987. He did not maintain close relationships with anybody and lived alone for 50 years in YMCA hostel in Madurai\n\nWriters Ramakrishnan, Konangi and many others have met Singaram in his last years of life and told him in person how much they were moved by his works. They repeatedly told Singaram's his stronghold in Tamil literature but Singaram was stoic as ever. He refused to accept his place and no more wrote.\n\nIn 1997, he gave away his earnings to Social welfare trusts. In the same year his health condition deteriorated and on 30 December 1997, he died in ambulance while being taken to hospital. He had told not to inform about his death to anyone.\n"}

Because much of this material is mailed, it is also a category of mail, accepted for delivery by a postal administration, that is not considered to be first-class mail and therefore qualifies for a special reduced printed matter postal rate. Depending on the specific postal regulations of the country, it is usually non-personal correspondence and printed in multiple quantities. Most postal authorities do not permit additional services, like registration or express services, to be added to items mailed as printed matter.\n\nIn the Postal Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico, proclaimed on June 20, 1862, terms were specified relating to the rates for printed matter between the two countries.

{"id": "14754558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14754558", "title": "Prosodic unit", "text": "Prosodic unit\n\nIn linguistics, a prosodic unit, often called an intonation unit or intonational phrase, is a segment of speech that occurs with a single prosodic contour (pitch and rhythm contour). The abbreviation IU is used and therefore the full form is often found as \"intonation unit,\" despite the fact that technically it is a unit of prosody rather than intonation, which is only one element of prosody.\n\nProsodic units occur at a hierarchy of levels, from the metrical foot and phonological word to a complete utterance. However, the term is generally restricted to intermediate levels which do not have a dedicated terminology. Prosodic units do not generally correspond to syntactic units, such as phrases and clauses; it is thought that they reflect different aspects of how the brain processes speech, with prosodic units being generated through on-line interaction and processing, and with morphosyntactic units being more automated.\n\nProsodic units are characterized by several phonetic cues, such as a coherent pitch contour. Breathing, both inhalation and exhalation, only occurs at the boundaries (pausa) between higher units. Several short contours may carry an additional overall gradual decline in pitch and slowing of tempo; this larger unit is termed a \"declination unit\" (DU). At the boundaries (pauses) between declination units, the pitch and tempo reset; for this reason the final one of the shorter internal contours is said to have \"final\" prosody, whereas the others are said to have \"continuing\" prosody.\n\nThese two levels of the hierarchy may be schematized as follows:\n\nIn English orthography, a \"continuing\" prosodic boundary may be marked with a comma (assuming the writer is using commas to represent prosody rather than grammatical structure), while \"final\" prosodic boundaries may be marked with a full stop (period).\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet has symbols (single and double pipes) for \"minor\" and \"major\" prosodic breaks. Since there are more than two levels of prosodic units, the use of these symbols depends on the structure of the language and which information the transcriber is attempting to capture. Very often, each prosodic unit will be placed in a separate line of the transcription. Using the single and double pipes to mark continuing and final prosodic boundaries, we might have American English,\n\nor French,\n\nNote that the last syllable with a full vowel in a French prosodic unit is stressed, and that the last stressed syllable in an English prosodic unit has primary stress. This shows that stress is not phonemic in French, and that the difference between primary and secondary stress is not phonemic in English; they are both elements of prosody rather than inherent in the words.\n\nThe pipe symbolsthe vertical bars and used above are phonetic, and so will often disagree with English punctuation, which only partially correlates with prosody.\n\nHowever, the pipes may also be used for metrical breaksa single pipe being used to mark metrical feet, and a double pipe to mark both continuing and final prosody, as their alternate IPA descriptions \"foot group\" and \"intonation group\" suggest. In such usage, each foot group would include one and only one heavy syllable. In English, this would mean one and only one stressed syllable:\n\nIn many tone languages with downdrift, such as Hausa, the single pipe may be used to represent a minor prosodic break that does not interrupt the overall decline in pitch of the utterance, while marks either continuing or final prosody that creates a pitch reset. In such cases, some linguists use only the single pipe, with continuing and final prosody marked by a comma and period, respectively.\n\nIn transcriptions of non-tonal languages, the three symbols pipe, comma, and period may also be used, with the pipe representing a break more minor than the comma, the so-called \"list prosody\" often used to separate items when reading lists, spelling words, or giving out telephone numbers.\n\nWhile each prosodic unit may carry a large information load in rehearsed speech, in extemporaneous conversation the amount of information is much more limited. There is seldom more than a single lexical noun in any one IU, and it is uncommon to have both a lexical noun and a lexical verb in the same IU. Indeed, many IUs are semantically empty, taken up by filler words such as \"um, well,\" or \"y'know.\" Chafe (1994) believes that this reflects the constraints of information processing by the brain during speech production, with chunks of speech (IUs) corresponding to chunks of cognitive output. It is also a possibility that the distribution of information across IUs is designed to maximize language comprehension by the other party.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12592050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12592050", "title": "Smart city", "text": "Smart city\n\nA smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the network (the Internet of things or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving.\n\nICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government.\nSmart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a simple \"transactional\" relationship with its citizens. Yet, the term itself remains unclear to its specifics and therefore, open to many interpretations.\n\nOther terms that have been used for similar concepts include \"cyberville\", \"digital city\", \"electronic communities\", \"flexicity\", \"information city\", \"intelligent city\", \"knowledge-based city\", \"MESH city\", \"telecity\", \"teletopia\", \"Ubiquitous city\", \"wired city.\"\n\nMajor technological, economic and environmental changes have generated interest in smart cities, including climate change, economic restructuring, the move to online retail and entertainment, ageing populations, urban population growth and pressures on public finances. The European Union (EU) has devoted constant efforts to devising a strategy for achieving 'smart' urban growth for its metropolitan city-regions. The EU has developed a range of programmes under 'Europe's Digital Agenda\". In 2010, it highlighted its focus on strengthening innovation and investment in ICT services for the purpose of improving public services and quality of life. Arup estimates that the global market for smart urban services will be $400 billion per annum by 2020. Examples of Smart City technologies and programs have been implemented in Singapore, Dubai, Milton Keynes, Southampton, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, China and New York.\n\nDue to the breadth of technologies that have been implemented under the smart city label, it is difficult to distill a precise definition of a smart city. Deakin and Al Wear list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city:\n\n\nDeakin defines the smart city as one that utilises ICT to meet the demands of the market (the citizens of the city), and that community involvement in the process is necessary for a smart city. A smart city would thus be a city that not only possesses ICT technology in particular areas, but has also implemented this technology in a manner that positively impacts the local community.\n\nAlternative definitions include:\n\nIt has been suggested that a smart city (also community, business cluster, urban agglomeration or region) uses information technologies to:\n\nThey evolve towards a strong integration of all dimensions of human intelligence, collective intelligence, and also artificial intelligence within the city. The intelligence of cities \"resides in the increasingly effective combination of digital telecommunication networks (the nerves), ubiquitously embedded intelligence (the brains), sensors and tags (the sensory organs), and software (the knowledge and cognitive competence)\".\n\nThese forms of intelligence in smart cities have been demonstrated in three ways:\n\n\nSome major fields of intelligent city activation are:\n\nAccording to David K. Owens, the former executive vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, two key elements that a smart city must have are an integrated communications platform and a \"dynamic resilient grid.\" Both are large investments.\n\nIn order to achieve an accurate description and explanation of the concept of Smart City it is needed to first analyse the topic through a specific framework. The framework is divided into 4 main dimensions:\n\nSeveral concepts of the Smart city rely heavily on the use of technology; a technological Smart City is not just one concept but there are different combinations of technological infrastructure that build a concept of smart city.\n\nHuman infrastructure (i.e., creative occupations and workforce, knowledge networks, voluntary organisations) is a crucial axis for city development.\n\nAccording to Moser, M. A., since 1990s the Smart Communities movement took shape as a strategy to broaden the base of users involved in IT. Members of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a partnership with government and other institutional organizations to push the use of IT to improve the quality of daily life as a consequence of different worsening in daily actions. Eger, J. M. said that a smart community makes a conscious and agreed-upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to solving its social and business needs. It is very important to understand that this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without the institutional help; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the success of smart community initiatives. Again Moser, M. A. explained that “building and planning a smart community seeks for smart growth”; a smart growth is essential what the partnership between citizen and institutional organizations try to do that is a reaction to worsening trends in daily things, like for instance traffic congestion, school overcrowding and air pollution. However it is important noticed that technological propagation is not an end in itself, but only a means to reinventing cities for a new economy and society. To sum up, it could possible to assert that any Smart City initiatives necessitate the governance support for their success.\n\nThe importance of these three different dimensions consist that only a link, correlation among them make possible a development of a real concept of Smart City. According to the definition of Smart City given by Caragliu, A., Del Bo, C., & Nijkamp, P., a city is smart when investments in human/social capital and IT infrastructure fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality of life, through participatory governance.\n\nSmart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve sustainability, create economic development, and enhance quality of life factors for people living and working in the city. It also means that the city has a smarter energy infrastructure. A more formal definition is this: “… An urban area that has securely integrated technology across the information . . . and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors to better manage a city’s assets.”\n\nA smart city is powered by “smart connections” for various items such as street lighting, smart buildings, distributed energy resources (DER), data analytics, and smart transportation. Amongst these things, energy is paramount; this is why utility companies play a key role in smart cities. Electric companies, working partnership with city officials, technology companies and a number of other institutions, are among the major players that helped accelerate the growth of America’s smart cities.\n\nSmart city employs a combination of data collection, processing, and disseminating technologies in conjunction with networking and computing technologies and data security and privacy measures encouraging application innovation to promote the overall quality of life for its citizens and covering dimensions that include: utilities, health, transportation, entertainment and government services.\n\nNew Internet technologies promoting cloud-based services, the Internet of Things (IoT), real-world user interfaces, use of smart phones and smart meters, networks of sensors and RFIDs, and more accurate communication based on the semantic web, open new ways to collective action and collaborative problem solving.\n\nOnline collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an on-line database for storage and allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data.\n\nIn London, a traffic management system known as SCOOT optimises green light time at traffic intersections by feeding back magnetometer and inductive loop data to a supercomputer, which can co-ordinate traffic lights across the city to improve traffic throughout.\n\nThe city of Santander in Cantabria, northern Spain, has 20,000 sensors connecting buildings, infrastructure, transport, networks and utilities, offers a physical space for experimentation and validation of the IoT functions, such as interaction and management protocols, device technologies, and support services such as discovery, identity management and security In Santander, the sensors monitor the levels of pollution, noise, traffic and parking.\n\nElectronic cards (known as smart cards) are another common platform in smart city contexts. These cards possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows the owner to log into a range of government provided services (or e-services) without setting up multiple accounts. The single identifier allows governments to aggregate data about citizens and their preferences to improve the provision of services and to determine common interests of groups. This technology has been implemented in Southampton.\n\nA smart city roadmap consists of four/three (the first is a preliminary check) major components:\nIn short, People, Processes, and Technology (PPT) are the three principles of the success of a smart city initiative. Cities must study their citizens and communities, know the processes, business drivers, create policies, and objectives to meet the citizens' needs. Then, technology can be implemented to meet the citizens' need, in order to improve the quality of life and create real economic opportunities.This requires a holistic customized approach that accounts for city cultures, long-term city planning, and local regulations.“Whether to improve security, resiliency, sustainability, traffic congestion, public safety, or city services, each community may have different reasons for wanting to be smart. But all smart communities share common attributes—and they all are powered by smart connections and by our industry’s smarter energy infrastructure. A smart grid is the foundational piece in building a smart community.” — Pat Vincent-Collawn, chairman of the Edison Electric Institute and president and CEO of PNM Resources\n\nUniversity research labs developed prototypes for intelligent cities. IGLUS is an action research project led by EPFL focused on developing governance systems for urban infrastructures. IGLUS announced a MOOC through Coursera. \"MIT Smart Cities Lab\" focuses upon intelligent, sustainable buildings, mobility systems (GreenWheel Electric Bicycle, Mobility-on-Demand, CityCar, Wheel Robots); the \"IntelCities\" research consortium for electronic government, planning systems and citizen participation; URENIO developed intelligent city platforms for the innovation economy focusing on strategic intelligence, technology transfer, collaborative innovation, and incubation, while it promotes intelligent cities research and planning; the \"Smart Cities Academic Network\" is working on e-governance and e-services in the North Sea region. The MK:Smart project is focusing on issues of sustainable energy use, water use and transport infrastructure alongside exploring how to promote citizen engagement alongside educating citizens about smart cities.\n\nLarge IT, telecommunication and energy management companies such as Cisco, Schneider Electric, IBM and Microsoft market initiatives for intelligent cities. Cisco, launched the \"Global Intelligent Urbanization\" initiative to help cities using the network as the fourth utility for integrated city management, better quality of life for citizens, and economic development. IBM announced its \"SmarterCities\" to stimulate economic growth and quality of life in cities and metropolitan areas with the activation of new approaches of thinking and acting in the urban ecosystem. Sensor developers and startup companies are continually developing new smart city applications.\n\nSmart city technological companies exist in Israel, with Tel Aviv getting an award in 2014.\n\nMajor strategies and achievements related to the spatial intelligence of cities are listed in the Intelligent Community Forum awards from 1999 to 2010, in the cities of Songdo and Suwon (South Korea), Stockholm (Sweden), Gangnam District of Seoul (South Korea), Waterloo, Ontario (Canada), Taipei (Taiwan), Mitaka (Japan), Glasgow (Scotland, UK), Calgary (Alberta, Canada), Seoul (South Korea), New York City (US), LaGrange, Georgia (US), and Singapore, which were recognized for their efforts in developing broadband networks and e-services sustaining innovation ecosystems, growth, and inclusion.\nThere are a number of cities actively pursuing a smart city strategy:\n\nThe Amsterdam Smart City initiative which began in 2009 currently includes 170+ projects collaboratively developed by local residents, government and businesses. These projects run on an interconnected platform through wireless devices to enhance the city's real time decision making abilities. The City of Amsterdam (City) claims the purpose of the projects is to reduce traffic, save energy and improve public safety. To promote efforts from local residents, the City runs the Amsterdam Smart City Challenge annually, accepting proposals for applications and developments that fit within the City's framework. An example of a resident developed app is Mobypark, which allows owners of parking spaces to rent them out to people for a fee. The data generated from this app can then be used by the City to determine parking demand and traffic flows in Amsterdam. A number of homes have also been provided with smart energy meters, with incentives provided to those that actively reduce energy consumption. Other initiatives include flexible street lighting (smart lighting) which allows municipalities to control the brightness of street lights, and smart traffic management where traffic is monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to take.\n\nBarcelona has established a number of projects that can be considered 'smart city' applications within its \"CityOS\" strategy. For example, sensor technology has been implemented in the irrigation system in Parc del Centre de Poblenou, where real time data is transmitted to gardening crews about the level of water required for the plants. Barcelona has also designed a new bus network based on data analysis of the most common traffic flows in Barcelona, utilising primarily vertical, horizontal and diagonal routes with a number of interchanges. Integration of multiple smart city technologies can be seen through the implementation of smart traffic lights as buses run on routes designed to optimise the number of green lights. In addition, where an emergency is reported in Barcelona, the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay. Much of this data is managed by the Sentilo Platform.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the City of Columbus, Ohio began its pursuit of a smart city initiative. It partnered with American Electric Power Ohio to create a group of new electric vehicle charging stations. Many smart cities such as Columbus are using agreements such as this one to prepare for climate change, expand electric infrastructure, convert existing public vehicle fleets to electric cars, and create incentives for people to share rides when commuting. For doing this, the U.S. Department of Transportation gave the City of Columbus a $40 million grant. The city also received $10 million from Vulcan Inc.\n\nOne key reason why the utility was involved in the picking of locations for new electric vehicle charging stations was to gather data. According to \"Daily Energy Insider\", the group Infrastructure and Business Continuity for AEP said, \"You don’t want to put infrastructure where it won’t be used or maintained. The data we collect will help us build a much bigger market in the future.\"\n\nBecause autonomous vehicles are currently seeing \"an increased industrial research and legislative push globally\", building routes and connections for them is another important part of the Columbus Smart City initiative.\n\nShaikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum vice president of UAE and a Ruler of Dubai has initiate the Smart Dubai project that contains more than 100 initiatives in 2013, this project will lead Dubai to be the world smartest city by 2030. As his highness says this project is going to facilitate and enhance the quality of life of Dubai's citizens by integrating the private and public sectors and enabling citizens to have an access to these sectors through their smartphones. One of the initiatives that has been launched is Dubai Autonomous Transportation Strategy within this strategy Dubai will only have driverless transits. In addition, to save the environment by 2021 Dubai will be paper-free; all information and transactions of governments, businesses, and customers will be fully digitized. As a part of the Smart Dubai project, citizens will have unlimited access to government applications by providing 5000 hotspots in different locations of the city by 2021. Dubai has launched two mobile applications; mPay and DubaiNow that facilitate the payments of services of the citizens. mPay enables citizens to pay for utilities, electricity and water, traffic fines, and Etisalat bills while DubaiNow enables citizens to pay for educational, health, transport, and business services. In addition, Dubai has established Smart Nol Card; a unified rechargeable card that enables citizens to pay for all the transportation services such as metro, buses, water bus, and taxis. Dubai Municipality has launched an initiative called Digital City in which each building in Dubai city is assigned to unique QR code that contains information about the building, plot, and location. Citizens are able to scan these codes to access and get benefit of the municipality e-services.\nDublin finds itself as an unexpected capital for smart cities. The smart city programme for the city is run by Smart Dublin an initiative of the four Dublin Local Authorities to engage with smart technology providers, researchers and citizens to solve city challenges and improve city life. It includes Dublinked- Dublin’s open data platform that hosts open source data to smart city applications.\n\nMadrid, Spain's pioneering smart city, has adopted the MiNT Madrid Inteligente/Smarter Madrid platform to integrate the management of local services. These include the sustainable and computerized management of infrastructure, garbage collection and recycling, and public spaces and green areas, among others. The programme is run in partnership with IBMs INSA, making use of the latter's Big Data and analytics capabilities and experience. Madrid is considered to have taken a bottom-up approach to smart cities, whereby social issues are first identified and individual technologies or networks are then identified to address these issues. This approach includes support and recognition for start ups through the Madrid Digital Start Up programme.\n\nA document written in 2011 refers to 18th century Żejtun as the earliest \"smart city\" in Malta, but not in the modern context of a smart city. By the 21st century, SmartCity Malta, a planned technology park, is partially operational while the rest is on construction, as a Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nIn December 2015, Manchester's CityVerve project was chosen as the winner of a government-led technology competition and awarded £10m to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) smart cities demonstrator.\n\nEstablished in July 2016, the project is being carried out by a consortium of 22 public and private organisations, including Manchester City Council, and is aligned with the city's on-going devolution commitment.\n\nThe project has a two-year remit to demonstrate the capability of IoT applications and address barriers to deploying smart cities, such as city governance, network security, user trust and adoption, interoperability, scalability and justifying investment.\n\nCityVerve is based on an open data principle that incorporates a 'platform of platforms' which ties together applications for its four key themes: transport and travel; health and social care; energy and the environment; culture and the public realm. This will also ensure that the project is scalable and able to be redeployed to other locations worldwide.\n\nMilton Keynes has a commitment to making itself a Smart City. Currently the mechanism through which this is approached is the MK:Smart initiative, a collaboration of local government, businesses, academia and 3rd sector organisations. The focus of the initiative is on making energy use, water use and transport more sustainable whilst promoting economic growth in the city. Central to the project is the creation of a state-of-the-art 'MK Data Hub' which will support the acquisition and management of vast amounts of data relevant to city systems from a variety of data sources. These will include data about energy and water consumption, transport data, data acquired through satellite technology, social and economic datasets, and crowdsourced data from social media or specialised apps.\n\nThe MK:Smart initiative has two aspects which extend our understanding of how Smart Cities should operate. The first, Our MK, is a scheme for promoting citizen-led sustainability issues in the city. The scheme provides funding and support to engage with citizens and help turn their ideas around sustainability into a reality. The second aspect is in providing citizens with the skills to operate effectively in a Smart City. The Urban Data school is an online platform to teach school students about data skills while the project has also produced a MOOC to inform citizens about what a Smart City is.\n\nNew York City is developing a number of smart city initiatives. A notable example is the series of city service kiosks in the LinkNYC network. These provide services including free WiFi, phone calls, device charging stations, local wayfinding, and more, funded by advertising that plays on the kiosk’s screens\n\nThe city of San Leandro, California is in the midst of transforming from an industrial center to a tech hub of the Internet of Things (IoT) (technology that lets devices communicate with each other over the Internet). California's utility company PG&E is working with the city in this endeavor and on a smart energy pilot program that would develop a distributed energy network across the city that would be monitored by IoT sensors. The goal would be to give the city an energy system that has enough capacity to receive and redistribute electricity to and from multiple energy sources.\n\nAn alternative use of smart city technology can be found in Santa Cruz, California, where local authorities analyse historical crime data in order to predict police requirements and maximise police presence where it is required. The analytical tools generate a list of 10 places each day where property crimes are more likely to occur, and then placing police efforts on these regions when officers are not responding to any emergency. This use of ICT technology is different to the manner in which European cities utilise smart city technology, possibly highlighting the breadth of the smart city concept in different parts of the world.\n\nIt's a retrofitting and urban renewal program being spearheaded by the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. The Government of India has the ambitious vision of developing 100 cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities.\n\nDespite its size and lack of natural resources, Singapore has overcome many of its challenges in 50 short years to become one of the world's most advanced and liveable countries. It has embarked on its next phase of transformation towards a Smart Nation, and endeavours to harness the power of networks, data and info-comm technologies to improve living, create economic opportunities and build closer communities.\n\nStockholm's smart city technology is underpinned by the Stokab dark fibre system which was developed in 1994 to provide a universal fibre optic network across Stockholm. Private companies are able to lease fibre as service providers on equal terms. The company is owned by the City of Stockholm itself. Within this framework, Stockholm has created a Green IT strategy. The Green IT program seeks to reduce the environmental impact of Stockholm through IT functions such as energy efficient buildings (minimising heating costs), traffic monitoring (minimising the time spent on the road) and development of e-services (minimising paper usage). The e-Stockholm platform is centred on the provision of e-services, including political announcements, parking space booking and snow clearance. This is further being developed through GPS analytics, allowing residents to plan their route through the city. An example of district-specific smart city technology can be found in the Kista Science City region. This region is based on the triple helix concept of smart cities, where university, industry and government work together to develop ICT applications for implementation in a smart city strategy.\n\nThe criticisms of smart cities revolve around:\n\n\n\nIntelligent Communities\n"}

It is currently the third largest Wikipedia by article-count with its current articles, where a majority are generated by a bot, or software application, and has a of 5.6.\nThe administrators on the Swedish Wikipedia (currently ) are elected for a fixed-term period of one year and have to be re-elected after that time.\n\nOriginally, Swedish Wikipedia rivalled susning.nu, a wiki created by Lars Aronsson in 2001. Susning.nu was by 28 May 2003 the world's second largest wiki. Due to several controversies involving the authority of the founder, objections to Aronsson's decision to allow advertisement on the site, several prolific Susning writers switched over to Swedish Wikipedia in 2002, and later more followed. Two of its pioneers were Johan Dahlin and Dan Köhl, the latter one introduced \"Tinget\" in November 2002. This was the first conflict handling organ at Swedish Wikipedia. In April 2004, Susning.nu's editing features were closed down to all but a handful of users, which further increased the flow to Swedish Wikipedia. On 14 January 2005, Wikipedia's article count surpassed that of Susning.nu.\n\nIn March 2006, the Swedish newspaper \"Svenska Dagbladet\" published a comparative evaluation of Swedish Wikipedia, Susning.nu and the online version of Nationalencyklopedin. The evaluation was done by giving a selection of articles to independent subject matter experts for grading. While Nationalencyklopedin came out on top with respect to factuality and neutrality, Swedish Wikipedia received a good overall grade and came out on top with respect to being up to date and having a broad coverage, also including popular culture subjects.\n\nOn 27 September 2012 it reached 500,000 articles. On 15 June 2013 it reached 1,000,000 articles and rose from 8th to 5th place. This meant that during 2012 and 2013 the number of articles on Swedish Wikipedia more than doubled. This is in large part due to a community project where bots were used in producing articles for all existing species of plants and animals. When finished, this project alone created more than a million articles, most short and sourced through available online databases on the subject. In 2014 about half of its articles were created by a single bot.\n\n\n"}

The interior design is created in graphic editors. Virtual staging is especially popular among real estate brokers, photographers, and interior designers. The main goal of this kind of visualization is creating highly realistic images of properties (usually for sale). The major advantages of virtual staging over traditional home staging are time and cost.\n\nVirtual staging is sometimes done to market a vacant home, as it can offer many of the benefits of traditional staging at a significantly lower cost.\n\nAbout five to ten percent of online real estate listings use virtual staging.\n\nAlgorithms of data analysis that scan millions of images on the Internet and evaluate them regarding to views and likes on social networks help to create interior and decor models for the virtual staging process.\n\nVirtual staging is more than 90% cheaper than physical staging.\n"}

The Xavante language is unusual in its phonology, its ergative object–agent–verb word order, and its use of honorary and endearment terms in its morphology.\n\nThe Xavante people are approximately 18,380 individuals in 170 villages as of 2014, but the language is spoken by 9600 people, of whom about 7000 are monolingual in Xavante alone. The current speakers, made up of all ages, use the language vigorously, and hold positive attitudes towards Xavante.\n\nXavante is a language in the Jê family, spoken in Mato Grosso, in the west part of Brazil. It has been orthographically rendered as Chavante and Shavante, and is also called Akuen, Akwen, A’uwe Uptabi, A’we, Crisca, Pusciti, and Tapuac.\n\nThe Xavante people originate from the east of the Araguaia River, in what was then called the province of Goias. In the early 18th century, this area was heavily invaded by colonizers searching for gold, leading to the indigenous population in the area to suffer from epidemics and live in the residential settlements created by the government. Following this, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, groups of indigenous people, now distinctly self-identifying as Xavante, settled in Mato Grosso; this area was relatively undisturbed until the 1930s.\n\nAt this point, the government under Getulio Vargas initiated the ‘March to the West’ campaign within the National Integration Program, in which expansion to the interior of Brazil and ‘domestication of the Savage’ were heavily promoted. The Xavante people were used in print media as illustrations of newly ‘pacified’ people who had decided to ‘join Brazilian society’. In the meantime, groups including missionaries had invaded the Mato Grosso to try to convert the Xavanate into Catholicism; the indigenous people, angry at the unsolicited invasion, attacked the group in return. However, following this period until the 1960s peaceful contacts, in which goods were exchanged, were established.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, the Xavante land was coveted for farming and agriculture purposes; deals to arrange transfers to white settlers were often fraudulent, and land used for monocultures, such as entire fields of rice, or grazing. The people were transferred from Mato Grosso to southern Brazil, a less fertile region; however, the Xavante people then began the attempt to recover the land they had lived on prior to contact with settlers in the 1970s, with demands for territory being met with violence by large capitalist companies that now had hold of the areas. In 1981, six areas were demarcated to the Xavante, and in 1991, the rights to extensions of some areas were won. However, conflicts regarding the territories between the Xavante and Brazilian government continue today. Currently, there has been a Program of Documentation of Indigenous Cultures (PRODOCULT) devoted to Xavante, run by J.R. Welch and R. Costa; the permanent collection, containing images, text, cartography and more information on the Xavante people and language, is housed in the Museum of the Indian.\n\nXavante is a member of the Jê language family, itself a member of the Macro-Gê stock. This stock is spoken in a wide distribution of non-central Brazil; Macro-Gê is also popular in the eastern, northern, and central, and southwestern parts of the country, as well as being distributed in nearby Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, but the Jê family is its only remaining large subgroup, with other languages remaining in isolates due to extinction. Within Jê, its 16 languages are distributed in four divisions; northern, north-eastern, central, and southern, and are better preserved than other languages in the stock due to its inland-inhabiting speakers. Xavante is classified in the central, alongside Xerente, Xaxriaba, and Akroa. The stock is marked by a large presence of nasal vowels, this also being marked in the proto- Jê reconstructed language. Consonant inventories of the Macro-Ge stock are of medium size, with Xavante historically undergoing a phonological change from velar consonants to glottal stops. All are mildly synthetic, without complex morphology, and have SV constituent orders.\n\nThe Xavante people have been studied in ethnographies; in 2010 and 2011, demographic information and ethnographic details were researched for the context of health among the Xavante by Basta, and tuberculosis specifically being examined alongside ethnographic information by DeSouza. Contemporary Xavante research by Lecena and colleagues in 2016 and Da Silva in 1999 has also investigated inactivity and socioeconomic status in the region and general information regarding the ways that Xavante people were living in the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nThe Xavante language was first referenced in the 19th century, in works of comparative philology which used word lists from the language and overviews of its structure. In the 20th century, Xavante has been studied academically since the 1960s by both Brazilian and foreign linguists, starting with a grammar; papers from this period examined the language’s phonemes, syllable structure, as well as aspect and acquisition. By the 1980s, works on the syntax and semantics of Xavante were published, focusing on sentence initial devices and focus; the first Xavante-Portuguese dictionary was also produced by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, all of whom had researched extensively in Xavante (1987). Since the 1990s, more specific properties of the language have been researched academically, namely with respect to acquisition, name agreement, assimilation, morphology, and respect/intimacy relationships. A revised Xavante-Portuguese dictionary, again compiled by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, was released in 2004.\n\nThe phonology of Xavante is described by McLeod (1974).\n\nXavante has nine vowel qualities, long and short. Four occur nasalized, long and short. \n\nXavante has ten consonants, . They are realized as,\n\nXavante is highly unusual in lacking velar consonants, except for the labio-velar approximant . At a phonemic level, it arguably also lacks nasal consonants, which is less unusual in the Amazon. The language however has a high degree of allophony, and nasal stops appear before nasal vowels.\n\nWith so few phonemic contrasts, Xavante allows wide latitude in allophones of its consonants. \n\n\n\n\n\nVowels do not become nasalized because of nasalized consonants, so the only consonants that become nasal are those in a cluster preceding a nasal vowel (and coda after a nasal vowel); a preceding oral vowel blocks the nasality from spreading to preceding syllables.\n\nXavante syllables are of the forms CV, CCV, CVC, CCVC, CV:, and CCV:; that is, all syllables begin with a consonant, sometimes two; they may optionally either end with a consonant or have a long vowel. Although a \"syllable\" may end in a consonant, a phonological \"word\" may not, apart from a few cases of word-final .\n\nThe attested initial CC consonant clusters are: \nAll seven obstruents occur in final position, but in a maximal CCVC syllable only are attested. Across two syllables, the following CC sequences are attested: \nThere are also CCC sequences such as (coda followed by onset ).\n\nThe vowels and are rare, and not attested in maximal CCVC syllables.\n\nIn Xavante, morphological variations of words are a significant aspect of generating new constructions within the language. For example, morphology reflects honorific status, in that morphemes are used to denote relationships of intimacy and kinship. Similarly, social positions and situations of individuals are marked using morphological constructions; for instance, a’ama, a group of Xavante men trained in new forms of pre-existing words, are referred to by other members of the clan using a specific set of morphological forms. Xavante also uses a reflexive prefix, tsi-, in situations requiring this grammatical construction to be denoted; for instance, ʔmadə (to look at) becomes tsi-ʔmadə (to look at oneself). Finally, the postverbal morpheme ni appears when referring to a generic or unknown subject, as in ‘ma ø-wæræ ni’ (or ‘someone (unknown) killed him. Morphological changes are important in generating meaning in Xavante, and reflect the possibilities of showing meaning using set morphemes.\n\nAs previously discussed, Xavante expresses relationships between people in its morphology. This is particularly reflected in familial connections; a child must use the respectful grammatical forms when growing older in reference to their parents and grandparents, and are scolded if they do not do so (Harrison, 2001). For example, the morpheme a is added to refer to a second person singular; a boy asking his grandfather to give a favour to his grandmother is generated thus:\n\nConversation between men and their father-in-laws is also marked by use of honorific grammatical variants, used by both parties. Finally, a couple that has been arranged to be married also enter a specific relationship, known as dasiwasini, and must use grammatical forms denoting respect. In all, morphological variation in Xavante is critical to displaying intimacy and closeness between people, and in marking where such a relationship exists through the way they refer to one another, with more personal relationships being denoted by special grammatical forms. Also previously discussed was the use of the post-verbal morpheme ni whe referring to unknown subjects. This is formally known as a ‘non-referential subject’, in that the subject does not refer to immediate entity in the world; for instance in saying ‘people’ as a collective instead of ‘my uncle’. This morpheme is added in both transitive and intransitive clauses, for instance when saying both ‘people love me’ and ‘people run’. Ni is also commonly used with another morpheme, da, as a person prefix referring to a generic entity; for example, to use both transitive and intransitive sentences as examples:\n\nIn these ways, Xavante uses morphological variation to express concepts relating to abstract individuals that exist in a different way than concrete, specific people. By extension, the language uses morphology in general to conceptualize a variety of concepts, including closeness in relationships as well as personal prefixes.\n\nThe syntax of Xavante utilizes several types of case markings in its structures, marking the intransitive subject (S), transitive subject or agent (A), and transitive object or patient (O) in different ways. First, it distinguishes between a number marking system and a person marking system, with both containing several subsystems. The former uses a neutral subsystem when arguments fulfill certain criteria. It also includes a Nominative-Accusative subsystem when the (O) of a transitive argument falls under a specified category. Finally, the person marking system of Xavante is notable for having multiple subsystems. As a consequence, examining these case systems is vital to understanding the syntax of Xavante.\n\nXavante’s case systems emphasise the lexicalization of number systems. Particles in the language depend on whether it is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person; whether the referent is in the subject, object, possessor, or complement position; and if the predicate is a noun (nominal) or a verb (verbal). Xavante also uses a singular, dual, and plural, and the number of the referent also dictate which number particle will be used. Within this number marking system, verbal clauses use a neutral marking subsystem, in which the marking of (A), (S), and (O) is identical whenever these arguments are singular or when (O) is definite and all three arguments are non-singular. A neutral system is marked for having the three arguments marked identically, and is common across languages. In Xavante, this situation is referred to as neutral because, in the first case, none of the three core arguments get marked, and in the second all get the same marking. An example is seen here:\n\nThe number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:\n\nThe number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:\n\nXavante also uses a person-marking system, in which subjects and objects are marked differently depending on a number of criteria. The absolutive series marks both intransitive subjects and transitive objects; the accusative series marks 1st person dual, plural object, 3rd person singular, or dual or plural object when the subject is 2nd person singular, dual, or plural; the nominative series marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive clauses; and am emphatic series that marks pronouns to form emphatic pronominal expressions with both transitive and intransitive clauses. The person-marking system has more subsystems that the number one, with three variations of ergative-absolutive case markings. Ergative-Absolutive is marked as (S) and (O) being equal, with (A) being different, and the first two being assigned as ergative and the third assigned as absolutive. In Xavante, Ergative-Absolutive I uses cross-referencing on (S) and (O) only, with (A) receiving no marking. Ergative-Absolutive II is marked when (O) is in 3rd person indefinite and (A) is 2nd person plural. Ergative-Absolutive III is marked with the use of a particle or adposition after the noun, with (A) receiving a mark and (S) and (O) not receiving one, and is only used relative and subordinate transitive clauses or negated independent transitive clauses:\n\nXavante’s person marking system also contains a tripartite subsystem, in which (A), (S), and (O) are all treated differently. In Xavante, this specifically occurs as all arguments receiving different arguments from the different series previously discussed. This is seen here:\n\nXavante’s person-marking system also has a variation of a Nominative-Accusative system, in which (S) and (A) are marked differently from (O)\n\nFinally, Xavante has two Split subsystems; the first, Split-S, is found in the subjects of nominal predicates. The second, Split-O, occurs in relative clauses. Overall, the person marking system in Xavante contains multiple subsystems depending on the situations in which they appear.\n\nIn all, Xavante uses a number of case marking systems in its clauses, varying based on number and person markings. It provides examples of a neutral system, Nominative-Accusative subsystems, Ergative-Absolutive subsystems, and split subsystems, varying based on different triggers.\n\nIn the Xavante language, plurals as well as duals are used to mark arguments in a clause. The language differentiates between singular nouns and dual, of which there is a quantity of two, and plural, in which the argument contains more than two items. These are expressed using morphological methods, including units that are used in a variety of contexts, including in different combinations. These markings appear to be used particularly for human subjects, and overall are vital to the structure of a clause in Xavante.\n\nDual arguments in Xavante, particularly those referring to people, use one of several possible morphological units. In order to describe a pair of human arguments, it is first important to distinguish between the first, second, and third person. For using the dual in the first person as a subject, such as in ‘We both’, the morpheme ʔwa is used in the beginning of the clause, with dĩ at the end of the clause; in combination they produce the first person dual. This is seen here:\n\nWhen using the dual first person as an object, however, a different morpheme, ʔĩwa, is attached to the main verb, for instance as here:\n\nWhen using the dual in the second person, for instance in saying ‘You both’, reduplication is used to denote optionality in the clause. In the first case, when ‘both’ is implied, ʔwa alone is used at the end of the clause, with the reduplicated ʔwaʔwa occurring earlier as follows:\n\nHowever, when the dual is not optional in the clause, only the reduplicated ʔwaʔwa occurs, at the end of the clause, as here:\n\nFinally, third person dual is also denoted similarly depending on whether the argument is in the subject or object position. For the former, the morpheme dzahurɛ is placed clause-finally, and denotes ‘They both’, as seen here:\n\nHowever, when the third person dual is in the object position, the same morpheme, dzahurɛ, is also used, as in the following example:\n\nIn all, the dual marks all arguments in Xavante, and differentiates between first, second, and third person in subject and object positions.\n\nPlurals in Xavante, in which more than two arguments are described, is expressed using its own variations of morphemes. In the first person and third person, dzaʔra is used clause-finally, as here:\n\nHowever, the second person plural is expressed differently, with the previous morpheme, dzaʔra, being combined with ʔwaʔwa in two positions, clause-medially after the initial person marker and clause-finally, as here:\n\nIn all, the plural in Xavante is expressed with less variation than in the dual, but nonetheless is always important to marking quantity of human subjects in the first, second, and third person.\n\n\n"}

Water activity (a) is measured as the humidity above a substance relative to the humidity above pure water (Aw = 1.0). Xerophiles are \"xerotolerant\", meaning tolerant of dry conditions. They often can survive in environments with water activity below 0.8. Typically xerotolerance is used with respect to matric drying, where a substance has a low water concentration. These environments include arid desert soils. The term osmotolerance is typically applied to organisms that can grow in solutions with high solute concentrations (salts, sugars), such as halophiles.\n\nThe common food preservation method of reducing water activities may not prevent the growth of xerophilic organisms, often resulting in food spoilage. Some mold and yeast species are xerophilic. Mold growth on bread is an example of food spoilage by xerophilic organisms.\n\nExamples of xerophiles include \"Trichosporonoides nigrescens\" and cacti.\n\n"}
