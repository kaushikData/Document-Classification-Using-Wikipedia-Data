{"id": "2079286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079286", "title": "Ancient Greek dialects", "text": "Ancient Greek dialects\n\nAncient Greek in classical antiquity, before the development of the κοινή (koiné) \"common\" language of Hellenism, was divided into several dialects. Most of them are known only from inscriptions, but a few of them, principally Aeolic, Doric, and Ionic, are also represented in the literary canon alongside the dominant Attic form of literary Greek. Likewise, Modern Greek is divided into several dialects, most of them having been derived from Koine Greek.\n\n\nAncient Greek literature is written in literary dialects that developed from particular regional or archaic dialects. Ancient Greek authors did not necessarily write in their native dialect, but rather chose a dialect that was suitable or traditional for the type of literature they were writing (see belles-lettres). All dialects have poetry written in them, but only Attic and Ionic have full works of prose attested.\n\nHomeric Greek is used in the first epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and the Homeric Hymns, traditionally attributed to Homer and written in dactylic hexameter. Homeric is a literary dialect with elements of Ionic, Aeolic and Arcadocypriot. Hesiod uses a similar dialect, and later writers imitate Homer in their epics, such as Apollonius Rhodius in Argonautica and Nonnus in Dionysiaca. Homer influenced other types of poetry as well.\n\nIonic proper is first used in Archilochus of Paros. This dialect includes also the earliest Greek prose, that of Heraclitus and Ionic philosophers, Hecataeus and logographers, Herodotus, Democritus, and Hippocrates. Elegiac poetry originated in Ionia and always continued to be written in Ionic.\n\nDoric is the conventional dialect of choral lyric poetry, which includes the Laconian Alcman, the Theban Pindar and the choral songs of Attic tragedy (stasima). Several lyric and epigrammatic poets wrote in this dialect, such as Ibycus of Rhegium and Leonidas of Tarentum. The following authors wrote in Doric, preserved in fragments: Epicharmus comic poet and writers of South Italian Comedy (phlyax play), Mithaecus food writer and Archimedes.\n\nAeolic is an exclusively poetic lyric dialect, represented by Sappho and Alcaeus for Lesbian (Aeolic) and Corinna of Tanagra for Boeotian.\n\nThessalic (Aeolic), Northwest Doric, Arcado-Cypriot and Pamphylian never became literary dialects and are only known from inscriptions, and to some extent by the comical parodies of Aristophanes and lexicographers.\n\nAttic proper was used by the Attic orators, Lysias, Isocrates, Aeschines and Demosthenes, the philosophers Plato and Aristotle and the historian Xenophon. Thucydides wrote in Old Attic. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides wrote in an artificial poetic language, and the comic playwright Aristophanes writes in a language with vernacular elements.\n\nThe ancients classified the language into three \"gene\" or four dialects, Ionic proper, Ionic (Attic), Aeolic, Doric and later a fifth one, Koine. Grammarians focus mainly on the literary dialects and isolated words. Historians may classify dialects on mythological/historical reasons rather than linguistic knowledge. According to Strabo, \"Ionic is the same as Attic and Aeolic the same as Doric - Outside the Isthmus, all Greeks were Aeolians except the Athenians, the Megarians and the Dorians who live about Parnassus - In the Peloponnese, Achaeans were also Aeolians but only Eleans and Arcadians continued to speak Aeolic\". However, for most ancients, Aeolic was synonymous with literary Lesbic. Stephanus of Byzantium characterized Boeotian as Aeolic and Aetolian as Doric. Remarkable is the ignorance of sources, except lexicographers, on Arcadian, Cypriot and Pamphylian.\n\nFinally, unlike Modern Greek and English, Ancient Greek common terms for human speech ( 'glôssa', 'dialektos', 'phônê' and the suffix '-isti' ) may be attributed interchangeably to both a dialect and a language. However, the plural 'dialektoi' is used when dialects and peculiar words are compared and listed by the grammarians under the terms 'lexeis' or 'glôssai'.\n\nThe dialects of Classical Antiquity are grouped slightly differently by various authorities. Pamphylian is a marginal dialect of Asia Minor and is sometimes left uncategorized. Mycenaean was deciphered only in 1952 and so is missing from the earlier schemes presented here:\n\nThe Ancient Greek dialects differed mainly in vowels.\n\nLoss of intervocalic \"s\" and consonantal \"i\" and \"w\" from Proto-Greek brought two vowels together in hiatus, a circumstance often called a \"collision of vowels\". Over time, Greek speakers would change pronunciation to avoid such a collision, and the way that vowels changed determined the dialect.\n\nFor example, the word for the \"god of the sea\" (regardless of the culture and language from which it came) was in some prehistoric form \"*poseidāwōn\" (genitive \"*poseidāwonos\"). Loss of the intervocalic *\"w\" left \"poseidāōn\", which is found in both Mycenaean and Homeric dialects. Ionic Greek changed the *\"a\" to an e (\"poseideōn\"), while Attic Greek contracted it to \"poseidōn\". It changed differently in other dialects:\n\nThe changes appear designed to place one vowel phoneme instead of two, a process called \"contraction\", if a third phoneme is created, and \"hyphaeresis\" (\"taking away\") if one phoneme is dropped and the other kept. Sometimes, the two phonemes are kept, sometimes modified, as in the Ionic \"poseideōn\".\n\nA vowel shift differentiating the Ionic and Attic dialects from the rest was the shift of \"ā\" () to \"ē\" (). In Ionic, the change occurred in all positions, but in Attic, it occurred almost everywhere except after \"e\", \"i\", and \"r\" (). Homeric Greek shows the Ionic rather than the Attic version of the vowel shift for the most part. Doric and Aeolic show the original forms with \"ā\" ().\n\nAnother principle of vocalic dialectization follows the Indo-European ablaut series or vowel grades. The Proto-Indo-European language could interchange \"e\" (e-grade) with \"o\" (o-grade) or use neither (zero-grade). Similarly, Greek inherited the series, for example, \"ei\", \"oi\", \"i\", which are e-, o- and zero-grades of the diphthong respectively. They could appear in different verb forms – present \"leipo\" () \"I leave\", perfect \"leloipa\" () \"I have left\", aorist \"elipon\" () \"I left\" – or be used as the basis of dialectization: Attic \"deiknūmi\" () \"I point out\" but Cretan \"diknumi\" ().\n\nThe ancient Greek dialects were a result of isolation and poor communication between communities living in broken terrain. All general Greek historians point out the influence of terrain on the development of the city-states. Often, the development of languages dialectization results in the dissimilation of daughter languages. That phase did not occur in Greek; instead the dialects were replaced by Standard Greek.\n\nIncreasing population and communication brought speakers more closely in touch and united them under the same authorities. Attic Greek became the literary language everywhere. Buck says:\n\nIn the first few centuries BC, regional dialects replaced local ones: Northwest Greek koine, Doric koine and Attic koine. The last came to replace the others in common speech in the first few centuries AD. After the division of the Roman Empire into the east and the west the earliest Modern Greek prevailed. The dialect distribution was then as follows:\n\nAccording to some scholars, Tsakonian is the only modern Greek dialect that descends from Doric, albeit with some influence from the Koine. Others include the Southern Italian dialects in this group, though perhaps they should rather be regarded as descended from the local Doric-influenced variant of the Koine.\n\n\n\n"}

Often this is in the form of a match for which all the ticket proceeds are given to the player in question. However hosting one of these matches is a risk for the player in question as he/she is responsible for paying any relevant receipts and collects any excess income from the match, therefore income from such matches is more often than not reliant on attendance.\n\nSometimes, the \"beneficiary\" can opt to give part or all of the money to charity. An example of this is Paul Collingwood's 2007 benefit with Durham County Cricket Club. This may also occur when sportsmen unite for a cause, for example the Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer \"Match for Africa\" (2010) where more than $2.6 million was raised for the Roger Federer Foundation, enabling children living in poverty to realise their potential.\n\nBenefit matches originated in English county cricket in a time period where playing sport, in particular cricket, for a living didn't offer as big of an income as it does in modern society (2015), holding a benefit at a player's 10 year service mark or retirement mark was considered a form of retirement/insurance policy. Benefit matches are confused with Testimonial matches, it's important to note that this is a direct gift from the club where income is guaranteed unlike in a benefit where income is often dependent on attendance. Similar events were organised in Baseball in the 1860s, these events often occurred at season end involving the stars of the sport to acknowledge a significant member of the sport. However a rule established by the NABBP in 1859 prohibited any player compensation, the basis of this rule was to maintain fair game in competition and avoid professional vs. amateur situations arising.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "64474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64474", "title": "Concatenation", "text": "Concatenation\n\nIn formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of \"snow\" and \"ball\" is \"snowball\". In some but not all formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.\n\nIn many programming languages, string concatenation is a binary infix operator. The codice_1 (plus) operator is often overloaded to denote concatenation for string arguments: codice_2 has the value codice_3. In other languages there is a separate operator, particularly to specify implicit type conversion to string, as opposed to more complicated behavior for generic plus. Examples include codice_4 in Edinburgh IMP, Perl, and PHP, codice_5 in Lua, and codice_6 in Ada, AppleScript, and Visual Basic. Other syntax exists, like codice_7 in PL/I and Oracle Database SQL.\n\nIn a few languages, notably C, C++, and Python, there is string literal concatenation, meaning that adjacent string literals are concatenated, without any operator: codice_8 has the value codice_3. In other languages, concatenation of string literals with an operator is evaluated at compile time, via constant folding, although this is often an implementation detail of the compiler, rather than a language feature.\n\nIn programming, string concatenation generally occurs at run time, as string values are not in general known until run time. However, in the case of string literals, the values are known at compile time, and thus string concatenation can be done at compile time, either via string literal concatenation or via constant folding.\n\nIn formal language theory and pattern matching (including regular expressions), the concatenation operation on strings is generalised to an operation on sets of strings as follows:\n\nFor two sets of strings \"S\" and \"S\", the \"concatenation\" \"S\"\"S\" consists of all strings of the form \"vw\" where \"v\" is a string from \"S\" and \"w\" is a string from \"S\", or formally . Many authors also use concatenation of a string set and a single string, and vice versa, which are defined similarly by and . In these definitions, the string \"vw\" is the ordinary concatenation of strings \"v\" and \"w\" as defined in the introductory section.\n\nFor example, if , and , then \"FR\" denotes the set of all chess board coordinates in algebraic notation, while e\"R\" denotes the set of all coordinates of the kings' file.\n\nIn this context, sets of strings are often referred to as formal languages. The concatenation operator is usually expressed as simple juxtaposition (as with multiplication).\n\nThe strings over an alphabet, with the concatenation operation, form an associative algebraic structure with identity element the null string—a free monoid.\n\nSets of strings with concatenation and alternation form a semiring, with concatenation (*) distributing over alternation (+); 0 is the empty set and 1 the set consisting of just the null string.\n\nIn programming for telephony, concatenation is used to provide dynamic audio feedback to a user. For example, in a \"time of day\" speaking clock, concatenation is used to give the correct time by playing the appropriate recordings \"concatenated\" together. For example:\n\n\nThe recordings themselves exist separately, but playing them one after the other provides a grammatically correct sentence to the listener.\n\nThis technique is also used in number change announcements, voice mail systems, or most telephony applications that provide dynamic feedback to the caller (e.g. moviefone, tellme, and others).\n\nProgramming for any kind of computerised public address system can also employ concatenation for dynamic public announcements (for example, flights in an airport). The system would archive recorded speech of numbers, routes or airlines, destinations, times, etc. and play them back in a specific sequence to produce a grammatically correct sentence that is announced throughout the facility.\n\nOne of the principles of relational database design is that the fields of data tables should reflect a single characteristic of the table's subject, which means that they should not contain concatenated strings. When concatenation is desired in a report, it should be provided at the time of running the report. For example, to display the physical address of a certain customer, the data might include building number, street name, building sub-unit number, city name, state/province name, postal code, and country name, e.g., \"123 Fake St Apt 4, Boulder, CO 80302, USA\", which combines seven fields. However, the customers data table should not use one field to store that concatenated string; rather, the concatenation of the seven fields should happen upon running the report. The reason for such principles is that without them, the entry and updating of large volumes of data becomes error-prone and labor-intensive. Separately entering the city, state, ZIP code, and nation allows data-entry validation (such as detecting an invalid state abbreviation). Then those separate items can be used for sorting or indexing the records, such as all with \"Boulder\" as the city name.\n\nIn recreational mathematics, many problems concern the properties of numbers under concatenation of their numerals in some base. Examples include home primes (primes obtained by repeatedly factoring the increasing concatenation of prime factors of a given number), Smarandache–Wellin numbers (the concatenations of the first prime numbers), and the Champernowne and Copeland–Erdős constants (the real numbers formed by the decimal representations of the positive integers and the prime numbers, respectively).\n\n\n"}

The ethnic Digo population has been estimated at around 360,000 (Mwalonya et al. 2004), the majority of whom are presumably speakers of the language. All adult speakers of Digo are bilingual in Swahili, East Africa's lingua franca. The two languages are closely related, and Digo also has much vocabulary borrowed from neighbouring Swahili dialects.\n\nThe classification and sub-classification of Digo provides a good example of the difficulty sometimes faced by linguists in differentiating languages and dialects. Most contemporary authorities follow Nurse and Hinnebusch (1993) in classifying Digo as a dialect of Mijikenda, one of the constituent languages of the Sabaki group of Northeast Coast Bantu. The Mijikenda dialects are indeed mutually intelligible, though they are conventionally treated as separate languages. Digo is a member of the southern Mijikenda sub-group, and is most closely related to its neighbours Duruma and Rabai. It is, however, felt by speakers to be sufficiently different from other Mijikenda dialects to deserve its own orthography and literature.\n\nDigo speakers recognise in turn a number of named varieties or dialects of their language. These are:\nTsw’aka was once thought to have been a local variety of the Vumba dialect of Swahili, but is now considered to be a variety of Digo in the process of shifting to Vumba. Some assimilated Segeju and Degere are also said to speak their own separate varieties of Digo, presumably as a consequence of language shift (Nurse & Walsh 1992).\n\nDigo speakers usually write their language using an alphabet based on the Latin alphabet used for Swahili, with additional combinations of letters representing some of the sounds that are distinctive to Digo (e.g. 'ph' for the voiced bilabial fricative or approximant). This has been developed further by the Digo Language and Literacy Project of Bible Translation and Literacy (East Africa). The project has produced basic literacy materials (listed in the \"Ethnologue\") and published a \"Digo-English-Swahili Dictionary\" using the new orthography (Mwalonya et al. 2004) as well as a linguistic description in \"A Grammar of Digo\" (Nicolle 2013). The Digo New Testament was finished in 2007. All of these materials are based on the Northern Digo dialect spoken in Kenya.\n\nOne hundred Digo proverbs have been collected and published by Margaret Wambere Ireri, with translations into Swahili, English, and French.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "90298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90298", "title": "Doodle", "text": "Doodle\n\nA doodle is a drawing made while a person's attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a \"scribble\".\n\nDoodling and scribbling are most often associated with young children and toddlers, because their lack of hand–eye coordination and lower mental development often make it very difficult for any young child to keep their coloring attempts within the line art of the subject. Despite this, it is not uncommon to see such behaviour with adults, in which case it is generally done jovially, out of boredom.\n\nTypical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks, often in the margins, drawn by students daydreaming or losing interest during class. Other common examples of doodling are produced during long telephone conversations if a pen and paper are available.\n\nPopular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school, famous TV or comic characters, invented fictional beings, landscapes, geometric shapes, patterns, textures, or phallic scenes.\n\nThe word \"doodle\" first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool or simpleton. It may derive from the German \"Dudeltopf\" or \"Dudeldop\", meaning simpleton or noodle (literally \"nightcap\"). It is the origin of the early eighteenth century verb \"to doodle\", meaning \"to swindle or to make a fool of\". The modern meaning emerged in the 1930s either from this meaning or from the verb \"to dawdle\", which since the seventeenth century has had the meaning of wasting time or being lazy.\n\nIn the 1936 film \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", in the final courtroom scene, the main character, addressing the judge, introduces the word 'doodler' – which the judge has not heard before – as \"a name we made up back home to describe a person who makes foolish designs on paper when they're thinking.\" This is clearly not a word in common usage at that time, and the inference is that it is an invented word that no one outside the character's fictional home town of Mandrake Falls would be expected to know. Perhaps the word 'doodle', used here in its modern sense of 'an absent-minded design on paper', was not entirely new and was not actually invented by the scriptwriter, Robert Riskin, but it seems likely that at the very least this film greatly assisted the word into common usage.\n\nThe meaning \"fool, simpleton\" is intended in the song title \"Yankee Doodle\", originally sung by British colonial troops prior to the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal \"Applied Cognitive Psychology\", doodling can aid a person's memory by expending just enough energy to keep one from daydreaming, which demands a lot of the brain's processing power, as well as from not paying attention. Thus, it acts as a mediator between the spectrum of thinking too much or thinking too little and helps focus on the current situation. The study was done by Professor Jackie Andrade, of the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth, who reported that doodlers in her experiment recalled 7.5 pieces of information (out of 16 total) on average, 29% more than the average of 5.8 recalled by the control group made of non-doodlers.\n\nAlexander Pushkin's notebooks are celebrated for their superabundance of marginal doodles, which include sketches of friends' profiles, hands, and feet. These notebooks are regarded as a work of art in their own right. Full editions of Pushkin's doodles have been undertaken on several occasions. Some of Pushkin's doodles were animated by Andrei Khrzhanovsky and Yuriy Norshteyn in the 1987 film \"My Favorite Time\".\n\nNobel laureate (in literature, 1913) poet Rabindranath Tagore made huge number of doodles in his manuscript. Poet and physician John Keats doodled in the margins of his medical notes; other literary doodlers have included Samuel Beckett and Sylvia Plath. Mathematician Stanislaw Ulam developed the Ulam spiral for visualization of prime numbers while doodling during a boring presentation at a mathematics conference. Many American Presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, have been known to doodle during meetings.\n\nSome doodles and drawings can be found in notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1516137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1516137", "title": "Faubourg", "text": "Faubourg\n\nFaubourg () is an ancient French term approximating \"suburb\" (now generally termed \"banlieue\"). The earliest form is \"Forsbourg\", derived from Latin \"foris\", 'out of', and Vulgar Latin (originally Germanic) \"burgum\", 'town' or 'fortress'. Traditionally, this name was given to an agglomeration forming around a throughway leading outwards from a city gate, and usually took the name of the same thoroughfare within the city. As cities were often located atop hills (for defensive purposes), their outlying communities were frequently lower down. Many faubourgs were located below their towns, and the term \"suburbs\" is derived from this tendency (\"sub\" = below; \"urbs urbis\" = city).\n\nFaubourgs are often considered the predecessor of European suburbs, into which they evolved generally in the 1950s and 1960s. Although early suburbs still conserved some characteristics related to faubourgs (such as the back alleys with doors, little break margins for houses, etc.), later suburbs underwent major changes in their construction, primarily in terms of residential density.\n\nBeside many French cities, the places faubourgs can still be found outside Europe include the province of Quebec in Canada and the city of New Orleans in the United States. The cities of Quebec and Montreal contain examples, although Montreal has far greater divergences in terms of \"banlieue,\" which lead to similarities of many Ontarian and American suburbs.\n\nFaubourgs were prominent around Paris since the 16th century. At that time, Paris was surrounded by a city wall. But even outside the Louis XIII wall there were urbanised areas, and those were called faubourgs. In 1701, these faubourgs were annexed to the city, and at about the same time, the wall was demolished, and where it once stood, there is now the chain of Great Boulevards that leads from Place de la Bastille via Place de la République and Place de la Madeleine to Place de la Concorde. The border of the city was transferred a few kilometers outwards, and the new borderline, which was in force until 1860, is now marked by the outer circle of boulevards passing through Place Charles de Gaulle in West and Place de la Nation in East.\n\nIn 1860, the border of the city was once more transferred a few kilometers outwards to where it still is. The Haussmannian Paris erased many traces of ancient faubourgs and the term banlieue was then coined.\n\nMany Parisian streets have retained their ancient denomination in spite of city growth; today it is still possible to discern pre-1701 delimitations in Paris by marking the point where a thoroughfare's name changes from \"rue\" to \"rue du faubourg\". For instance, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis used to be located outside of the city wall and was an extension of the rue Saint-Denis within the walls. The rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré came about in a similar manner.\n\nThe term was also used in the early expansion of New Orleans beyond the original city plan, when French was still a common language in the colonial city, even though in terms of characteristics, real faubourgs never existed in the city. Faubourg Tremé and Faubourg Marigny, two of the oldest neighborhoods outside of the French Quarter, are persistent examples. Another early example was Faubourg Ste. Marie, originally (late 18th century) a residential area, which was overtaken by commerce, developing into the modern Central Business District.\n\nGreater Montreal no longer has any actual \"faubourgs\" on the main island, as the suburb now refers to the North and South Shores. However, place names such as \"le Faubourg St-Laurent\" are still occasionally used to refer to the sections of Ville-Marie.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"des faubourgs de Montréal\" (\"the Montreal suburbs\") is preserved in some place names in the city proper, such as the annexes (branches) of the \"École des Métiers des Faubourgs-de-Montréal\". There was also a \"Caisse des Faubourgs de Montréal\" in The Village, which in 2003 was closed down.\n\nThe term \"faubourg\" is still alive in Quebec City, where it is mostly used to designate the Saint-Jean-Baptiste neighbourhood, often called \"Faubourg Saint-Jean-Baptiste\" or even \"le faubourg\" by its inhabitants. The term also applies to the Saint-Roch and Saint-Sauveur areas, and the three neighbourhoods are comprised in the municipal district of \"les Faubourgs\".\n\n"}
{"id": "9885137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9885137", "title": "Flex space", "text": "Flex space\n\nFlex space is a term used for lightly zoned buildings. It is mainly used when referring to industrial or office space.\n\nFlex space evolved from light industrial warehouses being converted to office space. Businesses that generally occupy these are new dotcoms, mechanic shops, and companies that contract plumbing, pest, electrical, and sometimes churches and related services.\n\nCompanies have discovered that on any given work day, a large percentage of their cubes are unoccupied—in some cases, up to 50%. Employees travel for work, take vacation, or are working from home in greater numbers than ever before. To avoid having to lease or buy more office space, flex space allows a company to have a higher occupancy of cube space and less wasted work areas.\n\nAt the beginning of the work day, an employee shows up at work. Cubes are mostly configured in the same way, making them all the same. The employee chooses a cube where she would like to sit, and that is her cube for the day. At the end of the day, she packs up her belongings, either taking them all home with her or storing them in a locker space. This leaves the cube the same way it was when he came in, and leaves it free and open for someone to use the following day.\nA large concern with employees in a flex space environment is cleanliness. It is important in a flex space environment to have a strong cleaning staff.\n\nFlex space describes mechanic shops as well. The Jim Bridger Building of Williston, North Dakota, USA is an example of a modern flex space mechanic shop.\n\nThe Jim Bridger Building is designed to flex its use depending on the needs of the oilfield and agricultural industries of Western North Dakota. Each vertical building panel has pneumatic, water, electrical, fiber optic, and hanging plates embedded in each panel. This makes the use of the building flexible. Tenants can grow their business space use, or trim their space use, without sacrificing building services. The building has heavy reinforced flooring, which with the panel plates and overhead cranes, makes the entire building into one big workbench.\n\n"}
{"id": "37360402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37360402", "title": "Français fondamental", "text": "Français fondamental\n\nFundamental French (français fondamental) is a list of words and grammatical concepts created in beginning of the 1950s for teaching foreigners and people part of l'Union française so that France could improve the spread of the French language. A series of investigations in the 1950s and '60s showed that a small number of words are used the same way orally and in writing in all circumstances; thus a limited number of grammatical rules were necessary for a functional language.\n\n\"Français fondamental\" was developed by the \"Centre d'Etude du Français Élémentaire\", which was renamed to the \"Centre de Recherche et d'Etude pour la Diffusion du Français\" (CREDIF) in 1959. It was headed by Georges Gougenheim, a linguist. The Ministry of Education of France sanctioned and promoted it as a method of learning French. The use of \"Français fondamental\" was common in French textbooks, and especially prevalent in audiovisual learning methods used in the 1960s.\n\nGougenheim, Réné Michea, Paul Rivenc, and Aurélien Sauvageot served as researchers for the project. There are 1,475 words in the \"first degree\" and 1,609 words in the \"second degree.\"\n\nThe core words for usage consist of around 270 grammatical words, 380 nouns, 200 verbs, 100 adjectives, and 50 words for various other uses, making up a total of one thousand words. There is a second group of words which are common to all French speakers, who can use spontaneously use around 1,500 words when needed in particular circumstances.\n\n\"L'Academie francaise\" prefers to distinguish \"fundamental french\" and \"elementary french\" as it says in its page \"Langue francaise - Questions courantes\" (The French Language - Common Questions) in the rubric \"Nombre de mots de la langue francaise\" (number of words in the french language): \"Based on frequency surveys, 'Fundamental French' and 'Elementary French' include just over 1000 to 3000 entrees respectively.\n\nFundamental French certainly had an influence, particularly in teaching the language to foreigners. But it was rejected in 1970 with the renewal of language teaching, without being replaced by a new tool. A seminar organised at \"l'École normale supérieure lettres et sciences humaines de Lyon\" in December 2005 tried to take stock of the developments that had occurred since its creation.\n\nIn a similar spirit but without the apparent affiliation, Radio France Internationale (RFI) released a 10 minute Journal in easy French with a restrained and simple vocabulary (300 words) that gave the context of the events once a day. This step is analogous to that of the Voice of America, who released a program in 1959 in Special English, a form of basic English with a vocabulary restrained to 1500 words.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "286747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286747", "title": "Google bomb", "text": "Google bomb\n\nThe terms Google bomb and Googlewashing refer to the practice of causing a website to rank highly in web search engine results for irrelevant, unrelated or off-topic search terms by linking heavily. In contrast, search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving the search engine listings of web pages for \"relevant\" search terms.\n\nGoogle-bombing is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or some combination thereof). Google's search-rank algorithm ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar anchor text. By January 2007, however, Google tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular Google bombs such as \"miserable failure\" leading to George W. Bush and Michael Moore; now, search results list pages about the Google bomb itself. Since no later than 21 June 2015, the first result in a Google search for \"miserable failure\" is the Wikipedia article defining \"Google bomb\". Used both as a verb and a noun, \"Google bombing\" was introduced to the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" in May 2005.\n\nGoogle bombing is related to spamdexing, the practice of deliberately modifying HTML to increase the chance of a website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.\n\nThe term \"Googlewashing\" was coined by Andrew Orlowski in 2003 to describe the use of media manipulation to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nGoogle bombs date back as far as 1999, when a search for \"more evil than Satan himself\" resulted in the Microsoft homepage as the top result.\n\nIn September 2000 the first Google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by \"Hugedisk Men's Magazine\", a now-defunct online humor magazine, when it linked the text \"dumb motherfucker\" to a site selling George W. Bush-related merchandise. Hugedisk had also unsuccessfully attempted to Google bomb an equally derogatory term to bring up an Al Gore-related site. After a fair amount of publicity the George W. Bush-related merchandise site retained lawyers and sent a cease-and-desist letter to \"Hugedisk\", thereby ending the Google bomb.\n\nAdam Mathes is credited with coining the term \"Google bombing\" when he mentioned it in an April 6, 2001 article in the online magazine \"uber.nu\". In the article Mathes details his connection of the search term \"talentless hack\" to the website of his friend Andy Pressman by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friend's page with the desired term. Some experts forecast that the practice of Google Bombing is over, as changes to Google's algorithm over the years have minimised the effect of the technique.\n\nThe Google Bomb has been used for tactical media as a way of performing a \"hit-and-run\" media attack on popular topics. Such attacks include Anthony Cox's attack in 2003. He created a parody of the \"404 – page not found\" browser error message in response to the war in Iraq. The page looked like the error page but was titled \"These Weapons of Mass Destruction cannot be displayed\". This website could be found as one of the top hits on Google after the start of the war in Iraq. Also, in an attempt to detract attention from the far-right group English Defence League (EDL), a parody group has been made known as \"English Disco Lovers\", with the expressed purpose of Google bombing the acronym.\n\nThe Google bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of Google's ranking factors. For example, talk radio host Alex Jones has often conducted what he calls \"Google bombs\" by dispatching instructions to his radio/Internet listeners. In this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase. The keyword surge gives the impression that the related content has suddenly become popular. The strategy behind this type of Google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword.\n\nBy studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is using, a company can provoke a search engine into \"lowering\" the ranking of a competitor's website. This practice, known as Google bowling, is often done by purchasing Google bombing services (or other SEO techniques) not for one's own website, but rather for that of a competitor. The attacker provokes the search company into punishing the \"offending\" competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results. For victims of Google bowling, it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because Google avoids explaining penalties, preferring not to \"educate\" real offenders. If the situation is clear-cut, however, Google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration. Furthermore, after the Google Penguin update, Google search rankings now take Google bowling into account and according to various sources, very rarely will a website be penalized due to low-quality \"farm\" backlinks.\n\nOther search engines use similar techniques to rank results, so Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask.com are also affected by Google bombs. A search for \"miserable failure\" or \"failure\" on September 29, 2006, brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN and number two on Ask.com. On June 2, 2005, Tooter reported that George Bush was ranked first for the keyword \"miserable\", \"failure\", and \"miserable failure\" in both Google and Yahoo!; Google has since addressed this and disarmed the George Bush Google bomb and many others.\n\nThe BBC, reporting on Google bombs in 2002, used the headline \"Google Hit By Link Bombers\", acknowledging to some degree the idea of \"link bombing\". In 2004, Search Engine Watch suggested that the term be \"link bombing\" because of its application beyond Google, and continues to use that term as it is considered more accurate.\n\nBy January 2007, Google changed its indexing structure so that Google bombs such as \"miserable failure\" would \"typically return commentary, discussions, and articles\" about the tactic itself. Google announced the changes on its official blog. In response to criticism for allowing the Google bombs, Matt Cutts, head of Google's Webspam team, said that Google bombs had not \"been a very high priority for us\".\n\nIn May 2004, the websites Dark Blue and SearchGuild teamed up to create what they termed the \"SEO Challenge\" to Google bomb the phrase \"nigritude ultramarine\".\n\nThe contest sparked controversy around the Internet, as some groups worried that search engine optimization (SEO) companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user. This fear was offset by the belief that Google would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the Google bombers.\n\nIn September 2004, another SEO contest was created. This time, the objective was to get the top result for the phrase \"seraphim proudleduck\". A large sum of money was offered to the winner, but the competition turned out to be a hoax.\n\nIn March 2005's issue of \".net\" magazine, a contest was created among five professional web developers to make their site the number-one site for the made-up phrase \"crystalline incandescence\".\n\nSome of the most famous Google bombs are also expressions of political opinions (e.g. \"liar\" leading to Tony Blair or \"miserable failure\" leading to the White House's biography of George W. Bush):\n\n\n\nSome website operators have adapted Google bombing techniques to do \"spamdexing\". This includes, among other techniques, posting of links to a site in an Internet forum along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site (see spam in blogs). Unlike conventional message board spam, the object is not to attract readers to the site directly, but to increase the site's ranking under those search terms. Promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic, in hopes that it will fly under the moderators' radar. Wikis in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism, as all of the pages are freely editable. This practice was also called \"money bombing\" by John Hiler circa 2004.\n\nAnother technique is for the owner of an Internet domain name to set up the domain's DNS entry so that all subdomains are directed to the same server. The operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired Google search terms, each linking to a subdomain of the same site, with the same title as the subdomain in the requested URL. Frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase, with spaces replaced by underscores or hyphens. Since Google treats subdomains as distinct sites, the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the PageRank of those subdomains and of any other site they link to.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, many have noticed changes in the Google algorithm that largely affects, among other things, Google bombs: only roughly 10% of the Google bombs worked as of February 15, 2007. This is largely due to Google refactoring its valuation of PageRank.\n\nQuixtar, a multi-level marketing company, has been accused by its critics of using its large network of websites to move sites critical of Quixtar lower in search engine rankings. A Quixtar independent business owner (IBO) reports that a Quixtar leader advocated the practice in a meeting of Quixtar IBOs. Quixtar denies wrongdoing and states that its practices are in accordance with search engine rules.\n\nOn December 26, 2011, a bomb was started against GoDaddy to remove them from the #1 place on Google for \"domain registration\" in retaliation for its support for SOPA. This was then disseminated through Hacker News.\n\nIn Australia, one of the first examples of Google bombs was when the keyword \"old rice and monkey nuts\" was used to generate traffic for \"Herald Sun\" columnist Andrew Bolt's website. The keyword phrase references the alleged $4 billion in loan deals brokered by Tirath Khemlani to Australia in 1974.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1911, during the Universal Congress of Esperanto in Anvers. Its members from very diverse backgrounds, mostly protestant churches. KELI publishes a bimonthly magazine, \"Dia Regno\", which started to appear regularly in 1908, when the German Paul Hübner was sure that five people would subscribe. Now the magazine serves as a tool among members in 48 countries from diverse faiths, Adventists to Quakers, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, etc., but also people of the Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nIn the beginning, it was important to have basic literature. In 1912, the New Testament was published and then in 1926 the entire Bible with the Zamenhof's Old Testament translation - not privately, but in the British and Foreign Bible Society. That way, it is possible to continually have Esperanto Bibles in every Christian Bookstore throughout the entire world. Also, an edition having the deuterocanonical books (translated by Gerrit berveling of Netherlands) was published in 2003. In 1971, KELI had an official hymnal \"Adoru Kantante\" (Worship by Singing) with 262 songs (mostly classics), from many countries and languages, with four part harmony - a beautiful book, done professionally. Recently, conferences have used more modest looking song collections, \"Tero kaj Chielo Kantu\" (Earth and Heaven Sing) with 161 songs, since people preferred more modern music. \"Adoru\", an ecumenical worship book co-edited with the catholic association IKUE, containing texts, prayers and hymnals appeared in June 2001.\n\nAfter the war, KELI started to organize an annual conference with concerns about working out a program about work, study, entertainment, the conference country and local churches. More and more, because of good communication with IKUE, the Roman Catholic Esperanto-Union, the annual conferences happened together, for the first time in 1968 in Limburg/Lahn. They attracted between 90 and 200 people, many of which were IKUE or KELI members.\n\nAt Universal Congresses, IKUE and KELI try to have communion together if possible. Often, they are among the great amount of visited programs of the congress week.\n\nFrom the start, KELI supported the actions for the blind by the Dutchman, Jacques Tuinder, known under the name \"Agado E3\", or now E-vid-ente. Now, its help focuses on Albania, but does not forget other aspects of misery for people with poor sight.\n\nThe task of KELI goes in two directions: to inform the Church and other Christian groups about Esperanto, and to inform the Esperanto community about Christianity.\n\n"}

Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work \"Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family\", the Iroquois system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese).\n\nThe system has both classificatory and descriptive terms. In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes 'same-sex' and 'cross-sex' parental siblings: the brothers of Ego's (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and the sisters of Ego's mother, are referred to by the same parental kinship terms used for Ego's Father and Mother. The sisters of Ego's father, and the brothers of Ego's mother, on the other hand, are referred to by non-parental kinship terms, commonly translated into English as \"Aunt\" and \"Uncle\".\n\nThe children of one's parents' same-sex siblings, i.e. parallel cousins, are referred to by sibling kinship terms. The children of Aunts or Uncles, i.e. cross cousins, are not considered siblings, and are referred to by kinship terms commonly translated into English as \"cousin\". In some systems, the kinship terms applied to cross-cousins are the same as those applied to brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, due to preferential marriage practices (see below).\nEgo (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) is encouraged to marry his cross cousins but discouraged or prohibited from marrying his parallel cousins. In many societies with Iroquois kinship terminologies, the preferred marriage partners include not only first cousins (mother's brother's children and father's sister's children), but more remote relatives who are also classified as cross cousins by the logic of the kinship system. Preferential cross-cousin marriage can be useful in reaffirming alliances between unilineal lineages or clans.\n\nThe term Iroquois comes from the six Iroquois tribes of northeastern North America. Another aspect of their kinship was that the six tribes all had matrilineal systems, in which children were born into the mother's clan and gained status through it. Women controlled some property, and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line. A woman's eldest brother was more important as a mentor to her children than their father, who was always of a different clan.\n\nSome groups in other countries also happen to be independently organized for kinship by the Iroquois system. It is commonly found in unilineal descent groups. These include:\n\nOther populations found to have the Iroquois system are\n\nSome communities in South India use the kinship tradition described above. \n\nMany of the cultures of Vanuatu use this type of kinship system. In Bislama (Vanuatu pidgin), paternal uncles and maternal aunts are referred to as \"smol papa\" \"small father\" and \"smol mama\" \"small mother\" respectively.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33699160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33699160", "title": "K'iche' language", "text": "K'iche' language\n\nK’iche’ (, also \"Qatzijob'al\" \"our language\" to its speakers), or Quiché (), is a Maya language of Guatemala, spoken by the K'iche' people of the central highlands. With over a million speakers (some 7% of Guatemala's population), K'iche' is the second-most widely spoken language in the country after Spanish. Most speakers of K'iche' languages also have at least a working knowledge of Spanish.\n\nThe Central dialect is the most commonly used in the media and education. The literacy rate is low, but K'iche' is increasingly taught in schools and used on radio. The most famous work in the Classical K'iche' language is the \"Popol Vuh\" (\"Popol Wu'uj\" in modern spelling).\n\nKaufman (1970) divides the K'iche' complex into the following five dialects, with the representative municipalities given as well (quoted in Par Sapón 2000:17).\n\n\n\n\nThe Nahualá dialect of K'iche' shows some differences from other K'iche' dialects. It preserves an ancient Proto-Mayan distinction between five long vowels (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu) and five short vowels (a, e, i, o, u). It is for that conservative linguistic feature that Guatemalan and foreign linguists have actively sought to have the language called K'ichee rather than K'iche' or Quiché.\n\nK'iche' has a rather conservative phonology. It has not developed many of the innovations found in neighboring languages, such as retroflex consonants or tone.\n\nStress is not phonemic. It occurs on the final syllable, and on every other syllable before the final in an iambic pattern.\n\nUnstressed vowels are frequently reduced (to or ) or elided altogether, often producing consonant clusters even at the beginnings of words. For example, \"sib'alaj\" \"very\" may be pronounced , and \"je na la' \"\"thus\" .\n\nK'iche' dialects differ in their vowel systems. Historically, K'iche' had a ten-vowel system: five short and five long. Some dialects (for instance, Nahualá and Totonicapán) retain the ten-vowel system. Others (for instance, Cantel) have reduced it to a six-vowel system with no length distinctions: short /a/ has become /ə/ in these dialects, and the other short vowels have merged with their long counterparts. Different conventions for spelling the vowels have been proposed, including by the Proyecto Lingüístico Francisco Marroquín, the Summer Institute of Linguistics and the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala. The table below shows the two vowel systems, and several of the spelling systems that have been proposed.\n\nVowels typically undergo syncope in penultimate syllables, allowing for a wide array of complex onsets. Diphthongs are found in recent loanwords.\n\nK'iche' has both pulmonic stops and affricates, p /p/, t /t/, tz /ts/, ch /tʃ/, k /k/, and q /q/, and glottalized counterparts b’ /ɓ/, t’ /t’/, tz’ /ts’/, ch’ /tʃ’/, k’ /k’/, and q’ /q’/. The glottalized /ɓ/ is a weak implosive, while the other glottalized consonants are ejectives. The pulmonic stops and affricates are typically aspirated.\n\nIn West Quiche, the approximants l /l/, r /ɻ/, y /j/, and w /w/ devoice and fricate to word-finally and often before voiceless consonants. In some dialects, intervocalic alternates between and , a highly unusual sound change. The fricative is most common between the vowels \"o\" and \"a\" and between two \"o\"s, and occurs more often than not between two \"a\"s.\n\nComplex onsets are very common in K'iche', partially due to the active process of penultimate syncope. Complex codas are rare, except when the first member of the complex coda is a phonemic glottal stop, written with an apostrophe. The sonorants /m, n, l, r/ may be syllabic.\n\nHistorically, different orthographies have been used to transliterate the K'iche' languages. The classic orthography of Father Ximénez who wrote down the Popol Vuh is based on the Spanish orthography and has been replaced by a new standardized orthography defined by the ALMG (Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala). Ethnohistorian and Mayanist Dennis Tedlock uses his own transliteration system which is completely different from any of the established orthographies, but this system will not be given here.\n\nLike other Mayan languages, K'iche' uses two sets of agreement markers—known to Mayanists as \"Set A\" and \"Set B\" markers—which can appear on both nouns and verbs. \"Set A\" markers are used on nouns to mark possessor agreement, and on verbs to agree with the transitive subject (ergative case). \"Set B\" markers are used on verbs to agree with the transitive object or the intransitive subject (absolutive case).\n\nK'iche' distinguishes six pronouns, classified by person and number. Gender and case are not marked on pronouns. Pronouns are often omitted, as subject and object agreement are obligatorily marked on the verb.\n\nVerbs are highly morphologically complex, and can take numerous prefixes and suffixes serving both inflectional and derivational purposes.\n\nThe table below shows the inflectional template of a K'iche' verb. Agreement follows an ergative/absolutive pattern. Subjects of transitive verbs are indexed using Set A markers. Intransitive subjects and transitive objects are indexed using Set B markers. Aspect and mood are also indicated, as is movement: the prefix ul- in the movement slot indicates movement towards the speaker, while the prefix e- (or b'e- in some varieties) indicates movement away.\n\nThe last morpheme on a verb, the so-called \"status suffix\", is a portmanteau morph whose form determined by a rather complicated set of rules.\nRelevant factors include:\n\nThe examples above involve verbs with simple stems. Verb stems may also be morphologically complex. Complex stems may involve voice suffixes\n\n\nor derivational suffixes, many of which form verb stems from other parts of speech. For instance, the versive suffix -ir or -ar forms verb stems from adjectives: utz \"good\", -utz-ir- \"get good\"; nim \"big\", -nim-ar- \"get big.\" Multiple suffixes can appear within a single stem: -nim-ar- \"get big\", -nim-ar-isa- \"enlarge (something)\", -nim-ar-isa-x- \"be enlarged.\"\n\nAs with all Mayan languages, K'iche' has an ergative pattern of verb agreement, and often uses verb-object-subject (VOS) word order. Most modern speakers use SOV, SVO, and VSO word orders interchangeably. Language purists have tried to preserve the traditional verb-initial word order, while influence from Spanish (an SVO language) promotes a subject-initial order.\n\nContrary to the way many other languages use high pitch in child directed speech (babytalk), K'iche' babytalk has been shown not to use high pitch. Mayans in fact lower their pitch slightly when they speak to children, due to the fact that in the Quiche Mayan culture high pitch is very often used to address persons of high status.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7549774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7549774", "title": "Koine Greek phonology", "text": "Koine Greek phonology\n\nThe Greek language underwent pronunciation changes during the Koine Greek period, from about 300 BC to 300 AD. At the beginning of the period, the pronunciation was almost identical to Classical Greek, while at the end it was closer to Modern Greek.\n\nThe most significant changes during the Koine Greek period concerned vowels: these were the loss of vowel length distinction, the shift of the Ancient Greek system of pitch accent to a stress accent system, and the monophthongization of diphthongs (except and ). These changes seem widely attested from the 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek, and in the early 2nd century AD in learned Attic inscriptions; it is therefore likely that they were already common in the 2nd century BC and generalized no later than the 2nd century AD.\n\nAnother change was the fricatization of the second element of diphthongs and . This change likely took place after the vocalic changes described above occurred. It is attested in Egyptian Greek starting from the 1st century AD, and seems to have been generalized in the late Roman period.\n\nAnother series of changes was the fricatization of voiced stops, which is widely attested in Egyptian Greek starting from the 1st century AD, but may have been generalized at a later date, possibly in the late Roman or early Byzantine periods.\n\nYet another series of changes was the fricatization of aspirated voiceless stops, which is attested in several locations from the 1st century AD, but seems to have been generalized at a later date, possibly in the late Roman or early Byzantine period.\n\nA last change (possibly related to fricatization of aspirated stops) is the loss of , which may have begun as soon as the late 1st century BC in Egyptian Greek, seems to have taken place no earlier than the 2nd century AD in learned Attic inscription, and had most probably been generalized by the late Roman times.\n\nThe primary issue comes from the diversity of the Greek-speaking world: evidence suggests that phonological changes occurred at different times according to location and/or speaker background. It appears that many phonetic changes associated with the Koine period had already occurred in some varieties of Greek during the Classical period.\n\nAn opposition between learned language and vulgar language has been claimed for the corpus of Attic inscriptions. Some phonetic changes are attested in vulgar inscriptions since the end of the Classical period; still they are not generalized until the start of the 2nd century AD in learned inscriptions. While orthographic conservatism in learned inscriptions may account for this, contemporary transcriptions from Greek into Latin might support the idea that this is not just orthographic conservatism, but that learned speakers of Greek retained a conservative phonological system into the Roman period. On the other hand, Latin transcriptions, too, may be exhibiting orthographic conservatism.\n\nInterpretation is more complex when different dating is found for similar phonetic changes in Egyptian papyri and learned Attic inscriptions. A first explanation would be dialectal differences (influence of foreign phonological systems through non-native speakers); changes would then have happened in Egyptian Greek before they were generalized in Attic. A second explanation would be that learned Attic inscriptions reflect a more learned variety of Greek than Egyptian papyri; learned speech would then have resisted changes that had been generalized in vulgar speech. A last explanation would be that the orthography in learned Attic inscriptions was artificially conservative; changes may then have been generalized no later than they are attested in Egyptian papyri. All these explanations are plausible to some degree, but would lead to different dating for the generalization of the same changes.\n\nTo sum this up, there is some measure of uncertainty in dating of phonetic changes; indeed, the exact dating and the rapidity of the generalization of Koine Greek phonological changes are still matters of discussion among researchers. Orthographic variants in contemporary written sources is the most direct evidence, but it is not enough to date a change in every context. Testimony of grammarians and, to a lesser extent, transcriptions into foreign language are interesting because they can indicate which pronunciation was regarded as standard by learned speakers; however, it has been argued that transcriptions may in some cases be conventional rather than phonetic, and Greek grammarians appear to describe learned pronunciation while ignoring established vulgar pronunciation.\n\nAlthough it belongs to the late classical period rather than the Koine Greek period, Boeotian phonology is shown here as it prefigures several traits of later Koine phonology.\n\nBy the 4th century BC, Boeotian had monophthongized most diphthongs, and featured a fricative . Note that, in contrast with Ionic-Attic and Koine, had remained a back vowel in Boeotian (written ). Long and short vowels were still distinguished.\n\nTeodorsson argues that by 350 BC, the majority Attic dialect seemed to display similar values (except for which was a front vowel; perhaps controversially, his reconstruction has already cancelled vowel length distinctions and merged and merged with as in Modern Greek.)\n\nEarly monophthongization, and perhaps even vowel weakening due to the shift to a stress accent, is also attested in Thessalian of the 3rd century BC, suggesting that several minority dialects had an advanced vowel system by the early Hellenistic period.\n\nNote that in this case when transcribing (and also later ) the phonemic symbols denote true mid-vowels, i.e. neither close nor open.\n\nThe /yː/ value for is attested later, in the 3rd century BC. An intermediate value of /øː/ has been suggested by some, perhaps attested in spellings of for indicating a premature loss of lip-rounding leading to /eː/, rather than /iː/ (c.f. text below.)\n\nDiphthongs and likely retained their classical pronunciation. A single interchange with -β, indicating an early change to , is found later, in the 3rd century BC.\n\nFricative values for , , , and are not unlikely, but are not attested in Boeotian in the 4th century BC. A fricative value for is attested in Laconian in the late 5th century BCE through spellings with , including in some plays by Aristophanes. also appears to have become fricative in 6th century BC Elean (see discussion on consonants below.) Additionally, as noted above, a single example of for is found a century later.\n\nNo reference has been found on the status of the aspirate in Boeotian at this period.\n\nThe tonal accent system of Ancient Greek probably remained relevant.\n\nThe following text, a Hellenistic Boeotian inscription, is rendered in a reconstructed pronunciation reflecting regional phonological developments. Monophthongization and vowel raising are clearly seen in the specialized Boeotian orthography which uses η instead of αι, ει for η and ηι (ῃ) and ω for ωι (ῳ.) There is also a spelling of ει for οι, indicating an early loss of lip-rounding resulting in /eː/, not /i(ː)/; it can therefore be inferred that at this stage οι became /øː/, not /y/. It is not implausible that in vulgar Attic the /y/ > /i/ shift had already occurred in the 4th century BC, but was resisted in Koine due to conservative interference. Also notable is the continued use of digamma ϝ for /w/.\n\nUntil the beginning of Roman times, some learned speakers may have retained a conservative pronunciation that preserved many traits of the Ancient Greek phonological system. However, already in the 4th century BC, the popular dialect in Athens may have been moving in the direction of the Koine without differences in vowel length, as noted above. Even in Attic official inscriptions, the learned pronunciation appears to have disappeared by the 2nd century AD.\n\nThe \"learned pronunciation\" described here is mostly pre-Koine Attic.\n\nThe pseudo-diphthong was confused with in manuscripts, except before a vowel, where it was confused with , so it probably retained its ancient value there. Note also that a monophthongal pronunciation of as is written in parentheses as a dialectal trait of Great Attic beginning in the late classical period. In addition, probably first lost its final element and merged with , but later raised to (as seen in alternations between spellings of / for the 2sg middle ending.) Both pronunciations are given as possible dialectal variants.\n\nLong first element diphthongs are written in parentheses because they were gradually monophthongized starting from the classical period; Dionysius of Halicarnassus prescribes them as a \"correct\" pronunciation, indicating that the diphthongs were no longer pronounced in natural speech. By the 1st century BC the process of monophthongization was over (see diachronic description below for more details).\n\nAncient grammarians and transcriptions suggest that voiced and aspirated stop consonants were retained until the beginning of the Roman period. The voiced stops probably became fricatives before the voiceless aspirates.\n\nSome scholars regard as an allophone of , others as a separate phoneme, which is why it is put in parentheses.\n\nWhat exact sound represented is a matter of discussion, but it should probably be regarded as an allophone of the notated by .\n\n\"Learned speech\" retained the tonal accent system of Ancient Greek.\n\nThe following excerpt is part of a Roman Senatorial decree to the town of Thisbae in Boeotia in 170 BC, and is transcribed with a conservative variety Koiné in the early Roman period. The transcription shows partial (pre-consonantal/word-final) raising of and to , retention of pitch accent, and retention of word-initial (the rough breathing).\n\nBy around 150 BC Egyptian Greek had monophthongized diphthongs and lost vowel length distinction.\n\nConfusion of with and of with in Egypt begin from this period on. However, was not confused with before the 1st century BC, so is still represented in the intermediate phase of . remained rounded, but apparently merged with in certain conditions (see sample text below.) Further confusion of / and is also common, indicating a neutralization of and , perhaps with a closer articulation of . However, distinction between close and mid back vowels is still maintained in the chart, because this development was likely an isolated regional trait related to Coptic influence, not affecting the development of the language generally.\n\nThe transition of and from , to , was likely already in progress. A probable intermediate semi-vocalic stage is therefore presented here. The diphthong was apparently retained in Egyptian at least in this century.\n\nEvidence for a fricative in Egyptian Greek dates as far back to the 4th century BC. From the 2nd century BC, these include omissions and insertions of before a front vowel which indicate a palatal fricative allophone in such positions. However, these may not have been standard pronunciations. likely did not become fricative till the 1st century AD. Fricative pronunciation for aspirates may have been generalized even later in Egyptian Greek.\n\nAspiration may have begun to disappear from popular speech in the 1st century BC.\n\nThe accent had changed to a stress accent.\n\nThe following late Ptolemaic Egyptian papyrus from 154 BC is rendered in popular pronunciation including the loss of vowel length distinction and shift to a stress accent. The substitution of αι for ε points to monophthongization; for οι, this is still in the intermediate phase of /ø/, as inferred by the lack of confusion with υ. The interchange of ι for η and υ suggests an early raising to /i/ for the former and loss of lip-rounding for the latter; this occurs only in highly restricted phonetic conditions (i.e. in labial environments), or may be an isolated dialectal trait. Horrocks' transcription already has a fricative γ with a palatal allophone before front vowels.\n\nThe loss of vowel length and the spread of Greek under Alexander the Great led to a reorganization of the vowels in the phonology of Koine Greek. There were no longer distinctions of long and short vowels in popular speech.\n\nThe monophthongization process was over by the 1st century BC with the final merger of and .\n\nIn the Roman period the and diphthongs developed narrower articulations, possibly closing to , or even, depending on when lip-rounding was lost, and . Before the 4th century AD interchanges of with are still more common than confusions with , so many (if not most) speakers probably preserved the earlier pronunciations of the second element as a semi-vowel or labialized consonant.\n\nBy the 1st century the voiced consonants and became fricatives and , though probably remained plosive till the 3rd century. Despite the lack of clear evidence for the fricativization of aspirated plosives in the Koine, , , and perhaps started to become fricatives in areas outside Egypt such as the northern Mediterranean. See discussion below.\n\nAspiration had probably dropped out of popular speech, but possibly remained a characteristic of learned speech.\n\nAccentuation lost distinctions of high and high-low tones, leaving only a high tone for a \"stress\" accent.\n\nThe following papyrus letter from 100 AD is again transcribed in popular Koine pronunciation. It now shows fricative values for the second element in diphthongs αυ/ευ and for β, except in transliterations of Latin names, but aspirated plosives remain plosive. Monophthongization and loss of vowel length are clearly seen in the graphic interchanges of ι/ει, υ/οι, and ω/o. Also, there is frequent post-nasal voicing of voiceless stops, which is strengthened in Egypt because of Coptic influence but eventually standardized everywhere and is a rule in Modern Greek.\n\nBy the 4th century AD, the loss of vowel length distinction and aspiration was most probably generalized. was often confused with (hence pronounced ?), but still occasionally with (presumably pronounced , as it still is today in Eastern – i. e., Pontic and Cappadocian – Greek dialects). Fricative values for former voiced and aspirate stop consonants were probably already common; however, some dialects may have retained voiced and aspirate stop consonants until the end of the 1st millennium. The pronunciation suggested here, though far from being universal, is essentially that of Modern Greek except for the continued roundedness of .\n\nThere is some confusion between and in Attic and Asia Minor two centuries earlier. However, in the papyri, it is only from this period that interchange with symbols for becomes as common as that between /, / or /. The confusion between and had begun as early as the 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek, but it was most probably not generalized in all phonetic positions yet.\n\nThe full transition of and to may have been generalized by this time.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence for the latter change in Egyptian papyri, it is perhaps not an unreasonable assumption that fricative values for both former voiced stops and voiceless aspirated stops were common in many other dialects. It is uncertain as to when the palatal allophones for velars /k/ and /x/ appeared.\n\nThe stress accent system was probably generalized.\n\nThe following excerpt from a late 4th century AD papyrus letter is rendered in late Roman/early Byzantine era popular Koine. Vowel length loss and monophthongization are presumed to be nearly universal in all regions, as is seen in the familiar interchanges of , , ι, and . The misspelling of for again suggests, as noted above, that both and merged with before labials. By now, however, (earlier Koine ?) had possibly fully raised to in all positions, as is shown in the transcription. Aspiration has been lost, and both voiced plosives and voiceless aspirated plosives have become fricatives. The omission of γ in the misspelling ὑιέvovτα (ὑγιαί–) may reflect a palatal allophone of velar fricative before front vowels.\n\nThe ancient distinction between long and short vowels was lost in popular speech at the beginning of the Koine period. \"By the mid-second century [BCE] however, the majority system had undergone important changes, most notably monophthongization, the loss of distinctive length, and the shift to a primary stress accent.\"\n\nFrom the 2nd century BC, spelling errors in non-literary Egyptian papyri suggest stress accent and loss of vowel length distinction. The widespread confusion between and in Attic inscriptions starting in the 2nd century AD was probably caused by a loss of vowel length distinction.\n\nThe means of accenting words changed from pitch to stress, meaning that the accented syllable had only one tone option (high) and was presumably louder and/or stronger. This shift directly corresponded with monophthongization and the loss of vowel timing distinctions, which destroyed the environment in which a pitch accent could be sustained.\n\nFrom the mid 2nd century BC, spelling errors all over the Mediterranean, including occasional graphic omissions of unaccented vowels, suggest a loss of vowel length distinction, which is commonly thought to result in the loss of tonal accent. More evidence of stress accent appears in poetry starting from the late 2nd century AD – early 3rd century AD.\n\nBefore a consonant, the diphthong had started to become monophthongal in Attic as early as the 6th century BC, and pronounced like , probably as . From the late 4th century BC in Attic, the spurious diphthong (pseudo-diphthong) (now notating both etymological and etymological ) came to be pronounced like , probably as (with the quality that the digraph still has in modern Greek).\n\nBefore a vowel, the diphthong did not follow the same evolution as pre-consonantal . One theory to explain this difference is that pre-vocalic may have kept a diphthongal value until the 4th century BC, the being progressively perceived as a glide from to the next vowel. From the late 4th century BC, the pre-vocalic diphthong came to be confused with , which implies that, unlike before a consonant, it retained the value , probably with a loss of openness distinction with ; for later evolution, refer to below.\n\nStarting from the 6th century in Attic, the diphthong had been monophthongized and confused with . While its initial value had probably been , it must have evolved to quite early (possibly in the 6th century BC, and at any rate before 350 BC); this vowel quality has been preserved through modern times.\n\nDiphthong was probably monophthongized at first as . This value is attested in Boeotian in the early 4th century BC with the Boeotian spelling of for . Confusion of with suggests that this transition had taken place by the mid 2nd century BC in Egyptian Greek. Further confusion between and is found in Palestine in the early 2nd century, and the confusion between and starting from c. 125 AD in Attic suggests that the monophthongization took place in the early 2nd century AD in learned Attic. Allen thinks the transition to (i.e. loss of openness distinction with ) to have taken place later; while Allen is not very explicit on this point, this theory seems based on the observation that while both and are confused with , is not confused with . However, not all scholars seem to agree. No reference on this point of debate has been found.\n\nDiphthong was monophthongized as or (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place). This is attested in Boeotian in the early as the 3rd century BC with a spelling of for , but this was probably a dialectal trait. Still, diphthong must have kept a diphthongal value at least in learned language until Roman times, as it is transcribed as \"oe\" in Latin. Further evidence of monophthongization is found from the early 1st century BC in Egyptian Greek, as well as in the early 2nd century AD in Palestine. Monophthongization in learned language seems attested by a spelling for found in a text dated from the early 2nd century AD and another from c. 240 AD. (Look up note on evolution of for subsequent evolution.)\n\nKoine Greek initially seems to feature diphthong , which had been progressively monophthongized to (written for ) in Attic from the 6th century BC to the 4th century BC but retained in other Greek dialects. It was later monophthongized as or (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place). (The author of these lines has not found any reference on when this change took place, but this transition may be phonologically linked to, and at any rate is quite unlikely to have taken place after, the similar transition of to ). (See discussion on below for subsequent evolution.)\n\nDiphthongs and lost their ancient value of and fortified to a fricative consonantal pronunciation of or , through the likely intermediate stages of and then Sporadic confusions of with , which attest a fricative pronunciation, are found as early as 3rd century BC Boeotia and in 2nd century BC Egypt. Further such confusions appear rarely in the papyri at the beginning of the 1st century AD. However, Gignac notes that before the Late Roman/Early Byzantine period spellings with are more common, which more likely represent the earlier transitional phases of or . Allen also believes that the fricative pronunciation was not generalized at once; for instance, Jewish catacombs inscriptions still show a diphthongal value in the 2nd–3rd century AD. Confusion of and with becomes increasingly common in late Roman and early Byzantine times, which suggests that it had been generalized by this time. Outside of Egypt, spellings with are also found in Asia Minor, from the Late Roman period. Finally, indirect evidence comes from transcriptions into foreign languages, such as Coptic \"Hippef\" for (2nd century AD), or Byzantine Late Hebrew/Aramaic transcriptions of with אב (\"ab-\").\n\nDiphthong had started to become monophthongal in Attic at least as early as the 4th century BC as it was often written and probably pronounced . In Koine Greek, most were therefore subjected to the same evolution as original classical and came to be pronounced . However, in some inflexional endings (mostly 1st declension dative singular and subjunctive 3S), the evolution was partially reverted from c. 200 BC, probably by analogy of forms of other cases/persons, to and was probably pronounced at first (look up note on evolution of for subsequent evolution).\n\nOther long-first-element diphthongs ( and became monophthongal by the 2nd century BC, as they were written and ; the former was probably pronounced , while the later may have been pronounced at first if openness distinction had not been lost yet, and was eventually pronounced at any rate (look up discussion of single vowels and below for details). From the 2nd century AD, Atticism caused for a widespread reintroduction of the ancient spelling with the final , but in any case was not pronounced.\n\nWhen augmented from in verbs, diphthong had been altered to from the 4th century BC.\n\nOther long-first-element diphthongs (, and ) had become monophthongal from the 1st century BC, as they were written as , and ; the first was probably pronounced , while the two later may have been pronounced and at first if openness distinction had not been lost yet ( and otherwise), and were eventually pronounced and at any rate (look up discussions of single vowels and and single vowel below for details).\n\nApart from , simple vowels have better preserved their ancient pronunciation than diphthongs.\n\nAs noted above, at the start of the Koine Greek period, pseudo-diphthong before consonant had a value of , whereas pseudo-diphthong had a value of ; these vowel qualities have remained unchanged through Modern Greek. Diphthong before vowel had been generally monophthongized to a value of and confused with , thus sharing later developments of .\n\nThe quality of vowels , , and have remained unchanged through Modern Greek, as , , and .\n\nVowels and started to be regularly confused in Attic inscriptions starting in the 2nd century AD, which may indicate that the quality distinction was lost around this time. However, this may as well indicate the loss of length distinction, with an earlier or simultaneous loss of quality distinction. Indeed, the fact that some less systematic confusion is found in Attic inscriptions from the 4th century BC may alternatively point to a loss of openness distinction in the 4th century BC, and the systematization of the confusion in the 2nd century AD would then have been caused by the loss of length distinction.\n\nThe quality distinction between and may have been lost in Attic in the late 4th century BCE, when pre-consonantic pseudo-diphthong started to be confused with and pre-vocalic diphthong with . C. 150 AD, Attic inscriptions started confusing and , indicating the appearance of a or (depending on when the loss of vowel length distinction took place) pronunciation that is still in usage in standard Modern Greek; however, it seems that some locutors retained the pronunciation for some time, as Attic inscriptions continued to in parallel confuse and , and transcriptions into Gothic and, to some extent, old Armenian transcribe as e. Additionally, it is noted that while interchange of and does occur in the Ptolemaic and Roman period, these only occur in restrictive phonetic conditions or may otherwise be explained due to grammatical developments.\n\nKoine Greek adopted for vowel the pronunciation of Ionic-Attic. Confusion of with appears in Egyptian papyri from the 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD, suggesting a pronunciation of , but this occurs only in restricted phonetic conditions or may be a regional trait (since Coptic did not have .) Transcriptions into Gothic and, to some extent, Armenian suggest that still retained a pronunciation, and the transition to in mainstream Greek is thought to have taken place at the end of the 1st millennium.\n\nThe aspirate breathing (aspiration, referring here to the phoneme , which is usually marked by the rough breathing sign), which was already lost in the Ionic idioms of Asia Minor and the Aeolic of Lesbos (psilosis), later stopped being pronounced in Koine Greek. Incorrect or hypercorrect markings of assimilatory aspiration (i.e. un-aspirated plosive becomes aspirated before initial aspiration) in Egyptian papyri suggest that this loss was already under way in Egyptian Greek in the late 1st century BC. Transcriptions into foreign languages and consonant changes before aspirate testify that this transition must not have been generalized before the 2nd century AD, but transcriptions into Gothic show that it was at least well under way in the 4th century AD.\n\nAmong consonants, only , , and are certain to have changed from Classical Greek. Consonants , and are assumed to have changed, too, but there is some disagreement amongst scholars over evidence for these.\n\nThe consonant , which had probably a value of in Classical Attic (though some scholars have argued in favor of a value of , and the value probably varied according to dialects – see Zeta (letter) for further discussion), acquired the sound that it still has in Modern Greek, seemingly with a geminate pronunciation at least between vowels. Attic inscriptions suggest that this pronunciation was already common by the end of the 4th century BC.\n\nHorrocks agrees with Gignac on finding evidence that geminate consonants tended to simplify beginning from the 3rd century BC, as seen in their arbitrary use in less literate writing. However, degemination was not carried out universally, as seen where the South Italian, south-eastern and some Asia Minor dialects preserve double consonants.\n\nConsonants , , which were initially pronounced as aspirates and , developed into fricatives and . On the other hand, there is no specific evidence of the transition of consonant from aspirate to fricative in the Koine Greek period. There is evidence for fricative in Laconian in the 5th century BC, but this is unlikely to have influenced Koine Greek which is largely based on Ionic-Attic. According to Allen, the first clear evidence for fricative and in Koine Greek dates from the 1st century AD in Latin Pompeian inscriptions. Yet, evidence suggest an aspirate pronunciation for in Palestine in the early 2nd century, and Jewish catacomb inscriptions of the 2nd–3rd century AD suggest a pronunciation of for , for and for , which would testify that the transition of to a fricative was not yet general at this time, and suggests that the transition of to a fricative may have happened before the transition of and . There may be evidence for fricative in 2nd century AD Attic, in the form of omission of the second element in the diphthongs (which pronounced ) before . Armenian transcriptions transcribe as until the 10th century AD, so it seems that was pronounced as aspirate by at least some speakers until then.\n\nThere is disagreement as to when consonants , and , which were originally pronounced , , , acquired the value of , , and that they have in Modern Greek. There is evidence of fricative as far back as the 4th century BC, in the form of omissions before a back vowel. In the papyri from the 2nd century BC is sometimes omitted or inserted before a front vowel, which indicates a palatal allophone or . However, to Allen these do not seem to have been a standard pronunciation. Some scholars have argued that the replacement of old Greek with in certain late classical dialects indicates a fricative pronunciation. Ancient grammarians describe the plosive nature of these letters, is transcribed as \"b\", not \"v\", in Latin, and Cicero still seems to identify with Latin b. Gignac finds evidence from non-literary papyri suggesting a fricative pronunciation in some contexts (mostly intervocalic) from about the 1st century AD, in the form of the use of to transcribe Latin \"v\" (which was also undergoing a fortition process from semi-vowel /w/ to fricative /β/.) However, Allen is again sceptical that this pronunciation was generalized yet. Increasingly common confusion of and with and in late Roman and early Byzantine times suggests that the fricative pronunciation of was common if not general by this time. Yet, it is not before the 10th century AD that transcriptions of as fricative \"v\" or as voiced velar \"ł\" (pronounced ) are found in Armenian, which suggests that the transition was not general before the end of the 1st millennium; however, previous transcriptions may have been learned transcriptions. Georgian loans in the 9th-10th centuries similarly show inconsistency in transcribing and as a stop or fricative; is consistently rendered as ბ \"b\" rather than ვ \"v\", while may be written with an adapted symbol for fricative or with ჟ (approximating in palatal position), but also with stop გ \"g.\" There is probable evidence for a peculiarly early shift of > in 6th century BC Elean, seen in the writing of for . Gignac interprets similar spellings in the Egyptian papyri beginning in the 1st century AD as the spirant pronunciation for δ in the Koine, but before the 4th century AD these only occur before . However, not all scholars agree that there is a reasonable phonetic basis for the earlier fricativization of δ before ι.\n\nThe weakness of final , frequently before a stop consonant, is attested in Egypt in both Hellenistic and Roman times, seen directly in graphic omission and hypercorrect insertion, though its complete loss would not be carried through until the medieval period and excluding the South-Italian, south-eastern and Asia Minor dialects. The development of voiced allophones , , of voiceless stops , , and after nasals is also evidenced in Pamphylia as early as the 4th century BC and in the Egyptian papyri (mostly Roman period) in the interchange with , , and in post-nasal positions (where these letters retained there their ancient plosive values, as noted above.) Hence , , would later be used for , , , via assimilation to the second element. In Egypt this development is seen as an influence of the Coptic substrate. But at the same time, this change has now become standard in Modern Greek, and so it appears to have occurred in other areas as well.\n\n\n"}

Few speakers are under 20 years old. The people live among the Aka (Hruso), but their language is only distantly related, with distinct words for numerals, body parts, and other basic vocabulary. The majority of Koro speakers live in bilingual households in which one or more members speak Ako or another indigenous language rather than Koro. Although it has resemblances to Tani farther to the east, it appears to be at least a separate branch of Sino-Tibetan. Researchers hypothesize it may have originated from a group of people enslaved and brought to the area.\n\nRecognition in the academic literature of Koro as a distinct language goes back at least to the 2009 edition of the \"Ethnologue\" (Lewis 2009), which based its findings on a language survey conducted in 2005. It notes that Koro has only 9 percent lexical similarity with Hruso Aka, and that it is \"highly dissimilar to neighboring languages\".\n\nIn October 2010, the \"National Geographic Daily News\" published an article corroborating the findings of the \"Ethnologue\" based on research conducted in 2008 by a linguistic team of David Harrison, Gregory Anderson, and Ganesh Murmu while documenting two Hruso languages (Aka and Miji) as part of National Geographic's \"Enduring Voices\" project. It was reported to them as a dialect of Aka, but turned out to be highly divergent.\n\nMark Post & Roger Blench (2011) propose that Koro is related to Milang in a branch, or perhaps independent family, they call Siangic.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, the primary divisions in language arts are literature and language, where language in this case refers to both linguistics, and specific languages. Language arts instruction typically consists of a combination of reading, writing (composition), speaking, and listening. In schools, language arts is taught alongside science, mathematics, and social studies.\n\nReading, by definition, is the ability and knowledge of a language that allows comprehension by grasping the meaning of written or printed characters, words, or sentences. Reading involves a wide variety of print and non-print texts that helps a reader gain an understanding of the material that is being read. Reading of texts that are often included in educational curriculum include fiction, nonfiction, classic, and also contemporary works. Reading goes beyond calling words to understanding the information presented in a written or a visual context.\n\nComposition is defined as the combination of distinct parts or elements to form a whole and the manner in which these elements are combined or related. The following are examples of composing in language arts:\n\nCompositions may also include:\n\nOration and live delivery are often key components of language arts programs. This can include through dramatic interpretation, speeches, oral interpretation of poetry, and the like.

{"id": "566381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=566381", "title": "Langues d'oïl", "text": "Langues d'oïl\n\nThe langues d'oïl ( ) or oïl languages ( ) are a dialect continuum that includes standard French and its closest autochthonous relatives historically spoken in the northern half of France, southern Belgium, and the Channel Islands. These belong to the larger Gallo-Romance languages, which also include the historical languages of east-central France and western Switzerland (Arpitania), southern France (Occitania), portions of northern Italy, and the Val d'Aran in Spain. \n\nLinguists divide the Romance languages of France, and especially of Medieval France, into three geographical subgroups: the first two are \"Langues d'oïl\" and \"occitan\", both named after their words for 'yes' (\"oïl\" and \"òc\", respectively), and the third is Franco-Provençal (Arpitan).\n\n\"Langue d'oïl\" (in the singular), \"Oïl dialects\" and \"Oïl languages\" (in the plural) designate the ancient northern Gallo-Romance languages as well as their modern-day descendants. They share many linguistic features, a prominent one being the word \"oïl\" for \"yes\". (\"Oc\" was and still is the southern word for \"yes\", hence the \"langue d'oc\" or \"Occitan languages\"). The most widely spoken modern Oïl language is French (\"oïl\" was pronounced or , which has become , in modern French \"oui\").\n\nThere are three uses of the term \"oïl\":\n\nIn the singular, Langue d'oïl refers to the mutually intelligible linguistic variants of \"lingua romana\" spoken since the 9th century in northern France and southern Belgium (Wallonia), since the 10th century in the Channel Islands, and between the 11th and 14th centuries in England (the Anglo-Norman language). \"Langue d'oïl\", the term itself, has been used in the singular since the 12th century to denote this ancient linguistic grouping as a whole. With these qualifiers, \"langue d'oïl\" sometimes is used to mean the same as Old French (see \"History\" below).\n\nIn the plural, \"Oïl dialects\" refer to the varieties of the ancient \"langue d'oïl\".\n\nIn the plural, \"Oïl languages\" refer to those modern-day descendants that evolved separately from the varieties of the ancient \"langue d'oïl\". Consequently, \"langues d'oïl\" today may apply either: to all the modern-day languages of this family \"except\" the French language; or to this family \"including\" French. \"\"Oïl\" dialects\" or \"French dialects\" are also used to refer to the \"Oïl languages except French\"—as some extant Oïl languages are very close to modern French. Because the term \"dialect\" is sometimes considered pejorative, the trend today among French linguists is to refer to these languages as \"langues d'oïl\" rather than \"dialects\".\n\nFive zones of Oïl dialects have been proposed:\n\n\nNon-standard varieties:\n\n\nGallo has a stronger Celtic substrate from Breton. Gallo originated from the oïl speech of people from eastern and northern regions: Anjou; Maine (Mayenne and Sarthe); and Normandy; who were in contact with Breton speakers in Upper Brittany. See Marches of Neustria\n\nNamed after the former provinces of Poitou and Saintonge\n\n\"For the history of phonology, orthography, syntax and morphology, see \"History of the French language\" and the relevant individual Oïl language articles.\"\n\nEach of the Oïl languages has developed in its own way from the common ancestor, and division of the development into periods varies according to the individual histories. Modern linguistics uses the following terms:\n\nIn the 9th century, \"romana lingua\" (the term used in the \"Oaths of Strasbourg\" of 842) was the first of the Romance languages to be recognized by its speakers as a distinct language, probably because it was the most different from Latin compared with the other Romance languages (see \"History of the French language\").\n\nMany of the developments that we now consider typical of Walloon appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon \"had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the thirteenth century\". In any case, linguistic texts from the time do not mention the language, even though they mention others in the Oïl family, such as Picard and Lorrain. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language \"Roman\" when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that we find the first occurrence of the word \"Walloon\" in the same linguistic sense that we use it today.\n\nBy late- or post-Roman times Vulgar Latin within France had developed two distinctive terms for signifying assent (\"yes\"): \"hoc ille\" (\"this (is) it\") and \"hoc\" (\"this\"), which became \"oïl\" and \"oc\", respectively. Subsequent development changed \"oïl\" into \"oui\", as in modern French. The term \"langue d'oïl\" itself was first used in the 12th century, referring to the Old French linguistic grouping noted above. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante mentioned the \"yes\" distinctions in his \"De vulgari eloquentia\". He wrote in Medieval Latin: \"nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil\" (\"some say 'oc', others say 'si', others say 'oïl'\")—thereby distinguishing at least three classes of Romance languages: \"oc languages\" (in southern France); \"si languages\" (in Italy and Iberia) and \"oïl languages\" (in northern France).\n\nOther Romance languages derive their word for \"yes\" from the classical Latin \"sic,\" \"thus\", such as the Italian \"sì\", Spanish and Catalan \"sí\", Portuguese \"sim\", and even French \"si\" (used when contradicting another's negative assertion). Sardinian is an exception in that its word for \"yes\", \"eja\", is from neither origin. Similarly Romanian uses \"da\" for \"yes\", which is of Slavic origin.\n\nHowever, neither \"lingua romana\" nor \"langue d'oïl\" referred, at their respective time, to a single homogeneous language but to mutually intelligible linguistic varieties. In those times, spoken languages in Western Europe were not codified (except Latin and Medieval Latin), the region's population was considerably lower than today, and population centers were more isolated from each other. As a result, mutually intelligible linguistic varieties were referred to as one language.\n\nIn the 13th century these varieties were recognized and referred to as \"dialects\" (\"idioms\") of a single language, the \"langue d'oïl\". However, since the previous centuries a common literary and juridical \"interdialectary\" langue d'oïl had emerged, a kind of koiné. In the late 13th century this common langue d'oïl was named \"French\" (\"françois\" in French, \"lingua gallica\" or \"gallicana\" in Medieval Latin). Both aspects of \"dialects of a same language\" and \"French as the common langue d'oïl\" appear in a text of Roger Bacon, \"Opus maius\", who wrote in Medieval Latin but translated thus: \"Indeed, idioms of a same language vary amongst people, as it occurs in the French language which varies in an idiomatic manner amongst the French, Picards, Normans and Burgundians. And terms right to the Picards horrify the Burgundians as much as their closer neighbours the French\".\n\nIt is from this period though that definitions of individual Oïl languages are first found. The Picard language is first referred to by name as \"langage pikart\" in 1283 in the \"Livre Roisin\". The author of the \"Vie du bienheureux Thomas Hélye de Biville\" refers to the Norman character of his writing. The \"Sermons poitevins\" of around 1250 show the Poitevin language developing as it straddled the line between oïl and oc.\n\nAs a result, in modern times the term \"langue d'oïl\" also refers to that Old French which was not as yet named \"French\" but was already—before the late 13th century—used as a literary and juridical \"interdialectary language\".\n\nThe term \"Francien\" is a linguistic neologism coined in the 19th century to name the hypothetical variant of Old French allegedly spoken by the \"late 14th century\" in the ancient province of \"Pays de France\"—the then Paris region later called \"Île-de-France\". This \"Francien\", it is claimed, became the Medieval French language. Current linguistic thinking mostly discounts the \"Francien\" theory, although it is still often quoted in popular textbooks. The term \"francien\" was never used by those people supposed to have spoken the variant; but today the term could be used to designate that specific \"10th-and-11th centuries\" variant of langue d'oïl spoken in the Paris region; both variants contributed to the koine, as both were called \"French\" at that time.\n\nFor political reasons it was in Paris and Île-de-France that this koiné developed from a written language into a spoken language. Already in the 12th century Conon de Béthune reported about the French court who blamed him for using words of Artois.\n\nBy the late 13th century the written koiné had begun to turn into a spoken and written standard language, and was named \"French\". Since then French started to be imposed on the other Oïl dialects as well as on the territories of \"langue d'oc\".\n\nHowever, the Oïl dialects and \"langue d'oc\" continued contributing to the lexis of French.\n\nIn the 16th century the French language was imposed even more by the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts to replace Latin in judgements and official acts and deeds (although the local Oïl languages had always been the language respectively spoken in justice courts). It is argued that the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts was not intended to make French a national language, merely a chancery language for law and administration. Although there were competing literary standards among the Oïl languages in the mediaeval period, the centralisation of the French kingdom and its influence even outside its formal borders sent most of the Oïl languages into comparative obscurity for several centuries. The development of literature in this new language encouraged writers to use French rather than their own regional languages. This led to the decline of vernacular literature.\n\nIt was the French Revolution which imposed French on the people as the official language in all the territory. As the influence of French (and in the Channel Islands, English) spread among sectors of provincial populations, cultural movements arose to study and standardise the vernacular languages. From the 18th century and into the 20th century, societies were founded (such as the \"Société liégoise de Littérature wallonne\" in 1856), dictionaries (such as George Métivier's \"Dictionnaire franco-normand\" of 1870) were published, groups were formed and literary movements developed to support and promote the Oïl languages faced with competition. Until the First World War, the regional languages of France were still the languages most used in the home and in the fields. This was also generally the case in areas where Oïl languages were spoken. French is now the best-known of the Oïl languages.\n\nBesides the influence of French literature, small-scale literature has survived in the other Oïl languages. Theatrical writing is most notable in Picard (which maintains a genre of vernacular marionette theatre), Poitevin and Saintongeais. Oral performance (story-telling) is a feature of Gallo, for example, while Norman and Walloon literature, especially from the early 19th century tend to focus on written texts and poetry (see, for example, \"Wace\" and \"Jèrriais literature\").\n\nAs the vernacular Oïl languages were displaced from towns, they have generally survived to a greater extent in rural areas - hence a preponderance of literature relating to rural and peasant themes. The particular circumstances of the self-governing Channel Islands developed a lively strain of political comment, and the early industrialisation in Picardy led to survival of Picard in the mines and workshops of the regions. The mining poets of Picardy may be compared with the tradition of rhyming Weaver Poets of Ulster Scots in a comparable industrial milieu.\n\nThere are some regional magazines, such as \"Ch'lanchron\" (Picard), \"Le Viquet\" (Norman), \"Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine\" (Jèrriais), and \"El Bourdon\" (Walloon), which are published either wholly in the respective Oïl language or bilingually with French. These provide a platform for literary writing.\n\nApart from French, an official language in many countries (see list), the Oïl languages have enjoyed little status in recent times.\n\nCurrently Walloon, Lorrain (under the local name of \"Gaumais\"), and Champenois have the status of regional languages of Wallonia.\n\nThe Norman languages of the Channel Islands enjoy a certain status under the governments of their Bailiwicks and within the regional and lesser-used language framework of the British-Irish Council. The Anglo-Norman language, a variant of Norman once the official language of England, today holds mostly a place of ceremonial honor in the United Kingdom (now referred to as \"Law French\").\n\nThe French government recognises the Oïl languages as languages of France, but the Constitutional Council of France barred ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nThe \"langues d'oïl\" were more or less influenced by the native languages of the conquering Germanic tribes, notably the Franks. This was apparent not so much in the vocabulary (which remained overwhelmingly of Latin origin) as in the phonology and syntax; the invading Franks, Burgundians and Normans became the rulers and their accents were imposed as standard on the rest of the population. This accounts in large part for the relative distinctiveness of French compared to other Romance languages.\nThe English language was heavily influenced by contact with Norman following the Norman Conquest and much of the adopted vocabulary shows typically Norman features.\n\nPortuguese was heavily influenced by more than a millennium of perennial contact with several dialects of both Oïl and Occitan language groups, in lexicon (up to 15–20% in some estimates, at least 5000 word roots), phonology and orthography. The influence of Occitan was, nevertheless, the most marked, through the status Provençal in particular achieved in southwestern Europe around the troubadour apex in the Middle Ages, when Galician-Portuguese lyric was developed. Aside the direct influence of Provençal literature, the presence of languages from modern-day France in the Galician-Portuguese area was also strong due to the rule of the House of Burgundy, the establishment of the Orders of Cluny and Cister, the many sections of the Way of St. James pilgrimage route that come from elsewhere in Europe out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the settlement in Iberia of people from the other side of the Pyrenees, arriving during and after the Reconquista.\n\nThe anti-Portuguese factor of Brazilian nationalism in the 19th century led to an increased use of the French language in detriment of Portuguese, as France was seen at the time as a model of civilization and progress. The learning of French has historically been important and strong among the Lusophone elites, and for a great span of time it was also the foreign language of choice among the middle class of both Portugal and Brazil, only surpassed in the globalised postmodernity by English, in both, and more recently by Spanish, in the latter.\n\nThe French spoken in Belgium shows some influence from Walloon.\n\nThe development of French in North America was influenced by the speech of settlers originating from northwestern France, many of whom introduced features of their Oïl varieties into the French they spoke.

Freud considered that \"The hostile feelings make their appearance as a rule later than the affectionate ones and behind them\"; and more frequently in same-sex than in mixed-sex analytic pairings.\n\nOtto Fenichel pointed out that whereas neurotic aggravations can follow the emergence of a negative transference, so too (paradoxically) can improvements: the patient gets better to spite the therapist for emphasising the patient's problems.\n\nMelanie Klein in her disputes with Anna Freud laid much greater emphasis than her opponent on the constructive role to be played by interpreting the negative transference. Jacques Lacan followed her theoretical lead in seeing \"the projection of what Melanie Klein calls \"bad internal objects\"\" as key to \"the negative transference that is the initial knot of the analytic drama\" - though he himself would face criticism for glossing over the negative transference in training analyses, to keep his analysands in dependence.\n\nW. R. D. Fairbairn was also more interested in the negative than the positive transference, which he saw as a key to the repetition and exposure of unconscious attachments to internalised bad objects. In his wake, object relations theorists have tended to stress the positive results that can emerge from working with the negative transference.\n\n\nDescribing the process of becoming the focus of a paranoid's hostility, C. P. Snow wrote:\n\n\"No one likes being hated: most of us are afraid of it: it jars to the bone when we meet hatred face to face.\"\n\n"}

It was also termed a blind promise or rash boon.

The first character promises to grant the other his/her love if an impossible wish is granted. Alternately, the first character could promise the second anything he/she asks for in exchange for escape from a life-or-death situation. \n\nA notable example of the first scenario is Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Franklin's Tale\", itself partly based on Boccaccio's \"The Filocolo\"; Dorigen, a married woman whose husband is absent, promises another suitor that he may have her if she makes the rocks on the coast of Brittany disappear. \n\nAn example of the second variation is found in Chaucer's \"The Wife of Bath's Tale\", where the main character, a young rapist knight threatened with execution if he cannot answer the question \"What do women want?,\" promises an older woman (the proverbial \"loathly lady\") anything she desires if she can provide the answer (she desires to marry him).\n"}

{"id": "308445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308445", "title": "Skywriting", "text": "Skywriting\n\nSkywriting is the process of using a small aircraft, able to expel special smoke during flight, to fly in certain patterns that create writing readable by someone on the ground. The message is often a frivolous phrase, a generally meaningless greeting, or an advertisement aimed at everyone in the vicinity, a general public display of celebration or goodwill, or a personal message, such as a marriage proposal or birthday wish.\n\nThe typical smoke generator consists of a pressurized container holding a low viscosity oil, such as Chevron/Texaco \"Canopus 13\", formerly \"Corvus Oil\". The oil is injected into the hot exhaust manifold, causing it to vaporize into a huge volume of dense, white smoke.\n\nWake turbulence and wind cause dispersal and shearing of the smoke causing the writing to blur and twist, usually within a few minutes. However special \"skytyping\" techniques have been developed to write in the sky in a dot-matrix fashion (a new letter every 2–5 seconds instead of every 1–2 minutes), and are legible for longer than traditional skywriting.\n\nThe beginnings of skywriting are disputed. In a 1926 letter to \"The New York Times\", Albert T. Reid wrote:\nMajor Jack Savage, former British Royal Air Force pilot and a writer for \"Flight\" magazine, had a successful skywriting fleet of Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft in England. He flew throughout the 1920s and 1930s, bringing the practice to America as well. The first recorded use of skywriting for advertising purposes was over the Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse in the United Kingdom in May 1922, when Royal Air Force Captain Cyril Turner wrote \"Daily Mail\" above the track. In the United States, the first use of skywriting in advertising followed on November 28, 1922, over New York City during a visit of Savage and Cyril Turner.\n\nHowever, commercial skywriting in the United States was developed in the early 1930s by Sid Pike, president of the Skywriting Corporation of America in 1932. One of the first major clients was Pepsi-Cola, which used skywriting to reach a mass market. A tremendous number of flights were contracted by Pepsi-Cola, with 2,225 flown in 1940. Skywriting has also been used at times by artists. Skywriter Wayne Mansfield flew for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and he appeared as a sky artist over the Biennale in Venice, Italy. Artist Vik Muniz used skywriting for his \"cloud cloud\" project.\n\nIn 1946 the Skywriting Corporation found themselves with a fleet of surplus World War II planes and developed \"dot matrix skywriting\", or skytyping. Skytyping is the process of using five planes in formation to choreograph puffs of smoke being released from each plane. The messages, written at 10,000 foot altitude, can be up to 1250 feet tall and over five miles long. Traditional skywriting letters are 3,000 feet high and take longer to write.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1662121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1662121", "title": "Sports commentator", "text": "Sports commentator\n\nIn sports broadcasting, a sports commentator (also known as sports announcer, sportscaster or play-by-play announcer) gives a running commentary of a game or event in real time, usually during a live broadcast, traditionally delivered in the historical present tense. The comments are normally a voiceover, with the sounds of the action and spectators also heard in the background. In the case of television commentary, the commentators are on screen rarely if at all during the event (although they may appear on camera at the start or near the end of the broadcast).\n\nThe \"main commentator\", also called the \"play-by-play\" announcer or commentator in North America, \"blow-by-blow\" in combat sports coverage or \"lap-by-lap\" for motorsports coverage, is the primary speaker on the broadcast. Broadcasters in this role are valued for their articulateness and for their ability to describe each play or event of an often fast-moving sporting event. The ideal play-by-play voice has a vocal timbre that is tolerable to hear over the multiple hours of a sports broadcast and yet dynamic enough to convey and enhance the importance of the in-game activity. Because of their skills, some commentators like Al Michaels in the U.S., David Coleman in the UK and Bruce McAvaney in Australia, may have careers in which they call several different sports at one time or another. Other main commentators may, however, only call one sport (Mike Emrick, for example, is known almost exclusively as an ice hockey broadcaster). The vast majority of play-by-play announcers are male; female play-by-play announcers have not seen sustained employment until the 21st century.\n\nRadio and television play-by-play techniques involve slightly different approaches; radio broadcasts typically require the play-by-play host to say more to verbally convey the on-field activity that cannot be seen by the radio audience. It is unusual to have radio and television broadcasts share the same play-by-play commentator for the same event, except in cases of low production budgets or when a broadcaster is particularly renowned (Rick Jeanneret's hockey telecasts, for example, have been simulcast on radio and television since the late 1990s).\n\nThe \"analyst or color commentator\" provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. They are usually former athletes or coaches in their respective sports, although there are some exceptions.\n\nThe term \"color\" refers to levity and insight provided by analyst. The most common format for a sports broadcast is to have an analyst/color commentator work alongside the main/play-by-play announcer. An example is \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" in the United States, which is called by color commentator Cris Collinsworth, a former American football receiver, and play-by-play commentator Al Michaels, a professional announcer. In the United Kingdom, however, there is a much less distinct division between play-by-play and color commentary, although two-man commentary teams usually feature an enthusiast with formal journalistic training but little or no competitive experience leading the commentary, and an expert former (or current) competitor following up with analysis or summary. There are however exceptions to this — most of the United Kingdom's leading cricket and snooker commentators are former professionals in their sports, while the former Formula One racing commentator Murray Walker had no formal journalistic training and only limited racing experience of his own. In the United States, George \"Pat\" Summerall, a former professional kicker, spent most of his broadcasting career as a play-by-play announcer.\n\nAlthough the combination of a play-by-play announcer and a color commentator is standard , in the past it was much more common for a broadcast to have no analysts and just have a single play-by-play announcer to work alone. Vin Scully, longtime announcer for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, was one of the few examples of this practice lasting into the 21st century until he retired in 2016.\n\nA \"sideline reporter\" assists a sports broadcasting crew with sideline coverage of the playing field or court. The sideline reporter typically makes live updates on injuries and breaking news or conducts player interviews while players are on the field or court because the play-by-play broadcaster and color commentator must remain in their broadcast booth. Sideline reporters are often granted inside information about an important update, such as injury, because they have the credentials necessary to do so. In cases of big events, teams consisting of many sideline reporters are placed strategically so that the main commentator has many sources to turn to (for example some sideline reporters could be stationed in the dressing room area while others could be between the respective team benches).\n\nIn British sports broadcasting, the \"presenter\" of a sports broadcast is usually distinct from the commentator, and often based in a remote broadcast television studio away from the sports venue. In North America, the on-air personality based in the studio is called the \"studio host\". During their shows, the presenter/studio host may be joined by additional analysts or pundits, especially when showing highlights of various other matches.\n\nVarious sports may have different commentator roles to cover situations unique to that sport. American football, for example, regularly employs \"rules analysts\" in its broadcasts; usually a former referee, a rules analyst explains penalties and controversial calls and dissects instant replay reviews to predict whether a call will or will not be overturned.\n\nIn North American English, \"sportscaster\" is a general term for any type of commentator in a sports broadcast. It may also refer to a sports talk show host or a newscaster covering sports news.\n\nIn video games, and particularly eSports, commentators are often called \"shoutcasters\"; this term is derived from the free plugin for Winamp called SHOUTcast, which enabled users to live-stream audio-only feeds across the Internet.\n\nWhile sports broadcasts took place from 1912, Florent Gibson of the \"Pittsburgh Star\" newspaper broadcast the first sports commentary in April 1921, covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny \"Hutch\" Dundee at the Motor Square Garden, Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 1975, the National Hockey League (NHL) made headlines when two coaches from the NHL All-Star Game in Montreal allowed Robin Herman and Marcel St. Cyr. access into the men's locker room. Both were believed to have been the first women ever allowed to enter a professional men's locker room to conduct a post-game interview. Sport organizations began to follow in the NHL's footsteps and allowed for other female sportswriters to be given the same access as men sportswriters.\n\nIt was not until the year 1977 when Melissa Ludtke, a sportswriter from \"Sports Illustrated\", was given the assignment to cover the New York Yankees playoff series but was denied entry into the men's locker room. Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and other officials chose to discriminate against her based on her sex. Knowing that this would put \"Sports Illustrated\" in a disadvantage from other publishers, Time Inc. and Ludtke filed a lawsuit against Kuhn.\n\nThe lawsuit was taken to the United States District Court in 1978 where Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled the act as violating the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court ruled that the Yankees organization devise a plan to protect the players of their privacy while female sportswriters conducted interviews, suggesting the use of towels.\n\nAfter the access of allowing women in was put into effect, the Yankees organization allowed reporters to spend ten minutes interviewing players and was then asked to leave and wait. Male reporters were unhappy with this and blamed the women from keeping them out and not being able to do their job. For some men they finally understood what women reporters had been dealing with.\n\nIn 1990, the issue made its way back into the headlines when Lisa Olson made a public statement revealing that players from the New England Patriots had exposed themselves while interviews were being conducted. This prompted other female reporters who had been harassed to come forward. Accusations were made that women appeared as being \"too friendly\" while performing interviews or conversing too long with players as though they were flirting. Their credibility became undermined. Thus, the issue of sexism was still present, despite the equal access to men's locker rooms.\n\nThough not always the case, in professional wrestling, the color commentator is usually a \"heel sympathizer\" (or a supporter of the \"bad guys\") as opposed to the play-by-play announcer, who is more or less the \"voice of the fans\" as well as supporters of the \"good guys\" (or babyfaces). Though both are supposed to show neutral stance while announcing, the color commentators (especially when they support heels) are usually more blatant about their stance than the play-by-play announcers. Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan pioneered the \"heel sympathizer\" for color commentary in wrestling. Jerry \"The King\" Lawler later made a successful transition into the role, though Lawler has since shown more sympathy for faces (partially due to being over with fans after nearly forty years in wrestling). In some cases, commentators are also active managers for wrestlers, usually following continuity as heels. Former Extreme Championship Wrestling color commentator Cyrus was known for having dual roles as a heel manager and a somewhat neutral commentator. Acting as a commentator has also been used to keep injured wrestlers in the public eye while recuperating. Special guest color commentators serve a two purposes: the primary is usually to place them in position to interfere with the match they are calling, the second is to provide promoters with the opportunity to determine if this performer can speak well extemproraneously.\n\n\n"}

After surface indications (e.g., pressure reaching a predetermined maximum) that a squeeze has been attained, any still-pumpable cement slurry remaining in the drill pipe or tubing ideally can be reverse circulated out before it sets.\n\nUsually the zone to be squeezed is isolated from above with a packer (and possibly from below with a bridge plug), but sometimes the squeezing pressure is applied to the entire casing string in what is known as a bradenhead squeeze, (named for an old manufacturer of casing heads).\n\nEven if a drilling rig is on location, pumping operations usually are done by a service company's cementing unit that can easily mix small batches of cement slurry, measure displacement volume accurately to spot the slurry on bottom, then pump at very low rates and high pressures during the squeeze itself, and finally measure volumes accurately again when reversing out any excess slurry. A squeeze manifold is a compact arrangement of valves and pressure gauges that allows monitoring of the drill pipe and casing pressures throughout the job, and facilitates quick switching of the pumping pressure to either side while the fluid returning from the other side of well is directed to the mud pit or a disposal pit or tank.\n\nThe generic term \"squeeze\" also can apply to injection of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure. Bullhead squeeze (or just plain bullheading) refers to pumping kill-weight mud down the casing beneath closed blowout preventers in a kick-control situation when it isn't feasible to circulate in such from bottom.\n\n"}
{"id": "478970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=478970", "title": "Standard manuscript format", "text": "Standard manuscript format\n\nStandard manuscript format is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works. Even with the advent of desktop publishing, making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally typeset, many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the \"standard\" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.\n\nAlthough publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors, style guides are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since \"virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication.\"\n\nManuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over style guides.\n\nIn general, a document with standard manuscript format will have the following features:\nOn the first page of the document, the author's name and contact information appears in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the first page, the wordcount appears.\n\nSubsequent pages only have text in the top right corner. This text includes: the author's name, a slash, an abbreviated title, another slash, and the page number.\n\nWriters can add the word count of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a query letter. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the margins are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.\n\nThe final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.\n\nPage numbers, author's name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.\n\nThere are formatting conventions for different kinds of written works, including:\n\n\n"}

He was the deputy of all convocations of the Soviet Parliament of Azerbaijan and from 1971 till 1989 he was the chairman of Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. Suleyman Rustam was not only the poet, he also was a translator and a literary man. He translated works of I.A.Krylov, A.S.Griboyedov, A.S.Pushkin, M.Y.Lermontov, N.A.Nekrasov and others into his native language. Suleyman Rustam's works were translated into many languages of the world and also into Russian.\n\nRustam worked as a chief editor of \"Edebiyyat qazeti\" (\"Literature newspaper\"). He was the laureate of many prestigious premiums of Azerbaijan and the USSR.\n\nSuleyman Rustam died on June 10, 1989 and was buried in the Alley of Honor in Baku.\n\n\nHis first collection of poems, \"From sadness to happiness\", written in 1927, was dedicated to Komsomol, civil war, courage of soldiers struggling for the Soviet power, as other poems of the poet, written in 1920's (\"Partisan Ali\", \"Armless hero\").\n\nThe main theme of his works, created in 1930's (\"Romanticism of a night\"), was the creation of romanticism of a collective work, attracting spiritual enrichment of people. \"A good comrade\" poem was dedicated to labor feats of cotton growers in Mugham steppes. In 1939-1940's, S.Rustam wrote \"Qachaq Nebi\" novel. The poet used folk proverbs about Qachaq Nebi, expanded and deepened them socially and historically, gave a social perception to the novel. Main heroes of the novel are Qachaq Nebi - a famous leader of the national movement of the 19th century and Hejer - his brave wife and fellow fighter.\n\nNebi, the son of a poor peasant, working as a farm laborer at bey, didn't bear cruelty and rudeness of his master and run to mountains and became \"qachaq\" (fugitive). He assembled dissatisfied peasants around him, vengeance for outraged people, took away money and commodities from the rich and gave them to the poor. He was supported by the whole neighborhood and courageously opposed tsar officers and gendarme and kept day-laborers in awe for a long time. And \"noble brigand\" Nebi's revolt was also collapsed as every spontaneous peasant struggle.\n\nPatriotic poems (\"A day will come\", \"To the sons of Azerbaijan\", \"Old man's answer\") written during the Great Patriotic War were dedicated to bravery and selflessness of the Soviet people, their unshakeable belief and victory over the enemy. Suleyman Rustam's \"Mother and a postman\" poem had a great fame (1942). Mother waiting for news from his front-line soldier son for four months says the postman: \"If there is not any letter for me…don't come here again!\" Disappointed postman goes away, but he is not offended, he is distressed by sufferings of the old mother. In her turn mother also regrets for her action. Finally, the postman brings a long-awaited letter and the postman and the whole neighborhood rejoices at the mother's happiness. This poem, written with a great emotional strength, deeply excites a reader and evokes his heartwarming feelings.\n\nDuring the postwar times the poet wrote a collection of poems called \"Two shores\", dedicated to hard life of Azerbaijani paupers in Iran and postwar flourishing of the Soviet Azerbaijan. Image of hero Qafur Mammadov, who shielded his commander from enemies by his chest, was created in \"Qafur's heart\" poem.\n\n\n"}
