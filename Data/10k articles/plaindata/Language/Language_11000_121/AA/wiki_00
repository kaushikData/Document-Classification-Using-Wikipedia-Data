He authored several short stories and novels in the Punjabi language including \"Sooraj Grehan\" and \"Doaba\". He received the Pride of Performance and \"Kamal-e-Fun\" awards for his literary work.\n\nMuhammad Afzal Ahsan Randhawa was born in Amritsar, Punjab, British India (now Punjab, India) on 1 September 1937. He belonged to the Randhawa Jat Family. Randhawa grew up in a rural part of the Sialkot district in Pakistan, where he was the editor of the magazine of the Mission High School. He graduated from Murray College in Sialkot. As a student, he used to be published in Daily Imroze and weekly \"Lail-o-Nahar\". Later, he got admission in the Punjab University Law College. He was the editor of the college magazine \"Al-Meezan\", while in law college. He had a love marriage with his wife Ayesha Randhawa (d. 2016), who taught at the University of Agriculture in Faisalabad. They had 4 children: one son and 3 daughters .\n\nRandhawa was a left leaning politician and a lawyer. In 1972, in a by-election he won the NA-49 seat in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad) for the National Assembly on Pakistan Peoples Party's ticket. He contributed to the framing of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan. In 1977, during the martial law of General Zia ul Haq was disqualified from taking part in politics for seven years by the 'military courts' and later in 1981, he was detained for 'living beyond his means'.\n\nRandhawa was popular among Sikh as he raised voice against 1984 Indian military Operation Bluestar on the Golden Temple. He also wrote a poem on the operation \"Navan Ghallughara\" (new Holocaust) glorifying Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as a great warrior. Hence, his works have been transcribed in Gurmukhi script and published in the Indian Punjab.\n\nIn 1986, Randhawa was awarded the Prof. Piara Singh Gill & Karam Singh Sandhu Memorial \"Antar-Rashtari Shiromani Sahitkaar/Kalakaar\" Award by the International Association of Punjabi Authors and Artists. In 1996, the President of Pakistan conferred Pride of Performance award to him. In 1999, he was bestowed upon with Kartar Singh Dhaliwal award by the Punjabi Sahit Akademi, Ludhiana.\n\nRandhawa used to participate as a guest or a panelist at different literature festivals and writing conferences in Pakistan.\nAitzaz Ahsan a prominent lawyer, in his 1996 book (reprinted in 2005) titled 'The Indus Saga', quoted six verses of Randhawa's poem to depict the Indus man.\n\nIn 2014, Randhawa was interviewed by Masood Malhi of Special Broadcasting Service. In 2015, the Pakistan Academy of Letters announced the 2013 \"Kamal-e-Fun Award\" – the highest literary award, to be presented to Randhawa along with a ₨. 500,000 prize money. In 2016, Randhawa opened the \"Lyallpur Sulekh Mela\" (Lyallpur Literary Festival) held in the Faisalabad Arts Council in Faisalabad.\n\nIn Punjabi, Randhawa had contributed four novels, four collections of short stories, six collections of poetry, one collection of TV and radio dramas and three translated versions of an African novel, one collection of African poetry and one translation of interviews of world leaders. He also wrote a collection of Urdu poetry.\n\nHis literary career began in 1961 with the publication of \"Deeva tey Darya\" – his first novel. It became the first book by a Pakistani to be published in India. He was awarded the Adamjee Prize for Literature for 1961–62 by the Pakistan Writers' Guild for his novelette \"Deeva tey Darya\" and for his second Punjabi novel \"Doaba\" in 1981–82. Randhawa's novel \"Sooraj Grehan\" published in 1984, is an exchange of letters between two lovers. His fourth novel \"Pundh\" was published in 2001.\n\nIn 1965, he published a collection of poetry \"Sheesha Aik Lashkaray Dou\"; followed by a collection of short stories \"Runn, Talwar Tay Ghora\" published in 1973. Other short story collections, include \"Randhawa Dian Kahanian\" in 1988, \"Munna Koh Lahore\" in 1989 and \"Illahi Mohar\" in 2013. Randhawa's further five poetry collections, include \"Raat Daay Char Safar\" in 1975; \"Punjab Di Var\" in 1979; \"Mitti Di Mehek\" in 1983; \"Piyali Wich Aasmaan\" in 1983; and \"Chhewaan Darya\" in 1997.\n\nHe also translated Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart as \"Tutt Bhaj\" (1986) and Gabriel García Márquez's Chronicle of a Death Foretold as \"Maut Da Roznamcha\" (1993) into Punjabi. In 2011, his collection of short stories \"Elahi Mohr Tey Doojian Kahanian\" was published.\n\nOn the evening of 18 September 2017, Randhawa died in Faisalabad, Pakistan, seventeen days after his 80th birthday. He was buried next to his son and wife in Qaim Sain Graveyard in Ghulam Muhammad Abad, Faisalabad on 20 September.\n\nOn his death, Fakhar Zaman chairman of the World Punjabi Congress, said that \"his poetry and short stories were equally trend setters and undoubtedly he was one of the very few writers who were equally popular in Pakistan and India\".\n"}

This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest.\n\nThe song is an up-tempo number, with many influences from African and flamenco music. The lyrics explain that \"There is a way/To understand without a language\", in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier.\n\nThe title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest, with the official CD of entries titling the track \"Amanbanda\" (with an \"n\" instead of an \"m\"). BBC commentary referred to the song as \"Amamdangda\" briefly, as well as describing the group as \"a mother and her two daughters\", which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters, though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners.\n\nAs the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final.

{"id": "247171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247171", "title": "Biphobia", "text": "Biphobia\n\nBiphobia is aversion toward bisexuality and toward bisexual people as a social group or as individuals. It can take the form of denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia.\n\n\"Biphobia\" is a portmanteau word patterned on the term \"homophobia\". It derives from the English neo-classical prefix \"bi-\" (meaning \"two\") from \"bisexual\" and the root \"-phobia\" (from the , \"phóbos\", \"fear\") found in \"homophobia\". Along with \"transphobia\" and \"homophobia\", it is one of a family of terms used to describe intolerance and discrimination against LGBT people. The adjectival form \"biphobic\" describes things or qualities related to biphobia, and the less-common noun \"biphobe\" is a label for people thought to harbor biphobia.\n\n\"Biphobia\" need not be a phobia as defined in clinical psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of \"xenophobia\".\n\nBiphobia can lead people to deny that bisexuality is \"real\", asserting that people who \"identify\" as bisexual are not \"genuinely\" bisexual, or that the phenomenon is far less common than they claim. One form of this denial is based on the heterosexist view that heterosexuality is the only true or natural sexual orientation. Thus anything that deviates from that is instead either a psychological pathology or an example of anti-social behavior. In these instances, homophobia and biphobia are largely the same.\n\nAnother form of denial stems from binary views of sexuality: that people are assumed monosexual, i.e. exclusively homosexual (gay/lesbian) or heterosexual (straight). Throughout the 1980s, modern research on sexuality was dominated by the idea that heterosexuality and homosexuality were the only legitimate orientations, dismissing bisexuality as \"secondary homosexuality\". In that model, bisexuals are presumed to be either closeted lesbian/gay people wishing to appear heterosexual, or individuals (of \"either\" orientation) experimenting with sexuality outside of their \"normal\" interest. Maxims such as \"people are either gay, straight, or lying\" embody this dichotomous view of sexual orientation.\n\nSome people accept the theoretical existence of bisexuality but define it narrowly, as being only the \"equal\" attraction towards both men and women. Thus the many bisexual individuals with unequal attractions are instead categorized as either homosexual or heterosexual. Others acknowledge the existence of bisexuality in women, but deny that men can be bisexual.\n\nSome denial asserts that bisexual behavior or identity is merely a social trend – as exemplified by \"bisexual chic\" or gender bending – and not an intrinsic personality trait. Same-gender sexual activity is dismissed as merely a substitute for sex with members of the opposite sex, or as a more accessible source of sexual gratification. Situational homosexuality in sex-segregated environments is presented as an example of this behavior.\n\nBiphobia is common from the heterosexual community, but is frequently exhibited by gay and lesbian people as well, usually with the notion that bisexuals are able to escape oppression from heterosexuals by conforming to social expectations of opposite-gender sex and romance. This leaves some that identify as bisexual to be perceived as \"not enough of either\" or \"not real.\" An Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 established that bisexual people faced microaggressions, bullying, and other anti-social behaviors from people within the lesbian and gay community.\n\nBisexual erasure (also referred to as \"bisexual invisibility\") is a phenomenon that tends to omit, falsify, or re-explain evidence of bisexuality in history, academia, the news media, and other primary sources, sometimes to the point of denying that bisexuality exists.\n\nOne cause of biphobia in the gay male community is that there is an identity political tradition to assume that acceptance of male homosexuality is linked to the belief that men's sexuality is specialized. This causes many members of the gay male community to assume that the very idea that men can be bisexual is homophobic to gay men. A number of bisexual men feel that such attitudes force them to keep their bisexuality in the closet and that it is even more oppressive than traditional heteronormativity. These men argue that the gay male community have something to learn about respect for the individual from the lesbian community, in which there is not a strong tradition to assume links between notions about the origins of sexual preferences and the acceptance thereof. These views are also supported by some gay men who do not like anal sex (sides, as opposed to both tops and bottoms) and report that they feel bullied by other gay men's assumption that their dislike for anal sex is \"homophobic\" and want more respect for the individuality in which a gay man who does not hate himself may simply not like anal sex and instead prefer other sex acts such as mutual fellatio and mutual male masturbation.\n\nSome forms of prejudice against bisexuals are claims that bisexuality is an attempt in persecuted homosexuals to adapt to heteronormative societies by adopting a bisexual identity. Such claims are criticized by bisexuals and researchers studying the situation of bisexuals for falsely assuming that same-sex relationships would somehow escape persecution in heteronormative cultures by simply identifying as bisexual instead of homosexual. These researchers cite that all countries with laws against sex between people of the same sex give the same punishment regardless of what sexual orientation the people found guilty identify as, that any countries where same-sex marriage is illegal never allow marriages between people of the same sex no matter if they identify as bisexual instead of homosexual, and that laws against \"gay\" male blood donors invariably prohibit any man who had sex with other men from donating blood no matter if he identifies as homosexual or as bisexual. The conclusion made by these researchers is that since there is no societal benefit in identifying as bisexual instead of identifying as homosexual, the claim that bisexuals are homosexuals trying to adapt to a heteronormative society is simply false and biphobic and causes bisexuals to suffer a two-way discrimination from both LGBT society and heteronormative society that is worse than the one-way discrimination from heteronormative society that is faced by homosexuals. It is also argue that such two-way discrimination causes many bisexuals to hide their bisexuality to an even greater extent than homosexuals hide their sexuality, leading to underestimations of the prevalence of bisexuality especially in men for whom such assumptions of \"really being completely gay\" are the most rampant.\n\nMany stereotypes about people who identify as bisexual stem from denial or bisexual erasure. Because their orientation is not recognized as valid, they are stereotyped as confused, indecisive, insecure, experimenting, or \"just going through a phase\".\n\nThe association of bisexuality with promiscuity stems from a variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women, or only with one person at a time is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural assumptions that \"men and women are so different that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other\" (\"a defining feature of heterosexism\"), and that \"verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire.\"\n\nAs a result, bisexuals bear a social stigma from accusations of cheating on or betraying their partners, leading a double life, being \"on the down-low\", and spreading sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This presumed behavior is further generalized as dishonesty, secrecy, and deception. Bisexuals can be characterized as being \"slutty\", \"easy\", indiscriminate, and nymphomaniacs. Furthermore, they are strongly associated with polyamory, swinging, and polygamy, the last being an established heterosexual tradition sanctioned by some religions and legal in several countries. This is despite the fact that bisexual people are as capable of monogamy or serial monogamy as homosexuals or heterosexuals.\n\nThe mental and sexual health effects of biphobia on bisexual people are numerous. Studies show that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity. This often leads to recognized indicators of mental health issues such as low self-esteem and self-worth. These indicators and pressures to \"choose\" a sexual identity can, in many cases, lead to depression as they may feel they live in a culture that does not recognize their existence.\n\nWhile doing research on women at high-risk of HIV infection, one study, from the \"Journal of Bisexuality,\" concluded that bisexual women in the high-risk cohort studied were more likely to engage in various high risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.\n\nBisexual-identified people may face disparities in harsher degrees than their gay and lesbian peers. In the U.S. in particular, for example, they may face:\n\n\nFeminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism.\n\nA bisexual woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine \"Common Lives/Lesbian Lives\", alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.\n\nA number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were \"deluded and desperate.\" However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.\n\nNevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a \"fashionable trend\" being promoted due to \"sexual hedonism\" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.\n\nLesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in \"The Lesbian Heresy\" (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to sexually harass women, bisexual men are just as likely to be bothersome to women as heterosexual men.\n\nDonna Haraway was the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" which was reprinted in \"Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature\" (1991). Haraway's essay states that the cyborg \"has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.\" However, the book \"Feminist Essays\" (2017) by Nancy Quinn Collins states that in the opinion of its author this \"is wrong because bisexuality is a sexual orientation, a harmless attraction some people simply have, not something they try to have or do in order to create organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity. Therefore, I [the author] would say that cyborgs can be bisexual, and cyberfeminism can and should be accepting of bisexuality.\"\n\nWhile the general bisexual population as a whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, \"Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective\", Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the way in which the brands within a company’s portfolio are related to, and differentiated from, one another. The architecture should define the different leagues of branding within the organization; how the corporate brand and sub-brands relate to and support each other; and how the sub-brands reflect or reinforce the core purpose of the corporate brand to which they belong. Often, decisions about brand architecture are concerned with how to manage a parent brand, and a family of sub-brands – managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using brand valuation model techniques.\n\nBrand architecture may be defined as an integrated process of brand building through establishing brand relationships among branding options in the competitive environment. The brand architecture of an organization at any time is, in large measure, a legacy of past management decisions as well as the competitive realities it faces in the marketplace.\n\nThere are three key levels of branding:\n\n\nProcter & Gamble is quoted by many authors as the antithesis of a corporate brand (Asberg and Uggla, Muzellec and Lambkin, Olins). \"However, this situation changed in 2012. After more than 150 years of invisibility of the organization for consumer, the brand developed corporate brand promise during the 2012 Olympic games. Commercials are aired on television around a message thanking all the \"moms\". In addition, each of their products is associated with the brand \"PG\" in advertisements for products.\n\nA recent example of brand architecture in action is the reorganization of the General Motors brand portfolio to reflect its new strategy. Prior to bankruptcy, the company pursued a corporate-endorsed hybrid brand architecture structure, where GM underpinned every brand. The practice of putting the \"GM Mark of Excellence\" on every car, no matter what the brand, was discontinued in August, 2009. In the run-up to the IPO, the company adopted a multiple brand corporate invisible brand architecture structure. The company's familiar square blue \"badge\" has been removed from the Web site and advertising, in favor of a new, subtle all-text logo treatment.\n\nAmbassador Brands\nThose brands that reflect the image of the company are Ambassador Brands. Success or Failure of these brands affect the favorable or unfavorable opinion respectively, of the company.\nE.g.: Colgate toothpaste, the market leader in toothpaste segment in India, can be rightly called Ambassador brand.\n\nPiggyback Brands\nThe nature of these brands is to live on other brands. They are not profit generators but build their image and gain mileage by riding on the back of these brands.\nE.g.: Colgate toothbrush is a piggyback brand which survives on the back of Colgate Toothpaste.\n\nBudget Brands\nThese brands signify those that are welcomed in every home. They do not lower the status of the upper-middle-class families as well as are affordable by the lower-class homes too.\nE.g.: Cibaca toothpaste can be described as budget brand which is mainly targeted in rural areas of India.\n\nStructuring a company brand portfolio can involve choosing a strategy based upon a number of variables, including the business strategy, market trends, competitive tactics, and sources of growth and profit. Often marketing mix modeling is used to help understand the role of brands in a portfolio, and how they support or cannibalize one another. A strong parent brand can be leveraged across multiple sub-brands to help maximize Return on Marketing Investment. Managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using brand valuation model techniques.\n\nIn the UK, the term \"brand architect\" is sometimes used, but it is worth noting that the title architect is a legally protected title controlled by the Architects Registration Board.\n"}

A \"changed\" tone is the tone of the word when it is read in a particular lexical or grammatical context, while the base (or underlying) tone is usually the tone of the word when read in citation. It is thus distinct from tone sandhi, which are automatic modifications of tone created by their phonetic environment, without regard to meaning. In its most common form, it occurs on the final syllable of either a compound word, a reduplicated word, or certain vocative examples, especially in direct address to people such as family members. There are a limited set of semantic domains where changed tone occurs, generally associated with small things, familiarity, food and disease. \n\nA changed tone usually takes the form of a non-high level, non-mid rising tone (i.e. tones 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Jyutping and Yale; see Cantonese phonology for further information on the tones in Cantonese) transforming into a mid-rising tone (tone 2); for some speakers, this changed tone is slightly lower than the citation mid-rising tone. For speakers with the high falling tone, this may also become the high level tone via the same process. In many speakers, another form of a changed tone used in specific vocatives that may also result in a high level tone (tone 1), rather than in a mid-level tone.\n\nTaishanese also exhibits changed tones. It is realized in some cases as an additional high floating tone to end of the mid level, low level, mid falling and low falling tones; this results in new contours for Taishanese, namely mid rising, low rising, mid dipping and low dipping respectively. The final pitch of these changed tones may be even higher in pitch than the citation high level tone. Another changed tone occurs where the expected tone is replaced by the low falling tone. These two are combined in certain cases, with the result that the expected tone is replaced by the low dipping tone, such as the change of the verb 刷 /tʃat˧/ \"to brush\" into the noun 刷 /tʃat˨˩˥/ \"a brush\". \n\nThe use of a high rising tone in marking changed tone in many Yue varieties of Chinese implies one possible origin in diminutive morphemes, much in the same way that erhua functions in Standard Mandarin and in the Beijing dialect. In Cantonese, several diminutive morphemes have been proposed as the original one, among them 兒 /jiː˥/ \"son\" (in its high level tone form) and 子 /t͡siː˧˥/ \"child\". Thus the changed tone is the relic of this contraction of the main syllable with this diminutive.\n\n"}

(Sometimes the terms diachronic linguistics and synchronic linguistics are used to refer to these two perspectives.) \n\nContrastive linguistics, since its inception by Robert Lado in the 1950s, has often been linked to aspects of applied linguistics, e.g., to avoid interference errors in foreign-language learning, as advocated by Di Pietro (1971) (see also contrastive analysis), to assist interlingual transfer in the process of translating texts from one language into another, as demonstrated by Vinay & Darbelnet (1958) and more recently by Hatim (1997) (see translation), and to find lexical equivalents in the process of compiling bilingual dictionaries, as illustrated by Heltai (1988) and Hartmann (1991) (see bilingual lexicography). \n\nContrastive descriptions can occur at every level of linguistic structure: speech sounds (phonology), written symbols (orthography), word-formation (morphology), word meaning (lexicology), collocation (phraseology), sentence structure (syntax) and complete discourse (textology). Various techniques used in corpus linguistics have been shown to be relevant in intralingual and interlingual contrastive studies, e.g. by 'parallel-text' analysis (Hartmann 1997).\n\nContrastive linguistic studies can also be applied to the differential description of one or more varieties within a language, such as styles (contrastive rhetoric), dialects, registers or terminologies of technical genres.\n\n\n"}

This is not because of muscle weakness or paralysis. The brain has problems planning to move the body parts (e.g., lips, jaw, tongue) needed for speech. The child knows what they want to say, but their brain has difficulty coordinating the muscle movements necessary to say those words. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown. Some observations suggest a genetic cause of DVD, as many with the disorder have a family history of communication disorders. There is no cure for DVD, but with appropriate, intensive intervention, people with this motor speech disorder can improve significantly.\n\nThere are three significant features that differentiate DVD/CAS from other childhood speech sound disorders. These features are:\n\nEven though DVD/CAS is a \"developmental\" disorder, it will not simply disappear when children grow older. Children with this disorder do not follow typical patterns of language acquisition and will need treatment in order to make progress.\n\nDVD/CAS is a motor disorder, which means that the problem is located in the brain and its signals, and not in the mouth. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Possible causes include genetic syndromes and disorders.\n\nRecent research has focused on the significance of the FOXP2 gene in both species and individual development.\nResearch regarding the KE family, where half the members of the extended family, over three generations, exhibited heritable developmental verbal dyspraxia, were found to have a defective copy of the FOXP2 gene. and further studies suggest that the FOXP2 gene as well as other genetic issues could explain DVD/CAS. including 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.\n\nNew research suggests a role for the sodium channel SCN3A in the development of the perisylvian areas, which maintain key language circuits- Broca and Wernicke Area. Patients with mutations in SCN3A had oral-motor speech disorders . \n\nBirth/prenatal injuries, as well as stroke, can also be causes of DVD/CAS. Furthermore, DVD/CAS can occur as a secondary characteristic to a variety of other conditions. These include autism, some forms of epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, galactosemia, and chromosome translocations involving duplications or deletions.\n\nDevelopmental verbal dyspraxia can be diagnosed by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves tasks such as pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves an examination of the mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. Tests such as the Kaufman Speech Praxis test, a more formal examination, are also used in diagnosis.\nA differential diagnosis of DVD/CAS is often not possible for children under the age of 2 years old. Even when children are between 2–3 years, a clear diagnosis cannot always occur, because at this age, they may still be unable to focus on, or cooperate with, diagnostic testing.\n\nThere is no cure for DVD/CAS, but with appropriate, intensive intervention, people with the disorder can improve significantly.\n\nDVD/CAS requires various forms of therapy which varies with the individual needs of the patient. Typically, treatment involves one-on-one therapy with a speech language pathologist (SLP). In children with DVD/CAS, consistency is a key element in treatment. Consistency in the form of communication, as well as the development and use of oral communication are extremely important in aiding a child's speech learning process.\n\nMany therapy approaches are not supported by thorough evidence; however, the aspects of treatment that do seem to be agreed upon are the following:\n\nAlthough these aspects of treatment are supported by much clinical documentation, they lack evidence from systematic research studies. In ASHA's position statement on DVD/CAS, ASHA states there is a critical need for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and programmatic research on the neural substrates, behavioral correlates, and treatment options for DVD/CAS.\n\nOne technique that is frequently used to treat DVD/CAS is integral stimulation. Integral stimulation is based on cognitive motor learning, focusing on the cognitive motor planning needed for the complex motor task of speech. It is often referred to as the \"watch me, listen, do as I do\" approach and is founded on a multi-step hierarchy of strategies for treatment. This hierarchy of strategies allows the clinician to alter treatment depending upon the needs of the child. It uses various modalities of presentation, emphasizing the auditory and visual modes. Experts suggest that extensive practice and experience with the new material is key, so hundreds of target stimuli should be elicited in a single session. Furthermore, distributed (shorter, but more frequent) and random treatment, which mix target and non-target utterances, produces greater overall learning.\n\nThe 6 steps of the hierarchy upon which integral stimulation therapy for children is loosely organized are:\"\n\nAnother treatment strategy that has been shown to have positive effects is an integrated phonological approach. This approach \"incorporates targeted speech production practice into phonological awareness activities and uses letters and phonological cues to prompt speech production\". McNeill, Gillon, & Dodd studied 12 children ages 4–7 with DVD/CAS who were treated with this approach 2x a week for two 6-week blocks of time (separated by a 6-week withdrawal block). They found positive effects for most of the children in the areas of speech production, phonological awareness, word decoding, letter knowledge, and spelling. These results show that it is clinically productive to target speech production, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, spelling, and reading all at once. This is particularly important since children with DVD/CAS often have continuous problems with reading and spelling, even if their production of speech improves.\n\n"}

In addition, a special postal marking may note the disinfection process.\n\nThe process did not necessarily have a scientific basis; the practice dates from before an understanding of the cause of contagious diseases, and the fumigant was as likely to be based on folklore. For instance, in the Middle Ages Mediterranean ports such as Venice would smoke received covers or douse them with vinegar.\n\nThe cholera pandemics of the early 19th century led to widespread treatment of mail, although the concern had died down by the 1840s. Mail from the tropics, particularly Hawaii, was treated against yellow fever. Following the 1898 war in Cuba, the US military government in occupation instigated several policies to reduce the endemic yellow fever problem including disinfection of mail. In the 20th century some mail was heat-treated to prevent the spread of smallpox.\n\nMost countries have instituted mail fumigation at one point or another, and investigation of the specific incidents is an active area for postal history; the Disinfected Mail Study Circle publishes about 300 pages of original research each year in its journal \"Pratique\".\n\nAn instance of double disinfection took place in 1900 with the fumigation with sulphur dioxide of mail from the leper settlement of the island of Molokai and the mail was further fumigated with formaldehyde when it was received in Honolulu. However no instance of infection of post office employee was recorded even though they had handled such non-disinfected leper mail for years.\n\nIrradiated mail is a form of disinfected mail adopted in the United States, in response to the 2001 anthrax attacks.\n\n"}

{"id": "42677739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42677739", "title": "Dothraki language", "text": "Dothraki language\n\nThe Dothraki language is a constructed fictional language in George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\", where it is spoken by the Dothraki, nomadic inhabitants of the Dothraki Sea. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J. Peterson, working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin's novels.\n\n, the language comprised 3163 words, not all of which have been made public. In 2012, 146 newborn girls in the United States were named \"Khaleesi\", the Dothraki term for the wife of a \"khal\" or ruler, and the title adopted in the series by Daenerys Targaryen. Dothraki and Valyrian have been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\n\nThe Dothraki vocabulary was created by David J. Peterson well in advance of the adaptation. HBO hired the Language Creation Society to create the language, and after an application process involving over thirty conlangers, David Peterson was chosen to develop the Dothraki language. He delivered over 1700 words to HBO before the initial shooting. Peterson drew inspiration from George R. R. Martin’s description of the language, as well as from such languages as Turkish, Russian, Estonian, Inuktitut and Swahili.\n\nDavid J. Peterson and his development of the Dothraki language were featured on an April 8, 2012 episode of CNN's \"The Next List\". He went on to create the Valyrian languages for season 3 of \"Game of Thrones\". Peterson and his development of Dothraki were also featured on the January 8, 2017 episode of \"To Tell the Truth\".\n\nThe Dothraki language was developed under two significant constraints. First, the language had to match the uses already put down in the books. Secondly, it had to be easily pronounceable or learnable by the actors. These two constraints influenced the grammar and phonology of the language: for instance, as in English, there is no contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops.\n\nDavid Peterson has said, \"You know, most people probably don't really know what Arabic actually sounds like, so to an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic. To someone who knows Arabic, it doesn't. I tend to think of the sound as a mix between Arabic (minus the distinctive pharyngeals) and Spanish, due to the dental consonants.\"\n\nRegarding the orthography, the Dothraki themselves do not have a writing system—nor do many of the surrounding peoples (e.g. the Lhazareen). If there were to be any written examples of Dothraki in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" universe, it would be in a writing system developed in the Free Cities and adapted to Dothraki, or in some place like Ghis or Qarth, which do have writing systems.\n\nThere are twenty-three consonant phonemes in the Dothraki language. Here the romanized form is given on the left, and the IPA in brackets.\n\nThe letters \"c\" and \"x\" never appear in Dothraki, although \"c\" appears in the digraph \"ch\". \n\n\"b\" and \"p\" seem to appear only in names, as in \"Bharbo\" and \"Pono\". These consonants were used in the past but have since developed into [f] and [v]. They can still be used as variants of [f] and [v].\n\nVoiceless stops may be aspirated. This does not change word meaning.\n\nThe geminates of consonants marked with digraphs have a reduced orthography:\n\nDothraki has a four vowel system shown below:\n\nThere are no diphthongs.\n\nIn the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" books, \"u\" never occurs as a vowel, appearing only after \"q\", and only in names, as in \"Jhiqui\" and \"Quaro\".\n\nIn sequence of multiple vowels, each such vowel represents a separate syllable. Examples: \"shierak\" - \"star\", \"rhaesh\" - \"country\", \"khaleesi\" - \"queen\".\n\nThe vowels /i, e, o, a/ turn into [e, ɛ, ɔ, ɑ] after /q/. /o/ turns into [ɤ] after dental consonants. /o/ can be pronounced as [u] after [g], [k] and [x].\n\nThough prepositions are also sometimes employed, the language is foremost inflectional. Prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes are all used. Verbs conjugate in infinitive, past, present, future, two imperatives and (archaic) participle; they also agree with person, number and polarity. Nouns divide into two classes, inanimate and animate. They decline in five cases, nominative, accusative, genitive, allative and ablative. Animate nouns also decline according to number.\n\nBasic word order is SVO (subject–verb–object). In a basic sentence, the order of these elements (when all three are present) is as in English: First comes the subject (S), then comes the verb (V), then comes the object (O).\n\nWhen only a subject is present, the subject precedes the verb, as it does in English:\n\nIn noun phrases there is a specific order as well. The order is as follows: demonstrative, noun, adverb, adjective, genitive noun, prepositional phrase. Prepositions always precede their noun complements. but adjectives, possessor and prepositional phrases all follow the noun:\n\nAdverbs normally are sentence final, but they can also immediately follow the verb. Modal particles precede the verb.\n\nIn the episode \"Andy's Ancestry\" from the United States television show \"The Office\", Dwight Schrute created the Dothraki phrase \"throat rip\" by placing \"throat\" in front to make it the accusative. David J. Peterson adapted that language technique and called it the \"Schrutean compound\".\n\n"}

She was an internationally renowned expert and leading researcher in child language acquisition, psycholinguistics, and the neurological bases of language, and she authored 10 books and over 200 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on these subjects. Bates was well known for her assertion that linguistic knowledge is distributed throughout the brain and is subserved by general cognitive and neurological processes.\n\nElizabeth Bates earned a B.A. from St. Louis University in 1968, and an M.A. and PhD in human development from the University of Chicago in 1971 and 1974, respectively.\n\nShe was employed as a tenure-track professor at the University of Colorado from 1974-1981 before joining the faculty of the University of California, San Diego, where she worked until 2003.Bates was one of the founders of the Department of Cognitive Science at UCSD, the first department of its kind in the USA. She was also the director of the UCSD Center of Research in Language and the co-director of the San Diego State University/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Language and Communication Disorders. Bates also served as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1976-1977 and at the National Research Council Institute of Psychology in Rome.\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Elizabeth Bates died, after a year-long struggle with pancreatic cancer. Over the course of more than thirty years, Bates established herself as a world leader in a number of fields – child development, language acquisition, aphasia research, cross-linguistic research, and adult psycho linguistics. The Elizabeth Bates Graduate Research Fund was established at UCSD in her memory to assist graduate students' research. She is survived by her husband and daughter, George and Julia Carnevale.\n\nElizabeth Bates was a pioneer and lead linguist studying how the brain processes language. More specifically, Bates made significant contributions towards the fields of child language acquisition, cross-linguistic language processing, and aphasia, investigating the cognitive, neural, and social linguistic factors subserving these processes. With Brian MacWhinney, Bates developed a model of language processing called the competition model, which views language acquisition as an emergentist phenomenon that results from competition between lexical items, phonological forms, and syntactic patterns, accounting for language processing on the synchronic, ontogenetic, and phylogenetic time scales. She was a main proponent of the functionalist view of grammar, in that communication is the main force that drives language's natural forms. This view provides support for Bate's widely known perspective: the brain does not use specialized linguistic centers, but instead employs general cognitive abilities in order to solve a communicative conundrum. Much of her research provided evidence towards the core principles of empiricism and against the nativist school of thought, which made her a major player in the East Pole-West Pole divide of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.\nIn defense of communication functioning as a main force of language acquisition, she looked to the prelinguistic use of commands by infants that required them to develop and use social skills. She highlighted the reliance on pointing by infants in order to fill their need to communicate before they are able to speak. The child's ability to incorporate imperatives in their gestures in order to make a command or request was found in her research and shows the necessity of communication regardless of language. Bates also coined the term , a word-like utterance made by prelinguistic children that has meaning (e.g. yumyum), but does not represent the adult-like form.\n\nWhen discussing the time period where children begin to speak, Bates received a lot of attention for finding an overwhelming amount of nouns within the first 50 words of a native English speaker's vocabulary. Bates helped settle an ongoing debate among linguists who argued that a referential language style, characterized by the child's first 50 words containing mostly object labels, was a better strategy in developing language than a personal and socially expressive language style. She found that regardless of the strategy applied by the child, they learn words at the same rate. She did, however, find strong predictive power in the child’s vocabulary at 13 and 20 months old and their grammatical complexity at 2 years old. Bates finds that language learning comes from the neural plasticity in the brain; therefore, children can and are able to learn a language, even with brain trauma. \nResearch in her lab also showed that adult aphasic patients' deficits were not specific to linguistic structures theorized to be localized to specific brain areas, nor were they restricted to the linguistic domain. Lesion sites overlap in the role that they affect speech fluency and complexity. Language is dependent upon basic cognitive processes such as memory, pattern recognition, and spreading activation. This perspective runs counter to the theory of Noam Chomsky, Eric Lenneberg, and Steven Pinker that language is a special stimulus that is processed by specific language modules in the mind such as the localization to the Broca's and Wernicke's areas.\n\nThrough her research, Bates demonstrated that neural plasticity allows children with damage to the right hemisphere or the left hemisphere to learn and apply language within a normal range of use. However, when children are matched in age, sex and socioeconomic status, their use is lower than that of children who did not suffer brain damage. The same study presented evidence that brain damage has permanent consequences on language use when incurred as an adult. In a comparative study on the Origins of Language Disorders, Bates found that the period between 0 to 5 years of age was important to the argument of neural plasticity as this suggests that reorganization in response to an injury occurs during this period. However, there are limits to brain plasticity. Despite the area that is damaged, whether it be right-frontal or left-frontal, it increases the risk for expressive language delay within 19 months to 30 months. This suggests that the left-frontal area isn't a unique region that encourages normal language development.\n\n\n\n"}

Often such words or phrases are regarded as profanity or \"bad language\", though there are also inoffensive expletive attributives. The word is derived from the Latin verb \"explere\", meaning \"to fill\", and it was originally introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of padding.\n\n\"Expletive\" comes from the Latin verb \"explere\", meaning \"to fill\", via \"expletivus\", \"filling out\". It was introduced into English in the seventeenth century for various kinds of padding—the padding out of a book with peripheral material, the addition of syllables to a line of poetry for metrical purposes, and so forth. Use of \"expletive\" for such a meaning is now rare. Rather, \"expletive\" is a linguistics term for a meaningless word filling a syntactic vacancy. Outside linguistics, the word is commonly used to refer to \"bad language\" or profanity. Some linguists use it as shorthand for \"expletive attributive\".\n\nThere are a large number of attributive adjectives and adverbs in English that function as expletives, indicating a speaker's anger, irritation, or in some cases strong approval or other emotion, without otherwise modifying the meaning of the phrase in which they occur.\n\nAn example of an expletive attributive is the word \"bloody\" as used in the following sentences.\n\nAn expletive attributive is an intensifier. Unlike other adjective or adverb usage, \"bloody\" or \"bloody well\" in these sentences do not modify the meaning of \"miracle\", \"good meal\", or \"make it happen\". The expletive attributives here suggest that the speaker feels strongly about the proposition being expressed.\n\nOther vulgar words may also be used in this way.\n\n\"Goddamn\", \"fucking\", and \"motherfucking\" do not contribute anything to the meaning. Rather, they suggest the strength of feeling of the speaker.\n\nOther words that are never thought of as offensive can be used in similar ways. For example:\n\nThe phone line discussed may (before it was cut off) have been just as good as any other, and therefore would not have been \"wretched\" in the literal senses of \"extremely shoddy\", \"devoid of hope\" or similar. Rather, \"wretched\" serves here as a politer equivalent of expletive \"bloody\" and the like.\n\nIn English, an expletive attributive can be infixed (inserted within another word, for \"un-bloody-believable\", etc.)\n"}

On his arrival in France he wrote \"Farewell to Ireland\", and upon hearing of the Flight of the Earls wrote \"Lament on the Sad State of Ireland\". After obtaining the degree of Doctor of Divinity at the University of Bordeaux he returned about 1610 to Ireland and was appointed to the cure of souls at Uachtar Achaidh in the parish of Knockgraffan, near Cahir, where he put a stop to the then-common practice of delaying Mass until the neighbouring gentry arrived.\n\nHis major work, \"Foras Feasa ar Éirinn\" (\"Foundation of Knowledge on Ireland\", more usually translated \"History of Ireland\"), was written in Early Modern Irish and completed ca. 1634.\n\nThe \"Foras Feasa\" traced the history of Ireland from the creation of the world to the invasion of the Normans in the 12th century, based on the rich native historical and pseudohistorical traditions (including that of the Milesians), historical poetry, annals and ecclesiastical records. The \"Foras Feasa\" circulated in manuscript, as Ireland's English administration would not give authority to have it printed because of its pro-Catholic arguments. It was a time of religious repression; in 1634 a political campaign for a general reform of anti-Catholic laws, known as the Graces, was denied by the viceroy. \n\nHaving Old English ancestry, Keating held the political view that Ireland's nobility and natural leadership derived from the surviving Gaelic clan chiefs and Old English landed families who had remained Catholic. He accepted the Stuart dynasty as legitimate. This had a continuing influence on the politics of the Confederate and Jacobite supporters in Ireland until Papal recognition of the Stuarts ended in 1766. Keating continued to influence Irish genealogical writers such as John O'Hart into the 1800s. \n\n\n"}

His later stories were published in \"Preetlari\", edited by Gurbaksh Singh. His major work, \"Marhi Da Deeva\", established his reputation as a novelist. Singh wrote four different versions of the novel over the course of four years, before he decided to publish the fourth and final one in 1964. The various characters Singh portrayed in the novel were recreations of real-life people woven into a fictitious storyline. It was translated into English by Sahitya Akademi as \"The Last Flicker\".\n\nSingh's other notable works included the novels \"Anhoe\" (1966), \"Addh Chanani Raat\" (1972), \"Anhe Ghore Da Daan\" (1976) and \"Parsa\" (1991); collections of short stories, including \"Saggi Phull\" (1962), \"Kutta Te Aadmi\" (1971), \"Begana Pind\" (1985) and \"Kareer Di Dhingri\" (1991); and autobiographies \"Neean Mattiyan\" (1999) and \"Dojee Dehi\" (2000) published in two parts. The novels \"Addh Chanani Raat\" and \"Parsa\" have been translated into English as \"Night of the Half Moon\" (published by Macmillan) and \"Parsa\" by the National Book Trust, respectively.\n\nSingh's favourite works included Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\", Irving Stone's \"Lust for Life\", John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes Of Wrath\", Phanishwar Nath Renu's \"Maila Anchal\", Prem Chand's \"Godaan\" and Yashpal's \"Divya\".\n\nSingh received various awards over the course of his life, including the Sahitya Akademi Award in Punjabi in 1975 for the novel \"Adh Chanani Raat\", the Soviet Land Nehru Award in 1986, the Bhai Veer Singh Fiction Award in 1992, the Shiromani Sahitkar Award in 1992, the Jnanpith Award in 1999 and the Padma Shri in 1998. He shared the Jnanpith Award with Hindi language author Nirmal Verma.\n\nSingh suffered from a heart attack earlier in 2016 after which he was partially paralysed. On 13 August 2016 he fell unconscious at his home in Jaitu and was admitted into a private hospital at Bathinda where he was kept on ventilator support. He died on 16 August 2016, when he was taken off life support systems, after it was determined that Singh had shown no signs of recovery. He is survived by his wife, Balwant Kaur, a son and two daughters.\n\nSingh has published various novels, short story collections, plays, children's literature and also an autobiography in two parts.\n"}

In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing biodiversity. Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting natural resources for industrial production and urbanization. Clearing habitats for agriculture is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include mining, logging, trawling, and urban sprawl. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species extinction worldwide. It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by habitat fragmentation, geological processes, climate change or by human activities such as the introduction of invasive species, ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.\n\nThe terms habitat loss and habitat reduction are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as water and noise pollution.\n\nIn the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and extinction becomes more likely. Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss. Temple (1986) found that 82% of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss, and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat. Endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as extinction debt. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's giant panda, once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread deforestation in the 20th century.\n\nBiodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s terrestrial species. These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.\nMost of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include New Zealand, Madagascar, the Philippines, and Japan. South and East Asia — especially China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Japan — and many areas in West Africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of South America, and the Caribbean Sea and its associated islands.\n\nRegions of unsustainable agriculture or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction. Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Amazonian tropical rainforest areas of South America are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.\n\nAreas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction. In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the East and Midwest. Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.\n\nTropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today. The current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.\n\nOther forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests. Farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94% of temperate broadleaf forests; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities. Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast and less than 8% in Madagascar remain from their original extents.\nPlains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's drylands, which include temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, scrub, and deciduous forests, have been somewhat degraded. But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification. The tallgrass prairies of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.\n\nWetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years. Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed. In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused soil erosion, coastal flooding, and loss of quality in the UK marine ecosystem. About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans. One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing, pollution, and invasive species; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed. Finally, over 35% of the mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed.\n\nHabitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, fire, and climate change is well documented in the fossil record. One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.\n\nHabitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests, etc. to arable land, urban sprawl, infrastructure development, and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. Desertification, deforestation, and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas (deserts, forests, coral reefs).\n\nGeist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion (96%), infrastructure expansion (72%), and wood extraction (67%). Therefore, according to this study, forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), permanent cultivation (48%), cattle ranching (46%), shifting (slash and burn) cultivation (41%), subsistence agriculture (40%), and fuel wood extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the construction of new roads) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.\n\nRising global temperatures, caused by the greenhouse effect, contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the polar bear. Melting ice caps promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.\n\nWhile the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat. The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as \"drivers\" of habitat destruction. Demographic, economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.\n\nDemographic drivers include the expanding human population; rate of population increase over time; spatial distribution of people in a given area (urban versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas. Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots. This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of threatened species across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity. The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests. The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.\n\nFrom the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%). The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%). Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%). The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices. Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%). Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).\n\nThere are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets. Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.\n\nHabitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought, crop failure, spread of disease, and water contamination. On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.\n\nAgricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via erosion, salinization, compaction, nutrient depletion, pollution, and urbanization. Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as birdwatching, recreational uses like hunting and fishing, and ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.\n\nProbably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and carbon cycles, which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain, algal blooms, and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change. One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is climate regulation. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management, nitrogen fixation, oxygen production, pollination (see pollinator decline), waste treatment (i.e., the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants), and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff.\n\nThe loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change.\n\nThe loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi, viruses, and bacteria.\n\nThe negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations. Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.\n\nAnother way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.\n\nThe rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years. In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.\n\nThe impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more fertilizers and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, degradation, or pollution. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.\n\nIn most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes. This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country. Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country. This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:\n\n\n"}

She is credited by some with having written the first novel in the Bengali language, \"Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran\" (Description of Phulmani and Karuna), in 1852. There are other claimants to being earlier novels. \"Nabababubilas\" published by Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay in 1825 is claimed as one by some but others think of it as being merely a story. Similar reservation has also been expressed about \"Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran\".\n\nHer father Alphonse François Lacroix was a Swiss citizen who went to Chinsurah in India in 1821 to preach Christianity on behalf of the London Missionary Society. Hana learnt Bengali from the servants at home and at the age of 12 started teaching Bengali in a newly established school in Calcutta (now, Kolkata). In 1845, she was married to Joseph Mullens, who was also engaged in preaching Christianity in India. It was a period when Sanskrit was used for literary purposes and Bengali was only a language of conversation.\n\nHer first Bengali book \"Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran\" was written for native Christian women in 1852. The objective was to preach Christianity. This book was published six years before Peary Chand Mitra published his \"Alaler Gharer Dulal\".\n\nThe first Bengali woman to write a novel was Swarnakumari Devi, with her \"Deepnirban\" in 1876.\n\nMullens wrote another book, \"The Missionary on the Ganges or What is Christianity\", in both English and Bengali. She translated Charlotte Maria Tucker's \"Daybreak in Britain\" into Bengali.\n\nIt was at the invitation of Mullens’ husband, chairing the Bengal Missionary Conference of 1855, that Rev. John Fordyce first reported on his female teaching initiative in the zenanas of Calcutta. Shortly thereafter, Mrs Mullens persuaded the widow of a Hindu doctor to accommodate zenana teaching in her home, and then negotiated other similar arrangements. Her work in this respect was interrupted by a return to England in 1858, but by the time of her death in 1861 she had four zenanas under her care and was visiting a further eleven every afternoon. Her work in this field earned her the accolade of \"Apostle of the Zenanas\".\n"}

It is spoken by about 200 to 500 people, the Hinukhs, in the Tsuntinsky District of southwestern Dagestan, mainly in the village of Genukh (Hinukh: \"Hino\"). Hinukh is very closely related to Tsez, but they are not entirely mutually intelligible.\n\nOnly half of the children of the village speak the Hinukh language. As Hinukh is unwritten, like the other members of the Tsezic family, Avar and Russian are used as literary language. Hinukh is not considered to have dialects, but due to its linguistic proximity to Tsez it was once considered a Tsez dialect.\n\nThe Hinukh people were already mentioned in the Georgian chronicles of the Early Middle Ages. The language itself was first described in 1916 by Russian ethnographer A. Serzhputovsky.\n\nHinukh distinguishes 6 vowel qualities , all of which can be either long or short. Two vowels can occur pharyngealized: and . However, these are only used by the older generation. Today they are usually replaced by .\n\nLike many Caucasian languages, Hinuq has a large number of consonants. In addition to voiced and unvoiced consonants, there are also ejectives.\n\nIt is an agglutinative language which makes mainly use of suffixes.\n\nHinukh is an ergative-absolutive language and, like most Northeast Caucasian languages, shows a rich case system. There are six non-spatial cases (Absolutive, Ergative, First Genitive, Second Genitive, Dative, Instrumental) as well as 35 spatial cases. The spatial case system itself consists of two categories, location and orientation, expressed by the use of direction markers (Essive, Lative, First Ablative, Second Ablative, Directional). The plural suffix is almost unvariably \"-be\".\n\nHinuq distinguishes a direct and oblique stem. Case suffixes are primarily added to the oblique stem. To form the oblique stem, there are different options, including oblique suffixes, epenthetic vowels, deletion of the base-stem-final consonant, vowel, or semivowel; stress shift or ablaut. The oblique stem suffixes are \"-mo\", \"-a\", \"-la\", \"-i\", \"-ya\", \"-o\", \"-li\", \"-yi\", \"-ra\", \"-ro\", \"-ru\", \"-do\", \"-u\", \"-na\", \"-nu\". Some examples of nominal declension are given below.\n\nThere are five genders in Hinuq which play an important role in the language's grammar.\n\nTenses are marked synthetically on the verbs by means of affixes. As its sister languages Bezhta and Tsez, Hinukh differentiates between \"witnessed past\" (ending in \"-s\" or \"-š\") and \"unwitnessed past\" (in \"-no\"); the present tense is marked with the suffix \"-ho\". In the future tense, Hinukh distinguishes a \"direct future\" (\"-n\"), which is used only in the first person, and an \"indirect future\" (\"-s\") used for all other persons.\n\nThe numeral system is vigesimal, which means that it is a base-20 system, a feature commonly found among the languages of the Caucasus.\n\n\n"}

He attended a local elementary school called Kungsholms Folkskola, which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was the world's largest elementary school - the school had a capacity of 3,800 pupils, but since not all of them attended school every day, they were taught in shifts and according to the City Museum of Stockholm, the total number of enrolled pupils was over 6,000.\n\nHe studied in the United States during the 1940s, returned to Sweden to study for a degree at the University of Uppsala in 1952 and became a cultural reporter for various Swedish newspapers and journals (\"Utsikt, Bonniers Litterära Magasin, Poesi, Dagens Nyheter\" and \"Expressen\"). At the same time, he became established as a lyricist for cabaret shows and his own reviews (including \"Två åsnor\" (\"A Pair of Donkeys\") which was staged in Gothenburg in 1957). In 1966 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nHis collections of poetry won him membership of the Swedish Academy in 1971, while his song lyrics brought him widespread public recognition. During the 1970s he worked tirelessly as a poet and as a song-contest lyricist, including writing for the 1973 Swedish Eurovision Song Contest entry selection round (Melodifestivalen) and for performer Lill-Babs in 1980.\n\nHe was awarded the Bellman Prize in both 1968 and 1981, the Pilot Prize in 1992, the Litteris et Artibus award in 1993, the Cornelis Vreeswijk scholarship in 1997 and the Swedish Academy's Nordic Prize in 1998. His works include anthologies of poetry, books of song lyrics, children's books, plays, operatic librettos and translations. Lars Forssell died in Stockholm in 2007.\n\n"}

Many hundreds of personal names and placenames are known from ancient sources, and they throw light on the Dacian language and the extent to which it differed from Thracian.\n\nAround 1150 Dacian anthroponyms (personal names) and 900 toponyms (placenames) have been preserved in ancient sources. As far as the onomastic (proper names) of Dacians and Thracians is concerned, opinions are divided. According to Crossland (1982), the evidence of names from the Dacian, Mysian and Thracian area seems to indicate divergence of a 'Thraco-Dacian' language into northern and southern groups of dialects, but not so different as to rank Thracian and Dacian as separate languages, There were also the development of special tendencies in word formation and of certain secondary phonetic features in each group. Mateescu (1923), Rosetti (1978) sustain that Thracian onomastic include elements that are common to Geto-Dacians and Bessians (a Thracian tribe). A part of researchers support that onomastically, Dacians are not different from the other Thracians in Roman Dacia’s inscriptions. But recently, D. Dana basing himself on new onomastic material recorded in Egyptian ostraka suggested criteria which would make possible to distinguish between closely related Thracian and Dacian-Moesian names and singled out certain specific elements for the latter.\n\nIn Georgiev’s opinion (1960; 1977) Dacian placenames and personal names are \"completely different\" from their Thracian counterparts.\n\nSeveral Dacian names have also been identified with ostracons of Dacian cavalry recruited after the Roman conquest and stationed in East Egypt, i.e. Dadas and Dadazi, Zoutoula, Dotos and Dotouzi, Dieri and Diernais, Diengis, Dida(s), Blaikisa, Blegissa, Diourdanos, Thiadicem, Avizina, Dourpokis, Kaigiza, Dardiolai, Denzibalos (see also Dacian king name Deki-balos), Denzi-balus (attested in Britain), Pouridour, Thiaper and Tiatitis, Dekinais, *Rolouzis, (See Ostraca from Krokodilo and Didymoi)\n\n\n\n\n"}

The phrase's usage has gone from relatively obscure to mainstream in the media and entertainment.\n\nThis abbreviation is used in colloquial English—instead of the whole phrase. It connotes a sexually attractive mother. \n\nThe concept of the MILF predates the term, as exemplified by Mrs. Robinson in the movie \"The Graduate\" (1967). The term was first documented in Internet newsgroups during the 1990s. It was popularized by the film \"American Pie\" (1999), where John Cho's character (simply credited as 'MILF Guy No. 2') used the term to refer to Jennifer Coolidge's character Jeanine Stifler.\n\nA 2007 article in \"New York\" magazine stated that evidence the term had become mainstream included \"25,000-plus MILF-branded mugs and tees on Café Press to a rash of hot-mama books (\"The Hot Mom's Handbook\", \"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy\", \"The MILF Anthology\"), television shows (\"Desperate Housewives\", \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\", the forthcoming contest \"Hottest Mom in America\", and a pilot in development called \"MILF & Cookies\"), and, of course, a concomitant porn genre\". The authors of the article went on to ask, \"How exactly did a once-taboo erotic fetish become a widespread, culturally sanctioned ideal, a perverse mix of branding and empowerment?\"\n\nThe term \"yummy mummy\" is also used along with MILF. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the term as \"an attractive and stylish young mother\".\n\nAlthough not yet as widespread in popular culture at large, the forms DILF (for \"Dad/Daddy I'd Like to Fuck\") or FILF (for \"Father I'd Like to Fuck\") are used among androphiles to refer to a sexually attractive older man who is likely a father.\n\nIn 2002, a resident of the U.S. state of Washington applied for a vanity license plate reading \"GOTMILF\", a parody of the \"Got Milk?\" advertising slogan. This plate was approved, but it was later canceled after complaints were filed against it. The 2003 music video for the song \"Stacy's Mom\" by the group Fountains of Wayne draws on the theme of a MILF in its storyline.\n\nIn December 2007, low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines ran a controversial advertising campaign, using MILF to promote their tropical destinations, based on a different acronym: \"Many Islands, Low Fares\". In January 2009, Spirit ran the campaign again.\n\nIn 2013, an apparel company, True & Co., parodied the phrase in advertising for its line of brassieres, converting it to \"Mom I'd Like to \"Fit\"\". The campaign garnered negative attention for the San Francisco-based company. A 2014 article in \"Playboy\" magazine by Purdue University sex educator and researcher Justin Lehmiller referenced the work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Kinsey to explain the fascination with the MILF phenomenon.\n\n"}

He was given his nickname, Nokë, by his family. He hails from the Shytaj brotherhood, a large family which numbered about 60 members, all living together in a big house known as the tower of Shytaj. He is the fourth of thirteen children in the Sinishtaj family. As pastoralism was the family occupation and means of survival, he was a shepherd as a child.\n\nHe attended elementary school in Tuzi taught by teachers who spoke the Gheg dialect. He continued his education in the city of Zadar and finished classic high school in Pazinit. He studied theology at schools in the Balkan cities of Zagreb and Rijeka finally moving to Florence, Italy where he graduated in theology.\n\nFor Nokë and his family, it was a great honor to be nominated as a Catholic priest and return to Malësia. For five years, Sinishtaj served as a priest in Gusinje, Tuzi, and Hoti. While serving as a priest, he was known for his oratorical skills preaching in church. However, after five years, he left the priesthood to start a family with whom he lives today in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2000, many years after leaving the priesthood, he published a book which was both an autobiographical diary and a confessional to justify his decision. The book was entitled \"Confessions of a Rebellious Priest\". In this book Sinishtaj recounts the problems he encountered as a priest. It was because of these events, including hostile behavior, and injustices inside the clergy, that caused him to finally leave the priesthood but not his faith in God.\n\nHowever he did not stop studying and in 1975 continued his education in Philosophy and Italian Literature at the University of Fribourg, graduating in 1981.

Some say that Atahu was from an island called Tokelau, while others speculate he came from Tonga. But later, Sikaiana was invaded by Tongans, leaving many people who lived on Sikaiana dead. In the late 1920s ritual houses were burned and missionaries from the Melanesian Mission came to Sikaiana and completely converted almost everyone on the island to Christianity. They burnt down the ritual houses because they believed that people would still have faith in other religions if it were still there. The people were eager to learn to read and write since it offered educational and employment opportunities off the island, which helped contribute to the success of the missionaries (Donner, 2012).\n\nThe Sikaiana language is a Polynesian outlier language spoken on Sikaiana in the Central Solomons, about ninety miles east of the Malaita Island in Polynesia. There are about 730 speakers of this language left in the world, a very low number for any language.\n\nSikaiana is an Austronesian language in the Ellicean family. Its sister languages include Kapingamarangi, Nukumanu, Nukuoro, Nukuria, Ontong Java, Takuu, and Tuvaluan.\n\nSikaiana uses nine different consonants which are reflexes of the Proto-Polynesian language. The consonants include: /p, t, k, f/h, v, s, m, n, and l/. In most situations, /h/ and /f/ are free in variation, but in many words, only /h/ can be used (Donner 2012). There is also a length distinctions for consonants. This sometimes occurs as a result of a non-pronunciation of a vowel. For example, \"hahai\" changes to \"hhai\" because the first /a/ is simply omitted. Double consonants can also be used as a form of reduplication, showing agreement in verbs with plural subjects, or to mark repeated actions (Donner 2012).\n\nThere are five vowel phonemes in Sikaiana which include: /a, e, i, o, and u/. The /u/ and /i/ are pronounced with the glides /w/ and /y/, usually when preceding /a/. Like the consonants, they are all reflexes of the Proto-Polynesian language. Vowel length distinction in Sikaiana is very important for proper pronunciation. The length distinction for vowels can completely change the word if not pronounced correctly. For example, the word for shell tool is \"aha\", and the word for cyclone is \"ahaa\". Such a slight difference in the pronunciation can make a big difference on the meaning of the word, although some native speakers who were born after World War II don’t know what the original forms of the words are (Donner 1996).\n\nThe basic constituent order for Sikaiana is subject verb object. Although the order may vary, this pattern is always used for short, simple statements. Object subject verb and object verb subject are not used in any oceanic language, which means that it will not be used in Sikaiana (Lichtenberk, 2012). In the Sikaiana grammar system, sentences that start with a noun usually do not lead with a preposition, but for noun phrases that follow a verb phrase, it may or may not lead with a preposition (Donner, 2012). As for nouns and noun phrases, there must always be a preceding article except if it is a noun of place, names, or free pronouns. The articles that usually precede a noun is either \"te\" or \"n\" The use of these articles makes nouns easily distinguishable from other parts of speech (Donner, 2012).\n\nSikaiana uses extensive morphology to transform words to better express more complex sentences. Like many other Polynesian languages, Sikaiana has two types of nominal possession markers. There is an alienable marker which is \"a\", and an inalienable marker, \"o\". Pronominal possessive markers differ slightly. The alienable marker for a pronoun is 'ana\" and the inalienable possession marker is \"ona'. Pronouns in Sikaiana include singular, first person inclusive, first person exclusive, second person, and third person. In order to nominalize verbs in Sikaiana, the suffix \"ana\" is added to a verb to nominalize it. There are also length distinction morphemes used. For example, \"taku\" means my, and \"takuu\" means axe.\n\nSikaiana is very similar to the Proto-Polynesian language, so many words that are present in Polynesian languages are also in the Sikaiana language. For example, \"hale\" in Sikaiana means house, and the same word is also house in Hawaiian.\n\nThe people of Sikaiana speak the Sikaiana language or Central Solomon Pidgin English. After WWII, many people from Sikaiana migrated to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands in search of jobs and education (Donner, 2002). This means that there was a decrease in the use of the language, since Sikaiana was not the language mainly used in that area. A decrease in the advantages of using the Sikaiana language increases the endangerment of it.\n\nAlthough there is a decrease in the number of speakers of the Sikaiana language, there is a dictionary which was put together by Arthur Capell in 1935 which covers vocabulary, grammar, typology, and brief history of the Sikaiana language. It may be possible for someone to learn how to speak Sikaiana if they read and studied the whole dictionary. Some other sources are by William Donner, who visited Sikaiana in the 1970s and 1980s, and wrote many things regarding history, language change, culture, and emigration of the Sikaiana people. Most of Donner’s work was published in the Journal Pacific Studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30858097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30858097", "title": "Theories of second-language acquisition", "text": "Theories of second-language acquisition\n\nTheories of second-language acquisition are various theories and hypotheses in the field of second-language acquisition about how people learn a second language. Research in second-language acquisition is closely related to several disciplines including linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and education, and consequently most theories of second-language acquisition can be identified as having roots in one of them. Each of these theories can be thought of as shedding light on one part of the language learning process; however, no one overarching theory of second-language acquisition has yet been widely accepted by researchers.\n\nAs second-language acquisition began as an interdisciplinary field, it is hard to pin down a precise starting date. However, there are two publications in particular that are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: (1) Corder's 1967 essay \"The Significance of Learners' Errors\", and (2) Selinker's 1972 article \"Interlanguage\". Corder's essay rejected a behaviorist account of SLA and suggested that learners made use of intrinsic internal linguistic processes; Selinker's article argued that second-language learners possess their own individual linguistic systems that are independent from both the first and second languages.\n\nIn the 1970s the general trend in SLA was for research exploring the ideas of Corder and Selinker, and refuting behaviorist theories of language acquisition. Examples include research into error analysis, studies in transitional stages of second-language ability, and the \"morpheme studies\" investigating the order in which learners acquired linguistic features. The 70s were dominated by naturalistic studies of people learning English as a second language.\n\nBy the 1980s, the theories of Stephen Krashen had become the prominent paradigm in SLA. In his theories, often collectively known as the Input Hypothesis, Krashen suggested that language acquisition is driven solely by comprehensible input, language input that learners can understand. Krashen's model was influential in the field of SLA and also had a large influence on language teaching, but it left some important processes in SLA unexplained. Research in the 1980s was characterized by the attempt to fill in these gaps. Some approaches included White's descriptions of learner competence, and Pienemann's use of speech processing models and lexical functional grammar to explain learner output. This period also saw the beginning of approaches based in other disciplines, such as the psychological approach of connectionism.\n\nThe 1990s saw a host of new theories introduced to the field, such as Michael Long's interaction hypothesis, Merrill Swain's output hypothesis, and Richard Schmidt's noticing hypothesis. However, the two main areas of research interest were linguistic theories of SLA based upon Noam Chomsky's universal grammar, and psychological approaches such as skill acquisition theory and connectionism. The latter category also saw the new theories of processability and input processing in this time period. The 1990s also saw the introduction of sociocultural theory, an approach to explain second-language acquisition in terms of the social environment of the learner.\n\nIn the 2000s research was focused on much the same areas as in the 1990s, with research split into two main camps of linguistic and psychological approaches. VanPatten and Benati do not see this state of affairs as changing in the near future, pointing to the support both areas of research have in the wider fields of linguistics and psychology, respectively.\n\nFor the second-language learner, the acquisition of meaning is arguably the most important task. Meaning it is the heart of a language, not the exotic sounds or elegant sentence structure. There are several types of meanings: lexical, grammatical, semantic, and pragmatic. All the different meanings contribute to the acquisition of meaning resulting in the integrated second language possession.\n\nLexical meaning – meaning that is stored in our mental lexicon; \n\nGrammatical meaning – comes into consideration when calculating the meaning of a sentence; usually encoded in inflectional morphology (ex. - ed for past simple, -‘s for third person possessive) \n\nSemantic meaning – word meaning;\n\nPragmatic meaning – meaning that depends on context, requires knowledge of the world to decipher; for example, when someone asks on the phone, “Is Mike there?” he doesn’t want to know if Mike is physically there; he wants to know if he can talk to Mike.\n\nSociocultural theory was originally coined by Wertsch in 1985 and derived from the work of Lev Vygotsky and the Vygotsky Circle in Moscow from the 1920s onwards. Sociocultural theory is the notion that human mental function is from participating cultural mediation integrated into social activities.\n\nFrom the field of linguistics, the most influential theory by far has been Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar (UG). The UG model of principles, basic properties which all languages share, and parameters, properties which can vary between languages, has been the basis for much second-language research. \n\nFrom a UG perspective, learning the grammar of a second language is simply a matter of setting the correct parameters. Take the \"pro-drop\" parameter, which dictates whether or not sentences must have a subject in order to be grammatically correct. This parameter can have two values: \"positive\", in which case sentences do not necessarily need a subject, and \"negative\", in which case subjects must be present. In German the sentence \"\"Er spricht\" (he speaks) is grammatical, but the sentence \"Spricht\" (speaks) is ungrammatical. In Italian, however, the sentence \"Parla\"\" (speaks) is perfectly normal and grammatically correct. A German speaker learning Italian would only need to deduce that subjects are optional from the language he hears, and then set his \"pro-drop\" parameter for Italian accordingly. Once he has set all the parameters in the language correctly, then from a UG perspective he can be said to have learned Italian, i.e. he will always produce perfectly correct Italian sentences.\n\nUniversal Grammar also provides a succinct explanation for much of the phenomenon of language transfer. Spanish learners of English who make the mistake \"Is raining\" instead of \"It is raining\" have not yet set their \"pro-drop\" parameters correctly and are still using the same setting as in Spanish. \n\nThe main shortcoming of Universal Grammar in describing second-language acquisition is that it does not deal at all with the psychological processes involved with learning a language. UG scholarship is only concerned with whether parameters are set or not, not with \"how\" they are set. Schachter (1988) is a useful critique of research testing the role of Universal Grammar in second language acquisition.\n\nLearners' most direct source of information about the target language is the target language itself. When they come into direct contact with the target language, this is referred to as \"input.\" When learners process that language in a way that can contribute to learning, this is referred to as \"intake.By the way, the amount of input learners take in is one of the most important factors affecting their learning. However, it must be at a level that is comprehensible to them. In his Monitor Theory, Krashen advanced the concept that language input should be at the \"i+1\" level, just beyond what the learner can fully understand; this input is comprehensible, but contains structures that are not yet fully understood. This has been criticized on the basis that there is no clear definition of i+1, and that factors other than structural difficulty (such as interest or presentation) can affect whether input is actually turned into intake. The concept has been quantified, however, in vocabulary acquisition research; Nation reviews various studies which indicate that about 98% of the words in running text should be previously known in order for extensive reading to be effective.\n\nIn his Input Hypothesis, Krashen proposes that language acquisition takes place only when learners receive input just beyond their current level of L2 competence. He termed this level of input “i+1.” However, in contrast to emergentist and connectionist theories, he follows the innate approach by applying Chomsky's Government and binding theory and concept of Universal grammar (UG) to second-language acquisition. He does so by proposing a Language Acquisition Device that uses L2 input to define the parameters of the L2, within the constraints of UG, and to increase the L2 proficiency of the learner. In addition, Krashen (1982)’s Affective Filter Hypothesis holds that the acquisition of a second language is halted if the learner has a high degree of anxiety when receiving input. According to this concept, a part of the mind filters out L2 input and prevents intake by the learner, if the learner feels that the process of SLA is threatening. As mentioned earlier, since input is essential in Krashen’s model, this filtering action prevents acquisition from progressing.\n\nA great deal of research has taken place on input enhancement, the ways in which input may be altered so as to direct learners' attention to linguistically important areas. Input enhancement might include bold-faced vocabulary words or marginal glosses in a reading text. Research here is closely linked to research on pedagogical effects, and comparably diverse.\n\nOther concepts have also been influential in the speculation about the processes of building internal systems of second-language information. Some thinkers hold that language processing handles distinct types of knowledge. For instance, one component of the Monitor Model, propounded by Krashen, posits a distinction between “acquisition” and “learning.” According to Krashen, L2 acquisition is a subconscious process of incidentally “picking up” a language, as children do when becoming proficient in their first languages. Language learning, on the other hand, is studying, consciously and intentionally, the features of a language, as is common in traditional classrooms. Krashen sees these two processes as fundamentally different, with little or no interface between them. In common with connectionism, Krashen sees input as essential to language acquisition. \n\nFurther, Bialystok and Smith make another distinction in explaining how learners build and use L2 and interlanguage knowledge structures. They argue that the concept of interlanguage should include a distinction between two specific kinds of language processing ability. On one hand is learners’ knowledge of L2 grammatical structure and ability to analyze the target language objectively using that knowledge, which they term “representation,” and, on the other hand is the ability to use their L2 linguistic knowledge, under time constraints, to accurately comprehend input and produce output in the L2, which they call “control.” They point out that often non-native speakers of a language have higher levels of representation than their native-speaking counterparts have, yet have a lower level of control. Finally, Bialystok has framed the acquisition of language in terms of the interaction between what she calls “analysis” and “control.” Analysis is what learners do when they attempt to understand the rules of the target language. Through this process, they acquire these rules and can use them to gain greater control over their own production.\n\nMonitoring is another important concept in some theoretical models of learner use of L2 knowledge. According to Krashen, the Monitor is a component of an L2 learner's language processing device that uses knowledge gained from language learning to observe and regulate the learner's own L2 production, checking for accuracy and adjusting language production when necessary.\n\nLong's interaction hypothesis proposes that language acquisition is strongly facilitated by the use of the target language in interaction. Similarly to Krashen's Input Hypothesis, the Interaction Hypothesis claims that comprehensible input is important for language learning. In addition, it claims that the effectiveness of comprehensible input is greatly increased when learners have to negotiate for meaning. \n\nInteractions often result in learners receiving negative evidence. That is, if learners say something that their interlocutors do not understand, after negotiation the interlocutors may model the correct language form. In doing this, learners can receive feedback on their production and on grammar that they have not yet mastered. The process of interaction may also result in learners receiving more input from their interlocutors than they would otherwise. Furthermore, if learners stop to clarify things that they do not understand, they may have more time to process the input they receive. This can lead to better understanding and possibly the acquisition of new language forms. Finally, interactions may serve as a way of focusing learners' attention on a difference between their knowledge of the target language and the reality of what they are hearing; it may also focus their attention on a part of the target language of which they are not yet aware.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canadian SLA researcher Merrill Swain advanced the output hypothesis, that meaningful output is as necessary to language learning as meaningful input. However, most studies have shown little if any correlation between learning and quantity of output. Today, most scholars contend that small amounts of meaningful output are important to language learning, but primarily because the experience of producing language leads to more effective processing of input.\n\nSome of the major cognitive theories of how learners organize language knowledge are based on analyses of how speakers of various languages analyze sentences for meaning. MacWhinney, Bates, and Kliegl found that speakers of English, German, and Italian showed varying patterns in identifying the subjects of transitive sentences containing more than one noun. English speakers relied heavily on word order; German speakers used morphological agreement, the animacy status of noun referents, and stress; and speakers of Italian relied on agreement and stress. MacWhinney et al. interpreted these results as supporting the Competition Model, which states that individuals use linguistic cues to get meaning from language, rather than relying on linguistic universals. According to this theory, when acquiring an L2, learners sometimes receive competing cues and must decide which cue(s) is most relevant for determining meaning.\n\nThese findings also relate to Connectionism. Connectionism attempts to model the cognitive language processing of the human brain, using computer architectures that make associations between elements of language, based on frequency of co-occurrence in the language input. Frequency has been found to be a factor in various linguistic domains of language learning. Connectionism posits that learners form mental connections between items that co-occur, using exemplars found in language input. From this input, learners extract the rules of the language through cognitive processes common to other areas of cognitive skill acquisition. Since connectionism denies both innate rules and the existence of any innate language-learning module, L2 input is of greater importance than it is in processing models based on innate approaches, since, in connectionism, input is the source of both the units and the rules of language.\n\nAttention is another characteristic that some believe to have a role in determining the success or failure of language processing. Richard Schmidt states that although explicit metalinguistic knowledge of a language is not always essential for acquisition, the learner must be aware of L2 input in order to gain from it. In his “noticing hypothesis,” Schmidt posits that learners must notice the ways in which their interlanguage structures differ from target norms. This noticing of the gap allows the learner's internal language processing to restructure the learner's internal representation of the rules of the L2 in order to bring the learner's production closer to the target. In this respect, Schmidt's understanding is consistent with the ongoing process of rule formation found in emergentism and connectionism.\n\nSome theorists and researchers have contributed to the cognitive approach to second-language acquisition by increasing understanding of the ways L2 learners restructure their interlanguage knowledge systems to be in greater conformity to L2 structures. Processability theory states that learners restructure their L2 knowledge systems in an order of which they are capable at their stage of development. For instance, In order to acquire the correct morphological and syntactic forms for English questions, learners must transform declarative English sentences. They do so by a series of stages, consistent across learners. Clahsen proposed that certain processing principles determine this order of restructuring. Specifically, he stated that learners first, maintain declarative word order while changing other aspects of the utterances, second, move words to the beginning and end of sentences, and third, move elements within main clauses before subordinate clauses.\n\nThinkers have produced several theories concerning how learners use their internal L2 knowledge structures to comprehend L2 input and produce L2 output. One idea is that learners acquire proficiency in an L2 in the same way that people acquire other complex cognitive skills. Automaticity is the performance of a skill without conscious control. It results from the gradated process of proceduralization. In the field of cognitive psychology, Anderson expounds a model of skill acquisition, according to which persons use procedures to apply their declarative knowledge about a subject in order to solve problems. On repeated practice, these procedures develop into production rules that the individual can use to solve the problem, without accessing long-term declarative memory. Performance speed and accuracy improve as the learner implements these production rules. DeKeyser tested the application of this model to L2 language automaticity. He found that subjects developed increasing proficiency in performing tasks related to the morphosyntax of an artificial language, Autopractan, and performed on a learning curve typical of the acquisition of non-language cognitive skills. This evidence conforms to Anderson's general model of cognitive skill acquisition, supports the idea that declarative knowledge can be transformed into procedural knowledge, and tends to undermine the idea of Krashen that knowledge gained through language “learning” cannot be used to initiate speech production.\n\nMichael T. Ullman has used a declarative/procedural model to understand how language information is stored. This model is consistent with a distinction made in general cognitive science between the storage and retrieval of facts, on the one hand, and understanding of how to carry out operations, on the other. It states that declarative knowledge consists of arbitrary linguistic information, such as irregular verb forms, that are stored in the brain's declarative memory. In contrast, knowledge about the rules of a language, such as grammatical word order is procedural knowledge and is stored in procedural memory. Ullman reviews several psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies that support the declarative/procedural model.\n\nPerhaps certain psychological characteristics constrain language processing. One area of research is the role of memory. Williams conducted a study in which he found some positive correlation between verbatim memory functioning and grammar learning success for his subjects. This suggests that individuals with less short-term memory capacity might have a limitation in performing cognitive processes for organization and use of linguistic knowledge.\n\nSecond language acquisition has been usually investigated by applying traditional cross-sectional studies. In these designs usually a pre-test post-test method is used. However, in the 2000s a novel angle emerged in the field of second language research. These studies mainly adopt Dynamic systems theory perspective to analyse longitudinal time-series data. Scientists such as Larsen-Freeman, Verspoor, de Bot, Lowie, van Geert claim that second language acquisition can be best capture by applying longitudinal case study research design rather than cross-sectional designs. In these studies variability is seen a key indicator of development, self-organization from a Dynamic systems parlance. The interconnectedness of the systems is usually analysed by moving correlations.\n\n"}

It is also an elite indigenous family surname in colonial Honduras, and a place name in the Motagua river valley in 1536. Feldman (1975), largely based on unpublished notes of Nicholas Helmuth conserved in the American Philosophical Society, concludes that Toquegua is a Ch'ol Mayan-related language. Sheptak (2007) contests that identification and concludes the people referred to as the Toquegua were multi-lingual, speaking Yucatec, Ch'ol, Nahuatl, and Lenca.\n\nThe Toquegua were merchants of cacao and feathers (particularly quetzal feathers) in the sixteenth century and hosted Yucatec Maya people in their communities.\n\n"}

As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city, such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.\n\nTheorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of behavioral geography, beginning with the work of Kevin Lynch in \"The Image of the City\", which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings. The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.\n\nSome theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments. Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city. Martin Krampen conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.\n\nRoland Barthes\nFrancoise Choay\nUmberto Eco\nMark Gottdiener\nAlgirdas Julien Greimas\nMartin Krampen\nAlexandros Lagopoulos\nRaymond Ledrut\nHenri Lefebvre\n\n"}
