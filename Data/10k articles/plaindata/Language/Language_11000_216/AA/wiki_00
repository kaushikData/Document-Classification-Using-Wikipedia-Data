His childhood name was 'Bholanath'. His early education was in village 'pathshalas'.\n\nAfter his early education and a short stint as a Hindi language teacher at Ara (1903–1921), Acharya Shivpujan Sahay went to Kolkata to edit 'Marwari Sudhar' and then joined \"Matwala\" as an Editor in 1923. He moved to Lucknow in 1924 to join the editorial department of Dularelal Bhargava's \"Madhuri\" where he worked with noted Hindi author Munshi Premchand and edited his \"Rangbhumi\" and some of his other stories.\n\nIn 1925, he returned to Calcutta and engaged in editing short-lived journals such as \"Samanway\", \"Mauji\", \"Golmal\",\"Upanyas Tarang\". Finally, Sahay moved to Varanasi (Kāśi) in 1926 to work as a freelance editor. For a short period in 1931, he went to Sultanganj near Bhagalpur to edit \"Ganga\". However, he returned to Varanasi in 1932 where he was commissioned to edit \"Jagaran\", a literary fortnightly brought out by Jaishankar Prasad and his circle of friends. Sahay once again found himself working with Premchand. He also went on to become a prominent member of the Nagari Pracharini Sabha and similar literary circles in Varanasi.\n\nIn 1935, he moved to Laheria Sarai with his family (Darbhanga) to work as editor of \"Balak\" and other publications of Pustak Bhandar owned by Acharya Ramlochan Saran. In 1939, he joined Rajendra College, Chhapra as a Professor of Hindi Language. In 1946, on a year's leave, he moved to Patna to edit \"Himalaya\", a literary monthly which was published by Pustak Bhandar owned by Acharya Ramlochan Saran.\n\nIn 1950, Sahay finally came to Patna to work as Secretary of Bihar Rashtra Bhasha Parished, a government academy where he edited and published more than 50 volumes of Hindi reference works. Later he became Director of the Parishad and compiled and edited \"Hindi Sahitya Aur Bihar\" a literary history. He retired from Parishad in 1959.\n\nHis own works were compiled and published in 4 volumes of \"Shipujan Rachanavali\" (1956–59) by the Parishad. Later, after his death, his complete works were edited and published by his son Prof. Mangal Murty as 'Shivapoojan Sahay Sahitya samagra'(2011) in 10 volumes. Shivpujan Sahay is also remembered for his editing of several literary commemoration volumes, chiefly \"Dwivedi Abhinandan Granth\" (1933),\"Anugrah Abhinandan Granth\" (1946), \"Rajendra Abhinandan Granth\" (1950) and \"Jayanti Smarak Granth\" (1942). He also edited Dr. Rajendra Prasad's \"Atmakatha\". He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1960.\n\n\nHe died in Patna on 21 January 1963. His posthumously published books are \"Wey Din Wey Log\" (1965), \"Mera Jeevan\" (1985), \"Smritishesh\" (1994), \"Hindi Bhasha Aur Sahitya\" (1996), and \"Gram Sudhar\" (2007) and 'Shivapoojan Sahay Sahitya Samagra' (10 Vols.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12549841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12549841", "title": "Act structure", "text": "Act structure\n\nAct structure explains how the plot of a film’s story is composed. Just like plays (staged drama) have 'acts', critics and screenwriters tend to divide films into acts; though films don't require to be physically broken down as such in reality.\n\nWhereas plays are actual performances that need 'breaks' in the middle for change of set, costume, or for the artists' rest, films are recorded performances shown mechanically and therefore don't need actual breaks. Still they are divided into acts for reasons that are in aesthetic and structural conformation with the original idea of Act in theatre. Act breaks in a film are usually very obscure for lay audience, and only a trained person can detect the ending of one act and the beginning of another in the progression of a movie, although learned people can typically mark it by a 'plot point' in writing process or film appreciation. The idea of act structure is of more value in screenwriting (i.e. while writing a screenplay) than watching a film, though the act breaks are never actually written in the final copies of screenplays, unlike in play scripts, where they are clearly mentioned as such; e.g. Act 1 Scene 3, etc. However, in television scripts called teleplays, clear denotations about act breaks are almost always included, usually to coincide with commercial breaks.\n\nAct is the broadest structural unit of enacted stories. The most common paradigm in theatre, and so in films, is that of the three-act structure proposed by Aristotle. Simply put, it means that any story has a 'beginning', a 'middle' and an 'end'. Playwrights and screenwriters divide their stories into three major parts viz. 'Set up', 'Confrontation' (alternatively called 'conflict' or 'complication') and 'Resolution'. These form the basic three acts of any performance – staged or screened.\n\nThough various theories have been proposed and debated, the three-act structure stands as the most popular one. Also, this is what Hollywood has discovered and proved as the most successful in commercial movie making.\n\nNative forms (including feature films) can often be seen in distinct parts called 'acts'.\n\nIt follows that the enacted story opens with the introduction of characters and situations, backdrop, locale etc. It creates interest in the audience and takes them to feel concerned as to what the real problem is and what may happen with it. Plays, and screenplays, usually revolve around main characters – the 'Protagonist' and the 'Antagonist' who engage themselves into a battle. That is \"Set up\".\n\nThe next part – and considered to be the most important – is complication of the problem of the story. It intrigues the audience all the more, giving them more and more information and putting various points of view for imaginative comparison. This eventually leads to higher points of audience interest. Because this second act of most screenplays add all the possible dramatic values to the plot, this is considered to be the core part of a script. The antagonist and the protagonist try and experiment with all their strengths (and weaknesses of the other) to win the battle. That is \"Confrontation\".\n\nThis takes us to the third act, the \"Resolution\". This means it tends to 'solve' the problem (-s) of the story developed so far. But this is not obvious, as it is expected to bring the 'climax' (or a series of climaxes) to give the audience the pay-off. The tool usually implemented is a 'do or die' situation where doors of escape for either or both of the two characters go on closing one by one, leaving them with only a thin chance that demands the fullest exploitation of their qualities and energies. This so-called jaw-dropping, breath-taking, arm-rest-grabbing 'obligatory moment' for the audience leads to the final outcome of the entire plot. And it is usually the triumph of the good (Protagonist) over the evil (Antagonist), with rare exceptions.\n\nThis framework can not be rigidly applied to all the film stories, and there are a good proportion of Hollywood movies that defy this theory. Many films follow this pattern only to a subtle extent, where their genre demands a more delicate handling. Screenwriters and script doctors have tried to provide alternative ideas, which again are open for debate. As alluded to previously, cinematic framework varies geographically and, through time, cinema has evolved unique approaches to storytelling. Also, this theory may not be fit for non-fiction films like documentary or corporate films, which may not have a 'plot' at their base with 'characters' and all their 'actions and speeches' predecided, like the feature films have. Such non-fiction films require their own forms of arrangement.\n\nWhat is important here is that ideas of Act structure help us understand films better. More importantly, these are 'tools' of the screenplay writers who can break down the story at hand and play with various ways of presenting it to find the best possible one. Experts have gone long way ahead in dividing plot to even smaller structural units and they keep working to find the most effective formula of structuring a film story.\n\n"}
{"id": "733264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733264", "title": "Ahom language", "text": "Ahom language\n\nThe Ahom language is a nearly extinct Tai language spoken by the Ahom people who ruled the Brahmaputra river valley in the present day Indian state of Assam between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The language is classified in a Northwestern subgrouping of Southwestern Tai owing to close affinities with Shan, Khamti and, more distantly, Thai. As the Ahom rulers of the area assimilated with other indigenous Assamese communities, they slowly adopted the Assamese language(the lingua-franca of the region) as their mother tongue which gradually replaced Ahom as a spoken language, a process which became complete during the 19th century. As of 2000, Ahom was only known by approximately 200 priests of the traditional Ahom religion and only used for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes.\n\nAlthough the language is no longer spoken, the exhaustive 1795 Ahom-Assamese lexicon known as the \"Bar Amra\" preserves the form of the language that was spoken during the Ahom Kingdom. Ahom is an important language in Tai studies. It was relatively free of both Mon-Khmer and Indo-Aryan influences and has a written tradition dating back to the 13th century.\n\nAhom is classified as a Southwestern Tai language. It has its own script.\nAhom has characteristics typical of Tai languages, such as:\n\nWhen speaking and writing Ahom, much is dependent upon context and the audience interpretation. Multiple parts of the sentence can be left out; verb and adjectives will remain, but other parts of speech, especially pronouns, can be dropped. Verbs do not have tenses, and nouns do not have plurals. Time periods can be identified by adverbs, strings of verbs, or auxiliaries placed before the verb.\nAhom, like other Tai languages, uses classifiers to identify categories, and repetitions of words to express idiomatic expressions. However, the expressions, classifiers, pronouns, and other sentence particles vary between the Tai languages descended from Proto-Tai, making Tai languages mutually unintelligible.\n\nThe immediate parent language from which Ahom is descended has been reconstructed as Proto-Tai, a language from 2000 years ago, in the Tai–Kadai family (unrelated to Chinese, but possibly related to the Austronesian languages), within the (proposed but debated) subgroup of Kam–Tai, although some say that Tai languages are a discrete family, and are not part of Tai–Kadai.\n\nThe Ahom people and their language originated in Yunnan in south-west China and they migrated, from the border between Northern Vietnam and the Guangxi province of China, into the south-east Asian peninsula and northern Burma.\nAhom was then spoken by the Ahom people who ruled most of Assam, a civilization in the Brahmaputra river valley, in Southeast Asia, from 1228 to 1826. It was the exclusive court language of the Ahom kingdom till about the 15th–16th century, when it gave way to Assamese, a language formed out of a mixture of Austric, Tibeto-Burmese, Tai, Indo-Chinese and Aryan language. The language fell into complete disuse by the 19th century and the phonology has completely been lost. The language today is used chiefly for liturgical purposes, and is no longer used in daily life. It retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature. An effort has been made to revive the language by following the phonology of existing sister languages, especially Tai-Aiton and Tai-Phake.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4585729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4585729", "title": "Case report", "text": "Case report\n\nIn medicine, a case report is a detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of an individual patient. Case reports may contain a demographic profile of the patient, but usually describe an unusual or novel occurrence. Some case reports also contain a literature review of other reported cases. Case reports are professional narratives that provide feedback on clinical practice guidelines and offer a framework for early signals of effectiveness, adverse events, and cost. They can be shared for medical, scientific, or educational purposes.\n\nMost case reports are on one of six topics:\n\n\nA case report is generally considered a type of anecdotal evidence. Given their intrinsic methodological limitations, including lack of statistical sampling, case reports are placed at the foot of the hierarchy of clinical evidence, together with case series. Nevertheless, case reports do have genuinely useful roles in medical research and evidence-based medicine. In particular, they have facilitated recognition of new diseases and adverse effects of treatments. (For example, recognition of the link between administration of thalidomide to mothers and malformations in their babies was triggered by the report of a particular case.) Case reports have a role in pharmacovigilance. They can also help understand the clinical spectrum of rare diseases, as well as unusual presentations of common diseases. They can help generate study hypotheses, including plausible mechanisms of disease. Case reports may also have a role to play in guiding the personalization of treatments in clinical practice.\n\nProponents of case reports have outlined some particular advantages of the format. Case reports and series have a high sensitivity for detecting novelty and therefore remain one of the cornerstones of medical progress; they provide many new ideas in medicine. Whereas randomized clinical trials usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation, the case report can detail many different aspects of the patient's medical situation (e.g. patient history, physical examination, diagnosis, psychosocial aspects, follow up).\n\nBecause typical, unremarkable cases are less likely to be published, use of case reports as scientific evidence must take into account publication bias. Some case reports also contain an extensive review of the relevant literature on the topic at-hand (and sometimes a systematic review of available evidence). Reports adopting this sort of approach can be identified by terms such as a \"case report and review of the literature\". Reports containing broader active research such as this might be considered case studies in the true definition of the term.\n\nCase reports can also play a relevant role in medical education, providing a structure for case-based learning.\n\nA particular attraction of case reports is the possibility of quick publication (with respect to more extensive studies such as randomized control trials), allowing them to act as a kind of rapid short communication between busy clinicians who may not have the time or resources to conduct large scale research.\n\nThe quality of the scientific reporting of case reports is variable, and sub-optimal reporting hinders the use of case reports to inform research design or help guide clinical practice. In response to these issues, reporting guidelines are under development to facilitate greater transparency and completeness in the provision of relevant information for individual cases. The CARE (i.e. CAse REport) guidelines include a reporting checklist that is listed on the EQUATOR Network, an international initiative aimed at promoting transparent and accurate reporting of health research studies to enhance the value and reliability of medical research literature. This 13-item checklist includes indications regarding the title, key words, abstract, introduction, patient information, clinical findings, timeline, diagnostic assessment, therapeutic interventions, follow-up and outcomes, discussion, patient perspective, and informed consent. An explanation and elaboration article (a manual for writing case reports following the CARE guidelines) was published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2017.\n\nMany international journals will publish case reports, but they restrict the number that appear in the print run because this has an adverse effect on the journal's impact factor. Case reports are often put in the internet part of the journal and there is often still a requirement for a subscription to access them. However, there are a few that are devoted to publishing case reports alone, and these are all open access. The first of these to start publishing, in 2001, was \"Grand Rounds\". Other similar journals include \"Case Reports in Medicine\", \"Journal of Medical Case Reports\", \"Oncology Reports\", \"Oncology Letters\" and \"Cases Journal\"; all of them publish peer-reviewed case reports in all areas of medicine. \"Cases Journal\" recently merged with the \"Journal of Medical Case Reports\" but still maintains an independent internet portal. \"BMJ Case Reports\" is an online, peer-reviewed journal publishing cases in all disciplines. \"Radiology Case Reports\" and the \"Journal of Radiology Case Reports\" are open-access peer-reviewed journals focusing on medical imaging. \"Journal of Surgical Case Reports\" is an open access peer-reviewed journal that considers case reports in the field of surgery. \"Journal of Orthopaedic Case Reports\" is an open access, peer-reviewed journal. \"Oncology Reports\" and \"Oncology Letters\" both publish case reports exclusively as open access, peer-reviewed journals in the field of oncology and cancer medicine. \"Human Pathology: Case Reports\" is an open access, peer-reviewed journal publishing all aspects of pathology, regardless of the system affected.\n\nThere are a number of websites that allow patients to submit and share their own patient case reports with other people. PatientsLikeMe and Treatment Report are two such sites.\n\nThe term is also used to describe non-scientific reports usually prepared for educational reasons.\nbut at times, not usually considered to be standard of high level reporting system.\n\n\n20.

It complements the more common four color CMYK process, which stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black), by adding light cyan and light magenta. Individually, light cyan is often abbreviated to Lc or c, and light magenta is represented as Lm or m.\n\nThe most noticeable result of using light cyan and light magenta inks is the removal of a distinct and harsh halftoning dot appearance that appears in prints that use light shades of cyan or magenta on the pure CMYK ink configuration. Usually when printing a dark color the printer will saturate the area with colored ink dots, but will use fewer ink dots to create the effect of a light color. The result is hard to notice with yellow because yellow is perceived as a very light color. However, the individual cyan and magenta ink dots will stand out in a sparse pattern due to their darker color against a white background; the result is undesirable when it is noticed.\n\nBy using light cyan or magenta, the printer can saturate areas that would typically use halftoning with these inks to remove the look of sparse magenta and cyan dots. The downside is the printer needs approximately twice as much light cyan and magenta ink in areas to achieve the same saturation as pure cyan/magenta which can lead to excess ink usage. The end result, however, is significantly better for some photos.\n\nCcMmYK colorants reduce graininess in the middle tone region. This reduced graininess typically improves the photographic appearance of blue skies and some flesh tones.\n"}

The Oath outlined the main aims and the course of action to be followed during Emperor Meiji's reign, setting the legal stage for Japan's modernization. This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, if less for governing than inspiring, throughout the Meiji era and into the twentieth century, and can be considered the first constitution of modern Japan.\n\nAs the name implies, the text of the Oath consists of five clauses:\n\nThe first draft of the Oath was written by junior councilor Yuri Kimimasa in January 1868, containing progressive language that spoke to the frustrations that the radical but modestly born Meiji leaders had experienced in \"service to hereditary incompetents.\" Yuri's language was moderated by his colleague Fukuoka Takachika in February to be \"less alarming,\" and Kido Takayoshi prepared the final form of the Oath, employing \"language broad enough to embrace both readings.\" The Oath was read aloud by Sanjō Sanetomi in the main ceremonial hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace in the presence of the Emperor and more than 400 officials. After the reading, the nobles and \"daimyōs\" present signed their names to a document praising the Oath, and swearing to do their utmost to uphold and implement it. Those not able to attend the formal reading afterwards visited the palace to sign their names, bringing the total number of signatures to 767.\n\nThe purpose of the oath was both to issue a statement of policy to be followed by the post-Tokugawa shogunate government in the Meiji period, and to offer hope of inclusion in the next regime to pro-Tokugawa domains. This second motivation was especially important in the early stages of the Restoration as a means to keep domains from joining the Tokugawa remnant in the Boshin War. Later, military victory \"made it safe to begin to push court nobles and \"daimyō\" figureheads out of the way\".\n\nThe promise of reform in the document initially went unfulfilled: in particular, a parliament with real power was not established until 1890, and the Meiji oligarchy from Satsuma, Chōshū, Tosa and Hizen retained political and military control well into the 20th century. In general, the Oath was purposely phrased in broad terms to minimize resistance from the \"daimyōs\" and to provide \"a promise of gradualism and equity\":\n\nThe Oath was reiterated as the first article of the constitution promulgated in June 1868, and the subsequent articles of that constitution expand the policies outlined in the Oath. Almost eighty years later, in the wake of the Second World War, Emperor Hirohito paid homage to the Oath and reaffirmed it as the basis of \"national polity\" in his Humanity Declaration. The ostensible purpose of the rescript was to appease the American occupiers with a renunciation of imperial divinity, but the emperor himself saw it as a statement of the existence of democracy in Meiji era.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4275231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4275231", "title": "Classification of Romance languages", "text": "Classification of Romance languages\n\nThe internal classification of the Romance languages is a complex and sometimes controversial topic which may not have one single answer. Several classifications have been proposed, based on different criteria.\n\nIn spite of their common origin, the descendants of Vulgar Latin have many differences. These occur at all levels, including the sound systems, the orthography, the nominal, verbal, and adjectival inflections, the auxiliary verbs and the semantics of verbal tenses, the function words, the rules for subordinate clauses, and, especially, in their vocabularies. While most of those differences are clearly due to independent development after the breakup of the Roman Empire (including invasions and cultural exchanges), one must also consider the influence of prior languages in territories of Latin Europe that fell under Roman rule, and possible heterogeneity in Vulgar Latin itself.\n\nRomanian, together with other related languages, like Aromanian, has a number of grammatical features which are unique within Romance, but are shared with other non-Romance languages of the Balkans, such as Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Turkish. These include, for example, the structure of the vestigial case system, the placement of articles as suffixes of the nouns (' = \"sky\", ' = \"the sky\"), and several more. This phenomenon, called the Balkan language area, may be due to contacts between those languages in post-Roman times.\n\nSome Romance languages form plurals by adding (derived from the plural of the Latin accusative case), while others form the plural by changing the final vowel (by influence of Latin nominative plural endings, such as ) from some masculine nouns.\n\nSome Romance languages use a version of Latin \"plus\", others a version of \"magis\".\n\nAlthough the Classical Latin word for \"nothing\" is ', the common word for \"nothing\" became ' in Italian (from neuter plural \"nulla\", \"no thing\", or from \"nulla res\"; Italian also has the word \"\") ' in Sardinian, ' in Spanish, Portuguese, and Galician (from \"(rem) natam\", \"thing born\"; Galician also has the word \"\"), ' in French, ' in Catalan, ' and ' in Aragonese, ' in Occitan (from \"rem\", \"thing\", or else from nominative \"res\"), ' in Romanian, ' in Romansh, ' in Venetian and Piedmontese, ' and ' in Lombard, and ' and ' in Friulian. Some argue that most roots derive from different parts of a Latin phrase \"nullam rem natam\" (\"no thing born\"), an emphatic idiom for \"nothing\". Meanwhile, Italian and Venetian \"niente\" and \"gnente\" would seem to be more logically derived from Latin \"ne(c) entem\" (\"no being\"), \"ne inde\" or, more likely, \"ne(c) (g)entem\", which also explains the French cognate word \"néant\". The Piedmontese negative adverb \"nen\" cames also directly from \"ne(c) (g)entem\", while \"gnente\" is borrowed from Italian.\n\nRomanian constructs the names of the numbers 11–19 by a regular Slavic-influenced pattern that could be translated as \"one-over-ten\", \"two-over-ten\", etc. All the other Romance languages use a pattern like \"one-ten\", \"two-ten\", etc. for 11–15, and the pattern \"ten-and-seven, \"ten-and-eight\", \"ten-and-nine\" for 17–19. For 16, however, they split into two groups: some use \"six-ten\", some use \"ten-and-six\":\nClassical Latin uses the \"one-ten\" pattern for 11–17 (\"ūndecim\", \"duodecim\", ... , \"septendecim\"), but then switches to \"two-off-twenty\" (\"duodēvigintī\") and \"one-off-twenty\" (\"ūndēvigintī\"). For the sake of comparison, note that English and German use two special words derived from \"one left over\" and \"two left over\" for 11 and 12, then the pattern \"three-ten\", \"four-ten\", ... , \"nine-ten\" for 13–19.\n\nThe verbs derived from Latin \"habēre\" \"to have\", \"tenēre\" \"to hold\", and \"esse\" \"to be\" are used differently in the various Romance languages, to express possession, to construct perfect tenses, and to make existential statements (\"there is\"). If we use T for \"tenēre\", H for \"habēre\", and E for \"esse\", we have the following distribution:\n\nFor example:\n\nAncient Galician-Portuguese used to employ the auxiliary H for permanent states, such as \"Eu hei um nome\" \"I have a name\" (i.e. for all my life), and T for non-permanent states \"Eu tenho um livro\" \"I have a book\" (i.e. perhaps not so tomorrow), but this construction is no longer used in modern Galician and Portuguese. Informal Brazilian Portuguese uses the T verb even in the existential sense, e.g. \"Tem água no copo\" \"There is water in the glass\".\n\nLanguages that have not grammaticalised *\"tenēre\" have kept it with its original sense \"hold\", e.g. Italian \"tieni il libro\", French \"tu tiens le livre\", Romanian \"ține cartea\", Friulian \"Tu tu tegnis il libri\" \"You're holding the book\". The meaning of \"hold\" is also retained to some extent in Spanish and Catalan.\n\nRomansh uses, besides \"igl ha\", the form \"i dat\" (literally: it gives), calqued from German \"es gibt\".\n\nSome languages use their equivalent of 'have' as an auxiliary verb to form the compound forms (e. g. French \"passé composé\") of all verbs; others use 'be' for some verbs and 'have' for others.\nIn the latter type, the verbs which use 'be' as an auxiliary are unaccusative verbs, that is, intransitive verbs that often show motion not directly initiated by the subject or changes of state, such as 'fall', 'come', 'become'. All other verbs (intransitive unergative verbs and all transitive verbs) use 'have'. For example, in French, \"J'ai vu\" or Italian \"ho visto\" 'I have seen' vs. \"Je suis tombé\", \"sono caduto\" 'I have (lit. am) fallen'. Note, however, the difference between French and Italian in the choice of auxiliary for the verb 'be' itself: Fr. \"J'ai été\" 'I have been' with 'have', but Italian \"sono stato\" with 'be'. In Southern Italian languages the principles governing auxiliaries can be quite complex, including even differences in persons of the subject. A similar distinction exists in the Germanic languages, which share a language area; German and the Scandinavian languages use 'have' and 'be', while modern English now uses 'have' only (although 'be' remains in certain relic phrases: \"Christ is risen\", \"Joy to the world: the Lord is come\").\n\n\"Be\" is also used for reflexive forms of the verbs, as in French \"j'ai lavé\" 'I washed [something]', but \"je me suis lavé\" 'I washed myself', Italian \"ho lavato\" 'I washed [something]' vs. \"mi sono lavato\" 'I washed myself'.\n\nTuscan uses \"si\" forms identical to the 3rd person reflexive in a usage interpreted as 'we' subject, triggering 'be' as auxiliary in compound constructions, with the subject pronoun \"noi\" 'we' optional. If the verb employed is one that otherwise selects 'have' as auxiliary, the past participle is unmarked: \"si è lavorato\" = \"abbiamo lavorato\" 'we (have) worked'. If the verb is one that otherwise selects 'be', the past participle is marked plural: \"si è arrivati\" = \"siamo arrivati\" 'we (have) arrived'.\n\nThe comparative method used by linguists to build family language trees is based on the assumption that the member languages evolved from a single proto-language by a sequence of binary splits, separated by many centuries. With that hypothesis, and the glottochronological assumption that the degree of linguistic change is roughly proportional to elapsed time, the sequence of splits can be deduced by measuring the differences between the members.\n\nHowever, the history of Romance languages, as we know it, makes the first assumption rather problematic. While the Roman Empire lasted, its educational policies and the natural mobility of its soldiers and administrative officials probably ensured some degree of linguistic homogeneity throughout its territory. Even if there were differences between the Vulgar Latin spoken in different regions, it is doubtful whether there were any sharp boundaries between the various dialects. On the other hand, after the Empire's collapse, the population of Latin speakers was separated—almost instantaneously, by the standards of historical linguistics—into a large number of politically independent states and feudal domains whose populations were largely bound to the land. These units then interacted, merged and split in various ways over the next fifteen centuries, possibly influenced by languages external to the family (as in the so-called Balkan language area).\n\nTo sum it up, the history of Latin and Romance-speaking peoples can hardly be described by a binary branching pattern; therefore, one may argue that any attempt to fit the Romance languages into a tree structure is inherently flawed. In this regard, the genealogical structure of languages forms a typical \"linkage\".\n\nOn the other hand, the tree structure may be meaningfully applied to any subfamilies of Romance whose members did diverge from a common ancestor by binary splits. That may be the case, for example, of the dialects of Spanish and Portuguese spoken in different countries, or the regional variants of spoken standard Italian (but not the so-called \"Italian dialects\", which are distinct languages evolved directly from Vulgar Latin).\n\nNevertheless, by applying the comparative method, some linguists have concluded that the earliest split in the Romance family tree was between Sardinian and the remaining group, called Continental Romance. Among the many peculiar Sardinian distinguishing features are its articles (derived from Latin \"IPSE\" instead of \"ILLE\") and retention of the \"hard\" sounds of \"c\" and \"g\" before \"e\" and \"i\". This view is challenged in part by the existence of definite articles continuing forms (e.g. \"sa mar\" 'the sea') in some varieties of Catalan, best known as typical of Balearic dialects.\n\nAccording to this view, the next split was between Romanian in the east, and the other languages (the Italo-Western languages) in the west. One of the characteristic features of Romanian is its retention of three of Latin's seven noun cases. The third major split was more evenly divided, between the Italian branch, which comprises many languages spoken in the Italian Peninsula, and the Gallo-Iberian branch.\n\nHowever, this is not the only view. Another common classification begins by splitting the Romance languages into two main branches, East and West. The East group includes Romanian, the languages of Corsica and Sardinia, and all languages of Italy south of a line through the cities of Rimini and La Spezia (see \"La Spezia–Rimini Line\"). Languages in this group are said to be more conservative, i.e. they retained more features of the original Latin.\n\nThe latter then split into a Gallo-Romance group, which became the Oïl languages (including French), Gallo-Italian, Occitan, Franco-Provençal and Romansh, and an Iberian Romance group which became Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nLinguists like Jean-Pierre Chambon claim that the various regional languages did not evolve in isolation from their neighbours; on the contrary, they see many changes propagating from the more central regions (Italy and France) towards the periphery (Iberian Peninsula and Romania). These authors see the Romance family as a linkage rather than a tree-like family, and insist that the Wave model is better suited than the Tree model for representing the history of Romance.\n\nIn a study by linguist Mario Pei (1949), the degrees of evolution of the Romance languages with respect to the ancestral Latin were found to be as follows\n\n"}

These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes.\n\nThe expression \"ecological land classification\" as understood in this article, is approximate with the biogeographical and ecological regionalisations in a scientific context (see biogeographic units).\n\nHowever, its actual usage is more approximate with a tool used for land management, in the context of environmental resource management.\n\nIn Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used. Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify ecosystems within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define ecological units. Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool.\n\nMany different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed.\n\nAmerican geographer Robert Bailey defines a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of in area), through meso-ecosystems (landscape mosaics, in the order of ) to macro-ecosystems (ecoregions, in the order of ).\n\nBailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: \"gestalt\" (\"a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts\"), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like geology, landforms and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; multivariate clustering of site attributes; digital image processing of remotely sensed data grouping areas based on their appearance or other spectral properties; or by a \"controlling factors method\" where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation physiognomy or the distribution of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems. \n\nIn contrast with Bailey's methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist Ariel Lugo and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on georeferenced, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.\n\nFollowing, a comparison of classification schemes and terms used in the study of the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and the Earth in ecology and other fields.\n\nIn ecology:\n\nIn biogeography:\n\nIn zoogeography:\n\nIn phytogeography:\n\n\nFor the physiognomic approach, see Vegetation#Classifications.\n\nFor the association (phytosociological) approach, see Phytosociology#Classificatory traditions.\n\nIn physiography:\n\nIn Geology:\n\nIn pedology (soil study):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Art-directed by Rudy VanderLans using fonts designed by his wife, Zuzana Licko, \"Emigre\" was one of the first publications to use Macintosh computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into desktop publishing (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.\n\nThe focus of \"Emigre\" was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared (Gail Swanlund, Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and Jeffery Keedy reappeared throughout the magazine's history.\n\nThe magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the émigré. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.\n\nBeginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of Vaughan Oliver at 4AD — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to Cranbrook, the Macintosh, type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of David Carson and Raygun.\n\nIncreasingly, \"Emigre\" became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of \"Emigre\" came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.\n\nEmigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD (\"Catfish,\" an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of Honey Barbara, The Grassy Knoll and Scenic.\n\nIn its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of \"Emigre\" were co-published by Princeton Architectural Press as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.\n\nThe magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285 mm x 425 mm (slightly shorter than 11\" x 17\" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5\" x 11\" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133 mm x 210 mm, plus a CD or DVD) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133 mm x 210 mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by Princeton Architectural Press.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1524244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1524244", "title": "Euskaltzaindia", "text": "Euskaltzaindia\n\nEuskaltzaindia (literally, \"group of keepers of the Basque language\"; often translated Royal Academy of the Basque Language) is the official academic language regulatory institution which watches over the Basque language. It carries out research on the language, seeks to protect it, and establishes standards of use. It is known in Spanish as La Real Academia de la Lengua Vasca (being under the royal patronage of the Spanish monarchy, like the Real Academia Española) and in French as Académie de la Langue Basque.\n\nThe academy was given status of a royal academy in 1976.\n\nThe Euskaltzaindia was established within the context of the Basque Renaissance (\"Eusko Pizkundea\", 1876–1936) in the framework provided by the Congress of Basque Studies held in Oñati in 1918, at a time when the Basque language was being proclaimed as a central cultural value to be protected and promoted. Important figures from the 19th century had already demanded the setting-up of an academy in defence of the language (Ulibarri, 1832; Aizkibel, 1856; d'Abbadie and Duvoisin, 1862; Jose Manterola, 1880 and Artiñano, 1886), and it was during the first two decades of the 20th century when various entities – some scientific and others more popular ones – also emphasized the need for its immediate creation. The scientific contributions of major foreign figures (Louis Lucien Bonaparte, Van Eys, Hugo Schuchardt, Dodgson, Gavel etc.) and from within the country (Arturo Campión, Azkue, Urquijo etc.), as well as the express demand on the part of Basque language loyalist organisations (for example, \"Eusko Esnalea\") created a favourable climate for the public authorities to take on the task of setting up the academy.\n\nThe first initiative in this direction came from the provincial government of Biscay, which the other three provincial governments in the peninsular part of the Basque Country subsequently joined (1918), with articles of association being approved and Euskaltzaindia being legally constituted in October 1919. One year later its journal \"Euskera\" was launched, the official organ for the publication of its rules and research work, which has survived to the present day.\n\nThe current internal structure and organisation can be summarised as follows: the academy is governed by a ruling body composed of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer. The heads of the Research and Watchdog Sections are also members. Plenary sessions must be held at least once a month. Under current rules the Academy has 24 full members and an unlimited number of associate members. The Academy is present throughout the area where Basque is used, with a head office in Bilbao and regional offices in Bayonne (Baiona), Donostia-San Sebastián, Iruñea-Pamplona and Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n\nThe Academy's articles of association set out the institution's objectives, first published in 1920. Those articles have been repeatedly reformed (and standing orders added) with the aim of adapting the institution to the linguistic and cultural circumstances of the day. However, the initial articles defining \"Euskaltzaindia\"'s ultimate goals have simply been ratified over the years, with new details being added where necessary (e.g. article 1 in 1976). The aims of the Academy were set out as follows in the original articles:\n\nArt. 1 – The aim of this institution is to watch over the Basque language, paying close attention to its promotion, both philologically and socially.\n\nArt. 2 – Accordingly, the Academy deals with both these areas in their respective sections: the Research Section and the Tutelary Section, with members belonging to both.\n\nIt is thus clear that the work of Euskaltzaindia is concerned with both the corpus and the status of the language. Since then the Academy has maintained these two sections in order to carry out its mission.\n\nIn the decade and a half prior to the Spanish Civil War (1919–1936), the Academy managed to consolidate itself as an institution and set about its project of promoting the birth of a standard literary language, although it was unable to provide a precise, solid academic formulation for that aim. On the other hand, its work in that period contributed decisively to a better understanding of the language through Resurrección María de Azkue's studies (\"Morfología Vasca\", 1923–1934) and far reaching surveys among speakers of the language (\"Erizkizundi Irukoitza\", from 1922 onwards). The journal \"Euskera\" is a faithful witness to the work carried out at the time.\n\nIn 1936 and the years which followed, under the language politics of Francoist Spain the Academy's previous activities were reduced to silence until Azkue, with the collaboration of Federico Krutwig, was able to timidly reinitiate academic life at the beginning of the 1950s. The articles of association were reformed in 1954, new full members were elected and from 1956 on the Academy started to enjoy a more settled existence both in its internal affairs and in its public conferences and open meetings (first postwar congress: Arantzazu, 1956).\n\nThe following decade (1956–1968) coincided with a new generation of collaborators, the increasing introduction of Basque in bilingual non-state schools (ikastolak), the revival of the Basque language press and the first attempts at teaching basic literacy in Basque, among other initiatives.\n\nThe Euskaltzaindia has been a vocal and active advocate of the introduction of a unified dialect of the Basque language, known as \"Euskera Batúa\", or Unified Basque. Basque has been usually divided into 8 different dialects, varying in their level of mutual intelligibility. The first detailed dialectical analysis was by Louis Lucien Bonaparte. However, many people have seen this as a weakness in the language's fight for survival in a world in which minority languages spoken in states are wiped out by the states' official language. Having been for centuries pressured on both sides by Spanish and French, and under the rule of Franco coming close to extinction, the Academy felt the need to create a unified dialect of Basque, in order that the language have a greater chance of survival. Unified of Basque was heavily based on the Gipuzkoan dialect – the dialect with the richest literary heritage.\n\nThe 1968 Arantzazu Congress laid down the basic guidelines for achieving that objective in a systematic way (lexicon, morphology, declension and spelling). A further step was taken in 1973 with a proposal to establish a standard conjugation.\n\nThe debate arising from this new set of standard language rules (1968–1976) did not prevent it from becoming increasingly accepted in teaching, the media, and administration (1976–1983), within the context of burgeoning regional government (Statute of Autonomy in Euskadi, 1979; Improvement of the Charter of Navarre, 1982). Many people, however, continue to oppose the imposition of a single created dialect of Basque.\n\n\"Euskaltzaindia\" counsels the Basque administrations wishing to officialize Basque place names.\nIt is funded by the Biscayne, Gipuzkoan, Alavese, Navarrese, Spanish, and French authorities for culture.\n\n"}

That specific individual is the central focus of the sexual activity; for example, it could be one woman surrounded by several men or a man with multiple women. Rather than serial couplings by two people, the gang bang is defined by the number and simultaneity of the various sex acts, such as vaginal, anal or oral sex or double penetration or triple penetration.\n\nThe largest gang bangs are sponsored by pornographic film companies, and recorded, but a gang bang is not unusual in the swinger community. It is more often considered to have multiple men and one woman, while a so-called \"reverse gang-bang\" (one man and many women), which can be seen in pornography, is rare in real life. Male-on-male gangbangs also happen.\n\nGang bangs are not defined by the precise number of participants, but usually involve more than three people and may involve a dozen or more. When the gang bang is organized specifically to culminate with the (near) simultaneous or rapid serial ejaculations of all male participants on the central man or woman, then it may be referred to by the Japanese term \"bukkake.\n\nBy contrast, three people engaged in sex is normally referred to as a \"threesome\", and four people are normally referred to as a \"foursome.\" Gang bangs also differ from group sex, such as threesomes and foursomes, in that most (if not all) sexual acts during a gang bang are centered on or performed with just the central person. Although the participants of a gang bang may know each other, the spontaneity and anonymity of participants is often part of the attraction. Additionally, the other participants normally do not engage in sex acts with each other, but may stand nearby and masturbate while waiting for an opportunity to engage in sexual activity.\n\nThough there have been numerous gang bang pornographic films since the 1980s, they usually involved no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. However, starting with \"The World's Biggest Gangbang\" (1995) starring Annabel Chong, the pornographic industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gangbang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period.\n\nThese kinds of films were financially successful, winning AVN Awards for the best selling pornographic films of their year; however, the events were effectively unofficiated and the record-breaking claims often misleading. Jasmin St. Claire described her \"record\", purportedly set with 300 men in \"World's Biggest Gang Bang 2\", as \"among the biggest cons ever pulled off in the porn business\", with merely about 30 men \"strategically placed and filmed,\" only ten of whom were actually able to perform sexually on camera.\n\n\n"}

By comparison, the traditional honorifics of Miss, Mrs, Ms and Mr all indicate the binary gender of the individual.\n\nThe newer term \"Mx\" avoids specifying gender not only for persons who wish not to indicate a binary gender (male or female) but also for persons whose gender identity does not fit the gender binary. Honorifics are used in situations when it is inappropriate to refer to someone only by their first or last name, such as when addressing a letter \"Dear Mx Jones\" or when introducing the person to others. Activists, supporters and others are working toward awareness and acceptance of alternative honorifics including Mx.\n\nNote that in Britain, honorifics are not ended with a period, while in the United States a period is used with the honorifics \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\" because they are abbreviations (for master and mistress), as well as with \"Ms.\" in order to preserve the form. \"Miss\" is not ended with a period because it is not an abbreviated form of a longer word. In Britain the periods are not included since where the period is placed there are no letters elided from the word.\n\nMx is a title commonly used by non-binary people as well as those who do not identify with the gender binary, which was first written about in the 1970s. Nat Titman spoke about its usage and brought it into popular acceptance. Among all other gender neutral titles, Mx is the most commonly used one, and is accepted by government and other organisations throughout the UK.\n\nThe \"x\" is intended to stand as a wildcard character, and does not imply a \"mixed\" gender. \"Mx\" is usually pronounced \"mix\" or with a schwa, \"məx\".\n\nMisc or sometimes 'misk' is another gender title pronoun. The word is derived from the Latin word miscellus, meaning “mixed,” following the rationale that a lot of non-binary people would say that they have aspects of various genders at various times.\n\nIn a 2016 international survey of non-binary participants, 0.8% of over 3,000 participants preferred the title Misc.\n\nInd, which stands for Individual, is a newly created gender neutral title. This title may be more appropriate for those who do not feel Mx meets their gender neutral standards, as Mx can sometimes be taken to stand for \"mix\". Ind was created to be free of gender, entirely, thus making it a better option for agender and gender nonconforming persons.\n\nIn a survey of over 3,000 nonbinary people in 2016, around 2.5% of nonbinary people used the title Ind.\n\nThere are a number of titles, such as Dr and Professor, that are used regardless of gender by those qualified to use them. However, those professional titles being a legacy of the noninclusive past, Dx has been proposed as a title for doctors to denote a non-binary gender identity.\n\n"}

He was arrested in July 1941, and held at the prison Møllergata 19 until September 1943. After a period at the Grini concentration camp he was transported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany in November 1943, and stayed there the rest of the war. In Sachsenhausen, he was selected as \"postmaster\", distributing post, a position which gave him a good overview of other prisoners. By 1945, he could bring collected material on the fate of many prisoners to Sweden. He continued the registration work for the Norwegian Legation in Stockholm, and later for the Government in Oslo.

There is no restriction that the writer is not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.\n\nDuring the 58 regular and retro nomination years, 98 writers have been nominated; 21 of these have won, including ties. David Langford has received the largest number of awards, with 21 wins out of 31 nominations. He was nominated every year from 1979 through 2009, and won 19 times in a row from 1989 through 2007. The other writers to win more than once are Richard E. Geis, with seven wins out of sixteen nominations; Mike Glyer, with four wins out of twenty-five nominations; Susan Wood Glicksohn, with three of eight; Harry Warner, Jr., with two out of eight; Wilson Tucker, with two out of seven; Bob Shaw, who won both times he was nominated; Forrest J Ackerman, with two out of four Retro Hugos; and Ray Bradbury, who won both Retro Hugos he was nominated for. The writers with the most nominations without winning are Evelyn C. Leeper, who was nominated twelve times in a row from 1990 through 2001, and Steven H Silver, whose twelve nominations span 2000-2013.\n\nThe Hugo Awards are presented every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\", and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award. The award has been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\". In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fan writer award has been given each time.\n\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and in a different city around the world each year.\n\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Writers are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. In some years writers who received sufficient nominations to be listed on the ballot declined; these are marked as withdrawn in the entry and are not listed on the main Hugo Award site. \n\n  *   Winners and joint winners\n\nBeginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of \"Retro Hugos\", in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior.

{"id": "52988789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52988789", "title": "Kuwaiti Persian", "text": "Kuwaiti Persian\n\nKuwaiti Persian, known in Kuwait as ʿīmi and spelled Eimi in some works is a dying (endangered) combination of different varieties of the Persian language and Achomi language that has been spoken in Kuwait for more than two centuries. Persian was spoken since the foundation of Kuwait, especially in the Sharg district of the historical Kuwait City, where families that emigrated from Persia had settled. \n\nKuwaitis of Iranian ancestry are called Ayam (). After conducting research about the usage of Persian language in Kuwait in 2004, Abdulmuhsen Dashti, a professor at Kuwait University, projects that the Persian language will disappear in Ayam families within two generations.\n\nKuwait is a country with no indigenous population. Starting in the eighteenth century, many people started emigrating to Kuwait seeking better life and escaping persecution. The immigration happened mainly (but not only) from territories geographically close to Kuwait, including Eastern Province of the nowadays Saudi Arabia, Nejd, Persia (nowadays called Iran) and Iraq. Immigrants from Persia were the basis of multilingualism in Kuwait, since they brought with them a completely different and distinct language than Arabic. It is projected that more than 30% of Kuwaiti citizens are Ayam. \n\nMost Ayam resided in the Sharg historical district in the old Kuwait City, thus forming a linguistic enclave that preserved the language for generations until the discovery of oil. They communicated in Persian between each other, and did not mingle a lot with Arabic speakers who resided in other districts of Kuwait City until after the industrialisation of Kuwait and Kuwait City that scattered people who lived in the districts of Kuwait City to the suburbs. The linguistic enclave wasn't there any longer and Ayam had to learn Kuwaiti Arabic to survive in the new environment.\n\nThe Persian emigrants spoke a variety of dialects and sub-dialects. This mixture came to be called 'imi ([language] of the Ayam in Arabic and Persian), over generations, the variety of Persian spoken today by Ayam developed. As all Ayam acquired Kuwaiti Arabic by time, Kuwaiti Persian is expected to be gone within no more than two generations. Ayam people who still speak Persian are bilingual in both Kuwait Arabic and Persian, while most young Ayam nowadays are native speakers of Kuwaiti Arabic only.\n\n`imi has no official status and it is not standardised. As a Koine, `imi is often seen as a \"childish\" patois by the public.\n\nBelow is a table the compares some words in Kuwaiti and Standard Persian, as collected by Batoul Hasan. Some changes seen in Kuwaiti Persian are also common in other non-standard Persian dialects in Iran as well.\n\nThe anti-preservation attitude of the Kuwaiti government towards the Persian language led and will eventually lead to the disappearance of the language in the Kuwaiti society, as Abdulmuhsen Dashti projects. The government tried and tries to delegitimise the use of `imi in as many domains as possible.\n\nSome Ayam reported unwillingness to pass the language to future generations for pragmatic reasons, as it will hurdle integration into the dominant culture. The minority group may feel pressure to abandon ties that could be interpreted as showing belonging to other countries, in this case Iran, as Persian is synonymous with Iranian for a lot of Kuwaitis, and the Persian language is actually called Iranian (Kuwaiti Arabic: إيراني) in Kuwaiti Arabic. In several interview conducted by PhD student Batoul Hasan, several have shown hesitation to use or learn Persian due to stigmatisation and prejudice. One person said: \"We live in an Arab country where Arabic is the main language and Eimi has no place in this society.\", \"Speaking Eimi is a sensitive issue that could erupt. It would be more acceptable to speak Israeli (Hebrew) in public, but when you speak Farsi due to societies prejudices you are asking for problems\". Many thought that Persian has no place and no use in the Kuwaiti society, as Arabic is the language of Kuwait (according to them). Multilingualism was not favourable, in the eyes of people interviewed by Batoul, unless it involved the acquisition of Arabic and English. Some people even believed that the acquisition of Kuwaiti Persian as a first or second language may affect the acquisition of Arabic.\n\nThe Persian language in general has been considered a threat by some Sunni Islamists. In 2012, MP Muhammad Hassan al-Kandari called for a \"firm action\" against an advertisement for teaching Persian.. The Kuwaiti TV series Karimo received some criticism for showing Kuwaiti actors speaking fluent Persian; with some calling it a dictated enforcement of Iranian culture on the Kuwaiti society.\n\nIn the educated circle, Persian is seen as a language with high cultural value. According to an Iranian cultural advisor to Kuwait, Khameyar said that a lot of Kuwaitis speak Persian proudly. He also added that many state officials carry conversations in Persian; including non-Ayam Kuwaitis who speak and answer in Persian with embassy officials. Khameyar also expressed his surprise from the reception their Persian language courses had received.\n\nPersian is taught in many institutes across Kuwait, including academic institutes, such as Kuwait University, diplomatic cultural institutes, such as the Iranian Embassy cultural office, language institutes, such as Berlitz, and religious institutes, such as Al-Imam Al-Mujtaba seminaries.\n\n\n\n"}

As a child, he was abducted by the Ottomans according to the \"devşirme\" system and raised as a Muslim in Edirne. A capable soldier, he was married to a daughter of Sultan Mehmed II. After distinguishing himself at the Siege of Belgrade (1456), he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding Zaganos Pasha. Throughout his tenure, he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest of Thessaly in 1394, the ruling Angeloi Philanthropenoi family took refuge. The grandchildren of either Alexios or Manuel were Mahmud Pasha and his brother Mihailo Anđelović. He may have also been related to the noblemen Alessio and Peter Spani through Alexios III Angelos, who was possibly their ancestor. Although the contemporary Byzantine sources and Ibn Kemal calls him Serbian, some late Ottoman sources call him Croatian.\n\nIt is estimated that Angelović was born in the early 1420s. Most historians accept that Angelović was born in Novo Brdo in the Serbian Despotate, and that his father Mihailos was the son of either Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos or his son/nephew/brother Manuel, rulers of Thessaly. T. Stavrides views it more probable that Manuel was his grandfather. The only information on his father is that he lived in Serbia in the 1420s. His mother's ancestry is the matter of debate. Chalkokondyles (1430–1470) called her Serbian, Kritoboulos (1410–1470), Greek, while there are various theories on her noble ancestry. Angelović had a brother, Mihailo Anđelović, later a prominent Serbian statesman.\n\nAccording to T. Yazici / \"Encyclopædia Iranica\", Angelović was \"born to a Greek or Serbian family\".\n\nChalkokondyles mentions that Angelović was captured by Ottoman horsemen while traveling with his mother from Novo Brdo to Smederevo (the Serbian capital), and taken to the Ottoman court. It is assumed that this took place in 1427, when the Ottomans attacked Serbia. Furthermore, it is unconcluded whether he was captured according to the \"devşirme\" practice, the regular practice of taking children of conquered noble families, or as a prisoner of war. Taşköprüzade (d. 1560) and Aşık Çelebi (1520–1572) name two other boys led with Angelović on horseback to Edirne, Molla Iyas and Mevlana Abdülkerim, the latter which reached the rank of \"kadıasker\" (chief judge) and \"şeyhülislam\" (Islamic scholar). Upon conversion to Islam, he received the name Mahmud.\n\nLittle is known about his activities before 1453. According to T. Stavrides, Angelović and his companions were educated in the palace, probably as \"içoğlan\", and Mahmud then entered service in the Enderûn, later serving prince Mehmed, the future sultan. Sources do not agree on which posts he held at the palace.\n\nMahmud Pasha was a capable soldier. After distinguishing himself at the Siege of Belgrade (1456), he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding Zaganos Pasha. Throughout his tenure he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns.\n\nIn 1458, the Serbian Despot Lazar Branković died. Mahmud's brother Mihailo became member of a collective regency, but he was soon deposed by the anti-Ottoman and pro-Hungarian faction in the Serbian court. In reaction, Mahmud attacked and seized Smederevo Fortress, although the citadel held out, and seized some additional strongholds in its vicinity. Threatened by a possible Hungarian intervention however he was forced to withdraw south and join the forces of Sultan Mehmed II at Skopje. In 1461, he accompanied Mehmed in his campaign against the Empire of Trebizond, the last surviving fragment of the Byzantine Empire. Mahmud negotiated the surrender of the city of Trebizond with the \"protovestiarios\", the scholar George Amiroutzes, who was also his cousin.\n\nIn 1463, Mahmud led the invasion and conquest of the Ottoman vassal state of Bosnia, even though a peace treaty between Bosnia and the Ottomans had just been renewed. He captured the Bosnian king, Stephen Tomašević, at Ključ, and obtained from him the cession of the country to the Empire.\n\nAngelović accompanied Mehmed II when he attacked Albania Veneta in the summer of 1467, and ravaged the lands. For 15 days he pursued Skanderbeg, who was a Venetian ally at the time, but failed to find him, as Skanderbeg retreated into the mountains and then succeeded in fleeing to the coast. According to Tursun Beg and Ibn Kemal, Angelović swam over Bojana, attacked Venetian-controlled Scutari, and plundered the surrounding area.\n\nMahmud was dismissed in 1468 due to the machinations of his successor, Rum Mehmed Pasha, ostensibly due to irregularities regarding the resettlement of the Karamanids in Constantinople following the conquest of Karaman earlier in that year. He was reinstated in 1472, but his relations with the Sultan were now strained. He was dismissed and executed in 1474, allegedly because of Mehmed's son, prince Mustafa. Mahmud had been at loggerheads with Mustafa after divorcing his second wife for spending a night in the same house as Mustafa during Mahmud's absence on campaign in 1473. Mustafa's death later in 1474 was even attributed by later accounts to poisoning by Mahmud.\n\nMahmud Pasha wrote works in Persian and Turkish with \"Adni\" as his nom de plume. He composed a \"divan\" in Persian composed of 45 \"ghazals\" and 21 \"mofrads\", and wrote several \"successful \"naziras\" on the \"ghazals\" of Zahir Faryabi and Hafez\". Mahmud Pasha also wrote numerous \"official letters in Persian\".\n\nHe married Selçuk Hatun, daughter of Zaganos Pasha, by his wife Sitti Nefise Hatun, and had a son named Ali Bey and a daughter named Hatice Hatun.\n\n"}

Balaram (Njalile Veettil Edavalathu Balaraman) (20 November 1919 – 16 July 1994) was one of the founding leaders of the communist movement in Kerala, India. A Marxist ideologue, scholar in Indian Philosophy and a well known literary critic in Malayalam, he wrote on the history of the communist movement in Kerala, which is considered as the most authentic record of the early period. He also authored several works in history, philosophy, politics, and literature.\n\nBalaram was born on 20 November 1919 in Pinarayi, a village near Tellicherry Town in the Kannur District of India. Incidentally, Pinarayi is the birthplace of the Communist Party of India in kerala, where it held its first meeting in 1939. Young Balaram (His real name was Balaraman, which was somehow shortened to Balaram) was an active member of that landmark conference held in a house near the village library, hardly 200 meters away from his home. He did schooling at a nearby village school. He studied up to 8th standard, which was considered (comparatively) a good school education at that time. After completing school, he became a faculty in a nearby school for a while. By then he was a known scholar in Sanskrit and Indian philosophy and had a good taste for spirituality which ultimately took him to the Ramkrishna Mission in Calcutta. There he spent several months learning more about the Vedas, the Upanishads and other ancient texts. He was dissatisfied with the ashram activities and returned to Kannur, a discontented young atheist.\n\nImmediately upon return he jumped into political activities as a Congress worker. A socialist group had already been formed in the Congress by that time at the national level and some of the Kerala leaders showed interest in that group. Within a short while Balram too became a member of the Socialist group. In 1938 he attended the 51st session of the Indian National Congress held in Haripura, Gujarat, where the socialist group came out openly against the policies of the Congress.\n\nBack in Malabar the Congress socialist group started the ground work to build a Communist movement in the state. P. Krishna Pillai, K. Damodaran, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, and N. C. Sekhar were the first team of leaders who took up this cause for which they met unofficially. Then came the historic meeting in Pinarayi, where the entire socialist leadership decided to convert to the Communist Party. The young Balaram was one of the main organizers of this first meeting of the Communist Party of Kerala. The meeting was presided by Com. P. Krishna Pillai, who was elected as the Secretary of the party on that day.\nAll the senior members of the team were very happy about the meeting and all of them congratulated the organizers and especially the young Balaram for his organizational abilities. Even before the meeting, he had held informal discussions with top leaders like P. Krishna Pillai and theoretician K. Damodaran. They recognized him as a good communist and gave all support. He was actively involved in organizing the party. He was arrested by the police several times and imprisoned for almost six years. He was Secretary of the party in the Kottayam Taluk in the 1940s.\n\nIn 1957, he was elected to the first Kerala Legislative Assembly from the Mattannur constituency. In 1960, he again represented Mattannur. In 1964, when the communist movement split into two on some ideological differences, Balaram stood with the original group known as the CPI (Communist Party of India). He was a member from the Tellicherry constituency to the Legislative body in 1970. He became a minister in the C. Achutha Menon ministry and held important portfolios like Industry and Public Relations. Next year he resigned from the ministry to take charge as the State Secretary of the Communist party of India. He held that post till 1984. Then he became the Secretary of the National Council of the party as well as the Member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He held both the posts till his death. He was the leader of the party in parliament also. He headed a Constitutional Reform Committee of the party when the Soviet Crisis erupted.\n\nHe was a passionate reader of world literature and a critic of Malayalam literature. He wrote several books on various subjects, which include economics, physics, history, philosophy, politics and archaeology. Once, he was invited by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to help the team of archaeologists who held excavation in Vijaya Nagara, knowing fully that he was an expert in Pali language. During his last days he vehemently opposed the Hindutva Movement under the Bharatiya Janata Party and wrote books and articles against their activities. His voice was heard even by opponents as it always contained valuable and authentic information and clear analysis.\n\nHe died of a cardiac arrest on 16 July 1994, aged 75. He is survived by his wife and four children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54541774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54541774", "title": "Neon noir", "text": "Neon noir\n\nNeon-noir cinema is a contemporary rendering of the film noir. A subset of the neo-noir genre, both take their name from the films noir: the highly stylised Hollywood crime dramas of the 1940s and 1950s. The term film noir when translated to English reads \"dark film\", alluding to the genre's dark or sinister sensibilities. This shaded undertone is highly characteristic of films noir, also marked by their dramatic use of lighting and shadow play, hard-boiled and often complex plot lines, reversed stereotypes, the presence of crime and violence, off-centre and tilted camera angles, cityscape shots or montages, and dreamlike aesthetic, to name but a few.\n\nNeon-noir, like the neo-noir, adopts many of the same sensibilities as the noirs they hark back to. What distinguishes the neon-noir from the larger bracket of neo-noir, is primarily its recollection of the genre's highly stylised use of light. Neon-noir films are characterised by their hyper visual nature; utilising vibrant colours, dynamic (man made) lighting, and highly designed cinematic style to underpin the more seedy elements of the films noir, especially heightening their dream-like aesthetic.\n\nThe term film noir was originally coined by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, though wasn’t popularised in the cinematic vocabulary or used in film criticism until much later. Due to the term’s retroactive up-take, contemporary films of the neo, and more specifically, neon-noir genre, are endowed with a heightened self-awareness of their borrowings from the era of film noir. The presence of crime and violence, hyper-stylised aesthetic, moral ambiguity, and complex narratives continue to permeate the contemporary genre, but with updated themes, and use of technology and media that were absent from the noir films of the 40’s and 50’s. \nThese characteristics permeate the films of the contemporary genre with their thematic content, aesthetic and sensibility as harking back to the film noir period.\n\nNeon-noir film borrows from and reflects many of the characteristics of the film noir: a presence of crime, violence, complex characters and plot-lines, mystery, ambiguity and moral ambivalence, all come into play in the neon-noir genre. But more so than the superficial traits of the genre, neon noir emphasises the socio-critique of film noir, recalling the specific socio-cultural dimensions of the interwar years when noirs first became prominent; a time of global existential crisis, depression and the mass movement of rural persons towards the cities. Long shots or montages of cityscapes, often portrayed as dark and menacing were suggestive of what Dueck referred to as a ‘bleak societal perspective’, providing a critique on global capitalism and consumerism. Other tactics also made use of heavily stylised lighting techniques such the chiaroscuro juxtaposition of light and dark, with neon signs and brightly lit buildings providing a sense of alienation and entrapment.\n\nAccentuating the already present use of artificial or neon lighting in the noir films of the 40’s and 50’s, neon-noir films imbue this aesthetic style with electrifying colour and manipulated light to accentuate their socio-cultural critique as backdrop to thematic references to contemporary and pop culture. In doing so, films of the neon-noir genre orbit the themes of urban decay, consumerist decadence and capitalism, existentialism, sexuality and issues of race and violence in the contemporary cultural landscape, not only of America, but the globalised world at large.\n\nNeon-noirs seek to bring the contemporary noir, somewhat diluted under the umbrella of neo-noir, back into the exploration of culture: class, race, gender, patriarchy, capitalism are key thematic references and departures for the neon-noir; an existential confrontation of society in a hyper technological and golbalised world. Illustrating society as decadent and consumerist, and identity as confused and anxious, neon-noirs reposition the contemporary noir in urban decay, often setting their scenes in the underground city-haunts; brothels, nightclubs, casinos, strip bars, pawnshops, Laundromats, etc.\n\nNeon noirs were popularised in the 70’s and 80’s by films like \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"Blade Runner\" (1982), and David Lynch films such as \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and later, \"Lost Highway\" (1997). In the more current cinematic landscape, films like Harmony Korine’s highly provocative \"Spring Breakers\", and Danny Boyle’s \"Trance\" (2013) have been especially recognised for their neon-infused rendering of the noir genre; While \"Trance\" was celebrated for ‘shak(ing) the ingredients (of the noir) like coloured sand in a jar’, \"Spring Breakers\" notoriously produced a slew of criticism referring to its ‘fever-dream’ aesthetic and ‘neon-caked explosion of excess’ (Kohn). Another neon-noir endowed with the 'fever-dream' aesthetic is The Persian Connection, expressly linked to Lynchian aesthetics as a neon-drenched contemporary noir.\n\nNeon-noir can be seen as a response to the over-use of the term neo-noir. While the contemporary term neo-noir functions to bring the noir into the contemporary landscape, it has been often criticised for its dilution of the noir genre, Arnett commenting on its ‘amorphous’ reach: ‘any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies’, and Cawelti recognising its ‘generic exhaustion’. The neon-noir, more specifically, seeks to revive the noir sensibilities in a more targeted manner of reference, focalising especially its socio-cultural commentary and hyper-stylised aesthetic.\n\n\nArnett, R.

It is also spoken in parts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh. Odia is one of the many official languages of India; it is the official language of Odisha and the second official language of Jharkhand. The language is also spoken by a sizeable population of at least 1 million people in Chhattisgarh.\n\nOdia is the sixth Indian language to be designated a Classical Language in India on the basis of having a long literary history and not having borrowed extensively from other languages. The earliest known inscription in Odia dates back to the 10th century AD.\n\nOdia is mainly spoken in the state of Odisha, but there are significant Odia-speaking populations in the neighbouring states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh; as well as in the neighbouring country of Bangladesh.\n\nDue to the increasing migration of labour, the west Indian state of Gujarat also has a significant population of Odia speakers, with Surat being the city with largest Odia-speaking population in Gujarat. Significant numbers of Odia speakers can also be found in the cities of Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Chennai, Goa, Mumbai, Raipur, Jamshedpur, Baroda, Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Guwahati, Shillong, Pune, and Silvassa.\n\nThe Odia diaspora constitute a sizeable number in several countries around the world, totalling the number of Odia speakers on a global scale to 55 million. It has a significant presence in eastern countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, mainly carried by the sadhaba, ancient traders from Odisha who carried the language along with the culture during the old-day trading, and in western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and England as well. The language has also spread to Burma, Malaysia, Fiji, Sri Lanka and Middle East countries.\n\nKataki Odia or \"The Odia of Mughalbandi region\" is considered as Standard Odia due to literary traditions.Also worth mentioning that spoken Standard of Odia is much different than literary Odia. It is spoken mainly in the eastern half of the state of Odisha, in districts like Khordha, Puri, Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada, Dhenkanal, Angul and Nayagarh district with not much variation.\n\n\nOdia's minor dialects include:\n\n\nOdia is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from an OdraMagadhi Prakrit similar to Ardha Magadhi, which was spoken in eastern India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early Jain texts. Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from Persian and Arabic, compared to other major North Indian languages.\n\nThe history of the Odia language is divided into eras:\n\n\nThe beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of \"charya sahitya\", the literature started by Vajrayana Buddhist poets such as in the \"Charyapada\". This literature was written in a specific metaphor called twilight language and prominent poets included Luipa, Tilopa and Kanha. Quite importantly, the Ragas that have mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in latter Odia literature.\n\nJayadeva was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an Utkala Brahmin family of Puri in circa 1200 AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem Gita Govinda, which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of Jayadeva's literary contribution changed the pattern of versification in Odia.\n\nJohn Beames, a British author and civil servant in British India who stayed for a considerable time in Odisha and worked for the survival of Odia language quotes:\n\nAt a period when Odia was already a fixed and settled language, Bengali did not exist. The Bengalis spoke a vast variety of corrupt forms of Eastern Hindi. It is not till quite recent times that we find anything that can with propriety be called a Bengali language.\n\nDialects have bit of variety from the literary language, and Bengal circulated in a vast region so that it have some varieties, called dialects. Odia circulated in a small region and less no of speaker that's why variety is very less, rather it have a similarity to Bengali language.\n\nWe may place the Hindi with its subsidiary forms Gujurati and Punjabi first fixing their rise and establishment as a modern languages distinct from their previous existence as Prakrit till the 12th or 13th century. Odia must have quite completed its transformation by the end of the 14th century. Bengali was no separate independent language but a maze of dialects without a distinct national or provincial type till the 17th or beginning of the 18th century. It was not till the gradual decay of the central Mohammedan power of Delhi enabled the provincial governors to assume an independent position that Bengali severed itself from Hindi and assumed characteristics which now vindicate for its right to be called a separate language.\nOdia has twenty-eight consonant phonemes, two semivowel phonemes and six vowel phonemes.\n\nAll vowels except also have nasal counterparts, but these are not always contrastive. Final vowels are standard and pronounced, e.g. Odia contra Bengali \"flower\".\n\nThe velar nasal is given phonemic status in some analyses. Nasals assimilate for place in nasal–stop clusters. have the flap allophones in intervocalic position and in final position (but not at morpheme boundaries). Stops are sometimes deaspirated between and a vowel or an open syllable +vowel and a vowel. Some speakers distinguish between single and geminate consonants.\n\nUnlike Hindi, Odia retains most of the cases of Sanskrit, though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.\n\nThe earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries. Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc. In the 14th century, the poet Sarala Dasa's wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess Durga. Rama-bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the Panchasakha Age and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature. Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Yasovanta, Ananta and Acyutananda. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the Usabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Dasa, the Rahasya-manjari of Deva-durlabha Dasa and the Rukmini-bibha of Kartikka Dasa. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, Bhima Bhoi, Dhivara, Sadasiva and Sisu Isvara-dasa composed another form called kavyas (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the Bhanja Age (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet Upendra Bhanja (1670–1720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the Bengali and Assamese scripts, the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the Tamil script and Telugu script. Amos Sutton produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and \"An Introductory Grammar of Oriya\" (1844).\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. Sarala Dasa who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the Vyasa of Odisha. He translated the Mahabharata into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially devotional poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja and Kabisurya Baladev Ratha.\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, Kabibar Radhanath Ray (1849–1908), Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843–1918) and Madhusudan Rao (1853–1912) made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924-1936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar (1907-1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like \"Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala\", etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971-72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal (1875–1928), Gangadhar Meher (1862–1924), Chintamani Mahanti and Kuntala-Kumari Sabat Utkala-Bharati, besides Niladri Dasa and Gopabandhu Das (1877–1928). The most notable novelists were Umesa Sarakara, Divyasimha Panigrahi, Gopala Praharaja and Kalindi Charan Panigrahi. Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were Godabarisha Mohapatra, Mayadhara Manasimha, Nityananda Mahapatra and Kunjabihari Dasa. Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi is known for his translations of some western classics apart from Udayanatha Shadangi, Sunanda Kara and Surendranatha Dwivedi. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor Girija Shankar Ray, Pandit Vinayaka Misra, Professor Gauri Kumara Brahma, Jagabandhu Simha and Harekrushna Mahatab. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the Odia people who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers Manoj Das's creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include Fakir Mohan Senapati, Madhusudan Das, Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Surendra Mohanty, Manoj Das, Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, Jagadish Mohanty, Sarojini Sahoo, Yashodhara Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like Kabibar Radhanath Ray, Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, Ramakanta Rath, Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.\n\nAnita Desai's novella, \"Translator Translated\", from her collection \"The Art of Disappearance\", features a translator of a fictive Odian short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.\n\nFour writers in Odia - Gopinath Mohanty, Sachidananda Routray, Sitakant Mahapatra and Pratibha Ray - have been awarded the Jnanpith, a prestigious Indian literary award.\n\nThe first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Odia:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16252027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16252027", "title": "Ram Ganesh Gadkari", "text": "Ram Ganesh Gadkari\n\nRam Ganesh Gadkari (May 26, 1885 - January 23, 1919) was a Marathi poet, playwright, and humorist from Maharashtra, India.\n\nRam Ganesh Gadkari was one of the writers the in new age transformation in Marathi literature. He wrote poetry under the pen name \"Govindagraj\" and humorous articles under the pen name \"Balakram\". He wrote plays under his legal name.\n\nGadkari was born on May 26, 1885 in a Marathi Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family in the town of \"Ganadevi\" in Navsari district of Gujarat. He died at Saoner near Nagpur on January 23, 1919.\n\nHis father Ganesh Raghunath[Vasudeo] Gadkari died on 24 September 1893, and poverty hindered his timely formal education. He finished his high school education at age 19 and enrolled in Pune's Fergusson College. However, flunking in the mathematics examination, he abandoned his formal education at the end of the first year in college, and took up teaching to support himself while pursuing his keen literary interests. \n\nTill 19 years of his age, he was unable to speak Marathi. Afterwards, he read and studied Marathi, Sanskrit, and English literature extensively. He critically studied particularly the works of Sanskrit playwrights Kalidas and Bhavabhuti; modern Marathi poets of his era Keshavasuta and Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar; Marathi poets of earlier times like Dnyaneshwar and Moropant; and English writers like Shakespeare, Percy Shelley, and Mark Twain.\n\nGadkari was married twice.His first wife Sitabai had left him though according to some contemporaries it was he who had abandoned her. His second wife Rama was younger by some 17 years than him but this too proved to be not a very happy marriage. Gadkari was bitterly disappointed when he realized that marital bliss that he was seeking was not going to come his way.\n\nWithin his short life span of 35 years, Gadkari produced four complete plays, three unfinished plays, 150 poems, and some \nhumorous articles. (On the day of his death, he had finished writing just a few hours earlier his play \"Bhava Bandhan\" (भावबंधन).) Literary critics have judged all of his works to be of very high caliber.\n\nCelebrated playwright, Vijay Tendulkar considers Gadkari the greatest poet-dramatist in any Indian language after Kalidas. He feels that no other than Gadkari had the genius to describe Sambhaji's extraordinary sacrifice in his struggle against the monstrous emperor Aurangzeb. Similarly, another prominent Marathi literary figure, Acharya Atre, considered Gadkari's contribution to Marathi literature and in particular Marathi drama as one of highest order. He was associated with Kirloskar natak company. His drama \"Ekach Pyala\" was performed by 'Balgandharva' as Sindhu after his death in 1919, which was the story of a poor, devoted wife Sindhu and her alcoholic husband Sudhakar.\n\nThere was some speculation that his play \"Ekach Pyala\" was based upon his personal and real experience with hard drinking, but Acharya Atre has convincingly demolished this speculation in his own autobiographical works and has stated that the one obsession that Gadkari had in his entire life was literature. It is to be noted here that Acharya Atre knew Gadkari fairly intimately, and therefore this assertion has a reasonable basis.\n\n\n\n\nWith a view to preserve the rich cultural heritage of Thane, the Thane Municipal Council constructed Rangayatan in 1979, a drama theatre, named after Shri Ram Ganesh Gadkari. The theatre has been hosting different plays and cultural programmes since. Also in Pune city in the well-known Sambhaji Park Gadkari's statue has been installed. As a matter of coincidence this park is next door to the city's well-known drama theatre Bal Gandharva Ranga Mandir. The statue was uprooted and thrown into the Mutha river by the activists of the Maratha extremist group, Sambhaji Brigade on January 3, 2017 because Gadkari showed Sambhaji in a poor light in his incomplete play 'Rajsanyas'. The Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu(CKP), the community to which Gadkari belonged later organized a meeting to protest this incident at the Gadkari Rangayatan. Indian National Congress leader Nitesh Rane rewarded the vandals and made inflammatory remarks claiming that he had announced a reward earlier in 2016 for removing the bust, and was proud of the act carried out by the accused.\n\nhttp://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pune-maratha-brigade-writer-statue-removed/1/848253.html\n"}
{"id": "33219530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33219530", "title": "Resort fee", "text": "Resort fee\n\nA resort fee, also called a facility fee, a destination fee, an amenity fee, an urban fee, or a resort charge, is a separate mandatory fee that a guest is charged by an accommodation provided in addition to a base room rate.\n\nResort fees are illegal in many countries. In other countries, including the United States, there is no specific legislation that either allows or outlaws resort fees.\n\nA resort fee is a daily mandatory additional charge that the hotel separates out from the advertised price. Consumer advocates equate this to paying a second room rate. The average resort fee is $24.93 per day. It can be more than the advertised cost of the room. There is no limit to what the resort fee can be. Two hotels in Florida have resort fees of over $100 per day.Many hotels in Las Vegas advertise room rates that are lower than the resort fee.\n\nThis concept is widely known as drip pricing, particularly in consumer rights contexts. One price is advertised out front to lure in a customer but when the customer goes to book there are then mandatory unavoidable fees, taxes and other add-ons that incrementally drip and increase the original advertised price.\n\nThe concept of resort fees originated in North America. Though mostly found in tourist destinations in the United States, some resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean also charge resort fees. A handful of hotels in Canada have also recently taken up the practice.\n\nResort fees are most prevalent in tourist locations and are usually seen as a nuisance by travelers. They also affect international tourists who are unfamiliar with the breakdown of a US hotel bill and may not speak English.\n\nResort fees are also commonly located in tourist areas, where there is collusion, and every hotel decides to charge resort fees. Currently, resort fees apply to all 62,000 rooms on the Las Vegas Strip. Resort fees, along with the recent introduction parking charges (neither of which are typically charged at the numerous alternative gaming locations in the United States), are believed to be a major cause of a reduction in tourism to Las Vegas.\n\nResort fees are not found just at resorts. Many budget hotels also charge resort fees. The Days Inn in Miami Beach, the Super 8 in Las Vegas and the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City are all two star hotels that charge resort fees.\n\nNew York City has seen a surge in hotel resort fees. In New York City the fees are often called destination fees, facility fees or amenity fees. There were 15 hotels in New York City with resort fees in 2016. In 2018 there are 84.\n\nHotels have long charged guests for specific amenities at a hotel, such as for snacks, drinks and use of facilities. In 1997 some resort hotels began to charge mandatory fees, regardless of which facilities were actually used by the guest. This enables the hotel to advertise a cheaper room rate, making up the balance from the mandatory fee.\n\nThe major benefit to the hotels is the profit, while still being able to show 'reasonable' room prices to the public. Resort fees brought in $2.47 billion to the hotel industry in 2015. MGM Resorts International stated that, for Las Vegas hotel rooms in 2011, \"Our RevPAR (revenue per available room) in the first quarter was up 16%, including resort fees. Excluding resort fees, REVPAR was up 11% in the quarter year-over-year.\"\n\nOnline hotel search and booking tools like Expedia, Travelocity and Hotel Tonight take a percentage of a reservation and then pass the reservation on to the hotel. A hotel loses a certain percentage from every reservation made on one of the sites. Hotels that charge resort fees but are listed on these hotel search and booking sites list only their advertised rate and not their resort fee. That is because the hotel booking site takes a percentage of that advertised rate. When the hotel collects the resort fee at check in, separately from the rate purchased for online, the hotel collects 100% of that charge.\nResort fees also affect travel agents. Travel agents can earn commission on the advertised rate of the hotel and do not collect a percentage of taxes or fees. Furthermore, travel agencies must legally know what the resort fee for each hotel is so that they can properly pass it on to their clients. Failure to do so could result in a lawsuit to their agency. Individual travel agents have found it difficult to keep up with changing hotel resort fees.\n\nHotels and Resorts also often collect Resort Fees from guests who are paying for their stay with loyalty points, since the Resort Fee is categorized a mandatory charge for bundled services as opposed to part of the room rate.\n\nThe American Hotel and Lodging Association has stated that the resort fee provides many benefits to consumers. Hotels say that customers like many features and amenities of the hotel to be included in the resort fee to avoid nickel and diming, but there is no proof that any services are included in the fees, which leads many consumers to deem it to be dishonest pricing.\n\nMGM Resorts International senior vice president Alan Feldman,has said “We have heard negative feedback from guests, but we’ve also heard positive feedback, from guests who are happy that they are no longer paying à la carte for different services. They don’t feel nickeled and dimed.”\n\nHotels have stated that tourists are paying a resort fee for a variety of amenities at the hotel. The American Hotel and Lodging Association said that resort fees pay for a range of hotel amenities, such as pool use, gym access, towel services, Wi-Fi, newspapers. They state that the resort fee is a payment for a group of services.\n\nConsumer advocates such as the National Consumers League and Travelers United have stated that since it is a mandatory fee, it is not an exchange of service. A guest could decline all of the services allegedly offered by the resort fee and still be forced to pay the resort fee. The advocates state that there is no exchange of service. It is simply an additional amount that the hotel collects, on top of the advertised room rate.\n\nMost hotels tax the resort fee at the hotel occupancy tax rate. This is a tax rate reserved for hotel room rates. Services are taxed at the sales tax rate in the United States. The hotel occupancy tax is higher than the sales tax rate. Consumer advocates argue this shows that the hotel resort fee is considered part of the room rate for the hotel and for tax purposes, not an exchange of service. A direct exchange of service, such as a hotel charge of bringing an extra bed to the room, would always be taxed at sales tax. A resort fee is normally not taxed as an exchange of service, but as a second room rate.\n\nResort fees have been criticized by consumers for not being fairly advertised prior to purchase.\n\nKatherine Lugar, president and Chief Executive Officer of the American Hotel and Lodging Association said that “throughout the booking process, hotels are transparent about costs, fees and taxes.” That assertion has been debated by consumer advocates. They argue that though hotels may list a resort fee, they do so at the very end of the booking process in extremely small print. Charlie Leocha, President of Travelers United, said \"The charging of mandatory resort fees by hotels results in a misrepresentation of the true price of the hotel room.\" Sometimes hotels improperly list the fee as a tax. The Arizona Grand Resort & Spa lists its resort fee under taxes. The Life Hotel in New York City lists their fee as an \"NYC mandatory City Hotel Fee.\" A resort fee is not a tax nor is it a mandatory city hotel fee. \n\nConsumer advocates have noted that if consumers choose to book their hotel based on price-based search tools on Expedia, Priceline, or Hotel Tonight, the resort fees are left off in the initial price comparison search. A hotel could be anywhere from $10 to $50 more expensive per night, but it is not listed with the advertised price.\n\nA Priceline spokeswoman, Flavie Lemarchand-Wood, said the practice of tacking added fees onto the advertised price after a hotel is selected is not deceptive: \"We are compliant in disclosing the fees prior to purchase. It is very important [for the consumer] to read everything on the page\" Expedia, Priceline and Hotel Tonight do not take commission from the resort fee. These online booking companies have no incentive to publish the resort fee. The hotel takes the entire amount of the resort fee. These companies are further disincentivized since if one site begins to add the resort fee to the advertised rate, it will look like the price on that site is higher and consumers would go to a competing online booking site. \n\nConsumers groups such as Travelers United and Kill Resort Fees contend if a hotel charges a mandatory fee, it should be included the nightly room rate. Hotel rating systems, such as AAA, have taken a policy of deducting points from a hotel being reviewed if they charge resort fees. AAA has said resort fees are a major annoyance of travelers. Frommer's travel guides have come out with numerous articles against hotel resort fees.\n\nSince resort fees are a mandatory fee that is not included in the advertised room rate of the hotel, the fee can be taxed differently from the advertised room rate. Resort fees in Nevada are treated and taxed as a hotel room at hotel occupancy tax. Both hotel rooms and resort fees in Nevada are taxed at 13.38%. Resort fees at many hotels in New York are taxed at 8.875% instead of the hotel occupancy tax of 14.75%. There is a 5.875% tax loss for New York City per resort fee per room per night. Consumer advocates estimate that hotel resort fees in New York City cause $10 million of lost tax revenue annually.\n\nIn Australia, under the Australian Consumer Law, it is illegal to charge, or even advertise it is a requirement to pay, mandatory fees (including resort fees), if they were not reflected in a total cost as a single figure at the time of booking. Under Australian law, any fees that are mandatory and are able to be calculated, including resort fees, must be included as a part of the total price in a single figure at the time of booking, deliberately doing otherwise are grounds for prosecution for misleading and unconscionable conduct.\n\nWhen advertising the sale price of a consumer good or service (i.e. non business-to-business transactions) a price \"must state the total price of the good or service as a single figure, which is the minimum total cost that is able to be calculated. This should include any tax, duty, fee, levy or other additional charges.\" Due to this requirement under Australian law, unlike the U.S., consumer goods and services always have ticket prices which reflect the actual monetary cost which a consumer pays out of pocket, with no additional tax or fees calculated on top at point of sale.\n\nAdditionally, by virtue of Australian anti-price drip laws, it is also not sufficient, and it is illegal, to add a mandatory fee (including resort fees) in circumstances where it was only disclosed and added to the final single figure in the late stages of a booking process. This price-dripping practice constitutes a bait and switch tactic which is misleading and detrimental to both consumers and competitors. Any mandatory fee must be included in the single figure which is advertised, it must be disclosed, and the disclosure must be early on in the booking process.\n\nIn order to protect Australian consumers, heavy penalties are applied and enforced (up to hundreds of thousands of dollars) for each instance of a breach of the Australian Consumer Law provisions.\n\nIn the European Economic Area, which comprises the European Union plus three more countries, Articles 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(e) of Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights Directive) require businesses to quote \"\"the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes\". Therefore it is unlawful to charge or advertise unavoidable fees and taxes that are not included within the total room rate, such as resort fees and city taxes. The legislation also applies when booking non-EEA accommodation via EEA-based travel agents and web sites, which are bound by the same requirement to quote the \"total price\"\".\n\nIn the United States, the legality of charging resort fees has been a decades-long issue of contention. Currently there is no U.S. law that allows for hotels to charge mandatory fees in addition to their base room rate. However, there is also no law banning this practice.\n\nNumerous bodies have authority on this issue in the United States, including the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Association of Attorneys General. So far only 47 Attorneys General have opened an investigation into hotel resort fees. Marriott was issued a subpoena on June 6, 2017 by the Attorney General of Washington, DC regarding their non-cooperation in the investigation, as the hospitality industry continues to stall any legislative solution to the issue.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the US government organization with authority to regulate the hotel industry. On the subject of resort fees, FTC attorney Mamie Kresses said \"The fees are not illegal as long as they're disclosed.\" What constitutes a clear disclosure, however, has been a matter of debate between the hotel industry and consumers. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission advised 22 hotel operators that their online rate quote totals, which did not include certain fees, may need to be updated to comply with FTC regulations.\n\nSince then the FTC has taken no legal action on resort fees. Consumer advocate Chris Elliott wrote \"The FTC has failed to protect consumers from what is perhaps the most dishonest fee in the travel industry.\" In 2016, FTC Chairperson Ramirez wrote a letter to Congress on the subject of resort fees and said “in my view……the most efficient and effective means to mandate the type of industry-wide requirement you propose would be through legislation.” US Senator McCaskill introduced the “Truth in Hotel Advertising Act of 2016” in the US Senate on February 25, 2016. The purpose of the bill is to \"prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising of hotel room rates, and for other purposes.\" The bill was not voted on during the 114th Congress.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a report on the harm of resort fees on January 5, 2017. The report concluded \"that consumers are likely being harmed by the hotel industry practice of disclosing mandatory resort fees separate from posted room rates, without first disclosing the total price.\"\n\nDue to the increasing use of resort fees at hotels, many consumers have begun to challenge them being applied to their hotel bill. This has been done by asking the hotel desk manager to remove the fee, by disputing the fee with the guest's credit card company or by suing the hotel in small claims court.\n\nConsumer travel advocate Christopher Elliott advises anyone who was blindsided by an add-on fee to dispute the charge with their credit card company. While the booking sites may allow small-print disclosures, some credit card companies have taken the consumer's side in these disputes and reversed the charges. Moreover, merchants that have a high volume of disputed charges can run afoul of credit card providers, which in egregious cases have the ability to terminate a vendor's right to accept credit cards.\n\nKill Resort Fees, an advocacy group working to eliminate resort fees, stated that all resort fees should be challenged. Lauren Wolfe, Founder of Kill Resort Fees, said that \"Resort fees are the equivalent of being charged a second room rate. No law exists protecting hotels ability to charge two room rates for one night so all of these second rates also known as resort fees should be challenged by consumers.\"\n\nForty-seven Attorneys General began an investigation into the practice of hotel resort fees in May 2016. Marriott would not turn over documents on the investigation after many requests by the Attorneys General. Marriott was subpoenaed on June 7, 2017 by the District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine. The subpoena reads: \"D.C. Code 1-301.89c(a) provides that the Office of the Attorney General 'shall have the authority to issue subpoenas for the production of documents and materials or for the attendance and testimony of witnesses under oath, or both, related to an investigation into unfair, deceptive, unconscionable, or fraudulent trade practices by or between a merchant or consumer, as defined in 28-3901.' Consistent with that authority, on May 16, 2016, the District served its subpoena on Marriott\"Wyndham is currently facing a class action lawsuit in Pennsylvania Federal Court regarding hotel resort fees. Luca v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. et al., case number 2:16-cv-00746, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania deals with and Wyndham its subsidiaries are sneaking a resort fee on to its room prices without notifying consumers, causing its rooms to be advertised at deceptively low rates, according to a proposed class action filed Monday in Pennsylvania federal court. The case reads:“Defendants’ failure to adequately disclose the resort fee charge as part of the true cost of renting a hotel room is deceptive and causes consumers, including plaintiff and the class, to believe that they are paying substantially less than they actually are being charged for a room at defendants’ hotels,” according to the complaint.\"Most hotels that have resort fees say the fee provides internet access. In most locations, the hotel resort fee is taxed sales tax or hotel occupancy tax. Some have argued that internet access cannot be taxed at either of these tax rates due to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. New York State is explicit in saying hotels and motels cannot tax internet access. Numerous hotels are being sued over their claim that resort fees provide internet access.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3799182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3799182", "title": "S. Wajid Ali", "text": "S. Wajid Ali\n\nS. Wajed Ali (; 4 September 1890 – 10 June 1951) was a Bengali writer, nationalist and Barrister-at-Law.\n\nWajid Ali was born on 4 September 1890 in the village of Baratajpur of Hooghly district. S. Wajed Ali's maternal grandmother hailed from the Nawabpur village in Chanditola of Hooghly district. Her father, who came from Mungaer, had settled in Nawabpur with a 'Jaigir' and married into the local Bengali community. Wajed Ali's three maternal uncles were 'Hafiz' in Koran and his grandfather's home atmosphere was one of religious conservatism. However, the natural beauty of Nawabpur touched him deeply as expressed in his memoirs. Wajed Ali's education began in the village 'Madrasa' or school. At this stage, in 1897 he had his first marriage, at the early age of seven, with his six-month-old cousin Ayesha (the daughter of his paternal uncle Sheikh Golam Rahman). In 1898, at the age of eight, Wajed Ali came to Shillong and started education under the tutelage of his father, S. Belayet Ali. Later, he was admitted to the English medium Mokhar School in Shillong, from where he graduated in his 'Entrance Exams' with a gold medal. This phase of his life in Shillong, Meghalaya had a lasting impression upon him.\n\nHe went to Aligarh MAYO college, where he was recognised as a meritorious student. He subsequently passed his I.A. and B.A. exams from Allahabad University in 1908 and 1910 respectively. After his graduation from Allahabad, he returned to his village of Baratajpur and spent a happy family life amidst the rural idyllic surroundings. His first child, Lutfunnissa, was born at this time. He was trying hard to convince his family to allow him to go to England for further education. Finally, with the enthusiasm and recommendations of his second uncle, he succeeded in getting their permission and left for London just a couple of years before the start of World War I. Wajed Ali joined the Law school of the University of Cambridge, from where he attained his B.A. and Barrister-at-Law degrees.\n\nWhile in Cambridge, he had fallen seriously ill and Miss Eleanor Saxby of Bristol had come forward to take care of him, and enable his subsequent recovery. From this episode started a relationship between them which culminated in his second marriage and divorce from Ayesha Begum, at the obvious displeasure of his family members back home. The year was 1915 – World War I was raging in Europe. It was at this time that S.Wajed Ali started the practice of Law in Calcutta High Court and continued till 1922. All this while, he lived with Eleanor in Mott Lane, Ripon Lane, Ripon Street etc. in Calcutta. Ill fortune struck when various factors of the failure of the family business, failing health, extravagant lifestyle – all combined together to drive him to bankruptcy. He immersed himself in deep studies about the contemporary society and involved himself in the elite literary world of the time. At the advice of his friend, Pramatha Chowdhury (editor of weekly Shobuj Potro), he started writing in Bengali and began an extraordinary literary career.\n\nIn 1923, he was appointed the third presidency magistrate of Calcutta and a few days later he started living with his family in No. 1 Canal Road in Calcutta. At this period he devoted himself to his literary pursuits. He expressed himself with supreme creative excellence in the fields of prose, symbolism, story-writing, translation, travelogues, etc. His troubled marriage with Mrs. Eleanor Saxby (Nellie) came to an end in 1928, when the mother of his two sons, Ahmed and Abdullah and daughter Zeb-un-Nissa separated from him and married his younger brother S. Shamsher Ali. This turn of events drove him into a family crisis and utter loneliness. The dramatic family complications made him hurt susceptible and psychologically isolated. In the face of all these adversities, he maintained his literary stability and creativity in matters of philosophical and nationalistic pursuits. He always maintained his clarity of vision and focus in all these matters, which were close to his heart.\n\nHaving been cast into loneliness and isolation in his family life, S. Wajed Ali, amidst his otherwise busy life with the duties of his job, literary pursuits, chairmanships of various societies and organisations etc., was like a prisoner of pain on a lonely island. At this time he met a learned Burmese lady, who subsequently became his wife and life-partner, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali. Descended from the line of Chengiz Khan, her father was the head of a Burmese royal family. When the British forces attacked Burma, most of the royal family men folk were killed in the anti-British struggle. Along with her mother and aunt, the Burmese princess Badrunnessa was brought to Calcutta as a royal war-prisoner. Unfortunately, a grave tragedy befell Mr. S. Wajed Ali's life only two years after his marriage, when on 26 October 1931, Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali died a day after the birth of her only child. Her body was buried in the 'Gobra graveyard'. An English nurse was appointed to take care of his new-born child, Sheikh Badruddin Ali (Zaib-un-Nissa was also quite young at the time).\n\nThe founding of the magazine 'Gulistan' in December 1932 was an active and busy chapter of S. Wajed Ali's life. He built up around this magazine a cultural and literary circle embracing the cream of contemporary Bengali society. Its cover bore the vision behind its creation 'the pioneer of Hindu-Muslim unity'. The writer's list of 'Gulistan' bears evidence of the nobility, width of scope and seriousness of the magazine: Kazi Nazrul Islam, Dr. Mohammed Shahidullah, Kazi Abdul Wadud, Kedārnāth Chattopādhyāy, Tārāśankar Bandyopādhyāy, Pramathanāth Bishi, Buddhadeb Basu, Sajanikānta Dās (of Śanibārer Chithi fame), Kaviśekhar Kālidās Rāy, Bārindranāth Ghosh, Pabitra Gangopādhyāy, Poet Kader Nawaz, Poet Nirmal Dās, Anurupā Devī, Prabhābatī Devī Sarasvatī, Indirā Devīcaudhurāni, Manilāl Bannerjee, A. K. Jainal Abedin (Navayug), Humayun Kabir, Comrade Abdul Aziz, Phanindranāth Mukhopādhyāy, Dhīrāj Bhattacārya, Saurīndramohan Mukhopadhyāy, Abbasuddin Ahmed etc. At these heady times, S. Wajed Ali's residence at 48, Jhowtalla Road, was the usual venue for the Gulistan-centred literary evening gatherings. The contemporary elite of the intellectual, literary and art world of Calcutta were often present in those sessions. Besides being the founder of the 'Gulistan' magazine, S. Wajed Ali was also the publisher and editor of the English language magazine: 'Bulletin of the Indian Rationalistic Society'.\n\nOn 31 October 1945, S. Wajed Ali retired from the position of third presidency magistrate and restarted his independent legal profession. At this time he still resided at his residence at 48, Jhowtolla Road.\n\nS. Wajed Ali was a soft-spoken person with a reserved and contemplative nature. He was a unique and distinctive personality of his time with his aristocratic bearing, wide grasp of knowledge and intellectual pursuits. Regarding his personality Syed Ali Ahsan has justifiably commented: \"S. Wajed Ali possessed an exceptionally generous nature. With such a magnanimous, righteous, broad-minded and pleasing personality, he was well loved by all he came into contact with…' 'He had an extraordinary depth of perception'. While never loud nor offensive, he was amusing and extremely well informed in his discussions. He loved talking to children and often listened to their stories, keeping them amused with his special simple magical simplicity and charm. He had some unique pursuits: he loved to walk the streets and parks in Calcutta so much so that he is quoted as having said that ' I am ready to deny myself many things in my life, but I am not ready to give up my pleasure of walking….. I usually like to walk in the Maidan.'. Towards the middle of 1949, S. Wajed Ali was affected with 'cerebral thrombosis', which rendered one side of his body paralysed. He was treated by the German doctor Mr. Troy and cared for by nurses. In these difficult days, his sons looked after him regularly. His younger brother Mr. S. Shamsher Ali visited him every day. His first wife Ayesha Khatun often visited him. Finally, at 9 o' clock of Sunday, 10 June 1951, he died at his 48, Jhowtolla residence. He was buried beside the grave of his last wife Mrs. Badrunnessa Ali at Gobra graveyard in Calcutta, where he had bought the place for himself when she died in 1931, 20 years earlier. Bounded by marble railings, his tombstone bears dates of his birth and death. He is honoured every year in a festival at his birthplace of Baratajpur.\n\nHis first Bangla essay 'Otiter Bojha' was published in Shobuj-potro −1919<br>\nHis short story 'Raja' was published in 'Islam Dorshon' – 1925<br>\nHe was elected chairman of the 'Bongio Musholman Shahitya Shamity' −1925<br>\nHe performed the presidential role in the 'Bongio Musholman Shahitya Shamity' and gave the presidential address at the fifth annual conference. -1925<br>\n31 July- Attended 'Bongiyo Musholman Shahitya Samity' general meeting and read the paper 'Toruner Kaj'. -1926<br>\nDecember.

It deals with current phonology and phonetics as well as with historical developments thereof as well as the geographical variants and the influence of German dialects.\n\nWhile the spelling of German is officially standardised by an international organisation (the Council for German Orthography) the pronunciation has no official standard and relies on a \"de facto\" standard documented in reference works such as (German Pronunciation Dictionary) by Eva-Maria Krech et al., (Duden volume 6, The Pronunciation Dictionary) by Max Mangold and the training materials of radio and television stations such as \"Westdeutscher Rundfunk\", \"Deutschlandfunk\", or \"Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen\". This standardised pronunciation was invented, rather than coming from any particular German-speaking city, but the city that Germans most consider to be closest to the standard is Hanover. Standard German is sometimes referred to as (stage German), but the latter has its own definition and is slightly different.\n\nSome scholars treat as an unstressed allophone of . Likewise, some scholars treat as an allophone of the unstressed sequence . The phonemic status of is also debated - see below.\n\n\nAlthough there is also a length contrast, vowels are often analyzed according to a tenseness contrast, with long being the tense vowels and short their lax counterparts. Like the English checked vowels, the German lax vowels require a following consonant, with the notable exception of (which is absent in many varieties, as discussed below). is sometimes considered the lax counterpart of tense in order to maintain this tense/lax division. Short occur in unstressed syllables of loanwords, for instance in ('psychometry'). They are usually considered allophones of tense vowels, which cannot occur in unstressed syllables (unless in compounds).\n\nNorthern German varieties influenced by Low German could be analyzed as lacking contrasting vowel quantity entirely:\n\nThe long open-mid front unrounded vowel does not exist in many varieties of Standard German and is rendered as the close-mid front unrounded vowel , so that both ('ear of grain') and ('honor') are pronounced (instead of \"Ähre\" being ) and both ('bears') and ('berries') are pronounced (instead of being ). It is debated whether is a distinct phoneme or even exists, except when consciously self-censoring speech, for several reasons:\n\n\nThe process of smoothing is absent from standard German, so the sequences are never pronounced * or *.\n\nMarginally, there are other diphthongs, for instance\n\nThe following usually are not counted among the German diphthongs as German speakers often feel they are distinct marks of \"foreign words\" (). These appear only in loanwords:\n\nIn the varieties where speakers vocalize to in the syllable coda, a diphthong ending in may be formed with every vowel except and :\n\nWith approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system has an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual affricate .\n\n\n\" is the voiceless palatal fricative (which is found in the word 'I'), and is the voiceless velar fricative (which is found in the word the interjection 'oh', 'alas'). Note that is the German word for 'sound, phone'. In German, these two sounds are allophones occurring in complementary distribution. The allophone occurs after back vowels and (for instance in 'book'), the allophone after front vowels (for instance in 'me/myself') and consonants (for instance in 'fear', 'sometimes'). (This happens most regularly: if the in is pronounced as a consonant, represents ; however if, as often happens, it is vocalized as , resembling the vowel , then may represent , yielding .)\n\nIn loanwords, the pronunciation of potential fricatives in onsets of stressed syllables varies: in the Northern varieties of standard German, it is , while in Southern varieties, it is , and in Western varieties, it is (for instance in : vs. vs. ).\n\nThe diminutive suffix is always pronounced with an . Usually, this ending triggers umlaut (compare for instance 'dog' to 'little dog'), so theoretically, it could only occur after front vowels. However, in some comparatively recent coinings, there is no longer an umlaut, for instance in the word (a diminutive of 'woman'), so that a back vowel is followed by a , even though normally it would be followed by a , as in ('to smoke'). This exception to the allophonic distribution may be an effect of the morphemic boundary or an example of \"phonemicization\", where erstwhile allophones undergo a split into separate phonemes.\n\nThe allophonic distribution of after front vowels and after other vowels is also found in other languages, such as Scots, in the pronunciation of \"light\". However, it is by no means inevitable: Dutch, Yiddish, and many Southern German dialects retain (which can be realized as instead) in all positions. It is thus reasonable to assume that Old High German \"ih\", the ancestor of modern , was pronounced with rather than . While it is impossible to know for certain whether Old English words such as \"niht\" (modern \"night\") were pronounced with or , is likely (see Old English phonology).\n\nDespite the phonetic history, the complementary distribution of and in modern Standard German is better described as backing of after a back vowel, rather than fronting of after a front vowel, because is used in onsets ( 'chemistry') and after consonants ( 'newt'), and is thus the underlying form of the phoneme.\n\nAccording to Kohler, the German is further differentiated into two allophones, and : occurs after (for instance in 'book') and after (for instance in 'brook'), while either or may occur after , with predominating.\n\nVarious German consonants occur in pairs at the same place of articulation and in the same manner of articulation, namely the pairs , , , , . These pairs are often called fortis–lenis pairs, since describing them as voiced–voiceless pairs is inadequate. With certain qualifications, , and are also considered fortis–lenis pairs.\n\nFortis-lenis distinction for is unimportant.\n\nThe fortis stops are aspirated in many varieties. The aspiration is strongest in the onset of a stressed syllable (such as 'thaler'), weaker in the onset of an unstressed syllable (such as 'father'), and weakest in the syllable coda (such as in 'seed'). All fortis consonants, i.e. are fully voiceless.\n\nThe lenis consonants range from being weakly voiced to almost voiceless after voiceless consonants: ('kasbah)', ('to resign'), ('red-yellow'), ('dropping'), ('intention'), ('wooden jalousie'), ('to chase away'), ('to drop'), ('fruit juice'). states that they are \"to a large extent voiced\" in all other environments, but some studies have found the stops to be voiceless word/utterance-initially in most dialects (while still contrasting with due to the aspiration of the latter).\n\nThe nature of the phonetic difference between the voiceless lenis consonants and the similarly voiceless fortis consonants is controversial. It is generally described as a difference in articulatory force, and occasionally as a difference in articulatory length; for the most part, it is assumed that one of these characteristics implies the other.\n\nIn various central and southern varieties, the opposition between fortis and lenis is neutralized in the syllable onset; sometimes just in the onset of stressed syllables, sometimes in all cases.\n\nThe pair is not considered a fortis–lenis pair, but a simple voiceless–voiced pair, as remains voiced in all varieties, including the Southern varieties that devoice the lenes (with however some exceptions). Generally, the southern is realized as the voiced approximant . However, there are southern varieties which differentiate between a fortis (such as in 'culpable' from Middle High German stræflich) and a lenis (, such as in 'polite' from Middle High German hovelîch); this is analogous to the opposition of fortis () and lenis .\n\nIn varieties from Northern Germany, lenis stops in the syllable coda are realized as fortis stops. This does not happen in varieties from Southern Germany, Austria or Switzerland.\n\nSince the lenis stops are unvoiced or at most variably voiced (as stated above), this cannot be called devoicing in the strict sense of the word because it does not involve the loss of phonetic voice. More accurately, it can be called coda fortition or a neutralization of fortis and lenis sounds in the coda. Fricatives are truly and contrastively voiced in Northern Germany. Therefore, the fricatives undergo coda devoicing in the strict sense of the word. It is disputed whether coda devoicing is due to a constraint which specifically operates on syllable codas or whether it arises from constraints which \"protect voicing in privileged positions.\"\n\nAs against standard pronunciation rules, in western varieties including those of the Rhineland, coda fortis–lenis neutralization results in \"voicing\" rather than \"devoicing\" if the following word begins with a vowel. For example, becomes and becomes . The same sandhi phenomenon exists also as a general rule in the Luxembourgish language.\n\nStress in German usually falls on the first syllable, with the following exceptions:\nIn addition, German uses different stress for separable prefixes and inseparable prefixes in verbs and words derived from such verbs:\n\nLike all infants, German infants go through a babbling stage in the early phases of phonological acquisition, during which they produce the sounds they will later use in their first words. Phoneme inventories begin with stops, nasals, and vowels; (contrasting) short vowels and liquids appear next, followed by fricatives and affricates, and finally all other consonants and consonant clusters. Children begin to produce protowords near the end of their first year. These words do not approximate adult forms, yet have a specific and consistent meaning. Early word productions are phonetically simple and usually follow the syllable structure CV or CVC, although this generalization has been challenged. The first vowels produced are , , and , followed by , , and , with rounded vowels emerging last. German children often use phonological processes to simplify their early word production. For example, they may delete an unstressed syllable ( 'chocolate' pronounced ), or replace a fricative with a corresponding stop ( 'roof' pronounced ). One case study found that a 17-month-old child acquiring German replaced the voiceless velar fricative with the nearest available continuant , or deleted it altogether ( 'book' pronounced or ).\n\nIn 2009, Lintfert examined the development of vowel space of German speakers in their first three years of life. During the babbling stage, vowel distribution has no clear pattern. However, stressed and unstressed vowels already show different distributions in the vowel space. Once word production begins, stressed vowels expand in the vowel space, while the F1-F2 vowel space of unstressed vowels becomes more centralized. The majority of infants are then capable of stable production of F1. It should be noted that the variability of formant frequencies among individuals decreases with age. After 24 months, infants expand their vowel space individually at different rates. However, if the parents' utterances possess a well-defined vowel space, their children produce clearly distinguished vowel classes earlier. By about three years old, children command the production of all vowels, and they attempt to produce the four cardinal vowels, , , and , at the extreme limits of the F1-F2 vowel space (i.e., the height and backness of the vowels are made extreme by the infants).\n\nGenerally, closed-class grammatical words (e.g. articles and prepositions) are absent from children's speech when they first begin to combine words. However, children as young as 18 months old show knowledge of these closed-class words when they prefer stories with them, compared to passages with them omitted. Therefore, the absence of these grammatical words cannot be due to perceptual problems. Researchers tested children's comprehension of four grammatical words: ] ('up to'), ('from'), ('the' neuter singular), and ('his'). After first being familiarized with the words, eight-month-old children looked longer in the direction of a speaker playing a text passage that contained these previously heard words. However, this ability is absent in six-month-olds.\n\nThe acquisition of nasals in German differs from that of Dutch, a phonologically closely related language. German children produce proportionately more nasals in onset position (sounds before a vowel in a syllable) than Dutch children do. German children, once they reached 16 months, also produced significantly more nasals in syllables containing schwas, when compared with Dutch-speaking children. This may reflect differences in the languages the children are being exposed to, although the researchers claim that the development of nasals likely cannot be seen apart from the more general phonological system the child is developing.\n\nA 2006 study examined the acquisition of German in phonologically delayed children (specifically, issues with fronting of velars and stopping of fricatives) and whether they applied phonotactic constraints to word-initial consonant clusters containing these modified consonants. In many cases, the subjects (mean age = 5;1) avoided making phonotactic violations, opting instead for other consonants or clusters in their speech. This suggests that phonotactic constraints do apply to the speech of German children with phonological delay, at least in the case of word-initial consonant clusters. Additional research has also shown that spelling consistencies seen in German raise children's phonemic awareness as they acquire reading skills.\n\nA merger found mostly in Northern accents of German is that of (spelled ) with (spelled , , or ). Some speakers merge the two everywhere, some distinguish them everywhere, others keep distinct only in conditional forms of strong verbs (for example 'I would give' vs. 'I give' are distinguished, but 'bears' vs. 'berries' are not. Standard pronunciation of is ).\n\nAnother common merger is that of at the end of a syllable with or , for instance ('war'), but ('wars'); ('he lay'), but ('we lay'). This pronunciation is frequent all over central and northern Germany. It is characteristic of regional languages and dialects, particularly Low German in the North, where represents a fricative, becoming voiceless in the syllable coda, as is common in German (final-obstruent devoicing). However common it is, this pronunciation is considered sub-standard. Only in one case, in the grammatical ending (which corresponds to English \"-y\"), the fricative pronunciation of final is prescribed by the Siebs standard, for instance ('important'). The merger occurs neither in Austro-Bavarian and Alemannic German nor in the corresponding varieties of Standard German, and therefore in these regions is pronounced .\n\nMany speakers do not distinguish the affricate from the simple fricative in the beginning of a word, in which case the verb ('[he] travels') and the noun ('horse') are both pronounced . This most commonly occurs in northern and western Germany, where the local dialects did not originally have the sound . Some speakers also have peculiar pronunciation for in the middle or end of a word, replacing the in with a voiceless bilabial fricative, i.e. a consonant produced by pressing air flow through the tensed lips. Thereby ('drop') becomes , rather than .\n\nMany speakers who have a vocalization of after merge this combination with long (i.e. > or > or ). Hereby, ('sheep') and ('sharp') can both be pronounced or . This merger does not occur where is a front vowel while is realised as a back vowel. Here the words are kept distinct as ('sheep') and ('sharp'). <br> \nIn umlaut forms, the difference usually reoccurs: or vs. . Speakers with this merger also often use (instead of formally normal ) where it stems from original . The word ('arks') is thus pronounced , which makes a minimal pair with , making the difference between and phonemic, rather than just allophonic, for these speakers.\n\nIn the standard pronunciation, the vowel qualities , , , , as well as , , , , are all still distinguished even in unstressed syllables. In this latter case, however, many simplify the system in various degrees. For some speakers, this may go so far as to merge all four into one, whence misspellings by schoolchildren such as (instead of ) or (instead of \"Portugal\").\n\nIn everyday speech, more mergers occur, some of which are universal and some of which are typical for certain regions or dialect backgrounds. Overall, there is a strong tendency of reduction and contraction. For example, long vowels may be shortened, consonant clusters may be simplified, word-final may be dropped in some cases, and the suffix may be contracted with preceding consonants, e.g. for ('to have').\n\nIf the clusters , , , or are followed by another consonant, the stops , and usually lose their phonemic status. Thus while the standard pronunciation distinguishes ('whole') from ('goose'), as well as from , the two pairs are homophones for most speakers. The commonest practice is to drop the stop (thus , for both words), but some speakers insert the stop where it is not etymological (, for both words), or they alternate between the two ways. Only a few speakers retain a phonemic distinction.\n\nThe Middle High German vowels and developed into the modern Standard German diphthong , whereas and developed into . For example, Middle High German and ('hot' and 'white') became Standard German and . In some dialects, the Middle High German vowels have not changed, e.g. Swiss German and , while in other dialects or languages, the vowels have changed but the distinction is kept, e.g. Bavarian and , Ripuarian and , Yiddish ' and ' .\n\nThe Middle High German diphthongs , and became the modern Standard German long vowels , and after the Middle High German long vowels changed to diphthongs. Most Upper German dialects retain the diphthongs. A remnant of their former diphthong character is shown when continues to be written in German (as in 'love').\n\nGerman incorporates a significant number of loanwords from other languages. Loanwords are often adapted to German phonology but to varying degrees, depending on the speaker and the commonness of the word. and do not occur in native German words but are common in a number of French and English loan words. Many speakers replace them with and respectively (especially in Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland), so that (from English \"jungle\") can be pronounced or . Some speakers in Northern and Western Germany merge with , so that (phonemically ) can be pronounced , or . The realization of as , however, is uncommon.\n\nMany English words are used in German, especially in technology and pop culture. Some speakers pronounce them similarly to their native pronunciation, but many speakers change non-native phonemes to similar German phonemes (even if they pronounce them in a rather English manner in an English-language setting):\n\nThe sample text is a reading of the first sentence of \"The North Wind and the Sun\". The phonemic transcription treats every instance of and as and , respectively. The phonetic transcription is a fairly narrow transcription of the educated northern accent. The speaker transcribed in the narrow transcription is 62 years old, and he is reading in a colloquial style. Aspiration, glottal stops and devoicing of the lenes after fortes are not transcribed.\n\nNote that the audio file contains the whole fable, and that it was recorded by a much younger speaker.\n\n\n\n"}

Typically it is a pub run by winegrowers and winemakers themselves, in which they sell their own wine directly to the public. The food served needs to be simple, regional cold dishes. Other expressions like \"Besenwirtschaft\" and \"Besenschänke\" (\"broom pub\"), \"Rädlewirtschaft\" (\"cyclists' pub\") as well as \"Hecken-\" or \"Häckerwirtschaft\" are also common.\n\nA \"Strausswirtschaft\" is essentially understood to be a winemaker serving his own wine on his own premises. These seasonal inns are not subject to normal business laws and are thus not obliged to have a licence or to pay extra taxes. They must, however, fulfil certain conditions instead. These conditions vary from state to state but they are in general agreement on certain essential points (see \"Legal aspects\" below).\n\nThe kinds of locations in which a \"Strausswirtschaft\" can be found can vary considerably. Besides ones funished like ordinary pubs there are also simple barns where benches and tables have been temporarily set up to accommodate guests. In earlier decades some winegrowers even cleared their flats or the stables to run such a tavern. In Austria this kind of pub is called a \"Buschenschank\" or \"Heuriger\". The name is derived from a bar or post to which a so-called \"Föhrenbusch\" or a \"Reisigbesen\" (a kind of besom or broom) was attached. This helps to explain another expression associated with the Strausswirtschaft: \"Ausg'steckt is\" (\"It is attached\"). By attaching the bar outside, the pub owner was informing the tax collector about the pub's tax liability. The \"Buschenschank\" and the expression \"Ausg'steckt is\" can be traced back to a regulation by Empress Maria Theresia.\n\nThe enactment \"Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii\" by Charlemagne is often mentioned as the historical standard for the \"Strausswirtschaft\". It enabled winemakers to sell their own products free of business tax. The \"Strausswirtschaft\" (\"Strauss\" – German for bunch of flowers; \"Wirtschaft\" – pub, inn) had to be marked as such by a bunch of flowers put up at the entrance.\n\nTypical dishes offered are rather simple and rich. Regional specialities are for instance:\n\nElaborate dishes are not allowed.\n\nAlmost nowhere are \"Strausswirtschaften\" considered restaurants, which means that owners do not need a concession. Nevertheless, the trade office needs to be notified in advance about the period during which the \"Stausswirtschaft\" intends to sell food and drink. \nAlthough \"Strausswirtschaften\" do not need a licence, there are certain laws they have to follow. Among other things, a \"Strausswirtschaften\" is not allowed to offer lodging or engage in trade. Food and beverage must be served at the place of production. It is forbidden to rent any extra facilities for serving food and beverage. \nThe following rules need to be respected: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3821824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3821824", "title": "Synaeresis", "text": "Synaeresis\n\nIn linguistics, synaeresis (; also spelled syneresis) is a phonological process of sound change in which two adjacent vowels within a word are \"combined\" into a single syllable.\n\nThe opposite process, in which two adjacent vowels are pronounced separately, is known as \"diaeresis\".\n\nFor any given word, speakers generally hold a traditional view about the \"standard\" pronunciation of that word. When realized in a careful reading style, each particular word is associated with this single, \"standard\" phonetic form. However, each word also possesses multiple non-standard or reduced phonetic forms which are produced in a greater range of contexts. These multiple variations in the pronunciation of a single word are referred to as allophonic variants. To classify one of these other forms as an allophonic variant of a word means that pronouncing the word in this way will not change the intended meaning of the word.\n\nSynaeresis is one of various phonological processes in which segments of words or phrases are lost. The general term for a loss of sound segments in the field of linguistics is known as \"elision\". Other types of elision include the processes of apheresis, syncope, apocope, synizesis, and synaloepha.\n\nSynaeresis comes from Greek (\"synaíresis\"), a \"contraction\", a \"taking \"or\" drawing together\", from (\"synairéō\"), \"(I) contract\", \"(I) grasp \"or\" seize together\", derived from , \"with\", and , \"(I) grasp, seize\". Semantically, it is easy to understand how this term evolved historically. The term eventually becamer applied to a process in which vowels are taken or drawn together.\n\nSynaeresis often occurs with reduced vowels in English, as in Asia ( → ) and Sebastian ( → ).\n\nSynaeresis is a common process in French. For example, the French word \"louer,\" which means ‘to praise,’ is typically pronounced as [lwe] according to transcriptions using the International Phonetic Alphabet. That pronunciation reduces the [u] vowel to a [w], or a glide sound, when pronounced in conjunction with the [e] vowel sound. In this example, the standard pronunciation uses the process of synaeresis to compress both of the original vowel sounds into one syllable. However, when speakers are asked to produce this word in a more controlled situation, in a careful reading style, French speakers often produce extended forms or different allophonic variants for the word. These forms of the word include [lue] according to IPA transcriptions, in which the two vowels are pronounced separately using the process of diaeresis.\n\nIn Ancient Greek, synaeresis is the merging and pronunciation of two separate vowels as a diphthong (e.g. α + ι → αι ) or a long vowel (e.g. ο + ο → ου ); a characteristic example of this is the conjugation class or classes of contracted verbs ( – or ). Diaeresis on the other hand, is the separation of a diphthong into two vowels (αϊ ).\n\nCertain words in Proto-Indo-European had two vowels separated by the consonant \"s\" or \"y\" (\"esu\" \"good\"). In Greek, this consonant changed to \"h\" (\"ehu\"), and was lost between vowels (\"eu\"). In Homer, the two vowels were sometimes pronounced separately (diaeresis: ) and sometimes together (synaeresis: ). Later in Attic Greek, they were always pronounced together.\n\nIn Greek synaeresis, two vowels merge to form a long version of one of the two vowels (e.g. \"e\" + \"a\" → \"ā\"), a diphthong with a different main vowel (e.g. \"a\" + \"ei\" → \"āi\"), or a new vowel intermediate between the originals (e.g. \"a\" + \"o\" → \"ō\"). Contraction of \"e\" + \"o\" or \"o\" + \"e\" leads to \"ou\", and \"e\" + \"e\" to \"ei\", which are in this case spurious diphthongs.\n\nIn general, the accent after contraction copies the accent before contraction. Often this means circumflex accent. But for nouns, accent follows the nominative singular. Sometimes this means a different accent from the uncontracted form — i.e., whenever the ending has a long vowel.\n\nContraction in Greek occurs throughout the present and imperfect of contracted verbs and in the future of other verbs. There are three categories based on the vowel of contraction: \"a\", \"e\", or \"o\".\n\nContraction also occurs in nouns, including the contracted second declension.\n\n\"S\"-stem nouns undergo contraction with vowel endings.\n\nSome compound nouns show contraction:\n\n\nIn Modern Greek, where original diphthongs are pronounced as monophthongs, synaeresis is the pronunciation of two vowel sounds as a monophthong, and diaeresis is the pronunciation of the two vowels as a diphthong (αϊ ).\n\n"}

Traditionally, it has been considered a dialect of the South Estonian dialect group of the Estonian language, but nowadays it has its own literary language and is in search of official recognition as an autochthonous regional language of Estonia. Võro has roughly 75,000 speakers (Võros) mostly in southeastern Estonia, in the eight parishes of the historical Võru County: Karula, Harglõ, Urvastõ, Rõugõ, Kanepi, Põlva, Räpinä and Vahtsõliina. These parishes are currently centred (due to redistricting) in Võru and Põlva counties, with parts extending into Valga and Tartu counties. Speakers can also be found in the towns of Tallinn and Tartu and the rest of Estonia.\n\nVõro is a descendant of the old South Estonian regional language and is the least influenced by Standard Estonian (which is based on Northern Estonian dialects). Võro was once spoken further south and east of historical Võromaa in South Estonian-speaking enclaves Lutsi, Leivu and Kraasna in what is now Latvia and Russia. In addition to Võro, other contemporary variants of South Estonian include the Mulgi, Tartu and Seto dialect.\n\nOne of the earliest written evidences of South Estonian is a translation of the New Testament (\"Wastne Testament\") published in 1686. Although the status of South Estonian began to diminish after the 1880s, the language began to undergo a revival in the late 1980s.\n\nThe majority of Estonians perceive the Võro language as a modern synonym for South Estonian. Today, Võro is used in the works of some of Estonia's best-known playwrights, poets, and authors (Madis Kõiv, Ülle Kauksi, Jaan Kaplinski, Ain Kaalep, etc.). One newspaper is printed in Võro: the fortnightly \"Uma Leht\" (literally 'Our Own Newspaper'). 26 public schools offer weekly special classes (mostly extracurricular) in modern Võro.\n\nEstonia's contribution to the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 was the song \"Tii\", which was performed by Neiokõsõ in Võro. \n\nThe language is endangered, and according to Kadri Koreinik this is due to the government's lack of legal commitment to protect the language.\n\nVõro employs the Latin script, like Estonian and Finnish.\n\nMost letters (including \"ä\", \"ö\", \"ü\", and \"õ\") denote the same sounds as in Estonian, with a few exceptions. The letter \"q\" stands for the glottal stop and \"y\" denotes , a vowel very close to Russian \"ы\" or Polish \"y\" (from 2005 written \"õ\").\n\nPalatalization of consonants is marked with an acute accent (´) or apostrophe ('). In proper typography and in handwriting, the palatalisation mark does not extend above the cap height (except uppercase letters \"Ń\", \"Ŕ\", \"Ś\", \"V́\" etc.), and it is written above the letter if the letter has no ascender (\"ǵ\", \"ḿ\", \"ń\", \"ṕ\", \"ŕ\", \"ś\", \"v́\" etc.) but written to the right of it otherwise (\"b’\", \"d’\", \"f’\", \"h’\", \"k’\", \"l’\", \"t’\"). In computing, it is not usually possible to enter these character combinations or to make them look esthetically pleasing with most common fonts, so the apostrophe is generally placed after the letter in all cases. This convention is followed in this article as well.\n\nVõro has preserved the system of vowel harmony that was present in Proto-Finnic. This distinguishes it from Estonian and some other Finnic languages, which have lost it.\n\nThe vowel harmony system distinguishes front, back and neutral vowels, much like the system found in Finnish. A word cannot contain both front and back vowels; suffixes automatically adapt the backness of the vowels depending on the type of vowels found in the word it is attached to. Neutral vowels can be combined with either type of vowel, although a word that contains only neutral vowels has front vowel harmony. The only neutral vowel is \"i\", like in Votic but unlike Finnish and Karelian, where \"e\" is also neutral.\n\nThe vowel \"y\" is considered a back vowel for harmony purposes, but does not participate in harmony itself, as it does not occur in suffixes and endings.\n\nSome examples, with Estonian and Finnish included for comparison:\n\nAll Võro consonants (except and ) can be palatalized. The glottal stop (q, IPA ) is a very common sound in Võro.\n\nEndings are shown only in the back vowel harmony variant. The \"e\" of the illative ending does not undergo vowel harmony, so it never changes to \"õ\".\n\nOnly the more common endings are shown. There are some unusual/irregular endings that are only found in a few words or word types.\n\nNotes:\n\nSome morphological features of the Võro language are considered to be very old. For instance the 3rd person singular of the indicative mood can be either without an ending or, alternatively, with a \"s\"-ending:\nAmong the Finnic languages, such double verb conjugation can be found only in the South Estonian and Karelian languages.\n\nVõro has a negative particle that is appended to the end of the verb, whereas standard Estonian and Finnish have a negative verb, which precedes the verb. In Estonian and Finnish, the negative verb \"ei\" (Finnish \"en/et/ei/emme/ette/eivät\") is used in both present and past negation, whereas in Võro the same is expressed by different particles ending with \"-i(q)\" or \"-s\":\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Võro:\n\nAs comparison the same sentence in Standard Estonian:\n\nIn Finnish:\n\n\n"}
