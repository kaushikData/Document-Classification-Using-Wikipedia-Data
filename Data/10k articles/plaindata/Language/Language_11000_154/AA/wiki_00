The villa and its alfoz, under the authority of the town government (\"concejo\"), constituted what was called a \"Comunidad de Villa y Tierra\", an autonomous political division within the kingdom. At the center of this community, the villa (or sometimes a city) comprised an urban area and often a castle and a fortified wall.\n\nBy the 12th century, the alfoces had fiscal, judicial and military functions. Furthermore, they lent themselves to the communal use of land for silvopastoral agriculture; however, in the year 1100, the Spanish kings began to allocate portions of land to the Roman Catholic Church and the nobility, an act that undermined the very purpose of the alfoz.\n\nThe alfoz and its villa formed what would later be known as a municipality. The word alfoz comes from the Arabic \"al-hawz\", meaning \"rural district\", and remains to this day an element of many place names in Spanish geography.\n\n"}

{"id": "5724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5724", "title": "Cape Breton Island", "text": "Cape Breton Island\n\nCape Breton Island (—formerly '; or '; ; or simply \"Cape Breton\") is an island on the Atlantic coast of North America and part of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nThe island accounts for 18.7% of Nova Scotia's total area. Although the island is physically separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the Strait of Canso, the long rock-fill Canso Causeway connects it to mainland Nova Scotia. The island is east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western coasts fronting on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence; its western coast also forms the eastern limits of the Northumberland Strait. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forms the western limits of the Cabot Strait. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the highlands of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, (\"Arm of Gold\" in French), dominates the island's centre.\n\nThe island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: Cape Breton, Inverness, Richmond, and Victoria. Their total population at the 2016 census numbered 132,010 \"Cape Bretoners\"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population. Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 2.9% since the 2011 census. Approximately 75% of the island's population is in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM) which includes all of Cape Breton County and is often referred to as Industrial Cape Breton, given the history of coal mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was Nova Scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe island has five reserves of the Mi'kmaq Nation: , , , , and /Chapel Island. is the largest in both population and land area.\n\nIts name may derive from near Bayonne, or more probably from \"Cape\" and the word ', the French demonym for ', the French historical region.\n\nCape Breton Island's first residents were likely Archaic maritime natives, ancestors of the Mi'kmaq. These peoples and their progeny inhabited the island (known as Unama'ki) for several thousand years and continue to live there to this day. Their traditional lifestyle centred around hunting and fishing because of the unfavourable agricultural conditions of their maritime home. This ocean-centric lifestyle did, however, make them among the first indigenous peoples to discover European explorers and sailors fishing in the St Lawrence Estuary. John Cabot reportedly visited the island in 1497. However, European histories and maps of the period are of too poor quality to be sure whether Cabot first visited Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's Cabot Trail, and by the Cabot's Landing Historic Site & Provincial Park, near the village of Dingwall.\n\nThe local Mi'kmaq peoples began trading with European fishermen when the fishermen began landing in their territories as early as the 1520s. In about 1521–22, the Portuguese under João Álvares Fagundes established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now Ingonish on the island's northeastern peninsula. These fishermen traded with the local population but did not maintain a permanent settlement. This Portuguese colony's fate is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.\n\nDuring the Anglo-French War of 1627 to 1629, under Charles I, the Kirkes took Quebec City; Sir James Stewart of Killeith, Lord Ochiltree planted a colony on Unama'ki at Baleine, Nova Scotia; and Alexander's son, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, established the first incarnation of \"New Scotland\" at Port Royal. These claims, and larger European ideals of native conquest were the first time the island was incorporated as European territory, though it would be several decades later that treaties would actually be signed (no copies of these treaties exist).\n\nThese Scottish triumphs, which left Cape Sable as the only major French holding in North America, did not last. Charles I's haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant the new North American gains would be bargained away in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632), which established which European power had claim over the territories, but did not in fact establish that Europeans had any claim to begin with.\n\nThe French quickly defeated the Scots at Baleine, and established the first European settlements on Île Royale: present day Englishtown (1629) and St. Peter's (1630). These settlements lasted only one generation, until Nicolas Denys left in 1659. The island did not have any European settlers for another fifty years before those communities along with Louisbourg were re-established in 1713, after which point European settlement was permanently established on the island.\n\nKnown as \"Île Royale\" (\"Royal Island\") to the French, the island also saw active settlement by France. After the French ceded their claims to Newfoundland and the Acadian mainland to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the French relocated the population of Plaisance, Newfoundland, to Île Royale and the French garrison was established in the central eastern part at Sainte Anne. As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to build a much larger fortification at Louisbourg to improve defences at the entrance to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and to defend France's fishing fleet on the Grand Banks. The French also built the Louisbourg Lighthouse in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America. In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included Île Saint-Jean, today called Prince Edward Island, and Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine.\n\nLouisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France. Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders with British naval assistance in 1745 and by British forces in 1758. The French population of Île Royale was deported to France after each siege. While French settlers returned to their homes in Île Royale after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, the fortress was demolished after the second siege. Île Royale remained formally part of New France until it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It was then merged with the adjacent, British colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Acadians who had been expelled from Nova Scotia and Île Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764, and established communities in north-western Cape Breton, near Cheticamp, and southern Cape Breton, on and near Isle Madame.\n\nSome of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the Seven Years' War were Irish, although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition. From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of Nova Scotia and was governed from Halifax.\n\nThe first permanently settled Scottish community on Cape Breton Island was Judique, settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called \"O 's àlainn an t-àite\", or \"O, Fair is the Place.\"\n\nDuring the American Revolution, on 1 November 1776, John Paul Jones – the father of the American Navy – set sail in command of \"Alfred\" to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the area's coal mines. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of \"Mellish\", a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for John Burgoyne's troops in Canada.\n\nMajor Timothy Hierlihy and his regiment on board HMS \"Hope\" worked in and protected from privateer attacks on the coal mines at Sydney Cape Breton. Sydney Cape Breton provided a vital supply of coal for Halifax throughout the war. The British began developing the mining site at Sydney Mines in 1777. On 14 May 1778, Major Hierlihy arrived at Cape Breton. While there, Hierlihy reported that he \"beat off many piratical attacks, killed some and took other prisoners.\"\n\nA few years into the war there was also a naval engagement between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton. French ships (fighting with the Americans) were re-coaling and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\nIn 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies: New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of St. John's Island (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and Newfoundland. The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at Sydney on its namesake harbour fronting on Spanish Bay and the Cabot Strait. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (1784–1787) and his successor was William Macarmick (1787).\n\nA number of United Empire Loyalists emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton. David Mathews, the former Mayor of New York City during the American Revolution, emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783. He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.\n\nFrom 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was John Despard, brother of Edward.\n\nAn order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the Duke of York by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg in 1758.\n\nLarge-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with schooners for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger brigs and brigantines, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the full-rigged ship \"Lord Clarendon\", the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.\n\nIn 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia. This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of Newfoundland and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of Highland Scots numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the Highland Clearances. Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities. To this day, Gaelic is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners. The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.\n\nThe 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes. The famous murder of William Davis by strike breakers, and the seizing of the New Waterford power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. William Davis Miners' Memorial Day is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.\n\nThe turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Guglielmo Marconi.\n\nFollowing his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near Baddeck in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including Helen Keller—and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with hydrofoil technologies as well as the Aerial Experiment Association, financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the British Empire when the AEA \"Silver Dart\" took off from the ice-covered waters of Bras d'Or Lake. Bell also built the forerunner to the iron lung and experimented with breeding sheep.\n\nMarconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-Atlantic radio message from a station constructed at Table Head in Glace Bay to a receiving station at Poldhu in Cornwall, England. Marconi's pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi's station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the Royal Canadian Navy in World War I through to the early years of World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, there was a significant drop of Gaelic speakers due to anger over Ireland's neutrality toward the Nazi regime.\n\nPromotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and formal Gaelic language courses in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English assimilation.\nIn the 1960s, the Fortress of Louisbourg was partially reconstructed by Parks Canada. Since 2009, this National Historic Site of Canada has attracted an average of 90 000 visitors per year.\n\nThe island measures in area, making it the 77th largest island in the world and Canada's 18th largest island. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, mountains, woods and plateaus. Geological evidence suggests at least part of the island was joined with present-day Scotland and Norway, now separated by millions of years of plate tectonics.\n\nCape Breton Island's northern portion is dominated by the Cape Breton Highlands, commonly shortened to simply the \"Highlands\", which are an extension of the Appalachian mountain chain. The Highlands comprise the northern portions of Inverness and Victoria counties. In 1936, the federal government established the Cape Breton Highlands National Park covering across the northern third of the Highlands. The Cabot Trail scenic highway also encircles the plateau's coastal perimeter.\n\nCape Breton Island's hydrological features include the Bras d'Or Lake system, a salt-water fjord at the heart of the island, and freshwater features including Lake Ainslie, the Margaree River system, and the Mira River. Innumerable smaller rivers and streams drain into the Bras d'Or Lake estuary and on to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.\n\nCape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the Canso Causeway, which was completed in 1955, enabling direct road and rail traffic to and from the island, but requiring marine traffic to pass through the Canso Canal at the eastern end of the causeway.\n\nCape Breton Island is divided into four counties: Cape Breton, Inverness, Richmond, and Victoria.\n\nThe climate is one of mild, often pleasantly warm summers and cold winters, although the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Stream moderates the extreme winter cold found on the mainland, especially on the east side that faces the Atlantic. Precipitation is abundant year round, with annual totals up to 60 inches on the eastern side facing the Atlantic storms. Considerable snowfall occurs in winter, especially in the highlands.\n\nThe island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures: Scottish, Mi'kmaq, Acadian, Irish, English, with respective languages Scottish Gaelic, Mi'kmaq, French, and English. English is now the primary language, including a locally distinctive Cape Breton accent, while Mi'kmaq, Scottish Gaelic and Acadian French are still spoken in some communities.\n\nLater migrations of Black Loyalists, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the island's eastern part around the industrial Cape Breton region. Cape Breton Island's population has been in decline two decades with an increasing exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.\n\nAccording to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton [Economic region] in 2016 / 2011 / 2006 / 1996 was 132,010 / 135,974 / 142,298 / 158,260.\n\nReligious groups\n\nStatistics Canada in 2001 reported a \"religion\" total of 145,525 for Cape Breton, including 5,245 with \"no religious affiliation.\" Major categories included:\n\nMuch of the recent economic history of Cape Breton Island can be tied to the coal industry.\n\nThe island has two major coal deposits:\n\n\nSydney has traditionally been the main port, with facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the \"Cape Breton Post\" daily newspaper, as well as one television station, CJCB-TV (CTV), and several radio stations. The Marine Atlantic terminal at North Sydney is the terminal for large ferries traveling to Channel-Port aux Basques and seasonally to Argentia, both on the island of Newfoundland.\n\nPoint Edward on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former navy base () now converted to commercial use. The Canadian Coast Guard College is nearby at Westmount. Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also in Sydney Harbour.\n\nGlace Bay, the second largest urban community in population, was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine closed in the 1980s. Glace Bay was the hub of the Sydney & Louisburg Railway and a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.\n\nPort Hawkesbury has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and Canso Canal created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established. The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to Seawaymax vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans. Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel, and small craft can use the Little Bras d'Or channel or St. Peters Canal. While commercial shipping no longer uses the St. Peters Canal, it remains an important waterway for recreational vessels.\n\nThe industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the Cape Breton Development Corporation's (DEVCO) coal mines and the Sydney Steel Corporation's (SYSCO) steel mill. In recent years, the Island's residents have tried to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, call centres, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in fields such as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.\n\nWhile the Cape Breton Regional Municipality is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.\n\nTourism in particular has grown throughout the post-Second World War era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the Cabot Trail scenic drive. The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only Newfoundland; and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its Scottish Gaelic heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts.\n\nWhale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the Pilot whale.\n\nThe island's primary east-west road is Highway 105, the Trans-Canada Highway, although Trunk 4 is also heavily used. Highway 125 is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The Cabot Trail, circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and Trunk 19, along the island's western coast, are important secondary roads. The Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway maintains railway connections between the port of Sydney to the Canadian National Railway in Truro\n\nThe Cabot Trail is a scenic road circuit around and over the Cape Breton Highlands with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall. Coupled with the Fortress of Louisbourg, it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The \"Condé Nast\" travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the world's best island destinations.\n\nCape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the Highland Clearances. The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and céilidhs have become a popular attraction for tourists. Inverness County in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as Mabou and Judique. Judique is recognized as 'Baile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include Bruce Guthro, Buddy MacMaster, Natalie MacMaster, Ashley MacIsaac, The Rankin Family, Aselin Debison, Gordie Sampson, Lee Cremo, and the Barra MacNeils. The Margaree's of Cape Breton also serve as a large contributor of fiddle music celebrated throughout the island. This traditional fiddle music of Cape Breton is studied by musicians around the world, where its global recognition continues to rise.\n\nThe Men of the Deeps are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.\n\n\nCape Breton artists who have been recognized with major national or international awards include actor Harold Russell of North Sydney, who won an Academy Award in 1946 for his portrayal of Homer Parrish in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", and Lynn Coady and Linden MacIntyre of Inverness County, who are both past winners of the Giller Prize for Canadian literature. The Rankin Family and Rita MacNeil have recorded multiple albums certified as Double Platinum by Music Canada.\n\nPeople from Cape Breton have also achieved a number of firsts in Canadian politics and governance. These include Mayann Francis of Whitney Pier, the first Black Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Isaac Phills of Sydney, Nova Scotia, the first person of African descent to be awarded the Order of Canada, and Elizabeth May of Margaree Harbour, the first member of the Green Party of Canada elected to the House of Commons of Canada.\n\nCape Breton Island is also home to YouTube weather sensation Frankie MacDonald. Frankie MacDonald on his YouTube channel \"dogsandwolves\" has over 100,000 subscribers. He accurately predicted an above Magnitude 7 earthquake in New Zealand in November 2016.\n\nAmerican artists like sculptor Richard Serra, composer Philip Glass and abstract painter John Beardman spent part of the year on Cape Breton Island.\n\nDirector Ashley McKenzie's 2016 film \"Werewolf\" is set on the island and features local actors; McKenzie grew up on the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3104469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3104469", "title": "Cavetto", "text": "Cavetto\n\nA cavetto is a concave moulding with a regular curved profile that is part of a circle, widely used in architecture as well as furniture, picture frames, metalwork and other decorative arts. In describing vessels and similar shapes in pottery, metalwork and related fields, \"cavetto\" may be used of a variety of concave curves running round objects. The word comes from Italian, as a diminutive of \"cave\", from the Latin for \"hollow\" (it is the same root as cave). A vernacular alternative is \"cove\", most often used where interior walls curve at the top to make a transition to the roof, or for \"upside down\" cavettos at the bases of elements. \n\nThe cavetto moulding is the opposite of the convex, bulging, ovolo, which is equally common in the tradition of Western classical architecture. Both bring the surface forward, and are often combined with other elements of moulding. Usually they include a curve through about a quarter-circle (90°). A concave moulding of about a full semi-circle is known as a \"scotia\".\n\nOnly a minor element of decoration in classical architecture, the prominent cavetto cornice is a common feature of the ancient architecture of Egypt and the Ancient Near East.\n\nAncient Egyptian architecture made especial use of large cavetto mouldings as a cornice, with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a torus moulding (convex semi-circle) below. This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an \"Egyptian cornice\", \"hollow and roll\" or \"gorge cornice\", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out. \nMany types of Egyptian capitals for columns are essentially cavettos running round the shaft, often with added decoration. These include the types known as \"bell capitals\" or \"papyrus capitals\". These features are often reproduced in Egyptian Revival architecture, as in the Egyptian Building (1845) in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt's neighbours and as well as appearing in early Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and ancient Iran, for example at the Tachara palace of Darius I at Persepolis, completed in 486 BC. Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by Ardashir I (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the Sasanian dynasty. \n\nThe cavetto took the place of the Greek cymatium in many Etruscan temples, often painted with vertical \"tongue\" patterns, and combined with the distinctive \"Etruscan round moulding\", often painted with scales. \nThis emphasis on the cavetto was very different from its role in mature Ancient Greek architecture, where cavetto elements were relatively small and subordinated to essentially vertical elements, setting the style for the subsequent Western classical tradition. Often an essentially cavetto section is heavily decorated, in Gothic architecture often smothering the shape beneath. \n\nIn general the Greeks made much more use of the cyma moulding, where a cavetto and ovolo were placed one above the other to produce a \"S\" shape; the cymatium using this was a standard part of the cornice in the classical Ionic order, and often used elsewhere. There are two forms, depending on which curve is uppermost: in the \"cyma recta\" the cavetto is on top, in the \"cyma reversa\" the ovolo. A cavetto alone was sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the Doric order of the Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, one of the standard models for revived classical architecture from the Renaissance onwards. But small cavetto mouldings were normal at various places, including integrated ones, not distinguished as a distinct zone by lines or borders, at the bottom of the shaft of columns, beginning the transition to the wider base. These are called an apophyge, or \"concave sweep\". \n\nClaude Perrault, the architect of Louis XIV's rebuilding of the Louvre Palace, explained in his architectural textbook \"Ordonnance for the five kinds of columns after the method of the Ancients\" (1683) why he had replaced a cavetto with a cyma in his illustration of the Doric capital: \"a cavetto is not as strong and is more readily broken than the other molding\".\n\nIn plates and other flattish shapes, \"cavetto\" is used for the curving area linking the base and the rim. This is the case whether the rim is a broad flat surface (typical 20th century Western plate), or merely the edge of the cavetto (typical modern cereal bowl). Normally the term refers to the top surface of the vessel; if the underside is meant (where the curve is now convex), that may be described as \"under the cavetto\", \"under-cavetto\" and so forth. \n\nThe cavetto is very often left undecorated, but may have decoration of a different sort from the middle or a flat rim, and the term is typically used when it is necessary to describe this.

{"id": "33708322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33708322", "title": "Commuter town", "text": "Commuter town\n\nA commuter town is a town whose residents normally work elsewhere but in which they live, eat and sleep. The name also suggests that these communities have little commercial or industrial activity beyond a small amount of locally-oriented retail business.\n\nA commuter town may also be known as an \"exurb\" (short for \"extra-urban\"), \"bedroom community\" (Canada and northeastern U.S. usage), \"bedroom town\", \"bedroom suburb\" (U.S. usage), \"dormitory town\", \"dormitory suburb\" or less commonly a \"dormitory village\" (British English/Commonwealth/Ireland). In Japan, it may also be referred to with the \"wasei-eigo\" coinage .\n\nSuburbs and commuter towns often coincide, but are not synonymous. Similar to \"college town\", \"resort town\" and \"mill town\", the term \"commuter town\" describes the municipality's predominant economic function. A suburb, in contrast, is a community of lesser size, density, political power and/or commerce comparative to a nearby community that is usually of greater economic importance. A town's economic function may change, for example when improved transport brings commuters to industrial suburbs or railway towns in search of suburban living. Some suburbs, for example Teterboro, New Jersey and Emeryville, California, remained industrial when they became surrounded by commuter towns; many commuters work in such industrial suburbs but few reside in them; hence, they are not commuter towns.\n\nAs a general rule, suburbs are developed in areas adjacent to a main employment center, such as a town or a city, but may or may not have many jobs locally, whereas bedroom communities have few local businesses, and most residents who have jobs commute to employment centers some distance away. Commuter towns may be in rural or semi-rural areas, with a ring of green space separating them from the larger city or town. Where urban sprawl and conurbation have erased clear lines among towns and cities in large metropolitan areas, this is not the case.\n\nCommuter towns can arise for a number of different reasons. Sometimes, as in Sleepy Hollow, New York or Tiburon, California, a town loses its main source of employment, leaving its residents to seek work elsewhere. In other cases, a pleasant small town, such as Warwick, New York, over time attracts more residents but not large businesses to employ them, requiring denizens to commute to employment centers. Another cause, particularly relevant in the American South and West, is the rapid growth of once-small cities. Owing largely to the earlier creation of the Interstate Highway System, the greatest growth was seen by the sprawling metropolitan areas of these cities. As a result, many small cities were absorbed into the suburbs of these larger cities.\n\nOften, however, commuter towns form when workers in a region cannot afford to live where they work and must seek residency in another town with a lower cost of living. The late 20th century dot-com bubble and United States housing bubble drove housing costs in Californian metropolitan areas to historic highs, spawning exurban growth in adjacent counties. For example, most cities in western Riverside County, California can be considered exurbs of Orange County, California and Los Angeles County, California. , over 80% of the workforce of Tracy, California was employed in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nA related phenomenon is common in the resort towns of the American West that require large workforces, yet emphasize building larger single-family residences and other expensive housing. For example, the resort town of Jackson, Wyoming has spawned several nearby bedroom communities, including Victor, Idaho, Driggs, Idaho, and Alpine, Wyoming, where the majority of the Jackson workforce resides. On Long Island, New York, many of the workforce who serve The Hamptons also reside in communities more modest and more suburban than their workplace, giving rise to a daily reverse commuter flow from more dense to less dense areas.\nIn certain major European cities, such as Berlin and London, commuter towns were founded in response to bomb damage sustained during World War II. Residents were relocated to semi-rural areas within a radius, firstly because much inner city housing had been destroyed, and secondly in order to stimulate development away from cities as the industrial infrastructure shifted from rail to road. Around London, several towns – such as Basildon, Crawley, Harlow, and Stevenage – were built for this purpose by the Commission for New Towns.\n\nIn some cases, commuter towns can result from negative economic conditions. Steubenville, Ohio, for instance, had its own regional identity along with neighboring Weirton, West Virginia until the collapse of the steel industry in the 1980s. Combined with easier access to the much larger city of Pittsburgh via the Steubenville Pike and the Parkway West, Steubenville has shifted its marketing efforts to being a commuter town to Pittsburgh, as well as one with a lower cost of living in Ohio compared to tax-heavy Pennsylvania. In 2013, Jefferson County, Ohio (where Steubenville is located) was added to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area as part of its larger Combined Statistical Area.\n\nWhere commuters are wealthier and small town housing markets weaker than city housing markets, the development of a bedroom community may raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a process akin to gentrification. Long-time residents may be displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This can also be influenced by zoning restrictions in urbanized areas that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to places of employment.\n\nThe number of commuter towns increased in the US and the UK during the 20th century because of a trend for people to move out of the cities into the surrounding green belt. Historically, commuter towns were developed by railway companies to create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of development was the Metropolitan Railway (now part of London Underground) which marketed its Metro-land developments. This initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city London to suburbs such as Harrow and out of London itself, to commuter villages in Buckinghamshire or Hertfordshire. Commuter towns have more recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure, thus spurring the development of roads and public transportation systems. These can take the form of light rail lines extending from the city centre to new streetcar suburbs and new or expanded highways, whose construction and traffic can lead to the community becoming part of a larger conurbation.\n\nIn the United States, it is common for commuter towns to create disparities in municipal tax rates. When a commuter town collects few business taxes, residents must pay the brunt of the public operating budget in higher property or income taxes. Such municipalities may scramble to encourage commercial growth once an established residential base has been reached.\n\nA 2014 study by the British Office for National Statistics found that commuting also affects wellbeing. Commuters are more likely to be anxious, dissatisfied and have the sense that their daily activities lack meaning than those who don’t have to travel to work even if they are paid more.\n\nIn Belgium, the development of traditional rural Flemish towns surrounding Brussels into commuter towns is causing major language tensions, as most of the newcoming commuters are French-speaking or even international English-speaking families with no attachment to the Flemish roots. The Flemish movement in the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde area, with demands such as the strict enforcement of the Dutch language (restaurants with bilingual menus have been assaulted by activists, etc.) can be analyzed as a reaction against gentrification caused by the arrival of those wealthier non-Dutch speakers working in international companies, national administration or the European Parliament.\n\nThe expression \"exurb\" (for \"extra-urban\") was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book \"The Exurbanites\", to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the suburbs that are commuter towns for an urban area. Most exurbs serve as commuter towns, but most commuter towns are not exurban.\n\nExurbs vary in wealth and education level. In the United States, exurban areas typically have much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, though this is not necessarily the case in other countries. They also typically have average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties, and some have some of the highest median household incomes in their respective metropolitan area. However, depending on local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than suburbs nearer the city.\n\nExamples of exurbs in the U.S. include:\n\nCommuters from early exurbs, such as the end of Philadelphia's Main Line and the Northern Westchester region of Westchester County, New York, reached the city center via commuter rail and parkway systems.\n\nToday's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise lightly developed areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural, wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs. Exurbs may have originated independently of the major city to which many residents commute. Most consist almost exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs were organized on the principles of the garden city movement.\n\nYesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as Forest Hills and Garden City, New York, often become a later decade's suburbs, surrounded and absorbed into a belt of infill.\n\nMany suburbs within a metropolitan city proper enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period, after which growth slowed for several decades; however, since the 1990s extensive development has occurred outside of cities. There have also been significant growth differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many developments typical of exurbs, such as the proliferation of big box retailers, lie just on the outside, due to older suburbs' being restricted by inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are free to develop and grow.\n\nSome architects, environmentalists, and urban planners consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted planning. Comparatively low density towns – often featuring large lots and large homes – create heavy motor vehicle dependency. \nOthers argue that exurban environments, such as those that have emerged in Oregon over the last 40 years as a result of the state's unique land use laws, have helped to protect local agriculture and local businesses by creating strict urban growth boundaries that encourage greater population densities in centralized towns, while slowing or greatly reducing urban and suburban sprawl into agricultural and timber land.\n\n"}

According to T.H. Irwin, \"It is characteristic of the eristic to think of some arguments as a way of defeating the other side, by showing that an opponent must assent to the negation of what he initially took himself to believe.\" Eristic is arguing for the sake of conflict, as opposed to resolving conflict.\n\nEristic was a type of \"question-and-answer\" teaching method popularized by the Sophists, such as Euthydemos and Dionysodoros. Students learned eristic arguments to \"refute their opponent, no matter whether he [said] yes or no in answer to their initial question\".\nPlato contrasted this type of argument with dialectic and other more reasonable and logical methods (e.g., at \"Republic\" 454a). In the dialogue \"Euthydemus\", Plato satirizes eristic. It is more than persuasion, and it is more than discourse. It is a combination that wins an argument without regard to truth. Plato believed that the eristic style \"did not constitute a method of argument\" because to argue eristically is to consciously use fallacious arguments, which therefore weakens one's position.\n\nUnlike Plato, Isocrates (often considered a Sophist) did not distinguish eristic from dialectic. He held that both lacked a \"'useful application' ... that created responsible citizens\", which unscrupulous teachers used for \"enriching themselves at the expense of the youth.\"\n\nSchopenhauer considers that only logic pursues truth. For him, dialectic, sophistry and eristic have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself because it aims at victory. He names these three last methods as \"eristic dialectic (contentious argument).\"\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, \"Eristic Dialectic\" is mainly concerned to tabulate and analyze dishonest stratagems, so that they may at once be recognized and defeated, in order to continue with a productive dialectic debate. It is for this very reason that Eristic Dialectic must admittedly take victory, and not objective truth, for its selfish aim and purpose.\n\nArgumentation theory is a field of study that asks critical questions about eristic arguments and the other types of dialogue.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Tortosa in the Baix Ebre comarca around 1582 and died in Vallfogona de Riucorb (Conca de Barberà) in 1623. In 1605 he was ordained in Vic.\n\nVicent Garcia completed his religious studies in Barcelona. In Vic, where he was ordained, he was the secretary to Bishop Francis Robust. In 1607, Garcia was appointed to the Vallfogona Riucorb rectory, where he remained until 1621. This spell at Vallfogona was followed by appointment to the post of secretary of the Bishop of Girona, Peter Moncada. A year after taking up this post, Garcia obtained a doctorate in theology from the College of St. George and St. Matthias in Tortosa. Vallfogona Riucorb died on September 2, 1623. Barcelona was a central place in Garcia's life. It was a city he visited frequently. In Barcelona, Garcia moved in the literary circle that met Bishop Juan de Moncada in his palace.\n\nHe cultivated an artful and elegant verse in sonnets and décima form, and also wrote violent satire and obscene or grotesque compositions. His style was imitated by many Catalan authors of the 18th century, a phenomenon known as \"vallfogonisme.\" In 1703 a portion of his work was published. The 1770 edition was banned by the Inquisition. In 1988 Albert Rossich included some of his poems in an anthology of erotic and pornographic Catalan poetry from the 17th century.\n\nVicent Garcia was subject to numerous rumors. One of them was that he visited Madrid in 1622 at the request of King Philip IV. Another baseless belief was that he had a friendship with Lope de Vega. Perhaps the most absurd was the story of his alleged poisoning by Zaragoza courtiers. His literary stature, however, was unquestionable. He is widely accepted as the first great Catalan writer. His works were seminal, creating a literary school that lasted well into the nineteenth century.\n\nGarcia's poetry resembled that of Spanish contemporary poets, especially in terms of the formality and theme. His use of language was particularly unique. He had a predilection for an elegant form of language, and his writings were always laced with irony and literary subjects. It was this characteristic in his work that drew comparisons with Quevedo. Some of Garcia best-known poems are \"A Lady in A beautiful Black Hair\", \"Epitaph On the Grave Of a Heavy Drinker\", and the sonnet \"Time\". As the titles suggest, Garcia was a versatile poet, writing on diverse topics. He was also a playwright, and wrote a play, \"Comedy in Santa Barbara\", to mark the occasion of the inauguration of the chapel of Santa Barbara Vallfogona in 1617.\n"}

Like most Berber languages, masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (\"a-\", \"i-\", \"u-\"), while the feminine nouns generally start with \"t-\" and end with a \"-t\" (there are some exceptions, however). Note that most feminine nouns are in fact feminized versions of masculine nouns.\n\nExamples: \n\nSingular nouns generally start with an \"a-\", and do not have a suffix. Plural nouns generally start with an \"i-\" and often have a suffix such as \"-en\". There are three types of plural : External, Internal, Mixed:\n\n\n\n\nAs in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or cases of the noun, organized ergatively: one is unmarked, while the other serves as the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called \"free state\", the latter \"construct state\". The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:\n\nThe first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel \"a\" become \"u\" :\nThe second involves the loss of the initial vowel in the case of some feminine nouns (the sound represented by the letter 'e' is not considered a true vowel):\nThe third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (\"w\" or \"y\") word-initially:\nFinally, some nouns do not change for free state:\n\nDepending on the role of the noun in the sentence, it takes either its free or annexed state:\n\n\nAfter a preposition (at the exception of \"ar\" and \"s\"), all nouns take their annexed state:\n\n\nThere are three tenses : the Preterite (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the aorist alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present).\n\n\n\nConjugation in Kabyle is done by adding suffixes (prefixes, postfixes or both). These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes):\n\n\nKabyle is a satellite-framed based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:\n\nExamples:\n\nKabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle \"ur\" attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its arguments. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « \"ur\" » before the verb and the particle « \"ara\" » after the verb:\nOther negative words (acemma ... etc.) are used in combination with \"ur\" to express more complex types of negation.\n\nVerb derivation is done by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms : Causative, reflexive and Passive.\n\nTwo prefixes can cancel each other:\n\nEvery verb has a corresponding agent noun. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions however).\n\n\nEvery verb has a corresponding action noun, which in English it could be translated into verb+ing:\n\nThere are 6 regular stems of forming action nouns, and the 7th is for quality verbs : (C for consonant, V for vowel)\n\n\nThe predicative particle \"d\" is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle, \"d\" is equivalent to both \"it is + adjective\" and \"to be + adjective\", but cannot be replaced by the verb \"ili\" (to be). It is always followed by a noun (free state).\n\nExamples:\n\nThe predicative particle \"d\" should not be confused with the particle of coordination \"d\"; indeed, the latter is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.\n\nExample : « Ula d nekk. » — \"Me too.\"\n\nExample : « Axxam-nneɣ. » — \"Our house.\" (House-our)\n\n\nExample : « Yuɣ-it. » — \"He bought it.\" (He.bought-it)\n\n\n\nThere are three demonstratives, near-deictic ('this, these'), far-deictic ('that, those') and absence:\n\nOnly the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, Arabic is used. They are \"yiwen\" (f. \"yiwet\") \"one\", \"sin\" (f. \"snat\") \"two\". The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: \"sin n yirgazen\" \"two men\".\n\n\"First\" and \"last\" are respectively \"amezwaru\" and \"aneggaru\" (regular adjectives). Other ordinals are formed with the prefix \"wis\" (f. \"tis\"): \"wis sin\" \"second (m.)\", \"tis tlata\" \"third (f.)\", etc.\n\nPrepositions precede their objects: « \"i medden\" » \"to the people\", « \"si temdint\" » \"from the town\". All words preceded by a preposition (at the exception of « \"s\" » and « \"ar\" », \"towards\", \"until\" ) take their annexed state.\n\nSome prepositions have two forms : one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts.\n\nAlso some of these prepositions have a corresponding relative pronoun (or interrogative), example:\n\nConjunctions precede the verb: \"mi yiwweḍ \"\"when he arrived\", \"muqel ma yusa-d\" \"see if he came\".\n\n"}

He first described it in his book \"The Klingon Dictionary\". It is a nominative–accusative, primarily suffixing agglutinative language, and has an object–verb–subject word order. The Klingon language has a number of unusual grammatical features, as it was designed to sound and seem alien, but it has an extremely regular morphology.\n\nKlingon follows an object–verb–subject word order. Adverbs usually go at the beginning of the sentence and prepositional phrases go before the object.\n\nSentences can be treated as objects, and the word codice_2 is placed after the sentence. codice_2 is treated as the object of the next sentence. The adverbs, indirect objects and locatives of the latter sentence go after the subject, but before the codice_2\n\nKlingon has three noun classes. The first one is living beings with an innate capacity to use language. The second one is body parts (not the body itself) and the third is all other nouns. Klingon has no articles, so the word codice_6 \"table\" can mean \"a\" table or \"the\" table. The difference between the two is inferred from context. The suffixes are ordered based on type number; a type 2 suffix goes before a type 3 suffix, but after a type 1 suffix.\n\nThere are five types of noun suffixes. A word cannot have two suffixes of the same type.\n\nThis type has three suffixes:\n\n\nThis type of suffix forms plurals. There are three suffixes, one for each noun class.\n\nA noun does not require a plural suffix if a pronoun or pronominal prefix serves to indicate that it is plural, or if it is being used in conjunction with a number.\n\nThis type of suffix indicates the speaker's opinion of the applicability of the noun. There are three suffixes:\n\n\nThis type of suffix indicates possession or specifies which object is referred to. It contains twelve suffixes.\n\nThere are ten possession suffixes, indicating who is the possessor of the object, which may be a person. For first- and second-person possessors, there are different forms depending on whether the \"object\" is a being capable of using language.\nThere are also two determiner suffixes:\n\nExamples:\n\nThis type of suffix serves a syntactic role in the sentence. It contains five suffixes.\n\n\nKlingon verbs mark for aspect but not for tense, which is indicated where necessary by context and by time adverbs. Prefixes mark subject and object. There are ten types of suffix, and as with nouns, a verb can have no more than one suffix of any type. (The tenth type, called \"rovers\", are an exception.) Again as with nouns, the types of suffix must appear in a strict order, indicated by their type number: a type 2 suffix goes before a type 3 suffix, but after a type 1 suffix. A rover suffix can go between any of them.\n\nUnlike English, there is no infinitive. The presentation of the verb stem as an infinitive in this article's example sentences is just to show the individual morphemes.\n\nKlingon verb prefixes mark both the subject and the object.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Expressed with the type-5 verb suffix codice_63\n\nPrefixes must be present even if the nouns or pronouns they reference are declared explicitly. In certain cases with a third person object, a first or second person indirect object can be omitted by using the first and second person object prefixes instead. This is known as the prefix trick.\n\nExamples:\n\nThis type of suffix forms reflexive verbs. There are two suffixes.\n\n\nThis type of suffix deals with the subject's volition. There are five suffixes.\n\n\nThis type of suffix describes the action of the verb. There are two suffixes.\n\n\nThere is only one suffix in this category, the causative suffix codice_103. This suffix indicates that the subject is causing the object to do something. If the verb to which it is added is transitive, the object becomes the indirect object. Many Klingon words are derived this way. For example, the verb \"to clean\" (codice_104) is derived from the verb \"to be clean\" (codice_105).\n\nIntransitive verb: \n\nTransitive verb: \n\nThere are two unrelated suffixes in this group. The suffix codice_63 indicates an undefined subject. The verb prefixes that are normally used for first or second person \"subject\" with third person singular \"object\" are used to indicate first or second person \"object\". The suffix indicates that the subject is capable of performing the action of the verb.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nThis type indicates the speaker's opinion of the action of the verb. There are four suffixes.\n\n\nThis type indicates the verb's aspect. There are four Type 7 suffixes.\n\nNote that aspect is different from tense and independent of it. A \"completed\" event (perfective aspect, codice_19 or codice_132) can just as easily be set before, during, or after the time of description (past, present, or future tense), or unspecified for tense. For simplicity, this section says \"is completed\", not \"was, is, or will be completed.\" (Do not confusive perfective aspect with \"perfectly done\".)\n\n\nThe perfective aspect can also be indicated by the use of the verb form codice_149 after the main verb. This carries the connotation of irreversibility.\n\nThere is only one suffix in this group, the honorific suffix codice_151. It is used when addressing any type of superior, be it social, political, or military, and only when being very polite or having high regard for that person. It is never required.\n\nEleven suffixes specify syntactic roles in the sentence.\n\nTwo suffixes form specific types of noun from a verb.\n\n\nThese two suffixes inflect the verb in specific grammatical moods.\n\nThe following seven suffixes are used to form subordinate clauses. A subordinate clause may go after or before the clause it modifies.\n\nTime\n\nCause and effect\n\n\nThis type of suffix is known as a codice_197 in Klingon, which is translated as \"rover\" (codice_198 \"to wander\" + codice_199). There are four rovers. These suffixes have no defined position, and can go after the verb stem or after any suffix – even another rover – except after a type-9 suffix or where the result would be meaningless. They modify whatever directly precedes them.\n\n\nThe position of the rover suffixes affects the meaning of the word. Contrast\n\nKlingon has no verb that corresponds to the verb \"to be\"; the concept is expressed using a different grammatical construction. Pronouns can be used as verbs that act as the pronoun plus the verb to be. The pronoun can take verb suffixes, which then modify the pronoun like any other verb. A third-person subject that is not a pronoun must go after the pronoun-verb and carry the type-5 noun suffix codice_62\n\nExamples:\n\nKlingon does not have adjectives as a distinct part of speech. Instead, many intransitive verbs can be used as adjectives, in which case they follow the noun they modify.\nContrast (codice_227 \"coat\", and codice_228 \"be wet\")\nwith\n\nIn this construction, the only verbal suffixes allowed are rover suffixes such as codice_210 and codice_213.\nType-5 \"noun\" suffixes that would normally be attached to the noun are instead attached to the adjectival verb:\n\nAdverbs are usually placed at the beginning of the sentence, but time adverbs go before other adverbs. \n\nAdverbs can take the rover suffix codice_213 to denote the opposite adverbial.\n\n\nKlingon has seven conjunctions, and they are different for nouns and for sentences. The noun conjunctions are codice_240 for a logical conjunction, codice_241 for a logical disjunction and codice_242 for an exclusive disjunction. Noun conjunctions go after the nouns they connect. Sentence conjunctions are codice_243 for a logical conjunction, codice_54 for a logical disjunction and codice_182 for an exclusive disjunction. codice_246 (or codice_247) \"but\" is used to contrast sentences.\n\nIn a relative clause, the verb has the type-9 verb suffix codice_195 added to it. The order of the words in relative clauses remains the same as in regular clauses, but the head noun may optionally get the type-5 suffix codice_62 added.\n\nSince there is already a type-5 noun suffix marking the head noun, nothing other than the subject or the object can be marked as head noun. Two sentences are formed instead to form the same idea. Relative clauses can have nouns with type 5 suffixes as modifiers, but it can be ambiguous as they can be misinterpreted as being part of the main sentence.\n\nA purpose clause expresses the reason or goal of the action of the main clause. If it is modifying a noun it states the purpose of the noun. A purpose clause always goes before the clause or noun it modifies. This is the cause of some grammatical ambiguity in Klingon, as a codice_196 modifying a noun at the beginning of a sentence can be misinterpreted as modifying the entire sentence. This can be resolved in writing with punctuation.\n\n\n\nIn this section, noun phrases are indicated by the abbreviation \"NP\", and adjectives by \"A\".\n\nKlingon comparatives mainly rely on adjectives like codice_257 (\"to be many\"), codice_258 (\"to be few\"), codice_259 (\"to be the same\"), and codice_260 (\"to resemble, to be like\") to contrast the nouns. However, many (but not all) of the comparatives have unusual word orders that don't parse as regular Klingon sentences.\n\n\nA yes–no question in Klingon can be formed by adding the suffix to the regular form. The word for yes is codice_284 or codice_285 and the word for no is codice_286. Interrogative pronouns go where the answer would normally go, and don't reorder the sentence. Interrogative adverbs go at the beginning of the sentence.\n\nKlingon uses a base-10 system to count numbers. To form a multiple of 10, 100, 1000, 1000000, the word for the multiple of ten is suffixed to the digit. For example. codice_287 is a combination of the word codice_288 \"eight\" and the number forming suffix \"ten\".\n\nLarger powers go before smaller powers: codice_289 is \"eight-ten seven\". The number suffix is used to form ordinal numbers, and the number suffix indicates how many times an action has been repeated: codice_290 \"fourth\", codice_291 \"twelve times\".\n\n"}

It was introduced by E. Mark Gold in his paper with the same title.\n\nIn this model, a learner is provided with presentation (i.e. strings) of some formal language. The learning is seen as an infinite process. Each time an element of the presentation is read the learner should provide a representation (e.g. a formal grammar) for the language. It is said that a learner can identify in the limit a class of languages if given any presentation of any language in the class the learner will produce only a finite number of wrong representations, and therefore converge on the correct representation in a finite number of steps, without however necessarily being able to announce its correctness since a counterexample to that representation could appear as an element arbitrarily long after.\n\nGold defined two types of presentations:\n\nThis model is an early attempt to formally capture the notion of learnability.\nGold's paper introduces for contrast the stronger models\nA weaker formal model of learnability is the \"Probably approximately correct learning (PAC)\" model, introduced by Leslie Valiant in 1984.\n\nIt is instructive to look at concrete examples (in the tables) of learning sessions the definition of identification in the limit speaks about.\n\nDana Angluin gave the characterizations of learnability from text (positive information) in a 1980 paper. \n\nIf a learner is required to be effective, then an indexed class of recursive languages is learnable in the limit if there is an effective procedure that uniformly enumerates \"tell-tales\" for each language in the class (Condition 1). It is not hard to see that if an ideal learner (i.e., an arbitrary function) is allowed, then an indexed class of languages is learnable in the limit if each language in the class has a tell-tale (Condition 2).\n\nThe table shows which language classes are identifiable in the limit in which learning model. On the right-hand side, each language class is a superclass of all lower classes. Each learning model (i.e. type of presentation) can identify in the limit all classes below it. In particular, the class of finite languages is identifiable in the limit by text presentation (cf. Example 2 above), while the class of regular languages is not.\n\n\"Pattern Languages\", introduced by Dana Angluin in another 1980 paper, are also identifiable by normal text presentation; they are omitted in the table, since they are above the singleton and below the primitive recursive language class, but incomparable to the classes in between.\n\nCondition 1 in Angluin's paper is not always easy to verify. Therefore, people come up with various sufficient conditions for the learnability of a language class. See also \"Induction of regular languages\" for learnable subclasses of regular languages.\n\nA class of languages has finite thickness if every non-empty set of strings is contained in at most finitely many languages of the class. This is exactly Condition 3 in Angluin's paper. Angluin showed that if a class of recursive languages has finite thickness, then it is learnable in the limit.\n\nA class with finite thickness certainly satisfies MEF-condition and MFF-condition; in other words, finite thickness implies M-finite thickness.\n\nA class of languages is said to have finite elasticity if for every infinite sequence of strings formula_1 and every infinite sequence of languages in the class formula_2, there exists a finite number n such that formula_3 implies formula_4 is inconsistent with formula_5.\n\nIt is shown that a class of recursively enumerable languages is learnable in the limit if it has finite elasticity.\n\nA bound over the number of hypothesis changes that occur before convergence.\n\nA language L has infinite cross property within a class of languages formula_6 if there is an infinite sequence formula_7 of distinct languages in formula_6 and a sequence of finite subset formula_9 such that:\n\nNote that L is not necessarily a member of the class of language.\n\nIt is not hard to see that if there is a language with infinite cross property within a class of languages, then that class of languages has infinite elasticity.\n\n\n"}

The term Leaktivism was popularized by Micah White, the co-founder of the Occupy movement, in relation to the Panama Papers.\n\nThe Panama Papers are a collection of 11.5m leaked files from one of the world’s largest law firms, Mossack Fonseca. A German newspaper called Süddeutsche Zeitung was able to obtain the database from an anonymous source. The different files demonstrated the manner in which the different wealthy individuals are able to take advantage of secrete offshore tax regimes.\n\nTwelve national leaders are included among the 143 politicians impacted within the leak. The Russian president, Pakistan's prime minister, the former Vice-President of Iraq, the President of Ukraine, the father of the British Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister of Iceland are some of the politicians that were incriminated by the leak.\n\nThe information leaked in regards to the Panama Papers is considered one of the largest leaks in history. This leak is considered to be larger than both the US diplomatic cables distributed by WikiLeaks in 2010 and the secrete intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden in 2013. In total there 11.5m documents along with 2.6 terabytes of information taken from the Mossack Fonseca’s internal database.\n\nMicah White is the co-founder of Occupy and a democratic activist. His article in the Guardian states that the Panama Papers illustrate the rising of leaktivism. He argues that the Panama Papers show that leaking information can be an impactful form of protest. White argues that the leaks have the ability to destabilize numerous governments throughout the globe, impacting the credibility of powerful world leaders.\n\nWhite states that the Panama Papers have resulted in positive social change. He uses the example of the Prime Minister from Iceland, who was forced to resign from his position. However, he does argue that while the resignation of some corrupt political leaders is progress, it does not solve the larger problem; namely, that our world is being run by the top 1%. He says that individuals must go beyond traditional activism and try different methods of protest, developing the manner in which our society protests in relation to the technology that is developing.\n\nWhite concludes his article by stating that the main problem that the Panama Papers illustrates is a questions concerning the governance of our world. The leak demonstrates who is actually in power. He further argues that the distribution of the papers will only be successful if it bring upon change.\"\n"}

She grew up in Tehran in a middle-class Iranian family. Both her parents were politically active and supported Marxist causes against the monarchy of the last Shah. When the Iranian Revolution took place in 1979, they were dismayed and intimidated by the Muslim fundamentalists who took power.\n\nDuring her youth, Marjane was exposed to the growing brutalities of the various regimes. Many of her family friends were persecuted, arrested, and even murdered. She found a hero in her paternal uncle, Anoosh, who had been a political prisoner and lived in exile in the Soviet Union for a time. Young Marjane greatly admired her uncle, and he in turn doted on her, treating her like a daughter. Tragically, as detailed in Satrapi's autobiography, Anoosh was arrested again and executed; his body was buried in an unmarked grave in the prison. Anoosh was only allowed one visitor before his execution, and he requested Marjane. The loss of her uncle left her deeply upset. As a young teen, Marjane began to act out, getting into trouble with the police for breaking modesty codes and buying music banned by the regime.\n\nHer parents grew concerned that Marjane, a strong-willed and rambunctious teenager, would run afoul of the strict new public codes for women. They arranged for her to study abroad, and in 1983 she arrived in Vienna, Austria, to attend the Lycée Français de Vienne. According to her autobiographical graphic novel \"Persepolis\", she stayed in Vienna through her high-school years, sometimes staying at friends' homes but for three months living on the streets. After an almost deadly bout of pneumonia, she returned to Iran. She studied visual communication, eventually obtaining a master's degree from Islamic Azad University in Tehran.\n\nDuring this time, Satrapi went to illegal parties hosted by her friends, where she met a man named Reza, a veteran of the Iran–Iraq War. She married him at the age of 21, but they divorced a couple of years later. Satrapi then moved to Strasbourg, France.\n\nSatrapi is married to Mattias Ripa, a Swedish national. They live in Paris. Apart from her native language, Persian, she speaks French, English, Swedish, German, and Italian.\n\nSatrapi became famous worldwide because of her critically acclaimed autobiographical graphic novels, originally published in French in four parts in 2000–2003 and in English translation in two parts in 2003 and 2004, respectively, as \"Persepolis and Persepolis 2\", which describe her childhood in Iran and her adolescence in Europe. \"Persepolis\" won the \"Angoulême \"Coup de Coeur\" Award\" at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. Her later publication, \"Embroideries\" (\"Broderies\"), was also nominated for the Angoulême Album of the Year award in 2003, an award that her novel \"Chicken with Plums\" (\"Poulet aux prunes\") won. She has also contributed to the Op-Ed section of \"The New York Times\".\n\nComics Alliance listed Satrapi as one of 12 women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.\n\nSatrapi prefers the term \"comic books\" to \"graphic novels.\" \"People are so afraid to say the word 'comic',\" she told the \"Guardian\" newspaper in 2011. \"It makes you think of a grown man with pimples, a ponytail and a big belly. Change it to 'graphic novel' and that disappears. No: it's all comics.\"\n\n\"Persepolis\" was adapted into an animated film of the same name. It debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival in May 2007 and shared a Special Jury Prize with Carlos Reygadas's \"Silent Light\" (\"Luz silenciosa\"). Co-written and co-directed by Satrapi and director Vincent Paronnaud, the French-language picture stars the voices of Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, and Simon Abkarian. The English version, starring the voices of Gena Rowlands, Sean Penn, and Iggy Pop, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in January 2008. Satrapi was the first woman to be nominated for the award.\n\n\"Persepolis\" was a very successful film both commercially (with over a million admissions in France alone) as well as critically, winning Best First Film at the César Awards 2008. The film reflects many tendencies of first-time filmmaking in France (which makes up around 40% of all French cinema each year), notably in its focus on very intimate rites of passage, and quite ambivalently recounted coming-of-age moments.\n\nSatrapi and Paronnaud continued their successful collaboration with a second film, a live-action adaptation of \"Chicken with Plums\", released in late 2011. In 2012, Satrapi directed and acted in the comedy crime film \"Gang of the Jotas\", from her own screenplay.\n\nIn 2014 Satrapi directed the comedy-horror film \"The Voices\", from a screenplay by Michael R. Perry.\n\nFollowing the Iranian elections in June 2009, Satrapi and Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf appeared before Green Party members in the European Parliament to present a document allegedly received from a member of the Iranian electoral commission claiming that the reform candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, had actually won the election, and that the conservative incumbent Mahmoud Ahmedinejad had received only 12% of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The son of Rabbi Dov Berish Elefant and his wife Bava Elefant (née Eisenberger). His father was a Rabbi and a Dayan (religious judge), was fluent in 11 languages, and was a bank manager for many years. His mother, Bava, was a businesswoman, and was the mother of 16 children, while some children died at an early age. When Mendel was 11 years old his mother died from a rare illness, and his father remarried.\n\nMendel studied at the local Talmud Torah at Vișeu de Sus, and continued on to study at the Yeshivot of Northern Romania and Czechoslovakia, one of them being the Yeshiva of Siget. During his adult years he moved to Czechoslovakia and lived there.\nDuring the 1920s, Mendel immigrated to Brazil, to the city of Rio de Janeiro, in order to save money towards his upcoming marriage with his fiancée, whom he married upon his return to Czechoslovakia. While in Rio de Janeiro, Mendel published poems and literary articles in local journals and newspapers.\nIn Czechoslovakia, between the two world wars, Mendel worked as a journalist in Yiddish Newspapers in the cities of Munkács and Košice.\n\nIn 1929 Mendel was the editor of a literary weekly named \"Der Fackl\" that appeared in Košice. Additionally, he edited another weekly named \"Der Kantshik\", and in 1933 he became the editor of \"Dus Yiddishe Vort\" in Košice, named in Hungarian \"zsidó szó\", which was well-known at the time.\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Mendel was a journalist in the city of Lvov in Poland, at a local Yiddish newspaper.\n\nDuring the Nazi invasion and the outbreak of World War II, Mendel was on a mission in Warsaw and fled towards Lithuania. His wife and child in Lvov fled to Lithuania as well, and they were reunited in Vilna. Mendel had been walking in the snow for a long period of time, he developed gangrene and once he arrived in Vilna - the doctors had to amputate his toes, among other things.\n\nLater, his health continued to deteriorate, and he couldn't continue to run and was caught by the Germans. The year of death is estimated at 1942.\n\nHis wife, Ilonka Elefant, and his young son who was approximately 10 years old (known fondly as \"Pindichku\"), continued to run until they were eventually intercepted by the Germans and were taken to a concentration camp. Upon arrival at the camp, a Nazi officer noticed the boy who was very handsome and had light blonde hair and blue eyes, and was a talented violinist. He took the boy to his house as a companion for his own son who was his age.\n\nIlonka Elefant perished in the camps, but managed to smuggle out a letter to her sister in hiding through a non-Jewish woman who worked at the camp every day, telling her what had befallen her son.and asking that she find him once the opportunity arose.\n\nAfter the War, Ilonka's sister went to wealthy relatives in South America and they hired private investigators who were able to trace this Nazi Officer from camp to camp, but ultimately lost track of him when the war ended and the camps dissolved. No one knows what happened to the child, and it was assumed that the Nazi officer had eventually killed him.\n"}

Its status now has been changed to attached department. Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between national and provincial governments and institutions for using Urdu language. However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include standardisation and linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life. In this respect, large amounts of legal and scientific documents are translated from English and other languages for publication into Urdu. These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation. Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department. The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage & Integration.Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist Dr. Anwaar Ahmad was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).\n\nThe institution aims to facilitate the use and adoption of Urdu language in grammical Persian through publications and other reading materials for individuals and organisations. It also provides linkages for cooperation and collaboration among various academic, research and educational institutions for use of Urdu language and native languages of the country. Over the years efforts have also been made to promote and facilitate Urdu as an official and business language; as a Medium of instruction; and as a medium of expression in the country. Moreover, the development of Urdu software is also encouraged at various levels to become more distant from Hindustani.\nThe organisational structure consists of six divisions that include: Dictionary section (\"Darul Lughaat\"), Translations section (\"Darul Tarjuma\"), Literature section (\"Darul Tasneef\"), and Publications section (\"Darul Isha’at\") respectively. There is also a department of Urdu Informatics (اردو اطلاعیات) to carry out research in developing the suitable hardware and software for the use of language in electronic media. A dedicated library contains extensive resources on Urdu, and issues regular Urdu Bulletins.\n\nThe institution has published a wide range of general, scientific and technical dictionaries and an Urdu Thesaurus. Especially, the \"Qaumi English-Urdu Dictionary\" has been based on Webster's Dictionary. A vast amount of literature has also been produced to encourage reading habits among children.\n\nIn 1980, the Authority standardised the Urdu keyboard layout for typewriters based on Naskh script. Later on, with the arrival of the digital age, the layout was improved for teleprinters and Information processing. Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of \"Urdu Zabta Takhti\" (اردو ضابطہ تختی) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as Computerised National Identity Cards by NADRA and a number of E-Governance initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage. Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode. Localization of Microsoft applications like Windows and Office in Urdu is also done by then NLA, now NLPD.\n\n\n\n"}

The book discusses writers such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Étienne Condillac, Louis Hjelmslev, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Roman Jakobson, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, André Leroi-Gourhan, and William Warburton. The English translation by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak was first published in 1976. A revised edition of the translation was published in 1997. A further revised edition was published in January 2016.\n\nThe work was initially submitted by Derrida as a \"Doctorat de spécialité\" thesis (directed by Maurice de Gandillac) under the title \"De la grammatologie : Essai sur la permanence de concepts platonicien, aristotélicien et scolastique de signe écrit\" (\"Of Grammatology: Essay on the Permanence of Platonic, Aristotelian and Scholastic Concepts of the Written Sign\"). His submission was unsuccessful.\n\nDerrida argues that throughout the Western philosophical tradition, writing has been considered as merely a derivative form of speech, and thus as a \"fall\" from the \"full presence\" of speech. In the course of the work he deconstructs this position as it appears in the work of several writers, showing the myriad aporias and ellipses to which this leads them. Derrida does not claim to be giving a critique of the work of these thinkers, because he does not believe it possible to escape from operating with such oppositions. Nevertheless, he calls for a new science of \"grammatology\" that would relate to such questions in a new way.\n\n\"Of Grammatology\" introduced many of the concepts which Derrida would employ in later work, especially in relation to linguistics and writing.\n\nThe book starts with a review of Saussure's linguistic structuralism, as presented in the\" Course in General Linguistics\". In particular, Derrida analyzes the concept of \"sign\", which for Saussure has the two separate components of sound and meaning. These components are also called signifier (\"signifiant\") and signified (\"signifié\").\n\nDerrida quotes Saussure: “Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.” Critiquing this relationship between speech and writing, Derrida suggests that written symbols are legitimate signifiers on their own—that they should not be considered as secondary or derivative relative to oral speech.\n\n\"Of Grammatology\" is one of three books which Derrida published in 1967, and which served to establish his reputation. The other two were \"La voix et le phénomène\", translated as \"Speech and Phenomena\", and \"L'écriture et la différence\", translated as \"Writing and Difference\". It has been called a foundational text for deconstructive criticism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This contrasts greatly from commercial sponsorship because the benefits of the endorsement go to the individual talent or programmers, while the stations and networks receive no revenue.\n\nIn the 1950s, concern over illicit business practices in television and radio including; plugola, payola, and rigged game shows led to congressional and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearings. In 1959, Attorney General William Rogers reported to President Dwight Eisenhower that deceptive and false advertising and programming was becoming a trend in the United States, and needed to stop. In that same year, FCC Chairman John Doerfer presented his plan to expand public service programming on television networks. The plan called for some public service programming in prime time slots, which did not occur before this. The networks likely had the same agenda as Doerfer, to regain the respect of the viewers, and agreed to Doerfer’s plan. By 1960, amendments were made to the Communications Act of 1934 to punish those who engaged in these illicit acts in the future.\n\n"}

It may be a sticker or attached by twist tie or other means.\nSome jurisdictions require items (possibly exceptions for bulk good and produce) to be individually marked with the price, or have shelf tags or barcode scanners available so customers can determine prices without consulting store staff. In some cases, unit price is also required.\n\nSome jurisdictions also outlaw price discrimination except for different quantities (e.g. quantity discounts are allowed) or different types of customers (e.g. individuals vs. organizations that might be expected to buy in bulk or have better creditworthiness). For example, the 1936 Robinson–Patman Act outlaws this practice in the United States.\n\nMany price tags also bear the name of the store.\n\nBefore the late 19th century, in most cases, retail goods did not have a fixed price, and each customer would be expected to haggle with the store clerk. The Quakers, who found it immoral for different customers to pay different prices (now known as price discrimination) were an exception. In the 1870s, Wanamaker's in Philadelphia and Macy's in New York (Rowland Hussey Macy was a Quaker) began affixing physical tags to items, eliminating haggling. This allowed shorter training time for new clerks (who would no longer need to know the art of haggling nor the range of accepted prices for every item) and allowed clerks to serve more customers.\n\nEven large stores kept goods behind a counter, requiring clerks to fetch items for customers. The Piggly Wiggly chain of grocery stores was the first to become self-service in 1916, further cementing the need for price tags. Price tags soon became commonplace in Western retail stores, and haggling rare outside of proprietors and individuals selling used items.\n\n"}

A qualified digital certificate, in addition to other specific services provided by a qualified trust service provider, is required to elevate the status of an electronic signature to that of being considered a qualified electronic signature. Using cryptography, the digital certificate, also known as a public key certificate, contains information to link it to its owner and the digital signature of the trust entity that verifies the authenticity of the content that has been signed.\n\nAccording to eIDAS, to be considered a qualified digital certificate, the certificate must meet the requirements provided in Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, including, but not limited to:\n\nThe need for non-repudiation and authentication of electronic signatures was originally addressed in the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC to help facilitate secure transactions, specifically those that occur across the borders of EU Member states.

The provider must be listed upon the EU Trust List; otherwise, they are not permitted to provide qualified digital certificates or other qualified trust services.\nThe trust service provider is required to abide by the guidelines established under eIDAS for creating qualified digital certificate, which include:\n\nIn court, a qualified electronic signature provided the highest level of probative value, which makes it difficult to refute its authorship. A qualified electronic signature, along with its qualified certificate is given the same consideration as a handwritten signature when used as evidence in legal proceedings. The validity of a qualified electronic signature that has been created with a qualified certificate must be accepted by other EU member states regardless of which member state the signature was produced in.\n\nIn other parts of the world, similar concepts have been created to define standards for electronic signatures. In Switzerland, the digital signing standard ZertES has comparable standards that address the conformity and regulation of trust service providers who product digital certificates. \n\nIn the United States, the NIST Digital Signature Standard (DSS) does not provide a comparable standard for regulating qualified certificates that would address non-repudiation of a signatory’s qualified certificate. An amendment to NIST DSS is currently being discussed that would be more in-line with how eIDAS and ZertES handle trusted services.\n\n\n"}

The language area also comprises the north of the German-speaking Community of Belgium as well as the southern edge of the Limburg province of the Netherlands, especially Kerkrade (\"Kirchroa\"). The name derives from the Ripuarian Franks (\"Rheinfranken\"), who settled in the area from the 4th century onward.\n\nThe most famous member is \"Kölsch\", the local dialect of Cologne. Dialects belonging to the Ripuarian group almost always call themselves \"Platt\" like \"Öcher Platt\" (of Aachen) or \"Eischwiele Platt\" (of Eschweiler), \"Kirchröadsj Platt\" (of Kerkrade) \"Bocheser Platt\" (of Bocholtz) or \"Bönnsch Platt\" (of Bonn). Most of the more than one hundred Ripuarian dialects are bound to one specific village or municipality. Usually there are small distinctive differences between neighbouring dialects (which are, however, easily noticeable to locals), and increasingly bigger differences between the more distant dialects. These are described by a set of isoglosses called the Rhenish fan in linguistics. The way people talk, even if they are not using Ripuarian, often allows them to be traced precisely to a village or city quarter where they learned to speak.\n\nAbout a million people speak a variation of Ripuarian dialect, which constitutes about one quarter of the inhabitants of the area. Penetration of Ripuarian in everyday communication varies considerably, as does the percentage of Ripuarian speakers from one place to another. In some places there may only be a few elderly speakers left, while elsewhere Ripuarian usage is common in everyday life. Both in the genuine Ripuarian area and far around it, the number of people passively understanding Ripuarian to some extent exceeds the number of active speakers by far. Estimates assume some ten, and up to twenty million speakers.\n\nSpeakers are centred on the German city of Köln (Cologne). The language's distribution starts from the important geographic transition into the flat-lands coming down from the Middle Rhine. The Ripuarian varieties are related to the Moselle Franconian languages spoken in the southern Rhineland (Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland) in Germany, to the Luxembourgish language in Luxembourg, to the Low Franconian Limburgish language in the Dutch province of Limburg, and to Low Dietsch in the province of Liège, Belgium. Most of the historic roots of Ripuarian languages are in Middle High German, but there were other influences too, such as Latin, Low German, Dutch, French and Southern Meuse-Rhenish (Limburgish). Several elements of grammar are unique to Ripuarian and do not exist in the other languages of Germany.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands officially recognise some Ripuarian dialects as minority languages, and the European Union likewise follows.\n\nRipuarian (excluding City-Colognian) emphasised personal pronouns:\n"}

{"id": "200107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200107", "title": "Tone sandhi", "text": "Tone sandhi\n\nTone sandhi is a phonological change occurring in tonal languages, in which the tones assigned to individual words or morphemes change based on the pronunciation of adjacent words or morphemes. It usually simplifies a bidirectional tone into a one-direction tone. It is a type of sandhi, or fusional change, from the Sanskrit word for \"joining\".\n\nTone sandhi occurs to some extent in nearly all tonal languages, manifesting itself in different ways. Tonal languages, characterized by their use of pitch to affect meaning, appear all over the world, especially in the Niger-Congo language family of Africa, and the Sino-Tibetan language family of East Asia, as well as other East Asian languages such as Tai-Kadai, Vietnamese, and Papuan languages. Tonal languages are also found in many Oto-Manguean and other languages of Central America, as well as in parts of North America (such as Athabaskan in British Columbia, Canada), and Europe.\n\nMany North American and African tonal languages undergo \"syntagmatic displacement,\" as one tone is replaced by another in the event that the new tone is present elsewhere in the adjacent tones. Usually, these processes of assimilation occur from left to right. In the Bantu languages of West Africa, for example, an unaccented syllable takes the tone from the closest tone to its left. However, in East and Southeast Asia, \"paradigmatic replacement\" is a more common form of tone sandhi, as one tone changes to another in a certain environment, whether or not the new tone is already present in the surrounding words or morphemes.\n\nMany languages spoken in China have tone sandhi, some of it quite complex. Southern Min (Minnan), which includes Hokkien, Taiwanese, and Teochew, has a complex system, with in most cases every syllable changing into a different tone, and which tone it turns into depending on the final consonant of the syllable that bears it.\nTake for example Taiwanese varieties of Hokkien, which have two tonemes (numbered 4 and 8 in the diagram above) that occur in checked syllables (those ending in a stop consonant) and five tonemes in syllables that do not end in a stop. In Taiwanese, within a phonological phrase, all its non-neutral-tone syllables save for the last undergo tone sandhi. Among the unchecked syllables, tone 1 becomes 7, 7 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2, and 2 becomes 1. Tone 5 becomes 7 or 3, depending on dialect. Stopped syllables ending in Pe̍h-ōe-jī , , or take the opposite tone (phonetically, a high tone becomes low, and a low tone becomes high) whereas syllables ending in a glottal stop (written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī by ) drop their final consonant to become tone 2 or 3.\n\nThe seven or eight tones of Hmong demonstrate several instances of tone sandhi. In fact the contested distinction between the seventh and eighth tones surrounds the very issue of tone sandhi (between glottal stop (-m) and low rising (-d) tones). High and high-falling tones (marked by -b and -j in the RPA orthography, respectively) trigger sandhi in subsequent words bearing particular tones. A frequent example can be found in the combination for numbering objects (ordinal number + classifier + noun): ib (one) + tus (classifier) + dev (dog) > ib tug dev (note tone change on the classifier from -s to -g).\n\nTone sandhi is compulsory as long as the environmental conditions that trigger it are met. It is not to be confused with tone changes that are due to derivational or inflectional morphology. For example, in Cantonese, the word \"sugar\" () is pronounced \"tòhng\" ( or , with low (falling) tone), whereas the derived word \"candy\" (also written 糖) is pronounced \"tóng\" (, with mid rising tone). Such a change is not triggered by the phonological environment of the tone, and therefore is not an example of sandhi. Changes of morphemes in Mandarin into its neutral-tone are also not examples of tone sandhi. \n\nIn Hokkien (again exemplified by Taiwanese varieties), the words \"kiaⁿ\" (whose base-tone is high flat and means ‘to be afraid’) plus \"lâng\" (whose base-tone is upwardly curving and means ‘person, people’) can combine via either of two different tonal treatments with a corresponding difference in resulting meaning. A speaker can pronounce the \"lâng\" as a neutral-tone (= low here), which causes the \"kiaⁿ\" (because it does not go into neutral-tone and immediately precedes) to keep its base-tone (which differs, by the way, from for instance the Standard-Chinese third tone preceding a neutral-tone's more common of its two behaviors). The result means ‘to be frightful’ (written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī as \"kiaⁿ--lâng\"). However, one can instead NOT make the \"lâng\" neutral-tone, which both causes it (due to being the final non-neutral tone in the phonological phrase) to keep its base-tone and causes the \"kiaⁿ\" (because this comes earlier in the phrase than the last non-neutral-tone syllable) to take its sandhi-tone (that being mid flat, because its base-tone is high-flat). This latter treatment means ‘to be frightfully dirty’ or ‘to be filthy’ (written as \"kiaⁿ-lâng\"). The former treatment does not involve the application of the tone sandhi rules, but rather is a derivational process (that is, it derives a new word), while the latter treatment does involve the tone sandhi, which applies automatically (here as anywhere that a phrase contains more than one syllable not made neutral-tone).\n\nStandard Chinese (Standard Mandarin) features several tone sandhi rules:\n\nZapotec, an Oto-Manguean language (or group of closely related languages) spoken in Mexico, has three tones: high, middle and low. The three tones, along with separate classifications for morpheme categories, contribute to a somewhat more complicated system of tone sandhi than in Mandarin. There are two main rules for Zapotec tone sandhi, which apply in this order:\n\n\nMolinos Mixtec, another Oto-Manguean language, has a much more complicated system of tone sandhi. The language has three tones (high, mid, or low, or 1, 2, or 3, respectively), and all roots are disyllabic, meaning that there are nine possible combinations of tones for a root or \"couplet\". The tone combinations are expressed here as a two digit number (high-low is represented as 13). Couplets are also classified into either class A or B, as well as verb or non-verb. A number of specific rules depending on these three factors determine tone change. One example of a rule follows:\n\n\"Basic 31 becomes 11 when following any couplet of Class B but does not change after Class A (except that after 32(B') it optionally remains 31\"\nža²ʔa² (class B) \"chiles\" + ži³či¹ (class A) \"dry\" > ža²ʔa²ži¹či¹ \"dry chiles\"\n\nAkan, a Niger-Congo language spoken in Ghana, has two tones: high and low. The low tone is default. In Akan, tones at morpheme boundaries assimilate to each other through tone sandhi, the first tone of the second morpheme changing to match the final tone of the first morpheme.\n\nFor example:\n\nSinologists sometimes use reversed Chao tone letters to indicate sandhi, with the left-facing letters of the IPA on the left for the underlying tone, and reversed right-facing letters on the right for the realized tone. For example, the Mandarin example of \"nǐ\" + \"hǎo\" > \"ní hǎo\" above would be transcribed:\n\nThe individual Unicode components of the reversed tone letters are .\n\n"}
{"id": "37297356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37297356", "title": "To’abaita language", "text": "To’abaita language\n\nToqabaqita is the language spoken by the people living at the north-western tip of Malaita Island, of South Eastern Solomon Islands. Toqabaqita, also known as To’abaita as well as To’ambaita, Malu and Malu’u is an Austronesian language. The website \"Ethnologue\" records the number of speakers of Toqabaqita as 12,600 in 1999. Lichtenberk, who has written an extensive grammar of Toqabaqita reports that Toqabaqita may be part of a North Malaita group of dialects which includes Baeguu, Baelelae and Fataleka, and possibly Lau. Ethnologue however reports no known dialects of Toqabaqita, but reports that within this group of languages, they are mutually intelligible. Lichtenberk points out that the speakers of Toqabaqita do recognize similarities across the whole island’s languages, but the Toqabaqita people themselves do not have this conception of North Malaita being a language and Toqabaqita as a dialect within this group.\n\nToqabaqita is classified as member of the Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Southeast Solomonic language family. Then there is a slight divergence in classification between Lichtenberk and Glottolog. Lichetenberk classifies the next subgrouping as Longgu/Malaita/Makira (San Crisobel), whereas Glottolog does not include Longgu at this point, but instead as a sister subgroup to Malaita/Makira. \n\nThe Wikipedia entry for Longgu, which is a Southeast Solomonic language spoken on Guadalcanal, is reported to be originally from Malaita. Lichtenberg then breaks the Malaita/Makira subgroup into the Central/Northern and Southern Malaita subgroups, then North Malaita subgroup itself, to which Toqabaqita belongs. In contrast Glottolog breaks the subgroup Malaita/ San Cristobel (Makira) into two subgroups Malaita/Makira and Longgu, then to North and south Malaita subgroups, where the north includes the above listed putative dialects as well as the central Malaita languages.\nThe number of speakers of Toqabaqita is relatively high for a Solomon Islands language, although most speakers become bilingual in Pijin as they grow up. Toqabaqita has the status of first language for children, and is used in daily life. Many Toqabaqita speakers also speak some English, and this is the language of the schools, although only primary schools are available locally. The literacy rate in Toqabaqita is 30-60%, and Latin script is used.\n\nToqabaqita phonemes consist of 17 consonants and 5 vowels.\n/k͡p/ and /g͡b/ are doubly-articulated voiceless and voiced labial–velar stop consonants. Pre-nasalization is a feature of particular Toqabaqita consonants, including all the voiced plosives, that is /b/, /d/, /g/ and /g͡b/, and for the glide /w/ . The degree of prenasalization varies and is determined by their position in the word.\nVowels can be long, but it is not allowed to have adjacent long vowels.\nStress is not indicated by the phonemes, but by the symbols (’) for primary stress and (’) for secondary stress.\n\nToqabaqita has as its basic constituent order Subject - Predicate – X, with X referring to other elements that the subject and predicate. This can also be categorized as SVO (subject verb object) and SVX (subject verb other). Lynch in his review of Oceanic languages found that this constituent order is in fact the most widely geographically distributed pattern.\nVerbs in Toqabaqita can include a variety of affixes, both suffixes and pre-fixes, which mark other grammatical categories of tense aspect, sequentiality and negation. Lexical objects are usually indexed on the verb as a suffix. In Toqabaqita the basic noun phrase consists minimally of a noun or an independent personal pronoun. Noun phrases may contain modifiers, which are generally suffixes.\nLexical morphemes consist of at least two syllables in Toqabaqita. Where a monosyllabic word occurs, such as a grammatical morpheme, it then attaches as a clitic to the preceding word, with some notable exceptions. If speech is slow then the grammatical morpheme may have its vowel lengthened and take stress.\n\nThe Independent person pronouns in Toqabaqita are for single, dual and plural pronouns for first person exclusive, first person inclusive, second and third person categories. With only a few systematic exceptions the pronominal noun phrases are used in the same position as where a lexical noun phrase would occur. Lexical nouns are marked only as singular or plural in Toqabaqita.\nExamples:\n\nThe variants marked with * were used exclusively by women. Of these pronouns used only by women, only the first person inclusive plural pronoun kia is used at the present time. This is specifically in the context of referring to one’s home, or one’s home place or one’s country most commonly when away from one’s home area’. It is notable that although there are multiple plural personal pronouns some are used more commonly than others. Some alternatives are rarely used, specifically these are the first person exclusive kamaliqa, the third person plural kiiluqa, and the second person singular qoo. Both forms of the second person plural, kamuluqa and kamaluqa are commonly used. There are phonetic associations with specific person pronouns. The dual pronouns all contain r, and the plurals all contain l, with exception of the third person plural kera. Lichtenberk suggests that this is due to their associations with the numbers rua which glosses as two, and ulu which glosses as three, and also that perhaps the plurals were previously trial or paucal forms of pronouns.\n\nIn some cases where the independent pronoun and a subject marker are identical (homophones) and occur in the same sentence one will be omitted, and Lichtenberk (2008) suggests it is the pronoun that is omitted. This occurs for koro, where it is both the inclusive dual inclusive independent personal pronoun and the dual inclusive nonfuture subject marker. Similarly kulu is both the plural inclusive independent plural pronoun and the plural inclusive nonfuture subject marker. Lichtenberk believes that most speakers would avoid the repetition.\n\nIn the above example the first \"kulu\" would be deleted. \nThe independent personal pronouns, including the third person pronouns are used with human reference, or with spirits, very rarely with animals. The may be used with mythological animals or with an animal that is in view.\n\nThe third person pronoun can be used to specify subject topicalization, even with inanimate objects, as is:\n\nThere are numerous specific uses of the independent personal pronouns such as the third person singular pronoun being used to close off a story or a narration, in a verb-less statement:\n\nTo emphasize a pronoun the same strategies that are used with lexical nouns are also employed, but with a specific pronominal foregrounder \"ni\".\n\nHere the emphasis is on the persons being spoken to. \nThe inclusive pronouns can be used in a way to include the addressee, to index personal closeness or in a jocular sense.\n\nToqabaqita uses person markers with proper nouns that designate people, spirits, ogres, pets and domestic animals. They are gender differentiated, with tha used with male and ni with female people. When referring to gods and spirits and introduced Christian deities, tha is used. Tha is used to refer to all pets and domestic animals, both male and female. They are used for reference not for address, see examples 11 and 12, but even then they are not obligatory.\n\nContrast the need for a person marker when talking about Ulufaala the named person in the narration, rather than when he arrives in person. \n\n\"Tha\" is used with the nouns that refer to children, \"wela\" (child, young person), \"kale\" (offspring), or adult males, \"weleqi.\"\n\n\"Tha\" is used for inanimate objects that actually have names.\n\nIn Toqabaqita there are two classes of transitive verbs, Class 1 and Class 2, and they index their pronominal direct objects differently. Class 1 transitives have object indexing suffixes only for the third person; \"-a\" for singular direct objects, \"-daroqa\" for dual categories and \"-da\" for plural objects. \n\nToqabaqita doesn't index object status first and second person, but it is indicated by the appropriate independent personal pronoun as in (18).\n\nClass 2 Transitive verbs have object indexing suffixes for all grammatical persons and numbers, and follow a similar pattern to the independent personal pronouns.\n\nAgain there are forms that were previously used only by women, in women's speech, that are no longer used. For the third person singular there are two forms -na and -a, and their use is often phonologically determined, in particular so there are no sequences of three vowels. \n\nThe \"-na\" object pronoun is used here in (20) to follow the vowel \"a\".\n\nToqabaqita has subject indexing suffixes which appear on the verb and also indicate nonfuture tense, future tense, imperfect aspect, sequentiality, negative aspect and dehortation. There is some suffixes that are the same in the third person dual and plural categories. It is interesting to observe that there are no archaic women's speech forms noted by Lichtenberk.\n\nPossession in Toqabaqita is relational in that there are two entities in the relationship the “possessor” and the “possessum”. The possessor may own an item, it may be a body part, or a tool. But this also includes relationships with the person or item, including a kinship relationship. Lichtenberk prefers to term these “personal suffixes” as they not only index possession, but also with a transitive verb to index their subject, to indicate a recipient/beneficiary relationship, and to index a complement with a number of prepositions. These suffixes can be used with both lexical nouns and verbs. It can be seen that some of these suffixes are identical with the singular object pronoun suffixes, namely -ku, -na, and -a.\nAgain there are forms previously used by women in speech, that are no longer used, marked (1). In terms of semantics the personal suffixes are used with relational nouns where the relationship is described as inalienable possession. This includes parts of a whole (24), body parts (23,27), products of a possessor (25,26) and integral contents such as blood of animal or juice of a fruit.\n\nFrom a phontactic point of view words with \"–l\" or-\"r\" in the syllable use third person singular \"–na\", as in example (27). Attributes as well as spatial and temporal relations of the possessor are also designated with these personal suffixes, as in example (28).\n\nToqabaqita also employs the bare possessive noun phrase where there is no indexing of the possessor on the possessed noun. A Possessor noun phrase must be present, this may be a lexical noun or a pronoun. The two following examples display this, in that a possessor noun phrase is pronominal, and it is the independent personal pronoun that is employed. In this manner all the independent pronouns can be bare possessor nouns.\n\n\n"}

As Asimov put it:\n\nAsimov explains that science is both progressive and cumulative. Even though scientific theories are later proven wrong, the degree of their wrongness attenuates with time as they are modified in response to the mistakes of the past. For example, data collected from satellite measurements show, to a high level of precision, how the Earth's shape differs from a perfect sphere. \n\nShermer states that being wronger than wrong is actually worse than being \"not even wrong\" (that is, being unfalsifiable).\n\nAccording to John Jenkins, who reviewed \"The Relativity of Wrong\", the title essay of Asimov's book is the one \"which I think is important both for understanding Asimov's thinking about science and for arming oneself against the inevitable anti-science attack that one often hears – [that] theories are always preliminary and science really doesn't 'know' anything\".\n\n"}
