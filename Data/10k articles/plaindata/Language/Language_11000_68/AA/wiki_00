It is the opposite of the analogy. When analogy is allowed, \"a contrario\" is forbidden and vice versa. Arguments \"a contrario\" are often used in the legal system as a way to solve problems not currently covered by a certain system of laws. Although it might be used as a logical fallacy, arguments \"a contrario\" are not by definition fallacies.\n\nIn law, the use of the \"argumentum a contrario\" finds its footing in the Latin maxim: ‘‘\"ubicumque lex voluit dixit, ubi tacuit noluit\"’’ that runs as follows: If the Legislator wished to say something, he would do that expressly. Accordingly, one may posit that non-mentioning about something on the part of Legislator leads to the conclusion that the Legislator wanted to be silent in a given matter. However, the full sense of this argument is reflected in the Latin maxim: ‘‘\"qui dicit de uno, negat de altero\"’’ (‘‘\"qui dicit uno, negat de altero\"’’), meaning of which is: Who says one thing negates the other one.\n\nHere the argument is based on the fact that red cars are not green cars and therefore § 123 of the X-Law cannot be applied to them. This requires the law to be interpreted to determine which solution would have been desired if the lawmaker had considered red cars. In this case it's probably safe to assume that they only wanted to regulate green cars and not regulate cars of other colors.\n\nOn the other hand, this example:\nAs with the example above, the argument is based on the fact that the law does not mention something (in this case, faxes), but leaps to the interpretation that they must therefore not be used. Here, the belief that lawmakers intentionally excluded fax machines is less reasonable than the assumption that fax machines did not exist at this time and that, were the law passed today, they would have been mentioned. Here the \"a contrario\" argument is used fallaciously in two ways: it places the letter of the law above its intent, and mistakes a time, place, and manner law letters and telegraphs, for a law only letters and telegraphs, which is it not.\n\nNovel legal cases often hinge on more cogent arguments of the form:\nDepending upon the intent and scope of the law, it may be held by the court to apply to the previously unaccounted-for situation by analogy, or to not apply because the cases are insufficiently analogous, such that a legislative change to the law's wording would be required for such an expansion of scope. Cases raising such questions are increasingly common as technology introduces capabilities that are somewhat but not exactly analogous to those provided by older technologies. A high-profile example of the use of \"argumentum a contrario\" (rejected by the court) in such a case is \"Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service\".\n\n\n"}

He served simultaneously as a communal rabbi, \"mashgiach ruchani\" of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, and as a teacher in Beis Yaakov.\n\nAvigdor Miller was born Victor Miller in Baltimore, Maryland. Miller was a kohen. Although he attended public school, only Yiddish was spoken at home. After school, he went to learn in an afternoon Talmud Torah. When he finished his regular classes at the Talmud Torah, the school arranged for him to learn privately with Rav Avrohom Eliyahu Axelrod, a Lubavitcher Hasid. The Talmud Torah was unable to pay Axelrod, but he continued to teach Miller anyway. Miller would never forget that Axelrod continued to teach him without being paid, and spoke about him with appreciation. \n\nAt age 17, Miller went to New York City to attend Yeshiva College. He was elected student body president, and was also the \"baal korei\". He graduated from both YU and RIETS, attaining a B.A. and rabbinical ordination, respectively.\n\nRabbi Moshe Bick, known as the \"Mezubizher Rav\", who arrived in the United States in 1927, was one of Rabbi Miller's early study partners.\n\nWhile a student at YU, Miller joined a \"chavurah\" together with five other young men (who were all to become notable Hareidi rabbis) to study Mussar from the \"sefer\" \"Mesillas Yesharim\". The organizer of the \"chavurah\" was Yaakov Yosef Herman, a builder of Orthodox Judaism in New York City of the early 20th-century. Herman encouraged Miller to travel to Europe to learn Torah in the yeshivas there. Miller met Rabbi Isaac Sher, the son-in-law of Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, who was in New York collecting funds for the Slabodka yeshiva at the time. Sher did not raise much money, since this was during the Great Depression. But Sher would later declare this to be his most successful trip to America, since he was able to recruit and bring such a bright student to Slabodka.\n\nIn 1932, at the age of 24, Miller arrived in Europe to study at the Slabodka yeshiva in Slabodke, Lithuania. While there, he studied under Rabbi Sher. As a student in Slabodka, Miller was compelled to wear a coat during the summer, in order to conceal the multitude of overlapping patches that were his trousers.\n\nRabbi Shulman of Slabodka, a son-in-law of Sher, introduced Miller to Ettel Lessin, daughter of Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Lessin of Slabodka. They were married in 1935.\n\nIn the preface to all his books, and on many of his tapes, Miller stated that everything that is un-sourced should be considered the teachings of Rabbi Sher, whom he considered his primary rabbi.\n\nIn 1938, due to the rise of Nazism and the tensions leading up to World War II, Miller sought to return to the United States with his wife and two children. The American consul in Kovno at the time was a public high-school classmate and acquaintance of Miller's from Baltimore. He arranged passage for Miller's wife and children, who were not United States citizens.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., Miller became rabbi of Congregation Agudath Shalom in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Initially, the community was taken aback by Miller's audacious pedagogy, and the sheer volume of his Torah presentations, attempting in vain to restrain his unconventional approach. Within a few years however, the community had changed their minds, desiring for Miller to stay longer.\n\nIn 1944, Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner, \"rosh yeshiva\" of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, hired Miller to become its \"mashgiach ruchani,\" in which position he served until 1964. In 1945, he also assumed the pulpit of the Young Israel of Rugby in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. In 1975, with neighborhood demographics changing, Miller established the Bais Yisroel of Rugby Torah Center on Ocean Parkway in Midwood, Brooklyn, which served as the main vehicle of his Torah dissemination until his death.\n\nMiller also lectured at many yeshivas and Beis Yaakov schools throughout the years.\n\nMiller was taken to Maimonides Medical Center shortly after Passover, 2001. Though his physical health was deteriorating, his mental acuity remained intact until his death on Friday morning, April 20, 2001.\n\nAt a memorial service the following Sunday, Miller was eulogized by Rabbi Yosef Rosenblum, the \"rosh yeshiva\" of Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher; Rabbi Shmuel Berenbaum, \"rosh yeshiva\" of Mir yeshiva; Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, \"rosh yeshiva\" of \"Torah Ore\", who was in America on a visit from Jerusalem; and Miller's son-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Brog.\n\nRabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen, a grandson-in-law of Miller, noted that Miller's descendants married into the esteemed families of Torah scholars such as Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, the Mattersdorfer Rav (& Cohen's grandfather); Rabbi Reuven Grozovsky; Rabbi Aaron Kotler and Rabbi Baruch Sorotzkin, \"rosh yeshiva\" of Telshe.\n\nMiller's body was transported to Israel, where a funeral was held at the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem with a crowd of 25,000 people in attendance. He was eulogized by Rabbi Noson Tzvi Finkel (the Mirrer rosh yeshiva), Rabbi Moishe Sternbuch and others. Rabbi Matisyohu Salomon was in Israel at the time, and he also delivered a moving eulogy.\n\nMiller was buried on the Mount of Olives in \"chelkat Tashach\".\n\nAt a later event at the end of the week of mourning, Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe, head of Agudath Israel and a pupil, remembered Rabbi Miller’s first days as \"mashgiach\" at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin.\n\nAfter his death, a synagogue, Nitei Avigdor (), was founded in Miller's name in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The synagogue includes a library of Miller's tapes. The founder and rabbi of the synagogue is Rabbi Avrohom Shlomo Yabo, known as the Lemberger Rov, who also gives lectures based on Miller's teachings.\n\nMiller was known within Orthodox Jewish circles as a master orator, having superb command of the English language. His personal magnetism drew students, young and old, from all Jewish backgrounds.\n\nMiller authored several books about Jewish history, Jewish thought, Evolutionary Theory, and other subjects.\n\nOver a span of 50 years, more than 2,500 lectures by Miller in English were published as tape cassettes, as well as several in Yiddish, of which several hundred thousand copies were sold. He gave most of his lectures in his Midwood synagogue. Topics covered are Torah education, ideology, and self-help. A range of \"sefarim\" were compiled by his students from these lectures, called \"Q&A Thursday Nights With Rabbi Miller.\"\n\nMiller sought to awaken his audiences to the fundamental principle that there is a plan and purpose to every minute detail of life in this world, and he wished to make them happy and excited about its benefits.\n\nMiller was outspoken in his belief that the Holocaust was a divine response to Jewish cultural assimilation in Europe. He wrote:\nMiller was a staunch opponent of Zionism, in both its religious and secular forms, and was known to help the Satmar Hasidim translate their anti-Zionist ads in \"The New York Times\". He was also a well-known opponent of the Theory of Evolution.\n\nMiller stated that the victims of the Kent State shootings were \"bums and they deserved to be shot.\"\n\nMiller had sharp views about African-Americans and the apartheid in South Africa. Of President Lincoln he stated “... I hold it against him that he set free the blacks. Don’t think it’s being prejudiced, the blacks were doing wonderful. They were learning to be decent and civilized under their white masters.”\n\nAt his funeral in Jerusalem, his son said that he had instructed all his descendants to speak only Yiddish with their families.\n\nMiller has been noted for his ability to summarize ideas into easily digestible soundbites. He once said, \"Learning Musar teaches one how to live, but learning \"Bava Kamma is\" living.\"\nMiller's books include:\n\n\n"}

To the north/northwest lay Communist China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and others. To the south and east lay capitalist/non-Communist India, Japan, Indonesia, and others. In particular, following the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone became an important symbol of this Asian division (though the term \"Bamboo Curtain\" itself is rarely used in that specific context).\n\nThe colorful term \"Bamboo Curtain\" was derived from \"Iron Curtain\", a term used widely in Europe from the 1940s to the early '90s to refer to that region's Communist boundaries. It was used less often than \"Iron Curtain\" in part because while the latter remained relatively static for over 40 years, the \"Bamboo Curtain\" shifted frequently and was somewhat less precise. It was also a less accurate description of the political situation in Asia because of the lack of cohesion within the East Asian Communist Bloc, which resulted in the Sino-Soviet split. During the Cold War, Communist governments in Mongolia, Vietnam and later Laos were allies of the Soviet Union, though they sometimes cooperated with China, while Cambodia's Pol Pot regime was loyal to China. After the Korean War, North Korea avoided taking sides between the Soviets and China. (Since the end of a Communist bloc in Asia, North Korea remains on good terms with both Russia and China, although relations between the countries have been strained in modern times.)\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution in China, the Chinese authorities put sections of the \"curtain\" under a lock-down of sorts, forbidding entry into or passage out of the country without permission from the Chinese government. Many would-be refugees attempting to flee to capitalist countries were prevented from escaping. Occasional relaxations led to several waves of refugees into the then-British crown colony of Hong Kong.\n\nImproved relations between China and the United States during the later years of the Cold War rendered the term more or less obsolete, except when it referred to the Korean Peninsula and the divide between allies of the US and allies of the USSR in Southeast Asia. Today, the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea is typically described as the DMZ. \"Bamboo Curtain\" is used most often to refer to the enclosed borders and economy of Burma (though this began to open in 2010). The Bamboo Curtain has since given way to the business model called the bamboo network.\n\n"}

A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, an owner publicly recording their own interests (which in some types of property must be on a court-recognised Register) protects themself from losing those to an indirect buyer, such as a qualifying buyer from a thief, who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, so-called \"race-notice\" jurisdictions require the BFP himself or herself to record (depending on the type of property by public notice or applying for registration) to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance.\n\nIn England and Wales and in other jurisdictions following the 20th century oft-repeated precedent, the BFP will not be bound by equitable interests of which he/she does not have actual, constructive or imputed notice, as long as he/she has made \"such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made\".\n\nBFPs are also sometimes referred to as \"equity's darling\". However, jurist Hackney explains the portrayal is inaccurate; in cases where legal title is passed to a \"bona fide\" purchaser for value without notice, it is not so much that equity has any great affection for the purchaser – it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property. The relationship between the courts of equity and the BFP is at root characterised as, geared toward the BFP, with benign neglect of the old owner(s). However, equity allows a proven BFP to claim for a full legal conveyance from former legal owner, failing which the court itself will convey title.\n\nIn the United States, the patent law codifies the \"bona fide\" purchaser rule, . Unlike the common law, the statute cuts off both equitable \"and\" legal claims to the title.\n\n"}

That is, \"Bunu\" in the broad sense is a cultural rather than linguistic group. Strecker (1987) had classified Bu-Nao (Bunu proper) as a Western (Chuanqiandian) Hmongic language, and the other Bunu languages—Younuo (Yuno), Wunai (Hm Nai), and Jiongnai (Kiong Nai)—as distinct branches of Hmongic. Matisoff (2001) grouped all of these together in a \"Bunu\" branch of Hmongic (that is, outside Western Hmongic).

{"id": "144481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144481", "title": "Bullpup", "text": "Bullpup\n\nA bullpup is a firearm with its action and magazine far behind its trigger group. This configuration permits a shorter overall weapon for a given barrel length. This maintains the advantages of a longer barrel in muzzle velocity and accuracy while improving maneuverability and reducing weight.\n\nThe origin of the term \"bullpup\" for this configuration is unclear. In 1957, the word was reported to denote a target pistol, particularly one with a fancy stock.\n\nThe bullpup design places the gun's action behind the trigger, usually in front of a short stock. The entire magazine is often also located behind the trigger group, though it is only necessary for the weapon's feed location to be located there for it to be classified as a bullpup; in some designs such as the Heckler & Koch G11 and Neostead the magazine or magazines extend forward rather than downward.\n\n\nThe concept was first used in bolt action rifles such as the Thorneycroft carbine of 1901, although the increased distance from hand grip to bolt handle meant the decreased length had to be weighed against the increased time required to fire. It is known to have been applied to semi-automatic firearms in 1918 (6.5 mm French Faucon-Meunier semi-automatic rifle developed by Lt. Col. Armand-Frédéric Faucon), then in 1936 a bullpup machine pistol was patented by the Frenchman Henri Delacre.\n\nAfter World War II, Western engineers drew inspiration from the German Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, which offered a compromise between bolt-action rifles and submachine guns. Among them was Kazimierz Januszewski (also known as Stefan Janson), a Polish engineer who had worked at the Polish national arsenal during the 1930s. After being mobilized during World War II he escaped German and Russian forces and made his way to England, where he was a part of the \"Polish design team\" at Enfield Lock's Royal Small Arms Factory. The factory was run by lieutenant colonel Edward Kent-Lemon. As Januszewski was developing a new rifle, the \"Ideal Calibre Board\" was searching for a replacement for the .303 cartridge. The Board decided on an optimal 7 mm cartridge on which Januszewski and the two teams working at Enfield had to base their designs. One design team led by Stanley Thorpe produced a gas-powered rifle with a locking system based on the Sturmgewehr. The design used steel pressings which were difficult to obtain, and the design was scrapped. The result of the Polish design team's efforts was the EM-2, which broke significant new ground.\n\nThe EM-2 contained some similarities to the Soviet AK-47, although Januszewski had never seen the Soviet rifle. The first significant bullpup assault rifle came from the British programme to replace the service pistols, sub-machine guns, and rifles. In the two forms of the EM-1 and the EM-2, the new rifle concept was born as a result of the experience with small arms that was gained during the Second World War.\n\nIt was obvious that the modern warfare would require the infantry to be armed with a light, selective fire weapon, with effective range of fire much longer than that of a submachine gun, but shorter than that of conventional semi-automatic or bolt action rifles. The bullpup design was seen as a necessity to retain the accuracy at range while reducing overall length. The EM-2 was adopted by the UK in 1951 as the world's first (limited) service bullpup rifle, but was promptly displaced by the adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO (0.308 in) cartridge, to which the EM-2 was not easily adapted. The decision was rescinded and a variant of the more conventional FN FAL was adopted in its place.\nA 7.62×39mm M43 calibre experimental assault rifle was developed by German A. Korobov in the Soviet Union around 1945, and a further development, the TKB-408 was entered for the 1946–47 assault rifle trials by the Soviet Army, although it was rejected in favour of the more conventional AK-47. The United States briefly experimented in the same year with the integrally-scoped Model 45A bullpup, which never progressed beyond the prototype stage; John Garand designed his T31 bullpup, abandoned after his retirement in 1953.\n\nAfter these failures of the bullpup design to achieve widespread service, the concept continued to be explored (for example: a second Korobov bullpup, the TKB-022PM).\n\nThe Steyr AUG (selected in 1977) is often cited as the first successful bullpup, being in service with the armed forces of over twenty countries, and becoming the primary rifle of Austria and Australia. It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. The arrival of the FAMAS in 1978, and its adoption by France emphasized the slide from traditional to bullpup layouts within gun designs.\n\nThe British resumed their bullpup experiments with the L85, which entered service in 1985. Following persistent reliability problems, it was redesigned by the then British-owned Heckler & Koch into the L85A2, and it is now a reliable weapon.\n\nHaving learned from extensive combat experience, Israel Military Industries developed a bullpup rifle: the Tavor TAR-21. The Tavor is light, accurate, fully ambidextrous and reliable (designed to stringent reliability standards to avoid malfunctioning in desert conditions), and is in increasing demand in other countries, notably India. The Tavor shares many similarities with the SAR 21 and the South African Vektor CR-21. Other bullpups have been recently adopted by the Islamic Republic of Iran Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army: the KH-2002 and the QBZ-95 respectively.\n\nSome sniper rifles such as the American Barrett M95 and XM500, German Walther WA 2000 and DSR-1, Chinese QBU-88, Russian SVU, and Polish Bor use the bullpup layout. It is also used for combat shotgun designs such as the Neostead and Kel-Tec KSG.\n\nBullpups adopted for current standard issue by various armed forces:\n\n"}

She describes these students as beautiful and self-assured, that they wore fashionable clothes, went to raves and took acid and \"tachas\". Although they came from nice homes in the south of Mexico City (see Jardines del Pedregal and San Ángel). De Anda and her friends would mock these students as elitists and fake as they claimed to be left-wing whilst going to protests in their best clothes. At this point to de Anda, the \"chairo\" was viewed as cool for the things that their wealth provided them. The word started to acquire its current meaning in the mid 2000s. De Anda gave new impetus to the word circa 2004 when she began to use it in her blog, \"Plaqueta\", and to jokingly describe her left-leaning friends. \n\nIn 2005, while de Anda attended the Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales, she created a satirical documentary titled \"Los Chairos\" which consisted of interviews with the \"chairos\" of Mexico City. The popularity of her blog helped increase views for the video and helped disseminate the term. \"Chairo\" then began to deform from describing something cool and fun to a word used to indicate and mock those who were demonstrating against the system. De Anda self-describes as a \"chaira\" and has expressed discontent with the word's usage to denigrate dissenting views.\n\nThe term has been further popularized by social media and now encompasses a large array of attributes. Most commonly seen as a 20-something college student, the term has also been extended to journalists, academics, writers and artists.\n\nCommon traits attributed to the \"chairo\" include: an expansive leftist-anarchist ideology, some sort of nationalist view (sometimes grounded on indigenismo), being indignant and fighting \"the System\" and globalization. They may be against what they believe to be \"Zionism\" and \"American imperialism\". A \"chairo\" is sometimes seen as a radical that sympathizes with Socialism that is in line with Chavismo. A common belief is that the 2006 and 2012 elections were stolen from Andrés Manuel López Obrador through electoral fraud. The media outlets \"La Jornada\" and \"Aristegui Noticias\" (see Carmen Aristegui) are said to be favored by the group. They can have the belief that violent acts of anarchism are justified because they believe they live under a Fascist dictatorship.\n\nOther stereotypes include wearing Che Guevara shirts and smoking marijuana or ingesting peyote. As well as adhering to the philosophy of Noam Chomsky and reading the works of Eduardo Galeano.\n\nAccording to the \"Diccionario del español de México\", compiled by the Colegio de México, a \"chairo\" is an offensive adjective used to describe individuals that defend social and political causes that are in contrast with the political right, however they lack real commitment to the causes defended; an individual that is autosatisfied with their own attitudes.\n\nA picture of writer Daniel Malpica (editor of \"Radiador Magazine\") became a popular image macro of the \"typical chairo\".\n\n\n"}

Content editing focuses on the general conceptual intent, content, organization, and writing style of the text in consideration.\n\nContent editing can require effort beyond that of basic copy editing, and in particular demands editorial judgement, because guidelines are often less strict. It can be time consuming because it requires the entire document to be conceptually edited, requiring a scope broader than that of specific diction or syntax. This could mean reorganizing sections or restructuring the document as a whole. \n\nEffective content editing can allow a confusing document to be more clear and precise, as well as easier to read. Content edits not only allow an improvement in readability, but also visual appeal.

{"id": "232601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232601", "title": "Ensemble cast", "text": "Ensemble cast\n\nAn ensemble cast is made up of cast members in which multiple principal actors and performers are assigned roughly equal amounts of importance and screen time in a dramatic production.\n\nThe structure of an ensemble cast contrasts with the popular Hollywood centralization of a sole protagonist, as the ensemble leans more towards a sense of \"collectivity and community\".\n\nEnsemble casts in film were introduced as early as September 1916, with D. W. Griffith's silent epic film \"Intolerance\", featuring four separate though parallel plots. The film follows the lives of several characters over hundreds of years, across different cultures and time periods. The unification of different plot lines and character arcs is a key characteristic of ensemble casting in film; whether it's a location, event, or an overarching theme that ties the film and characters together.\n\nFilms that feature ensembles tend to emphasize the interconnectivity of the characters, even when the characters are strangers to one another. The interconnectivity is often shown to the audience through examples of the \"six degrees of separation\" theory, and allows them to navigate through plot lines using cognitive mapping. Examples of this method, where the six degrees of separation is evident in films with an ensemble cast, are in productions such as \"Babel\", \"Love, Actually\" and \"Crash\", which all have strong underlying themes interwoven within the plots that unify each film.\n\nOther forms of narrative for films with ensemble casts having more or less equal amounts of screen time is demonstrated in recent productions such as \"The Avengers\", \"\" and \"\" where the cast and their characters have already been established in individual films prior to its release. In \"The Avengers\", there is no need for a protagonist in the feature as each character shares equal importance in the narrative, successfully balancing the ensemble cast. Referential acting is a key factor in executing this balance, as ensemble cast members \"play off each other rather than off reality\".\n\nEnsemble casting also became more popular in television series because it allows flexibility for writers to focus on different characters in different episodes. In addition, the departure of players is less disruptive to the premise than it would be if the star of a production with a regularly structured cast were to leave the series. The television series \"Friends\" is an archetypal example of an ensemble cast occurring in an American sitcom. Ensemble casts of 20 or more actors are common in soap operas, a genre that relies heavily on the character development of the ensemble. The genre also requires continuous expansion of the cast as the series progresses, with soap operas such as \"Days of Our Lives\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" staying on air for decades. Science-fiction mystery drama series \"Lost\" also features an ensemble cast.\n\nAn example of a success for television in ensemble casting is the Emmy Award-winning HBO series \"Game of Thrones\". The epic fantasy series features one of the largest ensemble casts on the small screen. The series is notorious for major character deaths, resulting in constant changes within the ensemble.\n\n"}

{"id": "5171128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5171128", "title": "Gay", "text": "Gay\n\nGay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. The term was originally used to mean \"carefree\", \"cheerful\", or \"bright and showy\".\n\nThe term's use as a reference to homosexuality may date as early as the late 19th century, but its use gradually increased in the 20th century. In modern English, \"gay\" has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the people and the practices and cultures associated with homosexuality. In the 1960s, \"gay\" became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation. By the end of the 20th century, the word \"gay\" was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex.\n\nAt about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to \"rubbish\" or \"stupid\") to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to weak, unmanly, or lame). In this use, the word rarely means \"homosexual\", as it is often used, for example, to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept of which one disapproves. The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.\n\nThe word \"gay\" arrived in English during the 12th century from Old French \"gai\", most likely deriving ultimately from a Germanic source.\n\nIn English, the word's primary meaning was \"joyful\", \"carefree\", \"bright and showy\", and the word was very commonly used with this meaning in speech and literature. For example, the optimistic 1890s are still often referred to as the \"Gay Nineties\". The title of the 1938 French ballet \"Gaîté Parisienne\" (\"Parisian Gaiety\"), which became the 1941 Warner Brothers movie, \"The Gay Parisian\", also illustrates this connotation. It was apparently not until the 20th century that the word began to be used to mean specifically \"homosexual\", although it had earlier acquired sexual connotations.\n\nThe derived abstract noun \"gaiety\" remains largely free of sexual connotations and has, in the past, been used in the names of places of entertainment; for example W. B. Yeats heard Oscar Wilde lecture at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin.\n\nThe word may have started to acquire associations of immorality as early as the 14th century, but had certainly acquired them by the 17th. By the late 17th century, it had acquired the specific meaning of \"addicted to pleasures and dissipations\", an extension of its primary meaning of \"carefree\" implying \"uninhibited by moral constraints\". A \"gay woman\" was a prostitute, a \"gay man\" a womanizer, and a \"gay house\" a brothel. The use of \"gay\" to mean \"homosexual\" was often an extension of its application to prostitution: a \"gay boy\" was a young man or boy serving male clients.\n\nSimilarly, a \"gay cat\" was a young male apprenticed to an older hobo, commonly exchanging sex and other services for protection and tutelage. The application to homosexuality was also an extension of the word's sexualized connotation of \"carefree and uninhibited\", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual mores. Such usage, documented as early as the 1920s, was likely present before the 20th century, although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as in the once-common phrase \"gay Lothario\", or in the title of the book and film \"The Gay Falcon\" (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is \"Gay\". Similarly, Fred Gilbert and G. H. MacDermott's music hall song of the 1880s, \"Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk\" – \"Master Dilke upset the milk, when taking it home to Chelsea; the papers say that Charlie's gay, rather a wilful wag!\" – referred to Sir Charles Dilke's alleged heterosexual impropriety. Giving testimony in court in 1889, the prostitute John Saul stated: \"I occasionally do odd-jobs for different gay people.\"\n\nWell into the mid 20th century a middle-aged bachelor could be described as \"gay\", indicating that he was unattached and therefore free, without any implication of homosexuality. This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip \"Jane\", first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of \"Jane Gay\". Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on Lady Jane Grey).\n\nA passage from Gertrude Stein's \"Miss Furr & Miss Skeene\" (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (\"Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family\", 1995) the portrait \"featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,\" and Edmund Wilson (1951, quoted by James Mellow in \"Charmed Circle\", 1974) agreed. For example:\n\nThe word continued to be used with the dominant meaning of \"carefree\", as evidenced by the title of \"The Gay Divorcee\" (1934), a musical film about a heterosexual couple.\n\n\"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938) was the first film to use the word \"gay\" in apparent reference to homosexuality. In a scene in which Cary Grant's character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, \"Because I just went \"gay\" all of a sudden!\" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to cross-dressing (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, \"I just decided to do something frivolous.\"\n\nIn 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A. Gross, executive secretary for the George W. Henry Foundation, who said in the June 1950 issue of SIR magazine: \"I have yet to meet a happy homosexual. They have a way of describing themselves as gay but the term is a misnomer. Those who are habitues of the bars frequented by others of the kind, are about the saddest people I’ve ever seen.\"\n\nBy the mid-20th century, \"gay\" was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles and its antonym \"straight\", which had long had connotations of seriousness, respectability, and conventionality, had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality. In the case of \"gay\", other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress (\"gay apparel\") led to association with camp and effeminacy. This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning, which was at first confined to subcultures. \"Gay\" was the preferred term since other terms, such as \"queer\", were felt to be derogatory. \"Homosexual\" is perceived as excessively clinical, since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as \"homosexuality\" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).\n\nIn mid-20th century Britain, where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967, to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity. Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include \"sporty\" girls and \"artistic\" boys, all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.\n\nThe 1960s marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of \"carefree\" to the current \"homosexual\". In the British comedy-drama film \"Light Up the Sky!\" (1960), directed by Lewis Gilbert, about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by Benny Hill proposes an after-dinner toast. He begins, \"I'd like to propose...\" at which point a fellow diner, played by Sidney Tafler, interjects \"Who to?\", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, \"Not to you for start, you ain't my type\". He then adds in mock doubt, \"Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet.\"\n\nBy 1963, a new sense of the word \"gay\" was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book \"The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting\". Similarly, Hubert Selby, Jr. in his 1964 novel \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\", could write that a character \"took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay...\" Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960–1966 animated TV series \"The Flintstones\", whereby viewers are assured that they will \"have a gay old time.\" Similarly, the 1966 Herman's Hermits song \"No Milk Today\", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a Top 40 hit in the U.S., included the lyric \"No milk today, it was not always so; \"The company was gay\", we'd turn night into day.\"\n\nIn June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album in the British daily newspaper \"The Times\" stated, \"The Beatles revive hopes of progress in pop music with their gay new LP\". Yet in the same year, The Kinks recorded \"David Watts\". Ostensibly about schoolboy envy, the song also operated as an in-joke, as related in Jon Savage's \"The Kinks: The Official Biography\", because the song took its name from a homosexual promoter they had encountered who had romantic desires for songwriter Ray Davies' teenage brother; and the lines \"he is so gay and fancy free\" attest to the ambiguity of the word's meaning at that time, with the second meaning evident only for those in the know. As late as 1970, the first episode of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" has the demonstrably straight Mary Richards' downstairs neighbor, Phyllis, breezily declaiming that Mary is, at age 30, still \"young and gay.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that the homosexual sense is a development of the word's traditional meaning, as described above. It has nevertheless been claimed that \"gay\" stands for \"Good As You\", but there is no evidence for this: it is a backronym created as popular etymology.\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines \"sexual orientation\" as \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes,\" ranging \"along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.\" Sexual orientation can also be \"discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women).\"\n\nAccording to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), \"the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.\"\n\nThe British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has argued that the term \"gay\" is merely a cultural expression which reflects the current status of homosexuality within a given society, and claiming that \"Queer, gay, homosexual ... in the long view, they are all just temporary identities. One day, we will not need them at all.\"\n\nIf a person engages in sexual activity with a partner of the same sex but does not self-identify as gay, terms such as 'closeted', 'discreet', or 'bi-curious' may apply. Conversely, a person may identify as gay without having had sex with a same-sex partner. Possible choices include identifying as gay socially, while choosing to be celibate, or while anticipating a first homosexual experience. Further, a bisexual person might also identify as \"gay\" but others may consider \"gay\" and \"bisexual\" to be mutually exclusive. There are some who are drawn to the same sex but neither engage in sexual activity nor identify as gay; these could have the term \"asexual\" applied, even though \"asexual\" generally can mean no attraction, or involve heterosexual attraction but no sexual activity.\n\nSome reject the term \"homosexual\" as an identity-label because they find it too clinical-sounding; they believe it is too focused on physical acts rather than romance or attraction, or too reminiscent of the era when homosexuality was considered a mental illness. Conversely, some reject the term \"gay\" as an identity-label because they perceive the cultural connotations to be undesirable or because of the negative connotations of the slang usage of the word.\n\nStyle guides, like the following from the Associated Press, call for \"gay\" over \"homosexual\":\n\nThere are those who reject the gay label for reasons other than shame or negative connotations. Writer Alan Bennett and fashion icon André Leon Talley are like others in the fashion and the arts, out and open gay men who reject being labeled gay, finding it too limiting and slotting them into label boxes.\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s in the United States, a conscious effort was under way, within what was then only called the gay community, to add the term \"lesbian\" to the name of all gay organizations that catered to both male and female homosexuals, and to use the terminology of gay and lesbian, or lesbian/gay when referring to that community. So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the \"L\" come first, lest an \"L\" following a \"G\" become another symbol of male dominance over women, although other women prefer the usage \"gay woman\". In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, transgender, intersex, and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.\n\nThe term \"gay\" can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of the said culture. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele, or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\nUsing it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality, but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.\n\nThe label \"gay\" was originally used purely as an adjective (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a noun with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy.\" This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too,\" although this may be perceived as derogatory. It was also used for comedic effect by the \"Little Britain\" character Dafydd Thomas.\n\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word \"gay\" is pejorative. While retaining its other meanings, its use among young people as a general term of disparagement is common. This pejorative usage has its origins in the late 1970s, with the word gaining a pejorative sense by association with the previous meaning: homosexuality was seen as inferior or undesirable. Beginning in the 1980s, and especially in the late 1990s, the usage as a generic insult became common among young people.\n\nThis usage of the word has been criticized as homophobic. A 2006 BBC ruling by the Board of Governors over the use of the word in this context by Chris Moyles on his Radio 1 show, \"I do not want that one, it's gay,\" advises \"caution on its use\" for this reason:\n\nThe BBC's ruling was heavily criticised by the Minister for Children, Kevin Brennan, who stated in response that \"the casual use of homophobic language by mainstream radio DJs\" is:\n\nShortly after the Moyles incident, a campaign against homophobia was launched in Britain under the slogan \"homophobia is gay\", playing on the double meaning of the word \"gay\" in youth culture, as well as the popular perception that vocal homophobia is common among closeted homosexuals.\n\nIn a 2013 article published in the \"Journal of Interpersonal Violence\", University of Michigan researchers Michael Woodford, Alex Kulick and Perry Silverschanz, alongside Appalachian State University professor Michael L. Howell, argued that the pejorative use of the word \"gay\" was a microaggression. Their research found that college-age men were more likely to repeat the word pejoratively if their friends said it, while they were less likely to say it if they had lesbian, gay or bisexual peers.\n\n\n"}

While any guard posting has rules that may go without saying (\"Stay awake,\" for instance), these orders are carefully detailed and particularly stressed in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard. Also known as the 11 General Orders, the list is meant to cover any possible scenario a sentry might encounter on duty.\n\nAll recruits learn these orders verbatim while at recruit training and are expected to retain the knowledge to use for the remainder of their military careers. It is very common for a drill instructor or (after boot camp) an inspecting officer to ask a question such as, \"What is your sixth general order?\" and expect an immediate (and correct) reply.\n\nThe General Orders for Sentries are quite similar between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the main differences being the titles of positions referenced in the orders. The Navy Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NJROTC), Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) also use the following General Orders to the Sentry.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Navy gives the General Orders for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as follows:\n\n1. To take charge of this post and all government property in view.\n\nWhen you are a sentry, you are \"in charge.\" This means that no one—no matter what their rank or position—may overrule your authority in carrying out your orders. The only way that you may be exempted from carrying out your orders is if your orders are changed by your superior. For example, if your orders are to allow no one to enter a fenced-in compound, you must prevent everyone from entering, even if an admiral tells you it is all right for him or her to enter. The petty officer of the watch (or whoever is your immediate superior) may modify your orders to allow the admiral to enter, but without that authorization you must keep the admiral out. Situations such as this will not often, if ever, occur, but it is important that you understand the principles involved. It is also your responsibility to know the limits of your post. This information will be conveyed to you among your special orders. You must also treat all government property that you can see as though it were your own, even if it is not technically part of your assigned post.\n\n2. To walk my post in a military manner, keeping always on the alert and observing everything that takes place within sight or hearing.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled\", as the expression goes. Be vigilant by looking around at all times. Do not be tempted to hide from the rain or cold in poor weather. If you see or hear anything unusual, investigate it.\n\n3. To report all violations of orders I am instructed to enforce.\n\nIf, for example, someone is climbing a fence near your post, you must report it, even if the offender stops climbing and runs away after your challenge. In this case, even though it appears that the threat to security is over, there is no way for you to know whether this violator is the only one involved. And even though the climber may have just been seeking a shortcut back to her or his ship, you cannot be certain that there is not something more sinister involved. Let your superiors make the judgment calls; your job is to report what happens on or near your post.\n\n4. To repeat all calls from any post more distant from the quarterdeck than my own.\n\nIn these days of modern communications, sentries will probably have telephones or radios at their disposal with which to make their reports. But if they do not, or if there is a power failure or some other reason that the modern equipment fails, the age-old practice of relaying the word is very important. The term \"guardhouse\" in this general order refers to the command post or point of control for the watches. It might be the quarterdeck on board ship or a tent in the field.\n\n5. To quit my post only when properly relieved.\n\nIt should be fairly obvious that you should not leave your post until someone has come to take your place or until the petty officer of the guard has told you that the watch is no longer necessary. If the person relieving you is late, report it to the petty officer of the watch but do \"not\" quit your post. If you become ill and can no longer stand your watch, notify the petty officer of the watch and he or she will provide you a proper relief.\n\n6. To receive, obey, and pass on to the sentry who relieves me, all orders from the Commanding Officer, Command Duty Officer, Officer of the Deck, and Officers and Petty Officers of the watch only..\n\nIt is essential that you receive and obey all of the special orders that apply to your watch. It is also essential that you pass these orders on to your relief.\n\n7. To talk to no one except in the line of duty.\n\nHaving conversations about matters not pertaining to your duty is distracting and must be avoided. If someone tries to engage you in casual conversation while you are standing your watch, it is your responsibility to inform them courteously that you are on duty and cannot talk with them.\n\n8. To give the alarm in case of fire or disorder.\n\nWhile this is rather straightforward and obvious, keep in mind that a fire or disorder of some kind might be a deliberate distraction to keep you from observing some other disorderly or subversive activity. If you are certain that a fire is not meant to be a distraction, you should fight the fire if you have the means to do so. Remember, however, that your first responsibility is to \"report\" whatever is amiss.\n\n9. To call the Officer of the Deck in any case not covered by instructions.\n\nThe rule here is \"When in doubt, ask.\" If you are not sure what you are supposed to do in a particular situation, it is better to ask for clarification than to make an assumption or to guess.\n\n10. To salute all officers and all colors and standards not cased.\n\nEven though you are in charge of your post and everyone, including officers, must obey your instructions insofar as they pertain to your duties, you must still extend the appropriate military courtesies. Both terms, \"colors\" and \"standards\", refer to the national ensign. The national ensign may be referred to as \"the colors\" when it is fixed to a staff, mast, or pike (e.g., when flown from a flagstaff or carried in a parade). When it is fixed to a vehicle it is often called \"the national standard.\" A flag is considered \"cased\" when it is furled and placed in a protective covering. If your duties allow, you should take part in morning or evening colors ceremonies, but do not sacrifice your vigilance by doing so. For example, if your assignment requires that you watch a certain area and the national ensign is being hoisted in a different direction, you should stand at attention and salute but do not face the colors; keep looking in the direction you are supposed to be watching.\n\n11. To be especially watchful at night and during the time for challenging, to challenge all persons on or near my post, and allow no one to pass without proper authority.\n\nChallenging persons while you are on sentry duty is accomplished by a mix of custom and common sense. When a person or party approaches your post, you should challenge them at a distance that is sufficient for you to react if they turn out to have hostile intentions. You should say in a firm voice, loud enough to be easily heard, \"Halt! Who goes there?\" (or \"Who is there?\"). Once the person answers, you should then say \"Advance to be recognized.\" If you are challenging a group of people, you should say, \"Advance \"one\" to be recognized.\" If you have identified the person or persons approaching, permit them to pass. If you are not satisfied with that person's identification, you must detain the person and call the petty officer of the watch. When two or more individuals approach from different directions at the same time, challenge each in turn and require each to halt until told to proceed.\n\nGeneral Orders for the Navy and Coast Guard are essentially the same, except for the wording of two orders: \n\n\nGeneral Orders of the Coast Guard:\n\nThe U.S. Army now uses a condensed form of orders, with three basic instructions. Previously it used the same eleven general orders as the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Security Forces also uses a condensed form, with three basics\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1202776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1202776", "title": "Individual ministerial responsibility", "text": "Individual ministerial responsibility\n\nIndividual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention in governments using the Westminster System that a cabinet minister bears the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their ministry or department. Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as cabinet collective responsibility, which states members of the cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign. This means that a motion for a vote of \"no confidence\" is not in order should the actions of an organ of government fail in the proper discharge of their responsibilities. Where there is ministerial responsibility, the accountable minister is expected to take the blame and ultimately resign, but the majority or coalition within parliament of which the minister is part, is not held to be answerable for that minister's failure.\n\nThis means that if waste, corruption, or any other misbehaviour is found to have occurred within a ministry, the minister is responsible even if the minister had no knowledge of the actions. A minister is ultimately responsible for all actions by a ministry because, even without knowledge of an infraction by subordinates, the minister approved the hiring and continued employment of those civil servants. If misdeeds are found to have occurred in a ministry, the minister is expected to resign. It is also possible for a minister to face criminal charges for malfeasance under their watch.\n\nThe principle is considered essential, as it is seen to guarantee that an elected official is answerable for every single government decision. It is also important to motivate ministers to closely scrutinize the activities within their departments. One rule coming from this principle is that each cabinet member answers for their own ministry in parliament's question time. The reverse of ministerial responsibility is that civil servants are not supposed to take credit for the successes of their department, allowing the government to claim them.\n\nIn recent years some commentators have argued the notion of ministerial responsibility has been eroded in many Commonwealth countries. As the doctrine is a constitutional convention, there is no formal mechanism for enforcing the rule. Today ministers frequently use ignorance of misbehaviour as an argument for lack of culpability. While opposition parties rarely accept this argument, the electorate is often more accepting. In most other Commonwealth countries such cases are today hardly ever brought to trial.\n\nIt is currently unclear what individual action a minister ought to take when a civil servant within his department is guilty of maladministration. The formulation of some guidelines took place during the Crichel Down Affair in 1954 in which the Minister of Agriculture, Thomas Dugdale, resigned, despite an inquiry suggesting that all mistakes were made within his department without his knowledge and in some cases due to deliberate deceit by civil servants. Later details suggested that he resigned because he supported the civil servants' actions and because he disagreed with the government accepting the inquiry's conclusions.\nThe government announced that ministers must defend civil servants who act properly and in accordance with policies set out by the minister. Furthermore, it was stated that \"where an official makes a mistake or causes some delay, but not on an important issue of policy and not where a claim to individual rights is seriously involved, the Minister acknowledges the mistake and he accepts the responsibility although he is not personally involved.\" \n\nIn 1982, Lord Carrington (then Foreign Secretary) and two other Foreign Office ministers resigned shortly after the invasion of the Falkland Islands. Later official reviews stated that, although there had been misjudgments within the Foreign Office, no responsibility attached to any individual within the government. However, in 1983, when 38 IRA prisoners broke out of the Maze prison, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, did not resign, explaining that the break-out was not caused by any policy initiative originating from him. This latter position has become the norm in British politics. An exception might be Estelle Morris, who resigned as Secretary of State for Education in 2002, saying she had not done well enough after a scandal over A-level marking.\n\nSome recent resignations due to personal errors of judgment or impropriety include the resignation of Ron Davies, the Secretary of State for Wales, for sexual misconduct in 1998, and the resignation of Peter Mandelson, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, for failing to disclose a substantial loan by a Cabinet colleague in 1999.\n\nAn argument put forward during the Scott Inquiry into the Arms-to-Iraq affair in the 1980s was a distinction between political responsibility and political accountability. \n\nFor organizational purposes there are Cabinet Ministers who are responsible for all activity within their department. In Canada ministerial responsibility has been reduced as it has become increasingly common for top level civil servants to be called before Parliament, bypassing the minister. \n\nIn New Zealand, ministerial responsibility has tended to follow British practice. Ministers have resigned in cases of personal misconduct, but more rarely in cases of maladministration. Ministers have refused to resign in some cases where they have been asked to account for departmental errors. The most famous case was Bob Semple, who refused to resign in 1943 over engineering failures in the construction of a railway tunnel. He was quoted as saying \"I am responsible, but not to blame.\" Subsequent notable incidents have included the refusal of a minister's resignation in the 1980s over compromised security of Budget documents, a minister resigning his portfolio (but not leaving Cabinet) over the 1995 Cave Creek disaster, and the resignation of a minister in 2011 for appearing to interfere in the administration of an ACC case.\n\n\n"}

He wrote in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German; in 1819, he published the first Hebrew novel. Born and raised in the Austrian province of Galicia shortly after its annexation in the first partition of Poland, he was a follower of Hasidism in his youth. Later, he turned against Hasidism and became a proponent of Jewish emancipation and Haskalah, although he remained an observant Jew. He is best known for his many writings on Hasidism, ranging from critical treatises to parody.\n\nIn 1786, only 13 years old, he wrote a book in German, \"Ueber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim aus ihren eigenen Schriften gezogen\" (\"On the Nature of the Sect of the Hasidim, Drawn from Their Own Writings\"), in which he attempted to demonstrate the absurdity of the beliefs and practices of Hasidic rabbis, including Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav and Rabbi Shneur Zalman, founder of what became the Lubavitcher movement. His work was rejected by the imperial censors, who apparently feared that it would create disharmony among Austria's Jewish subjects. It was published in 1816. At the age of 14 he was engaged by his parents, but he continued living in his father's home.\n\nHe studied Kabala and Hasidut, but his father, who was opposed to these studies, made him a merchant. This deeply affected his opinions regarding various subjects. Perl's satire of the Hasidic movement, \"Revealer of Secrets\" (\"Megalleh Temirim\"), is said to be the first modern novel in Hebrew. It was published in Vienna in 1819 under the pseudonym \"Obadiah ben Pethahiah\". Structured as an epistolary novel, it is currently in print only in an English translation, by Dov Taylor, published by Westview Press. It is an unusual book in that it satirizes the language and style of early Hasidic rabbis writing in Hebrew, which was not the vernacular of the Jews of its time. To make his work available and accessible to his contemporaries, Perl translated his own work into Yiddish. A subsequent parody of Hasidic writings, \"Words of the Righteous\", written with Isaac Baer Levinsohn and published in 1830, is available in Hebrew.\n\nAccording to Dov Taylor, in his introduction to his English translation of \"Revealer of Secrets\", Perl denounced Hasidism not only in his writing but in memoranda to representatives of the Austrian Empire. On March 22, 1838, Perl wrote a letter suggesting that the government censor Jewish libraries, prohibit meetings in Jewish ritual baths and close traditional Jewish schools, which he called \"a place of refuge for vagabonds, thieves . . . a nest of demoralization and of . . . nefarious, scandalous deeds.\" In certain memoranda written in later years Perl went so far as to attack particular Hasidic rebbes by name.\n\nAs an educator, he was a founder of the Deutsch-Israelitische Hauptschule, a school for Jewish children which taught secular subjects such as history, geography, mathematics, and natural science in German, in addition to the Bible and Talmud.\n\nJoseph Perl, who ridiculed the ecstatic dancing and singing of the Hasidim, died on Simchat Torah (a holiday known in English as \"rejoicing in the Torah\"), a holy day traditionally — and currently — celebrated by song, dance and a processional through the streets carrying Torah scrolls, so the Galician Hasidim did not miss the opportunity to dance on Perl's fresh grave immediately after his burial.\n\n"}

The punch shocks the liver, the largest gland organ, and a center of blood circulation, and causes the victim to lose focus and drive, and can cause a breathless feeling in the victim. It is usually delivered when feinting an opponent to lead with his right, which leaves the body exposed; the attacker then steps in and delivers a short, stiff uppercut, over the liver, which will likely leave the average man incapacitated.

The actual raw fundamental frequency curves which can be analysed acoustically are the result of an interaction between these two components and this makes it difficult to compare intonation patterns when they are produced with different segmental material. Compare for example the intonation patterns on the utterances \"It's for papa\" and \"It's for mama\".\n\nThe Momel algorithm attempts to solve this problem by factoring the raw curves into two components:\n\n\nThe quadratic spline function used to model the macromelodic component is defined by a sequence of target points, (couples <nowiki></nowiki> each pair of which is linked by two monotonic parabolic curves with the spline knot occurring (by default) at the midway point between the two targets. The first derivative of the curve thus defined is zero at each target point and the two parabolas have the same value and same derivative at the spline knot. This in fact defines the most simple mathematical function for which the curves are both continuous and smooth.\n\nOn the one hand, two utterances \"For Mama!\" and \"For Papa!\" could thus be modelled with the same target points (hence the same macromelodic component) while \"For Mama?\" and \"For Papa?\" would also have the same target points but which would probably be different from those of the first pair.\n\nOn the other hand, the utterances \"For Mama!\" and \"For Mama?\" could be modelled with the same micromelodic profile but with different target point, while \"For Papa!\" and \"For Papa?\" would also have the same micromelodic profile but which would be different from those of the first pair.\n\nThe Momel algorithm derives what its authors refer to as a \"phonetic representation\" of an intonation pattern which is neutral with respect to speech production and speech perception since while not explicitly derived from a model of either production or perception it contains sufficient information to allow it to be used as input to models of either process. The relatively theory-neutral nature of the algorithm has allowed it to be used as a first step in deriving representations such as those of the Fujisaki model (Mixdorff 1999), ToBI (Maghbouleh 1999, Wightman & al. 2000) or INTSINT (Hirst & Espesser 1993, Hirst et al. 2000).\n\n\nMomel automatic annotation can be performed by SPPAS\n"}

Most of his works deal with the lifestyle, tragedy and struggle of the village people and the contemporary social practices that prevailed in Bengal. He remains the most popular, translated, adapted, and plagiarized Indian author of all time.\n\nSarat Chandra Chattopadhyay was born on 15 September 1876, in Debanandapur, a small village two miles northwest of Bandel in Hooghly, West Bengal.\nHis father Motilal Chattopadhyay was an idler and dreamer who held irregular jobs. He could not finish novels and stories that he had started writing, but passed on his imagination and love of literature to Sarat Chandra. He, wife Bhuvanmohini, and their five children lived for many years in his father-in-law Kedarnath Gangopadhyay's house in Bhagalpur, Bihar.\n\nSarat Chandra was a daring, adventure-loving boy. Most of his schooling was in informal village schools called pathshalas. He was a good student and got a double promotion that enabled him to skip a grade. He passed his Entrance Examination (public examination at the end of Class X) but could not take his F.A. (First Arts) examination or attend college due to lack of funds.\n\nSarat Chandra started writing in his early teens. After finishing his formal studies, he spent much of his time interacting with friends, acting in plays, and in playing sports and games. Several of his famous novels and stories were written during this period.\n\nIn 1893, Sarat Chandra moved to Burma. Part of his novel, Srikanto, is based on his experiences in Burma. He got a temporary job in Burma Railway's audit office and later worked for many years in Burma's public works accounts office. While living in Rangoon, he married his first wife Shanti. He was deeply hurt when his wife and one-year-old son died from plague. He married his second wife Mokshada (later renamed Hironmoyee) also in Rangoon and taught her to read and write. She outlived him by 23 years.\n\nIn 1916, Sarat Chandra moved backed to India and settled in Howrah, near Kolkata. It is during this time that he improved his Sanskrit skills from \"Kabyasri\" Kishorimohan Mukherjee. He devoted himself to writing and established himself as one of India's major novelists and story writers. He was involved in India's freedom struggle and served as the president of Howrah district branch of Indian National Congress (1921-1936). University of Calcutta awarded him the prestigious Jagattarini medal. University of Dacca awarded him an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.). On 2 Magh 1344 or 16 January 1938 he died, from cancer of the liver.\n\nAfter returning from Burma, Chattopadhyay stayed for 11 years in Baje Shibpur, Howrah. Then he made a house in the village of Samtabere. He spent the later years of his life as a novelist in Samtabere and in another house in Kolkata. His house in Samtabere is often called as \"Sarat Chandra Kuthi\" in the map of Samtabere or Samta, in the Howrah district of West Bengal.\n\nThe two storied Burmese style house was also home to Sarat Chandra's brother, Swami Vedananda, who was a disciple of Belur Math. His and his brother's \"samadhi\" can still be seen there. The trees like bamboo, \"galoncho\" and the guava trees planted by the renowned author are still tourist attractions.\n\nThe phenomenal popularity of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay has been attested by some of the most prominent writers as well as literary critics across India in their writings. Most of the authors in Assam and Odisha, at least before the Independence, read him admiringly in original Bengali; rest of India read him in translations in varying quality. Publishers were never tired of reprinting his works; he remains the most translated, the most adapted and the most plagiarized author. His novels also reached a number of people through the medium of film and he is still an important force in Indian cinema. O. N. V. Kurup writes \"...Sarat Chandra's name is cherished as dearly as the names of eminent Malayalam novelists. His name has been a household word\". Dr Mirajkar informs \"the translations of Sarat Chandra created a stir amongst the readers and writers all over Maharashtra. He has become a known literary personality in Maharashtra in the rank of any popular Marathi writers including H. N. Apte, V. S. Khandekar, N. S. Phadke and G. T. Madkholkar\". Jainendra Kumar, who considers that his contribution towards the creation and preservation of cultural India is second, perhaps, only to that of Gandhi, asks a rhetorical question summing up Sarat Chandra's position and presumably the role of translation and inter-literary relationship: \"Sarat Chandra was a writer in Bengali; but where is that Indian language in which he did not become the most popular when he reached it?\"\n\nHis works have been made into around fifty films in many Indian languages. Particularly, his novel \"Devdas\" has been made into sixteen versions, from Bengali, Hindi to Telugu. \"Parineeta\" has also been made twice. In 1957 \"Bardidi\" was made by director Ajoy Kar. \"Majhli Didi\" (1967) by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and \"Swami\" (1977), for which he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Story, are other adaptations. Another famous film \"Chhoti Bahu\" (1971) is based on his novel \"Bindur Chhele\". His Novel 'Datta' was adapted into a Bengali film as Datta (film) in 1976 starring Suchitra Sen and Soumitra Chatterjee in the lead roles. The film \"Sabyasachi\" (film) was released in 1977 based on his work \"Pather Dabi\".\nThe other movies based on his novel were \"Nishkriti\", and \"Apne Paraye\" (1980) by Basu Chatterjee, starring Amol Palekar. The Telugu film \"Thodi Kodallu\" (1957) is also based on this novel. Gulzar's 1975 film, \"Khushboo\" is majorly inspired by his work \"Pandit Mashay\". The 1961 Telugu film \"Vagdanam\" by Acharya Atreya is loosely based on his novel \"Datta\". Also the 2011 film \"Aalo Chhaya\" is based on his short story, \"Aalo O Chhaya\".\n\nSarat Chandra wrote novels, novellas, and stories. He came to maturity at a time when the national movement was gaining momentum together with an awakening of social consciousness. His novel 'Pather Dabi' played an important role in the National Movement. Much of his writing bears the mark of the resultant turbulence of society. Sensitive and daring, his novels captivated the hearts and minds of innumerable readers both in Bengal and in the rest of India. His best known novels include \"Palli Samaj\" (1916), \"Charitrahin\" (1917), \"Devdas\" (1917), \"Nishkriti\" (1917), \"Datta\" (1918), \"Srikanta, Griha Daha\" (1920), \"Sesh Prashna\" (1929) and \"Sesher Parichay\" published posthumously (1939).\n\nHe wrote some essays including \"Narir Itihas\" (The History of Women) and \"Narir Mulya\" (The Value of Women). \"Narir Itihas\", which was lost in a house fire, contained a history of women on the lines of Spencer's Descriptive Sociology. While the second, \"Narir Mulya\" gives a theory of women's rights in the context of Mill's and Spencer's arguments.\n\nThe following classification of his works is based on \"Sarat Rachanabali\" (collected works) website.\n\nNovels and novellas\n\nStories\n\nPlays\nSarat Chandra converted three of his works into plays. \n\nEssays\n\nOther works\n\nBiography\n\n"}

The reaction time between hearing a word and pronouncing it can be as short as 254 ms or even 150 ms. This is only the delay duration of a speech syllable. While a person is only asked to repeat words, they also automatically process their syntax and semantics. Words repeated during the practice of shadowing imitate the parlance of the overheard words more than the same words read aloud by that subject. The technique is also used in language learning.\n\nFunctional imaging finds that the shadowing of nonwords occurs through the dorsal stream that links auditory and motor representations of speech through a pathway that starts in the superior temporal cortex, goes to the inferior parietal cortex and then the posterior inferior frontal cortex (Broca's area).\n\nSpeech shadowing was first used as a research technique by the Leningrad Group led by Ludmilla A.Chistovich in the late 1950s. It has been used in research into speech perception and stuttering.\n\nThe speech shadowing technique is used in dichotic listening tests. The first one to apply this technique was E. Colin Cherry in 1953. During dichotic listening tests, subjects are presented with two different messages, one in their right ear and one in their left. The participants are often asked to focus on only one of the different messages and this is where the speech shadowing technique is used. Participants are instructed to shadow the attended message by repeating it out loud with a delay of a few seconds between hearing a word and repeating the word. The speech shadowing technique is significant for these experiments because it ensures that the subjects are attending to the desired message. Various other stimuli are then presented to the other ear, and subjects are afterwards queried on what they can recall from the other message.\n\n\n"}

He was the great uncle of Vitus Bering. He served as Historiographer Royal from 1649.\n\nBorn in Viborg, Bering was the son of the city's mayor Peder Pedersen Bering and Maren Vitusdatter Brun. He graduated from Ciborg Cathedral School in 1635. He attracted attention for his poems in latin and went abroad on a royal scholarship, visiting the Netherlands and France.\n\nBering was called home in 1751 to serve as steward for the scanian magnate Tage Thott's son Ove Thott. On this capacity, he went on a seven year journey to the Netherlands (Leiden 1639), France (Orléans 1640), Italy (Siena 1642, Rome and Padua 1647) and Germany (Strassburg and Basel 1648). He had become still more famous for. After their return to Denmark, he took a Master's degree at Copenhagen University in 1649 he immediately assumed a position as \"professor poeseos\" which had apparently been created specially for him. Later that same year he was appointed to professor in history at Sorø Academy and Historiographer Royal. Im late 1651, he was granted permission to resign as professor.\n\nis patron, Tahe Thott, made arrangements for a residence at Skabersjö Castle in Scania. In 1665, the king granted him the former archbishop's house Lundegård at Lund. The loss of Scania as a result of the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 made Bering a Swedish subject. With support from Corfitz Ulfeldt, he negotiated with Karl Gustaf for a position as Swedish Historiographer. He offered to describe Sweden's earliest history and declared his willingness to praise the Swedish king's victories in Poland in return for a canonicate in Lund but refused to describe the Swedish victories over Denmark. The Swedish king accepted his proposal in 1759 but Bering managed to sell his estate to bishop Vinstrup in Lund in 1660 and chose instead to leave Scania. He was well reseived in Denmark and became a member of skatkammerkollegiet on 11 November 1660. In 1669, or possibly earlier, he was also appointed to Supreme Court justice. He also kept the position as Historiographer and was also a popular writer of Occasional poetry.\n\nBering was tasked with writing a general history of Denmark, a work on reignof Christian IV and a work on resent events such as the Assault on Copenhagen in 1659 and the institution of Absolutism in 1660. Neither of these were published proor to his death. His only publication was a critical work on England, \"Orosij Annilonis dissertalio de bello Dano-Anglico\" (1667), a defense of the Danish king's policy.\n\nHis work on the Assault on Copenhagen, \"Obsidio Hafniensis\", was published posthumously in 1676. His largest work, \"Floms Danicus\", an account of Danish history in latin reaching back to 1448, was not published until 1698. Its style is inspired by that of Publius Annius Florus. Historically, it is of little interest, being a merely stylistical treatment of older sources. It was, however, praised in its own time.\n\nFew of Bering's poems have survived. They represent the transition from Bording to Thomas Kingo, who both were among his personal friends, in Danish Baroque poetry.\n\nBering married Anne Nielsdatter, daughter of professor Niels Pedersen Aurilesius, in Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen on 13 June 1652. She died in 157. On 15 September 1663, he then married Gertrud Jørgensdatter, daughter of \"renteskriver\" Jørgen Hansen (1613–73) and Kirstine Knudsdatter (død 1702).\n\nIn 1666, Christian V granted him the Klampenborg area north of Copenhagen for life. Bering constructed a small country house on the land and named it Christiansholm after the king. The king also granted him another country estate, probably Farumgård shortly prior to his death in 1675.\n\nHis nephew Vitus Ionassen Bering, a sailor, entered Russian service, and, after an unremarkable military career, made himself a name as an explorer, commanding the First Kamchatka Expedition and Great Northern Expedition, where he perished at 60 years of age. Their similar names and the lack of the latter man's reliable portraits has led to the lot of confusion, and, until the explorer's remains were rediscovered in 1991, the portrait of his uncle was believed to belong to him.\n"}

Like all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the exploratory research purpose in empirical investigation and is often used as a conceptual framework in qualitative research.\n\nUse of the phrase \"working hypothesis\" goes back at least two centuries.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce came to hold that an explanatory hypothesis is not only justifiable as a tentative conclusion by its plausibility (by which he meant its naturalness and economy of explanation), but also justifiable as a starting point by the broader promise that the hypothesis holds for research. This idea of justifying a hypothesis as potentially fruitful (at the level of research method), not merely as plausible (at the level of logical conclusions), is essential for the idea of a working hypothesis, as later elaborated by Peirce's fellow pragmatist John Dewey.\n\nPeirce held that, as a matter of research method, an explanatory hypothesis is judged and selected for research because it offers to economize and expedite the process of inquiry, by being testable and by further factors in the economy of hypotheses: low cost, intrinsic value (instinctive naturalness and reasoned likelihood), and relations (caution, breadth, and incomplexity) among hypotheses, inquiries, etc. (as in the game of Twenty Questions). The \"Century Dictionary Supplement\" definition of \"working hypothesis\" reflects that perspective; Peirce may or may not have written it. Peirce seldom used the phrase \"working hypothesis,\" but he once commented about a related kind of a hypothesis that it was \"a hypothesis, which like the working hypothesis of a scientific inquiry, we may not believe to be altogether true, but which is useful in enabling us to conceive of what takes place.\" For Peirce the pragmatist, conceiving pragmatically of something meant conceiving of its effects in their conceivable implications as to informed practice in general including research.\n\nJohn Dewey used the concept of the working hypothesis as a pivotal feature in his theory of inquiry. Contrary to the principles of verification and falsifiability, used in formal hypothesis testing found within dominant paradigms of 'normal' science, working hypotheses were conceived by Dewey as neither true nor false but \"provisional, working means of advancing investigation,\" which lead to the discovery of other unforeseen but \"relevant\" facts. Dewey's development of the concept of the working hypothesis emerged from his contextualist epistemology in which absolute truth is unobtainable and replaced by \"warranted assertability\". Thus, Dewey noted:\nThe history of science also shows that when hypotheses have been taken to be finally \"true\" and hence unquestionable, they have obstructed inquiry and kept science committed to doctrines that later turned out to be invalid.\n\nIn Dewey's view, the working hypothesis is generated, not directly as a testable statement of, but instead in order to \"direct inquiry into channels in which new material, factual and conceptual, is disclosed, material which is more relevant, more weighted and confirmed, more fruitful, than were the initial facts and conceptions which served as the point of departure\".\n\nAbraham Kaplan later described the working hypothesis as \"provisional or loosely formatted\" theory or constructs.\n\nWorking hypotheses are constructed to facilitate inquiry; however, formal hypotheses can often be constructed based on the results of the inquiry, which in turn allows for the design of specific experiments whose data will either support or fail to support the formal hypotheses. In \"Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis\" Oppenheim and Putnam argued that unitary science, in which laws from one branch could be equally useful by others, could only be accepted tentatively without further empirical testing. Thus they argued:\nWe therefore think the assumption that unitary science can be attained through cumulative micro-reduction recommends itself as a working hypothesis. That is, we believe that it is in accord with the standards of reasonable scientific judgment to tentatively accept this hypothesis and to work on the assumption that further progress can be made in this direction.\n\nFor Putnam, the working hypothesis, therefore, represents a practical starting point in the design of an empirical research exploration. A contrasting example of this conception of the working hypothesis is illustrated by the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment. This experiment involves confronting the global skeptic position that we, in fact, are all just brains in vats being stimulated by a mad scientist to believe that our reality is real. Putnam argued that this proposition, however, rests on a \"magical theory of reference\" in which the existential evidence necessary to validate it is assumed. Thus, the brain-in-a-vat proposition does not make for much of a hypothesis at all since there is no means to verify its truth. It does, however, provide a contrast for what a good working hypothesis would look like: one suited to culling potential existential evidence of the subject at hand.\n\nA more concrete example would be that of conjectures in mathematics – propositions which appear to be true but which are formally unproven. Very often, conjectures will be provisionally accepted as working hypotheses in order to investigate its consequences and formulate conditional proofs.\n\nIn the field of public administration working hypotheses are used as a conceptual framework for exploratory, applied, empirical research Research projects that use working hypotheses use a deductive reasoning or logic of inquiry. In other words, the problem and preliminary theory are developed ahead of time and tested using evidence. Working hypotheses (statements of expectation) are flexible and incorporate relational or non-relational statements. They are often used as ways to investigate a problem in a particular city or public agency. \nThese projects are a type of case study and use multiple methods of evidence collection. The working hypotheses are used as a device to direct evidence collection. As a result, working hypotheses are generally organized using sub-hypotheses, which specify in more detail the kinds of data or evidence needed to support the hypothesis.\n\n"}
