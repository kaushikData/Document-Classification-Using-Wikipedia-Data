{"id": "4571402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4571402", "title": "Anti-Catalanism", "text": "Anti-Catalanism\n\nAnti-Catalanism (, ) is the collective name given to various alleged historical trends in Spain that have been hostile to and traditions.\n\nIn more recent times it is a term used to criticize political stances contrary to Catalan nationalism or Catalan independentism, both inside and outside Catalonia.\n\nIn a historical context, anti-Catalanism expresses itself as a hostile attitude towards the Catalan language, people, traditions or anything identified with Catalonia. In a political context it may express itself as the reaction to a perceived intrusion of Catalan political nationalism into the area. In its most extreme circumstances, this may also be referred as Catalanophobia. Several political movements, known for organising boycotts of products from Catalonia, are also actively identified with anti-Catalanism. It is a controversial term in Spain since Catalan political parties which support political independence are often accused of conflating criticism of their stances and actions with an attack on all Catalans. \n\nAnti-Catalanism in its most virulent form is mostly associated with far-right Spanish political parties. Fringe groups such as España 2000 (none of which obtained more than 0.5% of the votes in the last general elections) object strongly to the autonomy enjoyed by Catalonia, claiming that the granting of autonomy to Catalonia and other regions will lead to the breakup of Spain.\n\nCriticism of Catalan nationalism, is to be found throughout the Spanish political spectrum. However, such criticism does not usually imply hostility towards Catalonia itself, nor does it necessarily imply being against regional autonomy in Spain, or even the use of regional languages in the public domain. In fact, \"Ciutadans\" – which is possibly the most vocal of the Spanish political parties against the perceived excesses of regional nationalisms such as the Catalan – was created in Catalonia and has its national headquarters in Barcelona; this Catalan party – currently the largest party in the Catalan regional parliament – is equally referred to by Catalan nationalists as \"anti-Catalan\", illustrating a certain tendency among pro-independence Catalan parties to interpret attacks on their political stance as xenophobic, populist or selfish attacks on all Catalans, nationalist or not.\n\nIn this regard, black lists of so-called \"bad Catalans\" (Catalan public figures who oppose Catalan separatism) have been published. It should be added that Ciutadans has had links in the past to extremist groups. And more recently tried to pass a motion through parliament against the alleged indoctrination in Catalan, Balearic and Valencian schools.\nAdditionally such a distinction between \"good Catalans\" and \"bad Catalans\" is found in both sides of the issue, most recently by PP Catalan Leader Xavier Albiol who talked about mobilizing the majority of \"good Catalans\" when referring to those against independence. The prevalence of it is up for debate.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Catalan nationalists have often labelled as 'anti-Catalan' previous policies of the Spanish or French state which, per se, were not directed specifically to the Catalan culture, but were a part of a general centralist vision of politics.\n\nBesides politics, anti-Catalanism is often also based on widespread perceived prejudices among regions of Spain. The stereotype of Catalans common throughout Spain involve a sense of them being industrious and excelling in entrepreneurship on the one side but also excessively individualistic, unfriendly, disloyal, snobbish or mean on the other side. This perception plays with alleged political realities, Catalonia often being accused of lack of solidarity with the poorer regions of Spain, marginalisation of the Spanish language and culture (e.g., ban on bullfighting, absence of Spanish-language public education), and historical discrimination or xenophobia against economic migrants from Andalusia, Extremadura or other Spanish regions. The degree to which these accusations are justified is debatable, particularly since the children and grandchildren of immigrants have successfully integrated into a multicultural Catalan society. It should also be added that these are usually based on politically motivated misinterpretations, Spanish-language education is possible under request and is in practice the language most used in education as shown by speaker rates. This also applies to the prohibition of Spanish language signs: though the law states that the main language of street signs should be Catalan, it does not forbid the use of Spanish along with it.\n\nHowever, arguments forwarded include that whereas the 20 most common surnames names in Catalonia proper are typical of the Spanish language, the majority of political seats and posts are held by people with typically Catalan language surnames, and some of those who do not have them 'Catalanise' them upon embarking on a political career. In particular it has been noted that a pool of Catalan language surnames held by 13% of the total Catalan population holds 40% of the politically designated jobs, which has been called an 'overrepresentation' or even 'hyperrepresentation' in the political elite of these Catalan families vs. the Catalan society as a whole.\n\nAnti-Catalanism has a local and distinctive manifestation in the Valencian Community called Blaverism, a movement rejecting Joan Fuster's concept of \"Països Catalans\". Blaverism is best reflected in debates concerning the status of Valencian versus Catalan, even though this phenomenon has diminished greatly over the last 25 years.\nAlso in Aragon there is an anti-Catalan movement that seeks to downplay the Catalan identity of La Franja, thus the Aragonese regional parliament passed a law to avoid referring to the Catalan language as the language spoken in some parts of Aragon, forcing a neologism in its place, even though this was later abrogated.\n\n"}

{"id": "47197342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47197342", "title": "Babysan", "text": "Babysan\n\nBabysan was a comic created by American artist Bill Hume while he was stationed in Japan in the 1950s. The comic depicts American sailors interacting with a pin-up style Japanese woman named Babysan. The title comes from the word \"baby\" an affectionate term Americans use and \"san\" which is an honorary term used by the Japanese. It translates literally to Miss Baby. The comic became incredibly popular with United States service members in Japan by mixing good humor with culture, language, and sex. Babysan attempted to show some of the give and take between American and Japanese cultures during the occupational era. Anything but political, the comic plays on misunderstanding and sexuality. \"I didn't invent Babysan, I just reported life as it was.\"\n\nBill Hume was a member of the U.S Navy during World War II (1942–1945). He left the Navy in 1945 and married. In 1951, he was recalled to be part of the occupying force in Japan. Hume served as a petty officer in charge of maintaining good order and discipline and was also the editor of the station newspaper, \"The Oppaman\". Through his observations of life in Japan, the effects American sailors were having on the culture, and the effects the Japanese culture was having on the sailors Hume created Babysan, originally a pinup poster, to help boost morale. Babysan became a hit with the sailors of Fleet Airforce Service Squadron 120 and this popularity spread to the Navy Times and finally to the United States when servicemen began returning home. Hume returned to the United States in 1952, teamed up with John Annarino, and four books based on Babysan were published shortly after.\n\nBabysan gave a view of post-war Japan from the eyes of an American servicemember. Their love of American movies, American dance, and western clothing comes in stark contrast to the society of the recent past. Bill Hume rarely, if ever, depicts Japanese men in his comics and these cultural changes may or may not have impacted them at the time but when the Japanese women began adopting them. the American servicemen felt more relaxed and accepting. Although naive and innocent the character of Babysan was able to teach Americans a little bit about customary practices such as taking off shoes before entering a house, the hibatchi, the kimono, food, and money. It also included common Japanese words and a rudimentary explanation of writing even though some arrogant American sailors already seemed to know it all. In addition to entertaining the troops, Babysan also provided a glimpse of what to expect and how they might be perceived in their new home.\n\nThis semi-pornographic comic often featured Babysan partially nude and flirting. In one comic, she reminded creator Bill Hume that \"Japanese girls like to wear clothes, too.\" Servicemen may have imagined \"Cio-Cio San\" in Puccini's Madame Butterfly as the typical Japanese girl but what they got was instead was Babysan. This Japanese woman was self-motivated with her own problems and desires. Tight fitting clothing, blunt talk, and comfort with nudity made Babysan irresistible to servicemen of every rank and when they got jealous they accused her of \"butterflying\". This term meant being unfaithful but Babysan never accepted this description, she would disagree in her broken English and say that she had not butterflied, she had changed her mind. \nBabysan also desired money. She goes from one serviceman to another flirting asking questions like \"Why you all time bring candy- why never bring okane(money)?\"(33) or \"Why never have liberty on payday?\". (83) This was not prostitution however. It was payment for services to be sure but \"Babysan never forgot the acts of kindness on the part of the American. She decided...to devote herself to the part of the American...There wasn't much sense in restricting her charms to one.\" She entertained them with her beauty, her femininity, her charm, and her energy. And unlike Cio-Cio San, Babysan was not upset when Americans left for home, as she was waving goodbye to them she was already looking towards the future and another serviceman.\n\nBabysan made light of the tumultuous situation in Japan during the 1940s and 50s. Although not intended to be a textbook on Japanese custom and tradition Hume's works certainly contained elements of both. These were combined with some of charming things in Japan including the most charming thing to the United States servicemen according to Hume, the Japanese girl. Babysan disarmed the sailors and soldiers with her beauty and ability to adopt new things and through her they were able to enjoy the food, the language, and the culture during their short tours in Japan. It is not a widely known work but among many in the field, it is highly respected.\n"}

Common circulating examples include the ₹10, €1, €2, 2 and 5 PLN, 50 CZK, 100 and 200 HUF, 1 and 2 BGN, British £1 and £2, Canadian $2, South African R5, Turkish 1 lira, IDR 1K, Hong Kong $10, Argentine $1, Brazilian R$1 Philippine ₱10, and all Mexican coins of $1 or higher denomination.\n\nBi-metallic coins have been issued for a long time, with known examples dating from the 17th century, while the Roman Empire issued special-occasion, large medallions with a center of bronze or copper and an outer ring of orichalcum, starting with the reign of Hadrian. The silver-center cent pattern produced by the United States in 1792 is another example. In the 1830s and 1840s, British medalist Joseph Moore produced large numbers of bi-metallic \"penny model\" and less common \"halfpenny model\" tokens, as a proposal to replace the relatively large penny and halfpenny coins. Though not legal tender, Moore's tokens were circulated widely and accepted at face value by many merchants. Despite their popularity, the Royal Mint rejected the proposal, and did not reduce the size of the penny and halfpenny until decimalization.\n\nIn recent times, the first circulating bi-metallic coin was the Italian 500 lire, first issued in 1982. Morocco, with its 5-dirhams coin in 1987; France, with a 10-francs coin in 1992; Monaco, with a 10 francs; Thailand, with a 10 baht, in 1988; and Hong Kong, with a $10 coin, in 1993, Hungary, with a 100-forint coin in 1996, and Brazil with the 1 real coin issued bi-metallic coins for circulation all based on the minting process of the Italian 500 lire coin. India introduced 10-rupee bi-metallic coins in 2009 that are dated 2006 (minted at Noida). Since 1996, Canada has also produced bi-metallic $2 coins (nicknamed \"toonies\"). Great Britain has issued a bi-metallic 2-pound coin since 1997; and Singapore has issued a bi-metallic 1-dollar coin since 2013.\n\nThe first ever tri-metallic circulating coins were 20-francs coins introduced in France and Monaco in 1992. These were similar to the corresponding bi-metallic 10-francs coins, but had two rings instead of one. \n\nAs well as circulating coins, where they are generally restricted to high-denomination coins, bi-metallic coins are often used in commemorative issues, often made of precious metals. For example, the only bi-metallic coin of the United States is the $10 Library of Congress commemorative, made of a gold ring around a platinum center. They are used primarily as a way of securing against coin counterfeiting.\n\nThe manufacturing process is similar to that of ordinary coins, except that two blanks (the inner and the outer) are struck at the same time, deforming the separate blanks sufficiently to hold them together.\n\n"}

{"id": "1669534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1669534", "title": "Chess annotation symbols", "text": "Chess annotation symbols\n\nWhen annotating chess games, commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols. Question marks and exclamation points that denote a move as bad or good are ubiquitous in chess literature. Some publications intended for an international audience, such as the \"Chess Informant\", have a wide range of additional symbols that transcend language barriers.\n\nThe common symbols for evaluating the merits of a move are \"??\", \"?\", \"?!\", \"!?\", \"!\", and \"!!\". In these cases, the corresponding symbol is juxtaposed in the text immediately after the move (e.g. Re7? or Kh1!?, see algebraic chess notation).\n\nUse of these annotation symbols is subjective, as different annotators use the same symbols differently. Moreover, an annotator's use of symbols is often influenced by the player's strength: a positional misjudgment that an annotator might give a \"??\" if played by a strong grandmaster might pass unremarked if played by a beginner.\n\nAnnotators' use of punctuation also may possibly be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move; this tendency is sometimes referred to as \"annotation by result\".\n\nMove evaluation symbols, by increasing effectiveness of the move:\n\nThe double question mark \"??\" indicates a blunder, a very bad mistake. Typical moves which receive double question marks are those that overlook a tactic that wins substantial material or overlook a checkmate. A \"??\"-worthy move usually results in an immediately lost position. Occasionally, the sign is used for a move which transforms a won position into a draw, perhaps because the annotator feels that the mistake is unworthy of the player's skill level. They occur at all levels of play to all human competitors.\n\nA single question mark \"?\" after a move indicates that the annotator thinks that the move is a poor one that should not be played. These often lead to loss of tempo or material. The nature of the mistake may be more strategic than tactical; in some cases, the move receiving a question mark may be one for which it is difficult to find a refutation. A move that overlooks a forthcoming brilliant combination from the opponent would rarely receive more than one question mark, for example.\n\nWhether a single or double question mark is used is subjective and may depend on the player's strength. For instance, if a beginner makes a serious strategic error (for instance, accepting gratuitous pawn weaknesses or exchanging into a lost endgame) or overlooks a tactical sequence, this might be explained by the beginner's lack of skill, and be given only one question mark. If a master were to make the same move, some annotators might use the double question mark to indicate that one would never expect a player of the master's strength to make such a weak move.\n\nThis symbol is similar to the \"!?\" (below) but usually indicates that the annotator believes the move to be objectively bad, albeit hard to refute. The \"?!\" may also indicate that the annotator believes the move is deserving of criticism but not bad enough to warrant a \"?\". A sacrifice leading to a dangerous attack which the opponent should be able to defend against if he plays well may receive a \"?!\". Alternatively, this may denote a move that is objectively bad, but sets up an attractive trap.\n\nThe \"!?\" is one of the more controversial symbols. Different books have slightly varying definitions. Among the definitions are \"interesting, but perhaps not the best move\", \"move deserving attention\", \"enterprising move\" and \"risky move\". Usually it indicates that the move leads to exciting or wild play but that the objective evaluation of the move is unclear. It is also often used when a player sets a cunning trap in a lost position. Typical moves receiving a \"!?\" are those involving speculative sacrifices or dangerous attacks which might turn out to be strategically deficient.\n\nAndrew Soltis jokingly called \"!?\" the symbol of the lazy annotator who finds a move interesting but cannot be bothered to work out whether it is good or bad.\n\nWhile question marks indicate bad moves, exclamation points (\"!\") indicate good moves—especially ones which are surprising or involve particular skill. Hence annotators are usually somewhat conservative with the use of this symbol.\n\nOnce the players start making good choices when faced with difficult decisions, however, a few moves may receive exclamation points from annotators. Typical moves receiving exclamation points are strong , well-timed breakthroughs, sound sacrifices, and moves that avoid falling into traps.\n\nThe double exclamation point (\"‼\") is used for very strong moves such as sound sacrifices of large amounts of material and counter-intuitive moves that prove very powerful. For example, in what is known as the Game of the Century, 13-year-old Bobby Fischer's decision to sacrifice his queen for a strategic attack was awarded by annotators a double exclamation point. \n\nA few writers have used three or more exclamation points (\"!!!\") for an exceptionally brilliant move. For example, in Rotlewi-Rubinstein 1907, Hans Kmoch awarded Rubinstein's 22...Rxc3 three exclamation points. Likewise, an exceptionally bad blunder may be awarded three or more question marks (\"???\"). The general consensus among chess writers is that these symbols are unnecessary.\n\nA few writers have used unusual combinations of question marks and exclamation points (e.g. \"!!?\", \"?!?\", \"??!\") for particularly unusual or controversial moves, but these have no generally accepted meaning, and are typically used for humorous or entertainment purposes.\n\nOccasionally an annotation symbol may be put in parentheses, e.g. \"(?)\", \"(!)\". Different writers have used these in different ways; for example Simon Webb used \"(?)\" to indicate a move which is objectively sound, but was in his opinion a poor psychological choice, while Robert Hübner (see below) used it to indicate a move which is inaccurate and makes the player's task more difficult.\n\nThere are some systems which use these symbols in different ways.\n\nIn his 1992 book \"Secrets of Rook Endings\" and other books in the series (\"Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings\" and \"Secrets of Pawnless Endings\"), John Nunn uses these symbols in a more specific way in the context of endgames where the optimal line of play can be determined with certainty:\n\n\nThis convention has been used in some later works, such as \"Fundamental Chess Endings\" and \"Secrets of Pawn Endings\" by Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht, but it can be safely assumed the convention is not being used unless there is a specific note otherwise. The Nunn convention cannot be used to annotate full games because the exact evaluation of a position is generally impractical to compute.\n\nIn 1959, Euwe and Hooper made the same use of the question mark, \"... a decisive error...\".\n\nGerman grandmaster Robert Hübner prefers an even more specific and restrained use of move evaluation symbols:\n\"I have attached question marks to the moves which change a winning position into a drawn game, or a drawn position into a losing one, according to my judgment; a move which changes a winning game into a losing one deserves two question marks ... I have distributed question marks in brackets to moves which are obviously inaccurate and significantly increase the difficulty of the player's task ... There are no exclamation marks, as they serve no useful purpose. The best move should be mentioned in the analysis in any case; an exclamation mark can only serve to indicate the personal excitement of the commentator.\"\n\nWhen the solution to a certain chess problem is given, there are also some conventions that have become a common practice:\n\nThese symbols indicate the strategic balance of the game position:\n\nEven position: White and Black have more or less equal chances.\n\nSlight advantage: White has slightly better chances.\n\nSlight advantage: Black has slightly better chances.\n\nClear advantage: White has much better chances. It is also written as ±; the other similar symbols can be written in this style as well.\n\nClear advantage: Black has much better chances. It is also written as ∓; the other similar symbols can be written in this style as well.\n\nDecisive advantage: White has a winning advantage.\n\nDecisive advantage: Black has a winning advantage.\n\nUnclear position: It is unclear who (if anyone) has an advantage. Often used when a position is highly asymmetrical, e.g. Black has a ruined pawn structure but dangerous active piece-play.\n\nWith compensation: Whoever is down in has compensation for it. Can also denote a position that is unclear, but appears to the annotator to be approximately equal.\n\nThere are other symbols used by various chess engines and publications, such as \"Chess Informant\" and \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\", when annotating moves or describing positions. \n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n"}
{"id": "2488281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2488281", "title": "Crakow", "text": "Crakow\n\nCrakows or crackowes were a style of shoes with extremely long toes very popular in the 15th century. They were so named because the style was thought to have originated in Kraków, then the capital of Poland. They are also sometimes known as poulaines or pikes, though the term \"poulaine\", as in \"souliers a la poulaine\", \"shoes in the Polish fashion\", referred to the long pointed beak of the shoe, not the shoe itself.\n\nLong toed shoes had been popular in Europe at different times, first appearing in the archaeological record in the 12th century and falling in and out of fashion periodically before reaching their most exaggerated form in the third quarter of the 15th century and falling out of fashion in the 1480s.\n\nThe arrival of this fashion in England is traditionally associated with the marriage of Richard II and Anne of Bohemia in 1382. An anonymous 'monk of Evesham' recorded in 1394: \"With this queen there came from Bohemia into England those accursed vices (English \"Cracowys\" or \"Pykys\") half a yard in length, thus it was necessary for them to be tied to the shin with chains of silver before they could walk with them.\"\n\nHowever, there are indications they were worn as early as the 1360s. The author of the \"Eulogium Historiarum\" describes men of this period as wearing \"points on their shoes as long as your finger that are called crakowes; more suitable as claws... for demons than as ornaments for men.\"\n\n14th century poulaine-toed shoes found in London were found only in men's sizes, but 15th century art shows them being worn by both men and women, with the toes of men's shoes being the most extravagantly long. They were a controversial fashion and faced criticism from several quarters. In 1368, Charles V of France issued an edict banning their construction and use in Paris. An English poem from 1388 complained that men were unable to kneel in prayer because their toes were too long. In 1463, Edward IV passed a sumptuary law restricting anyone \"under the state of a Lord, Esquire, [or] Gentleman\" from wearing poulaines over the length of two inches. In 1465, they were banned in England altogether, so that all cordwainers and cobblers within the City of London were prohibited from making shoes with pikes more than two inches long.\n\nThe poulaine inspired later footwear fashions, such as the 1950s Winklepicker boots.\n\nPoulaine toes were packed with stuffing to provide rigidity and help them hold their shape. Surviving examples from medieval London have the points stuffed with moss. An Italian chronicler noted in 1388 that they were also sometimes stuffed with horsehair.\n\nAlthough there is no archaeological or medieval iconographic evidence to support the idea that the toes were ever tied up to the leg, as noted earlier, there is direct literary evidence dating from 1394 which states that this was the practice at the time these shoes were introduced into England. Additionally, the practice is mentioned by the antiquarian John Stow in his 1698 publication \"A Survey of London\", where he wrote:\nHowever, given that John Stow was writing over 100 years after the shoes fell out of fashion, and the lack of rigorous historical research in the writings of the time, he cannot be considered a reliable source. His record of Act 4 of Edward IV is exaggerated - the actual act does mention restrictions in length, but not monetary penalties, parliament or clergy:\n\nOvershoes made from leather or cork, called pattens, were frequently worn with late medieval shoes both indoors and outdoors. The shape of pattens reflected the style of shoes in different periods, and pattens during the period where poulaine toes were fashionable have matching long toes. These pattens would have supported the toe of the shoes if required.\n\nArchaeological evidence in the form of surviving shoe soles shows that the length of the point beyond the toes of the foot was rarely, if ever, more than 50% of the length of the foot. This is consistent with depictions of highly fashionable European men from the third quarter of the 15th century when poulaine toes were at the height of their popularity.\nAs with many items of high fashion the most extreme examples were worn by the upper classes. In periods when poulaine toes were popular most shoes were somewhat pointed, even those used during warfare. There is clear evidence from the Battle of Sempach that in certain periods soldiers on campaign wore shoes with toes so long as to interfere with the wearer's ability to run. In that battle, it became necessary for the knights of Leopold III, Duke of Austria to dismount and fight on foot, and because they did not have time to prepare for the engagement, they were forced to cut off the tips of their poulaines. The Swiss chroniclers report how a huge pile of these shoe-tips was found in a heap after the battle, and they are also depicted in the background of the battle scene in the Lucerne Chronicle of 1513.\nA surviving pair of sabatons belonging to Emperor Maximilian have extremely long poulaines, but they were used only on horseback and in this case the long points were detachable from the sabatons for foot combat. The catches can be seen over the area of the big toe.\n\n"}

For \"DARE\", a \"region\" may be as small as a city or part of a city, or as large as most (but not all) of the country. \"Humanities\" magazine has described it as \"a bold synthesis of linguistic atlas and historical dictionary\", and William Safire called it \"the most exciting new linguistic project in the twentieth century\".\n\nThe \"Dictionary\" is based both on face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people carried out in 1,002 communities across the country between 1965 and 1970, and on a large collection of print and (recently) electronic materials, including diaries, letters, novels, histories, biographies, government documents, and newspapers. These sources are cited in individual entries to illustrate how the words have been used from the 17th century through the beginning of the 21st century. Entries may include pronunciations, variant forms, etymologies, and statements about regional and social distributions of words and forms.\n\nFive volumes of text were published by Harvard University Press between 1985 and 2012: Volume I (A–C), with Frederic G. Cassidy serving as Chief Editor, appeared in 1985; Volume II (D–H), edited by Cassidy and Associate Editor Joan Houston Hall, was published in 1991; Volume III (I–O), by Cassidy and Hall, came out in 1996; Volume IV (P–Sk), by Hall, who succeeded Cassidy as Chief Editor upon his death, appeared in 2002; and Volume V (Sl–Z), with Hall as editor, finished the set in 2012. A sixth volume, subtitled \"Contrastive Maps, Index to Entry Labels, Questionnaire, and Fieldwork Data,\" edited by Hall with Luanne von Schneidemesser serving as Senior Editor, was published early in 2013. Late that same year, the digital version was launched.\n\n\"DARE\" chronicles the language of the American people. It is used by teachers, librarians, researchers, physicians, forensic linguists, journalists, historians, and playwrights.\n\nIn 1889, when Joseph Wright began editing the \"English Dialect Dictionary\", a group of American philologists founded the American Dialect Society with the ultimate purpose of producing a similar work for the United States. Members of the Society began to collect material, much of which was published in the Society's journal \"Dialect Notes\", but little was done toward compiling a dictionary recording nationwide usage until Frederic G. Cassidy was appointed Chief Editor in 1962. Cassidy had done fieldwork in Wisconsin for the Linguistic Atlas of the North Central States project and in Jamaica for his \"Dictionary of Jamaican English\". With the assistance of Audrey Duckert, he had also designed and administered an intensive mail-questionnaire survey of Wisconsin (the \"Wisconsin English Language Survey\"). Drawing on this experience, he and Duckert made plans for a nationwide, fieldworker-administered questionnaire that would provide a comprehensive foundation for the projected \"Dictionary\".\n\nThe fieldwork, supported by a grant from the Office of Education, was conducted during 1965–70. About eighty fieldworkers (mostly graduate students, but also some professors) were trained in phonetic transcription and fieldwork techniques; they were then sent to 1,002 carefully selected communities across the country, chosen to reflect population density and to account for settlement history and immigration patterns. Each fieldworker was required to find \"informants,\" people willing to provide information about words, who were natives of their communities and who had lived there all, or almost all, their lives. The informants were then asked to answer the questions in the \"DARE\" questionnaire. In many communities more than one person contributed answers, so the total number of informants, 2,777, is much larger than the number of communities.\n\nWhile the fieldworkers were interviewing people across the country, Cassidy and others in Madison organized an extensive volunteer reading program. Printed materials of all kinds were selected and sent to volunteers, who read them and identified regional words in context. These resources included historical and contemporary newspapers, diaries, letters, histories, biographies, novels, and government documents. A number of important unpublished collections of dialect materials were also donated to \"DARE\" for use in documenting the \"Dictionary\" entries.\n\nAs the fieldworkers sent their questionnaires back to Madison, the approximately 2.3 million answers were keypunched, and software was written to create a question-by-question tabulation of responses as well as an index. In addition, programs were written that allowed the interactive creation of maps showing where the responses were found and the production of statistical tables itemizing the age, sex, race, education level, and community type for each person who gave a particular response. These tools allow \"DARE\" editors to apply regional labels to entries based on where words were collected in the fieldwork project and to use social labels describing individuals who use those words.\n\nIn 1974, Cassidy contracted with Harvard University Press to publish the Dictionary, and editing began in earnest in 1975. By 1980 it was clear that the idea of writing and publishing \"DARE\" as a single unit was impossible. Early estimates of the time it would take to write and revise entries had been overly optimistic. Following the tradition of other historical dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"DARE\" decided to publish each volume as it was ready. Because Cassidy had contracted to supply the text of the \"Dictionary\" on magnetic tape fully coded for typesetting, with camera-ready maps, a production department had to be set up. A system was devised for coding the many specifications for format, type size and style, and special characters. Procedures were worked out for the meticulous checking and correcting of text that would be required.\n\nSix print volumes of the \"DARE\" have been published by Harvard University’s Belknap Press. Volume I (1985) contains detailed introductory material, plus the letters A-C; Volume II (1991) covers the letters D-H; Volume III (1996) contains I-O; Volume IV (2002) includes P-Sk; and Volume V (2012) covers Sl-Z as well as a bibliography of nearly 13,000 sources cited in the five volumes. (Starting with Volume IV, digital libraries provided many valuable resources for expanding the historical coverage of the entries.) Volume VI (2013) includes more than 1,700 maps showing contrastive distributions of regional synonyms (such as \"hero, hoagie, grinder, sub, torpedo, poor boy,\" and \"Cuban\", all of which describe a sandwich in a long bun), as well as social distributions of regional terms (by age, sex, race, education, and community type). It also includes an index to the regional, usage, and etymological labels used in the five text volumes; the text of the \"DARE\" Questionnaire; the responses by all \"DARE\" informants to 430 of the questions asked in the original fieldwork. The digital version was launched in December 2013.\n\nThe five text volumes contain approximately 60,000 headwords and senses in 5,544 pages. There are nearly 3,000 computer-generated distribution maps included in the text, showing where the words were found during the fieldwork. The first volume also includes 156 pages of introductory matter, with an extensive introduction, an explanation of \"DARE\"’s regions and maps, an essay on how language changes, a guide to pronunciation, text of the questionnaire, and a list of informants (showing where and when they were interviewed, the community type, the person's age, sex, race, occupation, education, and whether the person made an audiotape).\n\nAn unusual feature of \"DARE\" is its inclusion of maps showing where words were found during the nationwide fieldwork. The maps are adjusted to reflect population density rather than geographic area, so they look a bit strange at first, but one learns to \"read\" them quickly. Whenever possible, the editors apply regional labels to the entries, based both on the maps from the field survey and on the written citations. (There are nearly forty regional labels listed in the front matter to Volume I, but the most frequently used in the text of the Dictionary tend to be from the \"South,\" \"South Midland,\" \"North,\" \"New England,\" \"Northeast,\" \"West,\" \"Gulf States,\" and \"southern Appalachians.\") Since language is not restricted by state or regional boundaries, the labels often include qualifying language, such as \"chiefly N[ew] Eng[land],\" or \"scattered, but most freq[uent] S[ou]th, S[outh] Midl[and].\" If the evidence from the fieldwork shows that a term is used disproportionately frequently by a particular social group (based on age, sex, race, education, or community type), a \"social\" label such as \"old-fash[ioned],\" \"chiefly among women,\" or \"esp[ecially] freq[uent] among Black speakers\" will also be applied.\n\nThe digital version is available by subscription (for libraries or individuals) and perpetual access (libraries). In addition to the Basic Search, which yields both headwords and variant forms, an Advanced Search function allows Boolean searches of full text, headwords, parts of speech, variant forms, definitions, etymologies, quotations, and regional or social labels. Quotations link directly to specific entries in the bibliography, where users can link to every other quotation from that particular source.\n\nThe digital \"DARE\" also offers features based on the original fieldwork survey:\n\n\nUsers who visit the digital website (http://daredictionary.com) without a subscription can browse the headwords through a \"Word Wheel,\" designed to replicate the serendipity of flipping through the pages of a print dictionary. (Within the Word Wheel are 100 entries highlighted in gold, which can be viewed without cost.) They can do a search for headwords from a state or region and see the results list, but they cannot click on the results and go to the full entries. They can also search the bibliography.\n\nIn addition to a history of the \"DARE\" project and its fieldwork, it includes introductory matter from the first print volume, an Index of virtually all the regional, social, usage, and etymological labels in the five volumes of text, a pronunciation guide and abbreviation list, the Questionnaire and List of Informants, and all the contrastive maps that are included in Volume VI of the print version of \"DARE\". There is an \"Introduction to Contrastive Maps,\" followed by about 1,400 geographic maps showing regional synonyms for various concepts, and more than 300 maps showing differences in usage by people according to their age, sex, race, education, and community type. An index follows, with all the words that are mapped, making it easy to start with a question about a specific term and go directly to a regional or social map.\n\nSome 2,777 people in 1,002 American communities served as \"DARE\" informants by answering all or part of the \"DARE\" questionnaire. Each person was a native of the selected community and had lived there all (or almost all) his or her life. The \"List of Informants\" in the front matter to Volume I of \"DARE\" includes the following details for each participant: informant code (a state abbreviation and a number, e.g., AL001 for the first informant interviewed in Alabama); community name; community type (urban, large city, small city, village, rural); age group (60 or older=old, 40–59=middle-aged, 18–39=young); year of birth; year of interview; education level (unknown; less than grade five; at least grade five; at least two years of high school; at least two years of college or vocational school); occupation; sex; race; and whether the informant made an audiotape recording. At the end of the \"List of Informants\" is a supplementary list of people who made audiotape recordings but who did not answer any parts of the questionnaire.\n\nFieldworkers were asked to weight their selection of informants toward older people in an effort to collect words for objects and practices that were going out of use. As a result, 66% of the \"DARE\" informants were over 60 when interviewed between 1965 and 1970; 24% were middle-aged; and 10% were young. Knowing the proportion of informants from each age group who gave a particular response and contrasting that to the proportion of informants from each age group who answered that particular question allows \"DARE\" editors to detect which words appear to be old-fashioned and which are coming into greater use.\n\nThe \"DARE\" questionnaire included a total of 1,847 questions; some that proved not to be fruitful in the early interviews were dropped, with others being added in their place. The questionnaire aimed to elicit responses about the everyday activities in Americans' lives. It includes 41 sections, starting with the neutral subjects of time and weather and moving to more personal subjects such as religion and health. Also included are the questions used in the early questionnaire only. The text of each question is included in the front matter to Volume I, and the quotations in the text of the \"Dictionary\" usually include full or abbreviated versions of each question; in cases where only the question number is cited, a reader can refer to the front matter. The categories are listed below:\n\n\n\nIn addition to responding to the \"DARE\" questionnaire, informants were invited to make audiotape recordings in which they both read a set passage and conversed informally about any topic of their choice. The use of the reading passage, a contrived story called \"Arthur the Rat\" that was designed to elicit all significant pronunciation variants in American English, allows comparison of sounds in the same context from places all across the country. The use of free conversation elicited the introduction of topics not covered in the questionnaire, resulting in a corpus of informal speech that can be contrasted to the formal style of the reading passage. It also provides an extremely valuable oral history of mid-20th-century America.\n\nIn all, 1,843 \"DARE\" informants agreed to make audiotape recordings. They are noted in the \"List of Informants\" in the front matter to Volume I of \"DARE\", in the last column, marked \"Audiotape.\"\n\nIn a project with the Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, and the University of Wisconsin Digital Collection Center, \"DARE\" has made its collection of readings of \"Arthur the Rat\" available for listeners. (This collaborative project was funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services.) These recordings have been posted at \"American Languages: Our Nation's Many Voices\" (http://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/AmerLangs). (Use the \"Guided Search\" option, enter \"Arthur the Rat\" as a phrase in \"Any Field,\" and enter a state name in the \"Place/Time\" field to hear examples from a particular state.) In addition, samples of informal conversation from the \"DARE\" audiotapes may be heard at \"American Languages: Our Nation’s Many Voices Online\" (http://csumc.wisc.edu/AmericanLanguages/). Additional excerpts will be added as time permits.\n\nIn order to determine how vocabulary use has changed since the original fieldwork was done, \"DARE\" staff in 2013 undertook a pilot survey in Wisconsin (\"2013–14 survey\"), preliminary to an anticipated new nationwide survey. The updated survey did not use face-to-face interviews with fieldworkers, but instead invited people to answer questions on a website developed by \"DARE\" and the University of Wisconsin Survey Center. The new questionnaire, modeled closely on the original, omitted questions for items that are obsolete, updated some terminology, and added questions for items that did not exist in the late 1960s. The survey targeted the original 22 Wisconsin communities, asking residents who had lived there all their lives to participate by answering as many of the 41 sections of the questionnaire as they chose. In addition, new communities, selected as representative of the state on the basis of the 2010 Census, were also targeted. In those communities, residents had to have lived there only fifteen years. Other Wisconsin residents were invited to participate, but their responses have been kept separate from those from \"official\" respondents. Results of the online survey may be seen at http://dare.wisc.edu/survey-results.\n\nBeginning in summer 2015, \"DARE\" staff members began publishing quarterly updates on the project website: http://dare.wisc.edu/words/quarterly-updates. These include both new and significantly revised entries. Harvard University Press will incorporate them in annual updates to the digital version.\n\n\"DARE\" has been supported financially by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, other private foundations, and many individuals. The \"DARE\" offices are located in the English Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the university has provided generous support, particularly in the form of funding for graduate assistants. (See http://dare.wisc.edu/about/funding.)\n\nOn 5 November 2017, Douglas Belkin, in the \"Wall Street Journal\", reported that the Dictionary of American Regional English “has rung the knell, sugared off, finished out the row,” meaning it is shutting down, closing shop.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8751", "title": "Dominatrix", "text": "Dominatrix\n\nA dominatrix (), plural \"dominatrixes\" or \"dominatrices\" (), is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (\"pro-domme\") as the term \"dominatrix\" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.\n\nThe term \"domme\" is a coined pseudo-French female variation of the slang \"dom\" (short for \"dominant\"). The use of \"domme\", \"dominatrix\", \"dom\", or \"dominant\" by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene. The term \"mistress\" or \"dominant mistress\" is sometimes also used. \"Female dominance\", \"female domination\" or femdom refer to BDSM activities in which the dominant partner is female.\n\nAs fetish culture is increasingly becoming more prevalent in Western media, depictions of dominatrices in film and television have become more common.\n\n\"Dominatrix\" is the feminine form of the Latin \"dominator\", a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in S&M, dates to 1967. It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger's pulp paperback \"The Bizarre Lovemakers\". The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title \"Dominatrix\" (with art by Eric Stanton) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film \"Dominatrix Without Mercy\".\n\nAlthough the term \"dominatrix\" was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella \"Venus in Furs\" by Austrian writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The term \"masochism\" was later derived from the author's name by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in the latter's 1886 forensic study \"Psychopathia Sexualis\".\n\nThe history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the Goddess Inanna (or Ishtar as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of \"Hymns to Inanna\" have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing Gods and men into submission to her. Archaeologist and historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna's rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals \"imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief.\"\n\nThe profession appears to have originated as a specialization within brothels, before becoming its own unique craft. As far back as the 1590s, flagellation within an erotic setting is recorded. The profession features in erotic prints of the era, such as the British Museum mezzotint \"The Cully Flaug'd\" (c. 1674–1702), and in accounts of forbidden books which record the flogging schools and the activities practised.\n\nWithin the 18th century, female \"Birch Disciplinarians\" advertised their services in a book masked as a collection of lectures or theatrical plays, entitled \"Fashionable Lectures\" (c. 1761). This included the names of 57 women, some actresses and courtesans, who catered to birch discipline fantasies, keeping a room with rods and cat o' nine tails, and charging their clients a Guinea for a \"lecture\".\n\nThe 19th century is characterised by what historian Anne O. Nomis characterises as the \"Golden Age of the Governess\". No fewer than twenty establishments were documented as having existed by the 1840s, supported entirely by flagellation practices and known as \"Houses of Discipline\" distinct from brothels. Amongst the well-known \"dominatrix governesses\" were Mrs Chalmers, Mrs Noyeau, the late Mrs Jones of Hertford Street and London Street, the late Mrs Theresa Berkley, Bessy Burgess of York Square and Mrs Pyree of Burton Cres. The most famous of these Governess \"female flagellants\" was Theresa Berkley, who operated her establishment on Charlotte Street in the central London district of Marylebone. She is recorded to have used implements such as whips, canes and birches, to chastise and punish her male clients, as well as the Berkley Horse, a specially designed flogging machine, and a pulley suspension system for lifting them off the floor. Such historical use of corporal punishment and suspension, in a setting of domination roleplay, connects very closely to the practices of modern-day professional dominatrices.\n\nThe \"bizarre style\" (as it came to be called) of leather catsuits, claws, tail whips, and latex rubber only came about in the 20th century, initially within commercial fetish photography, and taken up by dominatrices. Within the mid-20th century, dominatrices operated in a very discreet and underground manner, which has made them difficult to trace within the historical record. A few photographs still exist of the women who ran their domination businesses in London, New York, The Hague and Hamburg's Herbertstraße, predominantly in sepia and black-and-white photographs, and scans from magazine articles, copied and re-copied. Amongst these were Miss Doreen of London who was acquainted with John Sutcliffe of AtomAge fame, whose clients reportedly included Britain's top politicians and businessmen. In New York, the dominatrix Anne Laurence was known within the underground circle of acquaintances during the 1950s, with Monique Von Cleef arriving in the early 1960s, and hitting national headlines when her home was raided by police detectives on 22 December 1965. Von Cleef went on to set up her \"House of Pain\" in The Hague in the 1970s, which became one of the world capitals for dominatrices, reportedly with visiting lawyers, ambassadors, diplomats and politicians. Domenica Niehoff worked as a dominatrix in Hamburg and appeared on talk shows on German television from the 1970s onwards, campaigning for sex workers' rights. Mistress Raven, founder and manager of Pandora's Box, one of New York's best known BDSM studios, was featured in Nick Broomfield's 1996 documentary film \"Fetishes\".\n\nThe term \"dominatrix\" is mostly used to describe a female professional dominant (or \"pro-domme\") who is paid to engage in BDSM play with a submissive. An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a \"session\", and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a \"dungeon\". Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email or online chat. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.\n\nWomen who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms \"dominatrix\", \"mistress\", \"lady\", \"madame\", \"herrin\" or \"goddess\". In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.\n\nSome professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients. Popular requests from clients are for dungeon play including bondage, spanking and cock and ball torture, or for medical play using hoods, gas masks and urethral sounding. Verbal erotic humiliation is also popular. It is not unusual for a dominatrix to consider her profession different from that of an escort and not perform tie and tease or \"happy endings\". Typically professional dominatrices do not have sexual intercourse with their clients, do not become naked with their clients and do not allow their clients to touch them. The Canadian dominatrix Terri-Jean Bedford, who was one of three women who initiated an application in the Ontario Superior Court seeking invalidation of Canada's laws regarding brothels, sought to differentiate for clarity her occupation as a dominatrix rather than a prostitute to the media, due to frequent misunderstanding and conflation by the public of the two terms.\n\nWhile dominatrices come from many different backgrounds, it has been shown that a considerable number are well-educated. Research into US dominatrices published in 2012 indicated that 39% of the sample studied had received some sort of graduate training.\n\nA 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM subculture were female. A 1994 report indicated that around a quarter of the women who took part in BDSM subculture did so professionally. In a 1995 study of Internet discussion group messages, the preference for the dominant-initiator role was expressed by 11% of messages by heterosexual women, compared to 71% of messages by heterosexual men.\n\nProfessional dominatrices can be seen advertising their services online and in print publications which carry erotic services advertising, such as contact magazines and fetish magazines that specialise in female domination. The precise number of women actively offering professional domination services is unknown. Most professional dominatrices practice in large metropolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and London, with as many as 200 women working as dominatrices in Los Angeles.\n\nProfessional dominatrices may take pride or differentiation in their psychological insight into their clients' fetishes and desires, as well as their technical ability to perform complex BDSM practices, such as Japanese shibari and other forms of bondage, suspension, torture roleplay, and corporal punishment, and other such practices which require a high degree of knowledge and competency to safely oversee. From a sociological point of view, Danielle Lindemann has stated the \"embattled purity regime\" in which many Pro-Dommes emphasise their specialist knowledge and professional skills, while distancing themselves from economic criteria for success, in a way which is comparable to avant-garde artists.\n\nSome dominatrices practice financial domination, or findom, a fetish in which a submissive is aroused by sending money or gifts to a dominatrix at her instruction. In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive's finances or a \"blackmail\" scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.\n\nTo differentiate women who identify as a dominatrix but do not offer paid services, non-professional dominants are occasionally referred to as a \"lifestyle\" dominatrix or Mistress. The term \"lifestyle\" to signify BDSM is occasionally a contention topic in the BDSM community and that some dominatrices may dislike the term. Some professional dominatrices are also \"lifestyle\" dominatrices - i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships. However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more, the connotation of \"professional.\"\n\nThe dominatrix is a female archetype which operates on a symbolic mode of representation, associated with particular attire and props that are drawn on within popular culture to signify her role—as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman—linked to but distinct from images of sexual fetish. During the twentieth century, the imagery associated with dominatrices was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer Charles Guyette, the publisher and film director Irving Klaw, and the illustrators Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew who drew for the fetish magazine Exotique.\n\nOne of the ubiquitous garments associated with the dominatrix is the catsuit. Historically, the black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the \"AtomAge\" magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer John Sutcliffe. The spill-over into mainstream culture, occurred with catsuits being worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like \"The Avengers\", and in the comic super-heroines such as Catwoman, in which the catsuit represented the independent woman capable of \"kick-ass\" moves and antics, enabling complete freedom of movement. On another level, the one-piece catsuit accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman's body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. \"You can look but you can't touch\" is the mechanism of this operation, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as \"tease and denial\".\n\nOther common signifying footwear of the dominatrix are thigh-high boots in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called kinky boots, along with the very high stiletto heel. Fishnet stockings, seamed hosiery, and stockings and garter belts (suspenders) are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.\n\nTight, leather corsets are another staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long opera gloves or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. Neck corsets may also be worn. \n\nDominatrices often wear clothing made from fetish fashion materials. Examples include PVC clothing, latex clothing and garments drawn from the leather subculture. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from Nazi chic, particularly the black SS officer's uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a uniform fetish.\n\nThe body language of the dominatrix is frequently represented by the use of strong, dominant body-language which is comparable to the dominant posturing in the animal world. The props she may brandish will strongly signify her role as dominatrix, such as bearing a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of Bruno Zach in the early 20th century, in conventional representation. \n\nPracticing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional signifiers of the role, or adapt them to create their own individual style, where there exists a potential pull—between meeting conventional expectations, and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess, the KGB secret agent, to their own ends.\n\n\n\n"}

Authorities disagree whether the word is used more properly for the seeds of the colocynth, those of a particular large-seeded variety of the watermelon, or generically for those of \"any\" cucurbitaceous plant. The characteristics and uses of all these seeds are broadly similar. Major egusi-growing nations include Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon.\n\nEgusi soup is a kind of soup thickened with the ground seeds and popular in West Africa, with considerable local variation. Besides the seeds, water, and oil, egusi soup typically contains leaf vegetables, other vegetables, seasonings, and meat. Leaf vegetables typically used for egusi soup include bitterleaf, pumpkin leaf, celosia and spinach. Typical other vegetables include tomatoes and okra. Typical seasonings include chili peppers, onions, and locust beans. Also commonly used are beef, goat, fish, shrimps, or crayfish.\n\nIn Nigeria, egusi is very popular among the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria, the Ibibio people and the Efik people (Calabar people) of southern Nigeria, the Hausa of northern Nigeria and the Edo people, Esan people, and Etsakọ people of the south-west of Nigeria. Yoruba people in general and quite notably the people of Ọṣun State – especially the Ijesha people – eat \"Iyan and Egusi\", a pounded yam and egusi soup.\n\nIn Ghana, egusi is also called akatoa of agushi, and as in Nigeria is used for soup and stew, and most popularly in palaver sauce.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Canadian government funded a project intended to develop a machine to help Cameroonians shell egusi seeds. A machine has been developed in Nigeria to shell egusi.\n\n"}

The concept of \"fadenya\" has been stretched and is often used to describe the political and social dynamism of the Mande world. \"Fadenya\" is often discussed in contrast to \"badenya\", or mother-childness.\n\n\"Fadenya\" originally described the conflicts between half-siblings with the same father, but different mothers. In the traditionally polygamous Mande world, half-brothers would often compete for control of their father’s lineage and claim to his wealth and land. In order to do so, these brothers would have to set out on their own, leaving the safety of their community, in order to achieve recognition independently and claim the lineage of their father or to “[overcome] paternal and ancestral reputations”.\n\nThis setting out to make a name for oneself was particularly common among younger brothers, who were less likely to receive anything from their father and therefore more motivated to overhaul the system through their own actions. These younger brothers have more to gain and much less to lose if they leave the family to seek their own fortunes.\n\nAlthough the term originally refers specifically to the conflict between brothers, the concept of \"fadenya\" is much larger than intra-familial conflict. In addition to its meaning of “father-childness\", \"fadenya\" is also used as a word for conflict in general. \"Fadenya\" can also extend beyond immediate family and affect an entire clan.\n\n\"Fadenya\" is seen as the source of political and social change in the Mande world, for upheaval of the existing social order occurs due to the tension of \"fadenya\". \"Fadenya\" is associated with “centrifugal forces of social disequilibrium: envy, jealousy, competition, self-promotion”. \"Fadenya\" is the catalyst and root of all sociopolitical changes in the Mande world, “the conceptual vehicle of dymanism in Mande society”, and thus carries with it all of those connotations.\n\n\"Fadenya\" itself requires a departure from society, whether literal or not. In many traditional tales, one leaves one’s family and the safety it provides in order to make one's own name and fortune. \"Fadenya\" does not always imply a physical journey, however. One may also figuratively leave one's family and village by deviating in opinion or values.\n\nBecause \"fadenya\" describes paternal ties, and almost always describes tensions between men, \"fadenya\" is often considered a decidedly masculine force. This creates an interesting cultural phenomenon, in which men are seen as the forces of change and advancement or decline. The masculinization of change creates interesting gender roles within the Mande world.\n\nBecause it is defined as rivalry and tension between half-siblings, \"fadenya\" may seem like an intrinsically destructive force. However, in reality, it is often tremendously positive. \"Fadenya\" is the means through which “the innovative actions of the young hero can lead to a modification of norms within the tradition of a community.” Through a positive form of \"fadenya\", one can improve society through the evolution and growth of customs. It is only through innovation that a society can survive and thrive, and positive \"fadenya\" provides the impetus for such change.\n\nThis positive \"fadenya\" is “predicated on commitment to society’s traditions and social mores and describes how such traditions and mores are reproduced or ‘’reinvented’’ to meet the demands of, and even develop and improve, modern social life”. The emphasis in positive \"fadenya\" is a respect for the existing elements of society and a recognition that traditions should be “reinvented” as opposed to essentially changed. For \"fadenya\" to be positive, it must place value in the current society and \"badenya\", and change elements only to innovate, not to destroy or severely alter.\n\nAs seen in the figure, positive \"fadenya\" necessitates reintegration. One must return from one's experience of the outside world or of other views, and bring this new knowledge to the community, using it to innovate and adapt existing customs.\n\nIn contrast to positive \"fadenya\", negative \"fadenya\" harms society. In instances of negative \"fadenya\", one does not return with positive methods of integrating and innovating. A “dissociate breakdown into wildness” occurs, leaving family members shamed and society worse off.\n\nOne may use cruel force to impose different and self-serving values, rejecting years of societal progress and disrespecting the innovations and work of those who came before. That is, of course, if one returns at all. Negative \"fadenya\" can also signal an individual's complete break from society, in which one leaves and never returns with anything to benefit one's own family and people. This also brings about great shame.\n\n\"Badenya\" refers to “mother-childness” or the relationship between siblings of the same mother within the polygamous structure. Because these siblings often share a closer bond, and do not compete among themselves as half siblings with the same father, \"badenya\" is a source of safety and security. \"Badenya\" is often what saves one from the tensions and competitiveness of \"fadenya\". One can always rely on a full sibling because of \"badenya\".\n\nWhen expanded, \"badenya\" is a uniting, community-oriented force; it promotes stasis and security. Just as \"badenya\" is used to mean mother-childness or sibling-hood, it is also used to mean harmony. It “connotes devotion to home, family and tradition” and “conveys a sense of community, social solidarity, and shared intimacy”. Within the community, \"badenya\" represents the “centripetal forces of society: submission to authority, stability, cooperation”. The “strong forces in Mande society [which] emphasize group norms, decisions and success over those of the individual…are reflected in the term \"badenya\".\n\n\"Badenya\" is the reason which communities stay together despite \"fadenya\"; it is the strong link that acts against the weaker ones of \"fadenya\". \"Badenya\" acts as the status quo to the change represented by \"fadenya\" and “carries with it a strong moral valence; there is a sense of an essential ‘goodness’ and ‘rightness’ to the familial collectivity badenya implies\".\n\n\"Fadenya\" is the “ ‘paternal’ corollary to the ‘maternal’ mores of \"badenya\"”. Just as \"fadenya\" is masculinized, \"badenya\" is feminized, as it represents maternal connection. It is also worth noting that it is through \"badenya\" that women often display their influence in society, for they have the power to protect their children from the forces of \"fadenya\". By placing security and stability into the realm of women, \"badenya\" emphasizes their important role in society.\n\nIt is important to note that in the Mande world, both \"badenya\" and \"fadenya\" are integral to the survival of a community. While “Mande peoples focus much socialization activity on the fostering of fadenya behavior, recognizing that it is only through this force of change that their community will be able to survive trials and a changing world; they also recognize that without the stability badenya provides, their societies would be plunged into constant chaos.\" The tension between \"badenya\" and \"fadenya\" represents the tensions between the group and the individual. This tension is not dichotomous, but rather an “intersection of two axes”.\n\nThe story of Sunjata, the founder of the Mali Empire, is a tremendously important aspect of Mande culture and provides not only historical information, but cultural information as well. Traditionally told through Griots, Sunjata contains many examples of \"fadenya\", \"badenya\", and their interactions.\n\nThe story, as told by Bamba Suso, begins with the birth of Sunjata to the King, Fata Kung Makhang, and his mother, Sukulung. Sunjata is the first son born to his father, and thus should inherit his kingdom, but when messengers bring the news of Sunjata’s birth to the King, he had already received notice of the birth of a second son, and wrongfully does not acknowledge Sunjata as his first born.\n\nNonetheless, it has been foretold that Sunjata will one day inherit his father’s kingdom and become a great leader. When his father eventually dies, his half-brothers seek to destroy him to eliminate any threat of competition. At this point, Sunjata decides to leave his people, and sojourns to find his destiny. Through a series of events in which his mother and sister provide tremendous help, Sunjata is able to become King and rule.\n\nExamples of \"fadenya\" are numerous in the story of Sunjata: from the way he is exiled and later comes to rule the Mande kingdom to his relationship with his mother. From the beginning of the tale, strong \"fadenya\" is established between Sunjata and his half-brothers, one of whom has stolen his place as the first born. This \"fadenya\" returns later, after the death of his father, when “his brothers got together,/ and then they went to a sorcerer/ and told him, ‘Attack [Sunjata] with a korte till he dies”. *** In response to this \"fadenya\", Sunjata leaves his home to set out to make a destiny of his own, a classic element of \"fadenya\".\n\nThrough Sunjata’s journey, we see many examples of \"badenya\". Even as a child, when he could not walk, it is his mother who comes to his aid when Sunjata proclaims “Call my mother:/ when a child has fallen down, it is his mother who picks him up” reflecting the deeply maternal and supportive essence of \"badenya\" ***. Later, when Sunjata is plotting to overthrow the rival who has stolen his homelands, it is Sunjata's sister who stands by his side and charms the tyrant into revealing his secrets. The fact that it is Sunjata's sister who plays such a significant role in his rise to power is reflective of the strong relationship between full siblings as described by \"badenya\".\n\nTwentieth-century Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté's \"Kouta trilogy\" is often interpreted as demonstrating the conflict between \"fadenya\" and \"badenya\". In Le lieutenant de Kouta, for example, the titular lieutenant struggles against the tyranny of his traditional animist elder brother, while seeking to preserve other traditions in the face of a youth-driven independence movement. In Le coiffeur de Kouta (\"The Barber of Kouta\"), the trilogy's second novel, the elders of the village similarly cite tradition in plotting against the village's young people, only to later realize that they must step aside so that the village can evolve and grow.\n"}
{"id": "2381268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2381268", "title": "Flying Spaghetti Monster", "text": "Flying Spaghetti Monster\n\nThe Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is the deity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism. Pastafarianism (a portmanteau of \"pasta\" and \"Rastafarianism\") is a social movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of intelligent design and creationism in public schools. According to adherents, Pastafarianism is a \"real, legitimate religion, as much as any other\". In New Zealand, Pastafarian representatives are authorized to officiate weddings. However, in the United States, a federal judge has ruled that the \"Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\" is not a real religion. In August 2018 the Dutch Council of State also ruled that Pastafarianism is not a religion.\n\nThe \"Flying Spaghetti Monster\" was first described in a satirical open letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State Board of Education decision to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes. In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for \"Flying Spaghetti Monsterism\", alongside intelligent design and evolution. After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an Internet phenomenon and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.\n\nPastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented both on Henderson's \"Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\" website, where he is described as \"prophet\", and in \"The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", written by Henderson in 2006. The central belief is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. Pirates are revered as the original Pastafarians. Henderson asserts that a decline in the number of pirates over the years is the cause of global warming. The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas about the Flying Spaghetti Monster and crafts representing images of it.\n\nBecause of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.\n\nIn January 2005, Bobby Henderson, then a 24-year-old Oregon State University physics graduate, sent an open letter regarding the Flying Spaghetti Monster to the Kansas State Board of Education. In that letter, Henderson satirized creationism by professing his belief that whenever a scientist carbon-dates an object, a supernatural creator that closely resembles spaghetti with meatballs is there \"changing the results with His Noodly Appendage\". Henderson argued that his beliefs were just as valid as intelligent design, and called for equal time in science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution. The letter was sent prior to the Kansas evolution hearings as an argument against the teaching of intelligent design in biology classes. Henderson, describing himself as a \"concerned citizen\" representing more than ten million others, argued that intelligent design and his belief that \"the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster\" were equally valid. In his letter, he noted,\n\nAccording to Henderson, since the intelligent design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster. Henderson explained, \"I don't have a problem with religion. What I have a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor.\"\n\nIn May 2005, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest. Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon. Henderson published the responses he then received from board members. Three board members, all of whom opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment \"It is a serious offense to mock God\". Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received. Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000, of which he has said that \"about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have said I am going to hell\". During that time, his site garnered tens of millions of hits.\n\nAs word of Henderson's challenge to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with bloggers as well as humor and Internet culture websites. The Flying Spaghetti Monster was featured on websites such as Boing Boing, Something Awful, Uncyclopedia, and Fark.com. Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged. As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Flying Spaghetti Monster became a symbol for the case against intelligent design in public education. The open letter was printed in several major newspapers, including \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"Chicago Sun-Times\", and received worldwide press attention. Henderson himself was surprised by its success, stating that he \"wrote the letter for [his] own amusement as much as anything\".\n\nIn August 2005, in response to a challenge from a reader, Boing Boing announced a $250,000 prize—later raised to $1,000,000—of \"Intelligently Designed currency\" payable to any individual who could produce empirical evidence proving that Jesus is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It was modeled as a parody of a similar challenge issued by young-earth creationist Kent Hovind.\n\nAccording to Henderson, newspaper articles on the Flying Spaghetti Monster attracted the attention of book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write \"The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\".\n\nIn November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to allow criticisms of evolution, including language about intelligent design, as part of testing standards. On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. This was the fifth time in eight years that the board had rewritten the standards on evolution.\nAlthough Henderson has stated that \"the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma\", some general beliefs are held by Pastafarians. Henderson proposed many Pastafarian tenets in reaction to common arguments by proponents of intelligent design. These \"canonical beliefs\" are presented by Henderson in his letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, \"The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", and on Henderson's web site, where he is described as a \"prophet\". They tend to satirize creationism.\n\nThe central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe \"after drinking heavily\". According to these beliefs, the Monster's intoxication was the cause for a flawed Earth. Furthermore, according to Pastafarianism, all evidence for evolution was planted by the Flying Spaghetti Monster in an effort to test the faith of Pastafarians—parodying certain biblical literalists. When scientific measurements such as radiocarbon dating are taken, the Flying Spaghetti Monster \"is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage\".\n\nThe Pastafarian conception of Heaven includes a beer volcano and a stripper (or sometimes prostitute) factory. The Pastafarian Hell is similar, except that the beer is stale and the strippers have sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAccording to Pastafarian beliefs, pirates are \"absolute divine beings\" and the original Pastafarians. Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that the concept of pirates as \"thieves and outcasts\" is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages and by Hare Krishnas. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were \"peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will\" who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates are in no way similar to \"the fun-loving buccaneers from history\". In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the Bermuda Triangle. Pastafarians are among those who celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day on September 19.\n\nThe inclusion of pirates in Pastafarianism was part of Henderson's original letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, in an effort to illustrate that correlation does not imply causation. Henderson presented the argument that \"global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s\". A deliberately misleading graph accompanying the letter (with numbers humorously disordered on the \"x\"-axis) shows that as the number of pirates decreased, global temperatures increased. This parodies the suggestion from some religious groups that the high numbers of disasters, famines, and wars in the world is due to the lack of respect and worship toward their deity. In 2008, Henderson interpreted the growing pirate activities at the Gulf of Aden as additional support, pointing out that Somalia has \"the highest number of pirates \"and\" the lowest carbon emissions of any country\".\nPastafarian beliefs extend into lighthearted religious ceremony. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day. Prayers are concluded with a final declaration of affirmation, \"R'amen\" (or \"rAmen\"); the term is a parodic portmanteau of the terms \"Amen\" and \"Ramen\", referring to instant noodles and to the \"noodly appendages\" of their deity.\n\nAround the time of Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa, Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named \"Holiday\". Holiday does not take place on \"a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season, itself\". According to Henderson, as Pastafarians \"reject dogma and formalism\", there are no specific requirements for Holiday. Pastafarians celebrate Holiday in any manner they please. Pastafarians also celebrate \"Pastover\" as a parody of Passover, and \"Ramendan\" as a parody of Ramadan.\n\nPastafarians interpret the increasing usage of \"Happy Holidays\", rather than more traditional greetings (such as \"Merry Christmas\"), as support for Pastafarianism. In December 2005, George W. Bush's White House Christmas greeting cards wished people a happy \"holiday season\", leading Henderson to write the President a note of thanks, including a \"fish\" emblem depicting the Flying Spaghetti Monster for his limousine or plane. Henderson also thanked Walmart for its use of the phrase.\n\nIn December 2005 Bobby Henderson received a reported US$80,000 advance from Villard to write \"The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\". Henderson said he planned to use proceeds from the book to build a pirate ship, with which he would spread the Pastafarian religion. The book was released on March 28, 2006, and elaborates on Pastafarian beliefs established in the open letter. Henderson employs satire to present perceived flaws with evolutionary biology and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective. The gospel urges readers to try Pastafarianism for thirty days, saying, \"If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back\". Henderson states on his website that more than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold.\n\n\"Scientific American\" described the gospel as \"an elaborate spoof on Intelligent Design\" and \"very funny\". In 2006, it was nominated for the Quill Award in Humor, but was not selected as the winner. Wayne Allen Brenner of \"The Austin Chronicle\" characterized the book as \"a necessary bit of comic relief in the overly serious battle between science and superstition\". Simon Singh of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that the gospel \"might be slightly repetitive...but overall it is a brilliant, provocative, witty and important gem of a book\".\n\nCasey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which advocates intelligent design, labeled the gospel \"a mockery of the Christian New Testament\".\n\nIn September 2005, before Henderson had received an advance to write the \"Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", a Pastafarian member of the Venganza forums known as Solipsy, announced the beginning of a project to collect texts from fellow Pastafarians to compile into the \"Loose Canon, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", essentially analogous to the Bible. The book was completed in 2010 and was made available for download.\n\nSome excerpts from \"The Loose Canon\" include:\n\nThe Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster now consists of thousands of followers, primarily concentrated on college campuses in North America and Europe. According to the Associated Press, Henderson's website has become \"a kind of cyber-watercooler for opponents of intelligent design\". On it, visitors track meetings of pirate-clad Pastafarians, sell trinkets and bumper stickers, and sample photographs that show \"visions\" of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nIn August 2005, the Swedish concept designer Niklas Jansson created an adaptation of Michelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam\", superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God. This became and remains the Flying Spaghetti Monster's de facto brand image. The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called \"The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant\" in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called \"Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog\", performed in December 2008. This communal activity attracted the attention of three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\nIn November 2007, four talks about the Flying Spaghetti Monster were delivered at the American Academy of Religion's annual meeting in San Diego. The talks, with titles such as \"Holy Pasta and Authentic Sauce: The Flying Spaghetti Monster's Messy Implications for Theorizing Religion\", examined the elements necessary for a group to constitute a religion. Speakers inquired whether \"an anti-religion like Flying Spaghetti Monsterism <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> actually a religion\". The talks were based on the paper, \"Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody\", published in the GOLEM Journal of Religion and Monsters. The panel garnered an audience of one hundred of the more than 9,000 conference attendees, and conference organizers received critical e-mails from Christians offended by it.\n\nSince October 2008, the local chapter of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has sponsored an annual convention called Skepticon on the campus of Missouri State University. Atheists and skeptics give speeches on various topics, and a debate with Christian experts is held. Organizers tout the event as the \"largest gathering of atheists in the Midwest\".\n\nThe Moldovan-born poet, fiction writer, and culturologist Igor Ursenco entitled his 2012 poetry book \"The Flying Spaghetti Monster (thriller poems)\".\n\nOn the nonprofit microfinancing site, Kiva, the Flying Spaghetti Monster group is in an ongoing competition to top all other \"religious congregations\" in the number of loans issued via their team. The group's motto is \"Thou shalt share, that none may seek without funding\", an allusion to the Loose Canon which states \"Thou shalt share, that none may seek without finding.\" it reported to have funded US$4,002,350 in loans.\n\n\"Bathyphysa conifera\", a siphonophore, has been called \"Flying Spaghetti Monster\" in reference to the FSM.\n\nOwing to its popularity and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since the existence of the invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, \"The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up to us to disprove it.\" Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of \"The Journal of Religion and Theater\", the Flying Spaghetti Monster is \"ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation\", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books \"The God Delusion\" and \"The Atheist Delusion\".\n\nIn December 2007 the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was credited with spearheading successful efforts in Polk County, Florida, to dissuade the Polk County School Board from adopting new science standards on evolution. The issue was raised after five of the seven board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians e-mailed members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal instruction time for the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, \"they've made us the laughing stock of the world\". Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed opposition to intelligent design. In response to hopes for a new \"applied science\" campus at the University of South Florida in Lakeland, university vice president Marshall Goodman expressed surprise, stating, \"<nowiki>[intelligent design is]</nowiki> not science. You can't even call it pseudo-science.\" While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue. She and the other board members expressed a desire to return to the day-to-day work of running the school district.\n\nNational branches of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster have been striving in many countries to have FSMism become an officially (legally) recognized religion, with varying degrees of success. In New Zealand, Pastafarian representatives have been authorized as marriage celebrants, however members of other movements considered to be \"alternative philosophies\" rather than religions are also recognized as celebrants under New Zealand law.\n\nA federal court in the US state of Nebraska ruled that Flying Spaghetti Monster is a satirical parody religion, rather than an actual religion, and as a result, Pastafarians are not entitled to religious accommodation under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act:\n\n\"This is not a question of theology\", the ruling reads in part. \"The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making a pointed political statement. To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a 'religious exercise' on any other work of fiction.\"\n\nPastafarians have used their claimed faith as a test case to argue for freedom of religion, and to oppose government discrimination against people who do not follow a recognized religion.\n\nThe Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster operates an ordination mill on their website which enables officiates in jurisdictions where credentials are needed to officiate weddings. Pastafarians say that separation of church and state precludes the government from arbitrarily labelling one denomination religiously valid but another an ordination mill. In November 2014, Rodney Michael Rogers and Minneapolis-based Atheists for Human Rights sued Washington County, Minnesota under the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause and the First Amendment free speech clause, with their attorney claiming discrimination against atheists: \"When the statute clearly permits recognition of a marriage celebrant whose religious credentials consist of nothing more than a $20 'ordination' obtained from the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster... the requirement is absolutely meaningless in terms of ensuring the qualifications of a marriage celebrant.\" A few days prior to a hearing on the matter, Washington County changed its policy to allow Rogers his ability to officiate weddings. This action was done in an effort to deny the court jurisdiction on the underlying claim. On May 13, 2015 the Federal Court held that the issue had become moot and dismissed the case. The first legally-recognized Pastafarian wedding occurred in New Zealand on April 16, 2016.\n\nIn March 2007, Bryan Killian, a high school student in Buncombe County, North Carolina, was suspended for wearing \"pirate regalia\" which he said was part of his Pastafarian faith. Killian protested the suspension, saying it violated his First Amendment rights to religious freedom and freedom of expression. \"If this is what I believe in, no matter how stupid it might sound, I should be able to express myself however I want to\", he said.\nIn March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were permitted to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse lawn, and proceeded to do so. The display gained national interest on blogs and online news sites and was even covered by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. It was later removed from the premises, along with all the other long-term statues, as a result of the controversy over the statue. In December 2011, Pastafarianism was one of the multiple denominations given equal access to placing holiday displays on the Loudoun County courthouse lawn, in Leesburg, Virginia.\n\nIn 2012, Tracy McPherson of the Pennsylvanian Pastafarians petitioned the Chester County, Pennsylvania Commissioners to allow representation of the FSM at the county courthouse, equally with a Jewish menorah and a Christian nativity scene. One commissioner stated that either all religions should be allowed or no religion should be represented, but without support from the other commissioners the motion was rejected. Another commissioner stated that this petition garnered more attention than any he had seen before.\n\nOn September 21, 2012, Pastafarian Giorgos Loizos was arrested in Greece on charges of malicious blasphemy and offense of religion for the creation of a satirical Facebook page called \"Elder Pastitsios\", based on a well-known deceased Greek Orthodox monk, Elder Paisios, where his name and face were substituted with pastitsio – a local pasta and béchamel sauce dish. The case, which started as a Facebook flame, reached the Greek Parliament and created a strong political reaction to the arrest.\n\nIn August 2013, Christian Orthodox religious activists from an unregistered group known as \"God's Will\" attacked a peaceful rally that Russian Pastafarians had organized. Activists as well as police knocked some rally participants to the ground. Police arrested and charged eight of the Pastafarians with attempting to hold an unsanctioned rally.One of the Pastafarians later complained that they were arrested \"just for walking\".\n\nIn February 2014, union officials at London South Bank University forbade an atheist group to display posters of the Flying Spaghetti Monster at a student orientation conference and later banned the group from the conference, leading to complaints about interference with free speech. The Students' Union subsequently apologized.\n\nIn November 2014, the Church of the FSM obtained city signage in Templin, Germany, announcing the time of Friday's weekly \"Nudelmesse\" (\"pasta mass\"), alongside signage for various Catholic and Protestant Sunday services.\n\nIn July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won the legal right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta strainer on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.\n\nOn August 9, 2011 the chairman of the church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Germany, Rüdiger Weida, obtained a driver's license with a picture of him wearing a pirate bandana. In contrast to the Austrian officials in the case of Niko Alm the German officials allowed the headgear as a religious exception.\n\nSome anti-clerical protesters wore colanders to Piazza XXIV Maggio square in Milan, Italy, on June 2, 2012, in mock obedience to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nIn February 2013, a Pastafarian was denied the right to wear a spaghetti strainer on his head for his driver's license photo by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, which stated that a pasta strainer was not on a list of approved religious headwear.\n\nIn March 2013 a Belgian's identity photos were refused by the local and national administrations because he wore a pasta strainer on his head.\n\nThe Czech Republic recognised this as religious headgear in 2013. In July that year, a member of the Czech Pirate Party from Brno was given permission to wear a pasta strainer on his head for the photograph on his official Czech Republic ID card. The Brno City Hall spokesman explained, \"The application complies with the laws...where headgear for religious or medical reasons is permitted if it doesn't hide the face\".\n\nIn August 2013 Eddie Castillo, a student at Texas Tech University, got approval to wear a pasta strainer on his head in his driver's license photo. He said, \"You might think this is some sort of a gag or prank by a college student, but thousands, including myself, see it as a political and religious milestone for all atheists everywhere.\"\n\nIn January 2014 a member of the Pomfret, New York Town Council wore a colander while taking the oath of office.\n\nIn June 2014 a New Zealand man obtained a driver's license with a photograph of himself wearing a blue spaghetti strainer on his head. This was granted under a law allowing the wearing of religious headgear in official photos.\n\nIn November 2014 former porn star Asia Carrera obtained an identity photo with the traditional Pastafarian headgear from a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Hurricane, Utah. The director of Utah's Driver License Division says that about a dozen Pastafarians have had their state driver's license photos taken with a similar pasta strainer over the years.\n\nIn November 2015 Massachusetts resident Lindsay Miller was allowed to wear a colander on her head in her driver's license photo after she cited her religious beliefs. Miller (who resides in Lowell) said on Friday, November 13 that she \"absolutely loves the history and the story\" of Pastafarians, whose website says has existed in secrecy for hundreds of years and entered the mainstream in 2005. Ms. Miller was represented in her quest by The American Humanist Association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center.\n\nIn January 2016 Russian Pastafarian Andrew Filin got a driver's license with his photo in a colander.\n\nIn 2016 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Pastafarian and law student Mienke de Wilde petitioned the courts to be allowed to wear a colander in her driver's license photo. She lost the petition, both at first instance and on appeal.\n\nA man's Irish driving licence photograph including a colander was rejected by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in 2013. In 2016, an Equality Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission reviewed the RSA's decision under the Equal Rights Acts and upheld it, on the basis that the complaint did \"not come within the definition of religion and/or religious belief\".\n\nWith regard to Bobby Henderson's 2005 open letter, according to Justin Pope of the \"Associated Press\": \n\nJustin Pope praised the Flying Spaghetti Monster as \"a clever and effective argument\". Simon Singh of the \"Daily Telegraph\" described the Flying Spaghetti Monster as \"a masterstroke, which underlined the absurdity of Intelligent Design\", and applauded Henderson for \"galvanis[ing] a defence of science and rationality\". Sarah Boxer of the \"New York Times\" said that Henderson \"has wit on his side\". In addition, the Flying Spaghetti Monster was mentioned in an article footnote of the \"Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review\" as an example of evolution \"enter[ing] the fray in popular culture\", which the author deemed necessary for evolution to prevail over intelligent design. The abstract of the paper, \"Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody\", describes the Flying Spaghetti Monster as \"a potent example of how monstrous humor can be used as a popular tool of carnivalesque subversion\". Its author praised Pastafarianism for its \"epistemological humility\". Moreover, Henderson's website contains numerous endorsements from the scientific community. As Jack Schofield of \"The Guardian\" noted, \"The joke, of course, is that it's arguably more rational than Intelligent Design.\"\n\nCasey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which promotes intelligent design, contested this, saying, \"the problem for their logic is that ID is not an arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature.\" Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in \"The Boston Globe\" that intelligent design \"isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science.\" This view of science, however, was rejected by the United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said \"Ironically enough, [Pastafarians], in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!\" \n\n\n"}

The book's narrator shares the same name as Powers, with the book referencing events and books in the author's life while mentioning other events that may or may not be based upon Powers' life.\n\nThe main narrative tells the story of Powers' return to his \"alma mater\" – referred to in the novel as simply \"U.\", but clearly based on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the school Powers attended and teaches at as a professor – after he has ended a long and torrid relationship with a loving but volatile woman, referred to as \"C.\" Powers is an in-house author for the university, and lives for free for one year. He finds himself unable to write any more books, and spends the first portion of the novel attempting to write, but never getting past the first line.\n\nPowers then meets a computer scientist named Philip Lentz. Intrigued by Lentz's overbearing personality and unorthodox theories, Powers eventually agrees to participate in an experiment involving artificial intelligence. Lentz bets his fellow scientists that he can build a computer that can produce an analysis of a literary text that is indistinguishable from one produced by a human. It is Powers' task to \"teach\" the machine. After going through several unsuccessful versions, Powers and Lentz produce a computer model (dubbed \"Helen\") that is able to communicate like a human. It is not clear to the reader or to Powers whether she is simulating human thought, or whether she is actually experiencing it. Powers tutors the computer, first by reading it canonical works of literature, then current events, and eventually telling it the story of his own life, in the process developing a complicated relationship with the machine.\n\nThe novel also consists of extensive flashbacks to Powers' relationship with C., from their first meeting at U., to their bohemian life in Boston, to their move to C.'s family's town in the Netherlands.\n\nThe novel culminates with Helen being unable to bear the realities of the world, and \"leaving\" Powers. She asks Powers to \"see everything\" for her, and subsequently shuts herself down. Her exit from the world forces Powers to experience a rebirth. In addition, Powers realizes that \"he\" was Lentz's experiment: would he or wouldn't he be able to teach a computer? Through the transformation he experiences, he is suddenly able to interact with the world, and he can write again.\n\n\nReception for the book has been mostly positive, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" praising the novel. The New York Times wrote that \"Galatea 2.2\" was \"complex\" and a \"heady and provocative experiment\". The Washington Times expressed that the book \"may not be the easiest to access, but will prove as enchanting as any.\"\n\n\n\n"}

With Samuil Micu he composed the first written grammar of the Romanian language: \"Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae\" (\"The elements of the Daco-Roman or Wallachian language\") (Vienna, 1780), in which he demonstrated the Latin origins of the Romanian language.\n\nBorn in Râciu de Câmpie, now Mureș County, he studied at Târgu-Mureș, Cluj, Bistrița, Blaj, Vienna and Rome (in the last two cities together with Samuil Micu, nephew of Bishop Inocențiu Micu-Klein).\n\nHe turned out to be a polyglot, thoroughly mastering Greek, Latin, Hungarian, German, Italian and French. His knowledge and culture allowed him to occupy the function of librarian of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in Rome, having permission to research any type of document. In the Papal States, and later in Hungary and in Vienna (the capital of the Habsburg domains), he carried out research work in various libraries, copying and transcribing exactly any reference to the history of the Romanians.\n\nȘincai assiduously worked to educate commoners, dedicating himself to a career in teaching, and contributing to the establishment of an impressive number of Greek-Catholic parochial schools (in all, over 300). In 1784 he was named general director of Romanian Uniate schools in all of Transylvania.\n\nHe translated and expanded the following basic textbooks for educational purposes: \"Abecedarul\" (\"The Book of ABCs\"), \"Gramatica\" (\"Grammar\"), \"Aritmetica\" (\"Arithmetic\") and \"Catehismul\" (\"The Catechism\"), adapting or creating the terminology necessary for pupils to understand these. He proved himself to be a remarkable translator, rendering the Bible into Romanian (in 1789, under the name of \"The Blaj Bible\").\n\nIn 1794 Șincai came into direct conflict with Bishop Ioan Bob; he was thrown into the harsh prison of Aiud, being followed and persecuted by the Habsburg authorities after his release in 1796.\n\nIn 1811 Șincai published a work of history, written in the form of annals and amply titled: \"Hronica românilor și a mai multor neamuri în cât au fost ele amestecate cu românii, cât lucrurile, întâmplările și faptele unora față de ale altora nu se pot scrie pre înțeles, din mai multe mii de autori, în cursul a treizeci și patru de ani culese\" (\"The chronicle of the Romanians and of other peoples insofar as they were mixed with the Romanians, as the things, events and facts of the one regarding the other cannot be written as if everyone understands them, from several thousand authors, gathered over the course of thirty-four years\").\n\nȘincai died at Szinye, near Košice in present-day Slovakia.\n\n"}
{"id": "708208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=708208", "title": "Globalism", "text": "Globalism\n\nGlobalism refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. The term is used by detractors of globalization such as right-wing populist movements. While primarily associated with world-systems, other things with global reach have also been so described.\n\nHistorically, it has been associated with international endeavours begun after World War II, such as the United Nations and the European Union, and also sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of \"nation building\" and military interventionism between the end of the Cold War in 1992 and the beginning of the War on Terror in 2001.\n\nPaul James defines \"globalism\", \"at least in its more specific use, ... as the dominant ideology and subjectivity associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the Roman Empire in the second century AD, and perhaps to the Greeks of the fifth-century BC.\"\n\nManfred Steger distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism. Market globalism includes the ideology of neoliberalism. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book \"The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World\", Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways.\n\nAlternatively, American political scientist Joseph Nye, co-founder of the international relations theory of neoliberalism, generalized the term to argue that \"globalism\" refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by networks of connections that span multi-continental distances; while globalization refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism. This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization. The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).\n\nDuring the election and presidency of United States president Donald Trump, Trump and members of his administration used the term \"globalist\" on multiple occasions. Critics claimed that the administration used the term as an anti-Semitic \"dog whistle\" term referring to members of a Jewish conspiracy.\n\nThe word itself came into widespread usage, first and foremost in the United States, from the early 1940s. This was the period when US global power was at its peak: the country was the greatest economic power the world had ever known, with the greatest military machine in human history. As George Kennan's Policy Planning Staff put it in February 1948: \"[W]e have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. […] Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity\". America's allies and foes in Eurasia were suffering the dreadful effects of World War II at this time.\n\nIn their position of unprecedented power, US planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which, in economic terms, meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States.\n\nThe first person in the United States to use the term \"economic integration\" in its modern sense (i.e. combining separate economies into larger economic regions) did so at this time: one John S. de Beers, an economist in the US Treasury Department, towards the end of 1941. By 1948, \"economic integration\" was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches. Paul Hoffman, then head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, made the most marked use of the term in a 1949 speech to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. As \"The New York Times\" put it,\n\nWhile ideologies of the global have a long history, globalism emerged as a dominant set of associated ideologies across the course of the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and as various processes of globalization intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary. In their recent writings, Manfred Steger and Paul James have theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies.\n\n\n"}

The most visually recognizable forms are from the Maprik area, with a tall and elaborately decorated front entrance wall where the ridge pole slopes down low toward the back of the building and the roof follows this decline and often continues all the way to the ground. The Sepik people are renowned for their superb artistic ability in painting and carving, which is often exhibited in these religious structures.\n\nThe front entrance of the modern National Parliament building in Port Moresby is modelled on traditional \"haus tambaran\" architecture. It can be viewed on Google Earth at Latitude: 9°25'41.69\"S, Longitude: 147°11'33.45\"E, and is depicted on the Papua New Guinea 50 Kina note. The High Commission of Papua New Guinea in Canberra, Australia, is also influenced by \"haus tambaran\". \nThe male-dominated \"tambaran\" or \"tambaram\" culture uses the haus tambaran as a meeting-house and site for rituals and initiations. It is also used in worship for the yam cult, the yam being the staple food for the Sepik people. The women serve primarily as preparers of feasts, outsiders, and spectators. The giant spirit, called Nggwal or Ngwalndu among the Abelam and Southern Arapesh peoples, is personified as noises that can be heard coming from the haus tambaran. Nggwal is the primary ancestor deity, though other cultural heroes are also often\ndepicted in cultural and sacred arts. Ngwalndu are large, flat painted faces that line the inside of the structure. Though they are said to be representations of ancestral spirits, they can also be seen as stylized women's bodies. However, it is important to note that painting is a sacred activity for the Sepik people, and the paintings of the Sepik people are taken very seriously.\n"}

{"id": "174521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174521", "title": "Infrastructure", "text": "Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure refers to the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or other area, including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function. Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds). In general, it has also been defined as \"the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions\".\n\nThere are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft. Hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry. This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. Soft infrastructure refers to all the institutions that maintain the economic, health, social, and cultural standards of a country. This includes educational programs, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.\n\nThe word infrastructure has been used in English since 1887 and in French since 1875, originally meaning \"The installations that form the basis for any operation or system\". The word was imported from French, where it means \"subgrade\", the native material underneath a constructed pavement or railway. The word is a combination of the Latin prefix \"infra\", meaning \"below\" and many of these constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and railways. The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of NATO in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense.\n\nA 1987 US National Research Council panel adopted the term \"public works infrastructure\", referring to:\n\n\"... both specific functional modes – highways, streets, roads, and bridges; mass transit; airports and airways; water supply and water resources; wastewater management; solid-waste treatment and disposal; electric power generation and transmission; telecommunications; and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise. A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities, but also the operating procedures, management practices, and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods, provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses, safe disposal of society's waste products, provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of information within and between communities.\"\nThe OECD also classifies communications as a part of infrastructure.\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers publish a \"Infrastructure Report Card\" which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2–4 years. they grade 16 categories, namely Aviation, Bridges, Dams, Drinking Water, Energy, Hazardous Waste, Inland Waterways, Levees, Parks & Recreation, Ports, Rail, Roads, Schools, Solid Waste, Transit and Wastewater.\n\nA way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in term of human capital. Human capital is defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica as “intangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population\". The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents’ values. This results in three major tasks: the task of economic proxies’ in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure.\n\nInstitutional infrastructure branches from the term \"economic constitution\". According to Gianpiero Torrisi, Institutional infrastructure is the object of economic and legal policy. It compromises the grown and sets norms. It refers to the degree of actual equal treatment of equal economic data and determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others.\n\nMaterial infrastructure is defined as “those immobile, non-circulating capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of economic agents\". There are two distinct qualities of material infrastructures: 1) Fulfillment of social needs and 2) Mass production. The first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services.\n\nAccording to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as \"internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as communication, transportation and distribution networks, financial institutions and markets, and energy supply systems\". Economic infrastructure support productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges, airports, water distribution networks, sewer systems, irrigation plants, etc.\n\nSocial infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services. Social infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and act on economic activity. These being schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, sports area, etc.\n\nCore assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics. Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different characteristics: Income, Low volatility of returns, Diversification, Inflation Protection, and Long-term liability matching. Core Infrastructure incorporates all the main types of infrastructure. For instance; roads, highways, railways, public transportation, water and gas supply, etc.\n\nBasic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks, the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation. It consist of the more well-known features of infrastructure. The things in the world we come across everyday (buildings, roads, docks, etc).\n\nComplementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways, gas/electricity/water supply, etc. To complement something, means to bring to perfection or complete it. So, complementary infrastructure deals with the little parts of the engineering world the brings more life. The lights on the sidewalks, the landscaping around buildings, the benches for pedestrians to rest, etc.\n\nThe term \"infrastructure\" may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts.\n\nLand improvement and land development are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements, not infrastructure.\n\nThe term public works includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings, such as schools and court houses. Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public services. Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government.\n\nInfrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies, such as sole public utility or railway companies. Generally, most roads, major airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned. Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees. Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term bonds.\n\nGovernment-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in public-private partnerships, in addition to in the public sector. in the United States for example, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950. Many financial institutions invest in infrastructure.\n\nEngineers generally limit the term \"infrastructure\" to describe fixed assets that are in the form of a large network; in other words, hard infrastructure. Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets. One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets \"where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components\".\n\nCivil defense planners and developmental economists generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure, including public services such as schools and hospitals, emergency services such as police and fire fighting, and basic financial services. The notion of infrastructure-based development combining long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with public private partnerships has proven popular among economists in Asia (notably Singapore and China), mainland Europe, and Latin America.\n\nMilitary infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being deployed or engaged in operations. For example, barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port installations, and maintenance stations.\n\nGreen infrastructure (or blue-green infrastructure) highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about land use planning. In particular there is an emphasis on the \"life support\" functions provided by a network of natural ecosystems, with an emphasis on interconnectivity to support long-term sustainability. Examples include clean water and healthy soils, as well as the more anthropocentric functions such as recreation and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities. The concept can be extended to apply to the management of stormwater runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems, or engineered systems that mimic natural systems, to treat polluted runoff.\n\nIn Marxism, the term \"infrastructure\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"base\" in the dialectic synthetic pair \"base and superstructure\". However, the Marxist notion of \"base\" is broader than the non-Marxist use of the term \"infrastructure\", and some soft infrastructure, such as laws, governance, regulations, and standards, would be considered by Marxists to be part of the superstructure, not the base.\n\nCommunications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of communication, political and social networks, or beliefs held by members of particular groups, as well as information technology, software development tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a collection of people with common interests. Examples include IT infrastructure, research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructure.\n\nAccording to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over forty percent for electricity generation, and eighty percent for roads.\n\nThe demand for infrastructure, both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested. There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia. The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in Asia-Pacific (around US$48 billion) and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year.\n\nIn Latin America, three percent of GDP (around US$71 billion) would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US$24 billion.\n\nIn Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In fragile states, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required.\n\nThe source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by government spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA), and yet others by private investors. In California, infrastructure financing districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities and services within a specified area by using property tax increases. In order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries' infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.\n\nThe spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be. Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on infrastructure as a whole. \n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total of US$24.9 billion. In irrigation, governments represent almost all spending. In transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending. In ICT and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-OECD financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade) and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7 billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.\n\n\n"}

From 1972 to 1977, he was the head of the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS). He was a leading figure of New History, related to cultural history. Le Goff argued that the Middle Ages formed a civilization of its own, distinct from both Classical Antiquity and the modern world.\n\nA prolific medievalist of international renown, Le Goff was sometimes considered the principal heir and continuator of the movement known as Annales School (\"École des Annales\"), founded by his intellectual mentor Marc Bloch. Le Goff succeeded Fernand Braudel in 1972 at the head of the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) and was succeeded by François Furet in 1977. Along with Pierre Nora, he was one of the leading figures of New History (\"Nouvelle histoire\") in the 1970s.\n\nSubsequently, he dedicated himself to studies on the historical anthropology of Western Europe during medieval times. He was well known for contesting the very name of \"Middle Ages\" and its chronology, highlighting achievements of this period and variations inside it, in particular by attracting attention to the Renaissance of the 12th century.\n\nIn his 1984 book \"The Birth of Purgatory\", he argued that the conception of purgatory as a physical place, rather than merely as a state, dates to the 12th century, the heyday of medieval otherworld-journey narratives such as the Irish Visio Tnugdali, and of pilgrims' tales about St Patrick's Purgatory, a cavelike entrance to purgatory on a remote island in Ireland.\n\nAn agnostic, Le Goff presented an equidistant position between the detractors and the apologists of the Middle Ages.\n\nAmong his numerous works were two widely accepted biographies, a genre that his school did not usually favor: the life of Louis IX, the only King of France to be canonized, and the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, the Italian mendicant friar.\n\nIn October 2000 he received an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Pavia. He was also nominated Academician of Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato, Italy.\n\nIn 2004, he received the Dr. A.H.

He is best remembered as the author of \"Mazurek Dąbrowskiego\" (), which in 1927 was adopted as the Polish national anthem.\n\nWybicki was born in Będomin, in the region of Pomerania in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His family was Pomeranian nobility.\n\nHe finished a Jesuit school, and in his youth was a junior court official. Wybicki was elected a deputy to the Repnin Sejm, the session of Polish parliament in 1767, on the eve of the First Partition of Poland. Subsequently he joined the insurgency known as the Confederation of Bar (1768–1772), aimed at opposing the Russian influence and king Stanisław August Poniatowski. He was one of the advisors (\"konsyliarz\") of the Confederacy, acting as a diplomat. After the failure of the uprising, he spent some time in the Netherlands, studying law at Leiden University.\nReturning to Poland, in the 1770s and 1780s he was associated with the Commission of National Education. He supported King Stanisław August Poniatowski and his proposed reforms. He helped draft the liberal Zamoyski Codex of laws of the late 1770s. He was a Patriotic Party activist during the Great Sejm (1788–92) – though he was not one of its first deputies, during much of that time staying at his estate, writing and staging operas. He did, however, participate in the Great Sejm's deliberations, beginning in 1791. In 1792, in the aftermath of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation.\n\nHe participated in the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and was a member of the Military Section of the Provisional Council of the Duchy of Masovia. After the failure of this insurrection he moved to France.\nHe was a close friend of both Tadeusz Kościuszko and Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. With Dąbrowski he organized the Polish Legions in Italy, serving under Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1797, while in Reggio Emilia, Italy, he wrote \"Mazurek Dąbrowskiego\" (Dąbrowski's Mazurek). In 1806 he helped Dąbrowski organize the Greater Poland Uprising.\n\nAfter the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, he held a number of positions in its Department of Justice, and continued working for it after the Duchy's transformation into Congress Poland. In 1817 he became president of the Supreme Court of Congress Poland.\n\nHe died on 10 March 1822 in Manieczki, in Schrimm, then part of the Grand Duchy of Posen, Prussia.\n\nWybicki was a writer, journalist and a poet. He wrote political-themed poems, plays and political treaties advocating reforms in Poland in the 1770s and 1780s. His works of that time analyzed the Polish political system, the concepts of liberty, and advocated for more rights for the peasantry. He would also publish more political brochures in the 1800s, advocating for liberal reforms in the Duchy of Warsaw.\n\n\"Mazurek Dąbrowskiego\" (Dąbrowski's Mazurka) remains Wybicki's most famous creation. It has been regarded as an unofficial national anthem since the November Uprising of 1831. In 1927 the Mazurka was officially adopted as the Polish national anthem by the Polish parliament (Sejm).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "180362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180362", "title": "Kukri", "text": "Kukri\n\nThe kukri or khukuri ( \"khukuri\") is a knife, originating from the Indian subcontinent, associated with the Nepali speaking Gurkhas of India and Nepal. The knife has an inwardly curved blade, similar to a machete, used as both a tool and as a weapon in Nepal and India. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the Gurkha. It is a characteristic weapon of the Nepalese Army, the Royal Gurkha Rifles of the British Army, the Assam Rifles, the Assam Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Gorkha regiments of the Indian Army, and of all Gurkha regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in Nepalese and Indian Gorkha heraldry and is used in many traditional rituals such as wedding ceremonies.\n\nThe \"kukri\", \"khukri\", and \"kukkri\" spellings are of Indian origin, the original Nepali form being \"khukuri\".\n\nResearchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat. Similar implements have existed in several forms throughout South Asia and were used both as weapons and as tools, such as for sacrificial rituals. Burton (1884) writes that the British Museum housed a large kukri-like falchion inscribed with writing in Pali. Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in Kathmandu.\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the East India Company came into conflict with the growing Gorkha Kingdom, culminating in the Gurkha War of 1814–1816. It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel \"Dracula\" by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's Bowie knife.\n\nAll Gurkha troops are issued with two kukri, a Service No.1 (ceremonial) and a Service No.2 (exercise); in modern times members of the Brigade of Gurkhas receive training in its use. The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both World War I and World War II enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit's situation report. It reads: \"Enemy losses: ten killed, ours nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.\" Elsewhere during the Second World War, the kukri was purchased and used by other British, Commonwealth and US troops training in India, including the Chindits and Merrill's Marauders. The notion of the Gurkha with his kukri carried on through to the Falklands War.\n\nOn 2 September 2010, Bishnu Shrestha, a retired Indian Army Gurkha soldier, alone and armed only with a khukri, defeated thirty bandits who attacked a passenger train he was on in India. He was reported to have killed three of the bandits, wounded eight more and forced the rest of the band to flee. A contemporaneous report in the \"Times of India\", that includes an interview with Shrestha, indicates he was less successful.\n\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from 5–10 mm at the handle, and can taper to 2 mm by the point while the blade lengths can vary from 26–38 cm for general use.\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly 40–45 cm (16–18 in) in overall length and weighs approximately 450–900 grams (1–2 lbs). Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength the blade might be hollow forged, or a fuller is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including: \"tin chira\" (triple fuller), \"dui chira\" (double fuller), \"angkhola\" (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large beveled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (\"karda\", \"kauda\", \"kaudi\", \"kaura\", or \"cho\") at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery; that it delineates the end of the blade whilst sharpening; that it is a symbol representing a cows' foot, or Shiva; that it can catch another blade, or kukri in combat. The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.\n\nThe handles are most often made of hardwood or water buffalo horn, but ivory, bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of brass or steel.\n\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial tang, although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular. The full tang is mainly used on some military models, but has not caught-on in Nepal itself.\n\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened \"chakmak\" to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a \"karda\". Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.\n\nThe Biswakarma Kami (caste) are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making. Modern kukri blades are often forged from spring steel, sometimes collected from recycled truck suspension units. The tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle is hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called \"laha\" (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a full tang (\"panawal\") configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by \"laha\", the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a \"chakmak\" over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to steel their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a \"Sarki\".\n\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion. Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops. The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.\n\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\n\n\n\nKukris can be broadly classified into two types: Eastern and Western. The Eastern blades are originate and named according to the towns and villages of Eastern Nepal. The Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as \"Siru\" grass leaf like. Sirupate is also known as one of Chainpure Khukuri. Khukuris made in locations like Chainpur, Bhojpur, and Dhankuta in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.\nWestern blades are generally more broad. Occasionally the Western style is called \"Budhuna\", (referring to a fish with a large head), or \"baspate\" (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal \"Sirupate\" blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.\n\nThere is Khukuri named after Gorkhali General Amar Singh Thapa called Amar Singh Thapa Khukuri. This Khukuri is modeled on the real Khukuri used by the Gorkhali General. The real Khukuri used by Amar Singh Thapa is archived at National Museum of Nepal and is more curvy in nature than other traditionals.\n\nThere is a popular proverb in Nepali as follows:\n\n"}

As Field they wrote around 40 works together, and a long journal \"Works and Days\". Their intention was to keep the pen-name secret, but it became public knowledge, not long after they had confided in their friend Robert Browning.\n\nKatharine Bradley was born on 27 October 1846 in Birmingham, England, the daughter of Charles Bradley, a tobacco manufacturer, and of Emma (née Harris). Her grandfather, also Charles Bradley (1785–1845), was a prominent follower and financial backer of prophetess Joanna Southcott and her self-styled successor John \"Zion\" Ward. She was educated at the Collège de France and Newnham College, Cambridge.\n\nBradley's elder sister, Emma, married James Robert Cooper in 1860, and went to live in Kenilworth, where their daughter, Edith Emma Cooper was born on 12 January 1862. Emma Cooper became an invalid for life after the birth of her second daughter, Amy, and Katharine Bradley, being her sister, stepped in to become the legal guardian of her niece Edith Cooper.\n\nBradley was for a time involved with Ruskin's utopian project. She published first under the pseudonym Arran Leigh, a nod to Elizabeth Barrett. Edith adopted the name Isla Leigh for their first joint publication, \"Bellerophôn\".\n\nFrom the late 1870s, when Edith was at University College, Bristol, they agreed to live together and were, over the next 40 years, lesbian lovers, and co-authors. Their first joint publication as Michael Field was \"Callirhöe and Fair Rosamund\" in 1884. They had financial independence: Bradley's father Charles Bradley had been in the tobacco industry in Birmingham.\n\nThey were Aestheticists, strongly influenced by the thoughts of Walter Pater. They developed a large circle of literary friends and contacts; in particular painters and life partners Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon, near whom they settled in Richmond, London. Robert Browning was also a close friend of theirs, and they knew and admired Oscar Wilde, whose death they bitterly mourned. While they were always well connected, the early critical success was not sustained (this is often attributed to the joint identity of Field becoming known). They knew many of the aesthetic movement of the 1890s, including Walter Pater, Vernon Lee, J. A. Symonds and also Bernard Berenson. William Rothenstein was a friend. In 1899 the death of Edith's father enabled them to buy their own house as evidence of their \"close marriage\", although Edith saw her father's death as retribution for their lifestyle. Edith led the way in establishing the couple as active Catholics.\n\nThey wrote a number of passionate love poems to each other, and their name Michael Field was their way of declaring their inseparable oneness. Friends referred to them as the Fields, the Michaels or the Michael Fields. They had a range of pet names for each other. They also were passionately devoted to their pets, in particular a dog named Whym Chow, for whom they wrote a book of poems named after him.\n\nTheir joint journal starts with an account of Bradley's passion for Alfred Gérente, an artist in stained glass and brother of Henri Gérente, who was of an English background but worked mostly in France. It goes on to document Michael Field as a figure, amongst 'his' literary counterparts, and their lives together. When Whym Chow died in 1906, the emotional pattern of the relationship was disturbed; both women became Roman Catholic converts in 1907. Their religious inclinations are reflected in their later works, where their earlier writing is influenced by classical and Renaissance culture, in its pagan aspects particularly, Sappho as understood by the late Victorians, and perhaps Walter Savage Landor.\n\nEdith died of cancer in 1913, as did Katherine less than a year later. They were buried together at St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake. A now-lost marble tomb was erected in 1926. Their extensive diaries are stored in the British Library, and have been digitised and made available by the Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium.\n\nA much-edited selection from the journals, which were two dozen annual volumes in ledgers with aspects of scrapbooks combined with a self-conscious literary style of composition, was prepared by T. Sturge Moore, a friend through his mother Marie.\n\n\n"}

Formerly a member of the National Union of Students (Australia), it has been ejected and its practices are considered controversial by a number of education industry associations. As of 2013, NLC, along with their sub group Overseas Student Association (OSA), have been banned from NSW after warning issued by NSW Premier.\n\nNLC was formed in 1986, in response to the need for a unified body to voice international student's concerns especially over the introduction of the user-pay system for international students tuition fee by the Australian government. NLC was the peak representative body in Australia for all international students. It stood for quality education, equitable welfare and multicultural understanding. Until 2009, it was recognised as the national representative body for international students by the Australia Federal Government. In 2009 the leadership of the NLC was expelled from the NUS. This in turn caused the NLC to lose recognition from peak education bodies (Universities Australia, ACPET, TAFE Directors Australia, and English Australia), Federal and State Governments and education providers.\n\nNLC was officially incorporated in 1998 and its official legal name is National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia Inc. Until 2009 the NLC worked in conjunction with National Union of Students of Australia and fulfilled its role as a peak representative organisation by taking the role of the International Students Committee of the National Union of Students of Australia (NUS).\n\nThe NLC had developed strong relationships with many stakeholders in the international education industry. These included, Australian Education International (AEI), IDP Education Australia, State Government Education Departments, International Student Adviser Network Australia (ISANA), all four OSHC providers, National Tertiary Education Union, Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, IELTS, English Australia, and most international education departments throughout Australian Universities. Since 2009 many of these relationships have been fundamentally compromised.\n\nThe NLC had helped to achieve changes in the international education industry over between 1986 and 2009. These included the deregulation of the overseas student health cover industry, contributions to the ESOS Act reviews in 2006, 2000, 2004 and in 1996, changes to immigration regulations, such as extensions of sunset clauses on permanent residency changes. In 2008 the NLC was currently working on re introducing public transport concession for international students in NSW and Victoria and ensuring quality education.\n\nThe NLC had 42 affiliated university campus international student organisations, from 31 public and 2 private universities, and drew its membership primarily from university students, claiming a representation of 303,000 international students in Australia. It contributed to Federal and State Government inquiries and processes into changing and improving international education in Australia.\n\nHowever, as of 2013, New South Wales Premier along with New South Wales Police Department, 11 universities and NSW Museum issues a warning regards NLC and it's OSA activities. They have been accused of collecting personal data from student which is consider illegal. Their current website have been taken down as a result.\n\nThe NLC has been critical of increasing exploitation of full fee paying international students, describing the current international student issues as having begun in 1986 with the introduction of full fees, and claiming that students are exploited in abusive visa schemes which do not result in real educational benefits. The NLC has also criticised the formation of student ghettos due to the poor integration of international and domestic students in Universities and the lack of welfare support for international students causing the development of in-group peer reliance structures. According to Eric Pang in 2008, then the president of the NLC, many international students had claimed \"There's not much international students can learn from Australia in terms of culture, or in terms of English. After all, the standard of English of Australian students is not high anyway.\"\n\nIn 2009 the NLC was accused of bullying, was forcibly disaffiliated from the NUS, and recognition has been refused by the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney. Later in 2009 other international student groups, the Australian Federation of International Students and the Federation of Indian Students of Australia claimed that the NLC had made legal threats regarding their operation in Victoria.\n\nIn 2013, NSW Premier issued warning regards NLC and its sub group OSA, stating that they have been involved taking private data from student illegally. NSW Office of Fair Trading has also launched an investigation about the bogus \"SafetyCard\" issued by NLC, about the non-existent discount in public services and extra protection from police. As a result, their website, which contain the infringed NSW government logo and NSW Police logo have been taken down.\n\n (Site have been Taken down)\n"}

Raymond Bellour and Guy Rosolato have made psychoanalytical analogies between films and the dream state, claiming films as having a \"latent\" content that can be psychoanalyzed as if it were a dream. states that before the 1930s, psychoanalysts \"primarily attempted to apply the interpretative schemata found in Sigmund Freud's \"Interpretation of Dreams\" to films.\"\n\nAuthor Douglas Fowler surmises that \"images arising from dreams are the well spring of all our efforts to give enduring form and meaning to the urgencies within,\" seeing this as the reason why \"the deep structure of human narrative is conceived in dreams and the genesis of all myth is dreams.\" Author Robert Eberwein describes the filmic experience as the merging of a viewer's consciousness with the projected consciousness of the screen's subject, a process whereby the viewer's prior experiences with dreaming \"help to create a sense of oneness\" with cinema, causing the gap between viewer and what is being viewed to narrow. Under this theory, no matter what is being shown on the screen — whether the literal representation of a character dreaming, or the fictional characters of a story going on about their fictional lives — the very process of viewing film itself \"replicates activities associated with the oneiric experience.\"\n\nFilms and dreams are also connected in psychological analysis by examining the relationship between the cinema screening process and the spectator (who is perceived as passive). Roland Barthes, a French literary critic and semiotician, described film spectators as being in a \"para-oneiric\" state, feeling \"sleepy and drowsy as if they had just woken up\" when a film ends. Similarly, the French surrealist André Breton argues that film viewers enter a state between being \"awake and falling asleep\", what French filmmaker René Clair called a \"dreamlike state\". Edgar Morin's \"Le cinéma ou l'homme imaginaire\" (1956) and Jean Mitry's first volume of \"Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma\" (1963) also discuss the connection between films and the dream state.\n\nFilmmakers described as using oneiric or dreamlike elements in their films include Sergei Parajanov (e.g., \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\"), David Lynch (e.g., \"Twin Peaks\", \"Mulholland Drive\"), Andrei Tarkovsky (e.g. \"Andrei Rublev\" and \"Solaris\"), Stan Brakhage (e.g., \"Dog Star Man\"), Michelangelo Antonioni (e.g. \"The Passenger\"), Jaromil Jireš (e.g., \"Valerie and Her Week of Wonders\"), Krzysztof Kieslowski (e.g. \"The Double Life of Veronique\"), Federico Fellini (e.g., \"Amarcord\"), Ingmar Bergman (e.g., \"Wild Strawberries\"), Jean Cocteau (e.g., \"Orphic Trilogy\"), Raúl Ruiz (e.g., \"City of Pirates\"), Edgar G. Ulmer (e.g., \"The Black Cat\"), Jacques Tourneur (e.g., \"I Walked With a Zombie\"), Maya Deren, Wojciech Has, and Kenneth Anger.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3435236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3435236", "title": "Pragmatic language impairment", "text": "Pragmatic language impairment\n\nPragmatic language impairment (PLI), or social (pragmatic) communication disorder (SCD), is an impairment in understanding pragmatic aspects of language. This type of impairment was previously called semantic-pragmatic disorder (SPD). People with these impairments have special challenges with the semantic aspect of language (the meaning of what is being said) and the pragmatics of language (using language appropriately in social situations). It is assumed that those with autism have difficulty with \"the meaning of what is being said\" due to different ways of responding to social situations.\n\nPLI is now a diagnosis in DSM-5, and is called social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Communication problems are also part of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, the latter also show a restricted pattern of behavior, according to behavioral psychology. The diagnosis SCD can only be given if ASD has been ruled out.\n\nIndividuals with PLI have particular trouble understanding the meaning of what others are saying, and they are challenged in using language appropriately to get their needs met and interact with others. Children with the disorder often exhibit:\n\n\nAccording to Bishop and Norbury (2002), children with semantic pragmatic disorder have fluent, complex and clearly articulated expressive language but exhibit problems with the way their language is used. These children typically are verbose. However, they usually have problems understanding and producing connected discourse, instead giving conversational responses that are socially inappropriate, tangential and/or stereotyped. They often develop obsessional interests but not as strong or eccentric as people with autism spectrum disorders.\n\nThe current view, therefore, is that the disorder has more to do with communication and information processing than language. For example, children with semantic pragmatic disorder will often fail to grasp the central meaning or saliency of events. This then leads to an excessive preference for routine and \"sameness\" (seen in autism spectrum disorders), as PLI children struggle to generalize and grasp the meaning of situations that are new; it also means that more difficulties occur in a stimulating environment than in a one-to-one setting.\n\nA further problem caused by PLI is the assumption of literal communication. This would mean that obvious, concrete instructions are clearly understood and carried out, whereas simple but non-literal expressions such as jokes, sarcasm and general social chatting are difficult and can lead to misinterpretation. Lies are also a confusing concept to children with PLI as it involves knowing what the speaker is thinking, intending and truly meaning beyond a literal interpretation.\nPrior to the DSM-5, SCD was not differentiated from a diagnosis of autism. However, there was a large number of cases of children experiencing difficulties with pragmatics that did not meet the criteria for ASD. The differential diagnosis of SCD allows practitioners to account for social and communication difficulties that occur at a lesser degree than in children with ASD.\n\nThere is debate over the relationship between semantic pragmatic disorder and autistic disorder as the clinical profile of semantic pragmatic disorder is often seen in children with high-functioning autism.\n\nPragmatic language impairment is distinguished from autism by the absence of any history (current or past) of restricted/repetitive patterns of interest or behavior in PLI.\n\nThe DSM-5 categorizes SCD as a communication disorder within the domain of neurodevelopmental disorders, listed alongside other disorders of speech and language which typically manifest in early childhood. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social (pragmatic) communication disorder is as follows:\n\nHyperlexia is a similar but different disorder where main characteristics are an above-average ability to read with a below-average ability to understand spoken and/or written language. Joanne Volden wrote an article in 2002 comparing the linguistic weaknesses of children with nonverbal learning disability to PLI.\nIn 1983, Rapin and Allen suggested the term \"semantic pragmatic disorder\" to describe the communicative behavior of children who presented traits such as pathological talkativeness, deficient access to vocabulary and discourse comprehension, atypical choice of terms and inappropriate conversational skills. They referred to a group of children who presented with mild autistic features and specific semantic pragmatic language problems. More recently, the term \"pragmatic language impairment\" (PLI) has been proposed.\n\nRapin and Allen's definition has been expanded and refined by therapists who include communication disorders that involve difficulty in understanding the meaning of words, grammar, syntax, prosody, eye gaze, body language, gestures, or social context. While autistic children exhibit pragmatic language impairment, this type of communication disorder can also be found in individuals with other types of disorders including auditory processing disorders, neuropathies, encephalopathies and certain genetic disorders.\n\n"}
{"id": "745202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745202", "title": "Reality tunnel", "text": "Reality tunnel\n\nReality tunnel is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence \"Truth is in the eye of the beholder\". It is similar to the idea of representative realism, and was coined by Timothy Leary (1920–1996). It was further expanded on by Robert Anton Wilson (1932-2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book \"Prometheus Rising\".\n\nWilson and Leary co-wrote a chapter in Leary's 1988 book \"Neuropolitique\" (a revised edition of the 1977 book \"Neuropolitics\"), in which they explained further: \nThe gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another's territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other's reality tunnel. \n\nEvery kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson \n\nThe idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.\n\nA parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation bias—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the \"one true objective reality\", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.\n\nWilson—like John C. Lilly and many others—relates that through various techniques one can break down old reality tunnels and impose new reality tunnels by removing old filters and replacing them with new ones, with new perspectives on reality—at will. This is attempted through various processes of deprogramming using neuro-linguistic programming, cybernetics, hypnosis, biofeedback devices, meditation, controlled use of hallucinogens, and forcibly acting out other reality tunnels. Thus, it is believed one's reality tunnel can be widened to take full advantage of human potential and experience reality on more positive levels. Robert Anton Wilson's \"Prometheus Rising\" is (among other things) a guidebook to the exploration of various reality tunnels.\n\nWe don't see things as they are; we see them as we are. – Anaïs Nin\n\nHarvard sociologist Talcott Parsons used the word \"gloss\" to describe how the mind perceives reality. We are taught, he theorised, how to \"put the world together\" by others who subscribe to a consensus reality. \"The curious world of Talcott Parsons was where society was a system, interactive subsystems adhering to a certain set of unwritten rules.\"\n\nThe meme is another source of \"gloss\"; it is \"transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena.\" Because we're social creatures, there are reasons for us to adopt some social currencies.\n\nIn line with Kantian thought, as well as the work of Norwood Russell Hanson, studies have indeed shown that our brains \"filter\" the data coming from our senses. This \"filtering\" is largely unconscious and may be influenced—more-or-less in many ways, in societies and in individuals—by biology, cultural constructs including education and language (such as memes), life experiences, preferences and mental state, belief systems (e.g. world view, the stock market), momentary needs, pathology, etc.\n\nAn everyday example of such filtering is our ability to follow a conversation, or read, without being distracted by surrounding conversations, once called the cocktail party effect.\n\nIn his 1986 book \"Waking Up\", Charles Tart—an American psychologist and parapsychologist known for his psychological work on the nature of consciousness—introduced the phrase \"consensus trance\" to the lexicon. Tart likened normal waking consciousness to hypnotic trance. He discussed how each of us is from birth inducted to the trance of the society around us. Tart noted both similarities and differences between hypnotic trance induction and consensus trance induction. (See G. I. Gurdjieff).\n\nSome disciplines—Zen for example, and monastic schools such as Sufism—seek to overcome such conditioned realities by returning to less thoughtful and channeled states of mind.\n\nConstructivism is a modern psychological response to reality-tunneling.\nFor Wilson, a fully functioning human ought to be aware of their reality tunnel, and be able to keep it flexible enough to accommodate, and to some degree empathize with, different reality tunnels, different \"game rules\", different cultures... Constructivist thinking is the exercise of metacognition to become aware of our reality tunnels or labyrinths and the elements that \"program\" them. Constructivist thinking should, ideally, decrease the chance that we will confuse our map of the world with the actual world... [This philosophy] is currently expressed in many Eastern consciousness-exploration techniques.\n\nAnother example is Lacan's distinction between \"The Real\" and the \"Symbolic\". Lacan argued that the Real is the imminent unified reality which is mediated through symbols that allow it to be parsed into intelligible and differentiated segments. The symbolic, which is primarily subconscious, is further abstracted into the Imaginary (our actual beliefs and understandings of reality). These two orders ultimately shape the way we come to perceive reality.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23024310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23024310", "title": "Suburbia bashing", "text": "Suburbia bashing\n\nSuburbia bashing refers to a negative discourse about suburbia that is relatively prominent in Australia, particularly in the mainstream media. Sprawling cities define the urban Australian landscape. The iconic \"quarter -acre\" block is often cited as fundamental to the Australian Dream. It has both cultural and political currency. There is a profound cynicism that exists in much commentary on suburbia that is promoted by \"intellectuals and others seeking to delineate the suburb\". This discourse dates back to the boom of suburban development in the 1950s and criticises a culture of aspirational homeownership.\n\nDame Edna Everage typifies this tradition as she demonstrates both \"nostalgia and disdain for the Australian suburb and suburban life\". In 1901, the year of Australian Federation, \"almost 70 per cent of Sydney’s population were living in the suburbs\" Despite the fact the majority of Australians still live in the suburbs, or maybe because of it, this practice of \"suburbia bashing\" perseveres in the mainstream media.\n\nSuburbia bashing is entrenched in questions of national identity. Disparaging commentary about the suburbs often appears in contrast to the national mythology of the Australian bush. The landscape that is portrayed in the tourism advertisements, by poets and painters, does not represent the experience of the majority of Australians. The suburb and the bush are counterposed, \"the bush (cast as the authentic Australian landscape) with the city (regarded as blighted foreign import)\" The bush landscape is a masculine construction of a more “authentic notion of Australian national identity” exemplified by the poetry of Henry Lawson Conversely, the suburb is feminised, epitomised by Dame Edna for more than fifty years, and more recently, by comedic team Jane Turner and Gina Riley in \"Kath & Kim\".\n\nIn 1966 prominent journalist Allan Ashbolt described Australian reality as distinctly suburban:\n\n\"Behold the man – the Australian of today – on Sunday morning in the suburbs when the high decibel drone of the motor-mower is calling the faithful to worship. A block of land, a brick veneer, and the motor-mower beside him in the wilderness – what more does he want to sustain him\".\n\nAshbolt satirised the suburb that represented Australian nationalism, rooted in the post-World War II era, as passive and uninspired, inscribed strongly in spatial terms. Architect and cultural critic, Robin Boyd, also criticised suburbia, referring to it as the \"Australian Ugliness\". Boyd observed a “pursuit of respectability” in suburban spaces Ashbolt and Boyd represent this intellectual “tradition of abuse of the suburbs and of the majority of Australians”. Suburban space has been characterised by “conformity, control and some sense of false consciousness”. Boyd writes of a contrived and superficial sense of place, centred on a “fear of reality”.\n\n\"The Australian ugliness begins with fear of reality, denial of the need for the everyday environment to reflect the heart of the human problem, satisfaction with veneer and cosmetic effects. It ends in betrayal of the element of love and a chill near the root of national self-respect.\"\n\nThe ugliness that Boyd describes is qualified as \"skin deep\". However, in the tradition of suburbia bashing, he proposes that there is an emptiness of spirit that can be read through an uniformed appreciation for aesthetics.\n\nMore recently there has been suggestion of a \"new Australian ugliness\". New suburban developments have seen the proliferation of what have become known as \"McMansions\". McMansions epitomise the suburbia that is attacked by Boyd for both its monotony and \"featurism\" Journalist Miranda Devine refers to an elitist perception that those who live in such suburban assemblages display a \"poverty of spirit and a barrenness of mind\" that is derived from a politics of aesthetics and taste, as expressed by Boyd fifty years ago. In this \"new Australian ugliness\" some commentators attribute a rise in consumer culture: \"There’s a concern about over-consumption. But there’s little thought of why – beyond advertising-driven gullibility\". Academic Mark Peel has rejected notions of gullible \"consuming\" residents of new suburbs by explaining his own \"choice\" to move to Melbourne’s outer suburbs.\n\nPeel alludes to a discourse of suburbia that is elitist, and is based on matters of taste. Taste has translated into a socio-cultural divide. When Miranda Devine refers to the elites, she refers to an inner-city population. The divide is between the urbanites and the suburbanites, and the conflict is over national identity.\n"}
{"id": "25992413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25992413", "title": "The Last Story", "text": "The Last Story\n\nThe game was directed and co-written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the original creator of \"Final Fantasy\", who had the initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to \"Blue Dragon\" and \"Lost Odyssey\". Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto, Sakaguchi decided to make a game that would be different from his previous work and most other role-playing games. Development took between three and four years according to different sources. Its story was originally based in science fiction, but at Nintendo's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy. Among the staff were regular \"Final Fantasy\" composer Nobuo Uematsu, and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka. It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan, and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia. During this time, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. The title was a commercial success, and received generally positive reviews worldwide: while the gameplay generally met with praise, opinions varied on the story and graphics.\n\n\"The Last Story\" is an action role-playing game (ARPG) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael for the majority of the game. Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or the Classic Controller. The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with access to side quests, shops, and areas to collect items when not engaged in the main story. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party can pick up money and items from non-playable characters betting on the fight.\n\nIn battle, the player controls Zael alone, with the rest of the party being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and directed by player commands. Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five \"lives\", with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually. The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters. Combat plays out in real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls. During combat, a character's Tension gauge will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.\n\nA skill unique to Zael is Gathering: when activated, all enemies within an area will focus their attention on him, allowing other team members to act without interruption. As the game progresses, Zael can issue commands to the other team members, with the perspective switching to a top-down view for this action. In addition to standard combat, players can switch to a behind-the-shoulder perspective for manually firing Zael's crossbow, which can launch a variety of ammunition at enemies and objects. Enemies in Zael's sights will have their weaknesses and abilities revealed. In battle, destructible objects in the environment can be used by the party to defeat enemies; these objects regenerate after a time rather than remaining destroyed. Magic cast by certain characters with that ability leave the casting area temporarily imbued with a spell's elemental properties creating a magic circle. These circles can cause elemental damage or effects to enemies within the area, or they can imbue the weapons of characters who walk into the circle with said element. Eventually, Zael will learn the ability to \"diffuse\" magic circles which will spread the spell's effect which varies depending on the element. .\n\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, players have access to online multiplayer through the game's main menu. The multiplayer features two modes: a competitive mode where players face each other in various stages, and a co-op mode where a team of players face bosses from the single-player campaign. For the competitive match, the player can choose from multiple allied and enemy characters, and all boons granted by equipment or experience levels are removed to level the playing field. Teams of up to six players can be formed for team matches. Players gain or lose points when they defeat or are defeated by an opponent, and defeated enemies respawn in the battlefield. When all opponents have been defeated, all players are awarded with items and equipment that can carry over into the single-player campaign: those who performed the best receive higher-quality equipment and \"titles\" ti distinguish them from other players. The co-op battles allow players to carry over their equipment and character levels from single-player, with the available characters being restricted to Zael's mercenary group. Defeating a boss earns players items themed around it. In both modes, players communicate using a stock of scripted responses both taken from the single-player campaign and specially created for multiplayer.\n\n\"The Last Story\" is set on Lazulis Island, a vast seaborne fortress ruled by Count Arganan and allied to an unnamed human empire in the midst of crisis as the land decays and dies. Dagran, a mercenary, travels to Lazulis in search of employment with the mercenary band he leads: Zael, Syrenne, Yurick, Lowell and Mirania. During the journey, Zael, who dreams of becoming a knight, encounters a mysterious force and is branded on the hand, granting him magical power. While on an errand in town, Zael runs into a woman named Lisa and helps her escape from city guards. Employed as guards to Count Arganan for the wedding of his niece, Lady Calista, to Lord Jirall, Zael encounters Calista and recognizes her as \"Lisa\". The group also meet General Asthar and his protegee Therius when Syrenne picks a fight with Therius. After Calista explains to Zael in private that hers is an arranged marriage, Lazulis is attacked by the Gurak, a race once banished from Lazulis by humans and now united under their ruler Zangurak. To avoid being killed by the ensuing cannon fire, Zael, Dagran, and Calista stow away on a Gurak ship and eventually take it over. The group are returned to Lazulis by the island's knights. On Lazulis, the mercenaries are accused of aiding the Gurak by Jirall, who is trying to cover up his cowardly behavior during the Gurak attack by having anyone who witnessed it imprisoned. Dagran persuades Arganan to release them after showing him Zael's mark, which is revealed to be a mystical \"Mark of the Outsider\" destined to save Lazulis from disaster.\n\nArganan attempts to get Zael onto his side, offering him knighthood and Calista's hand in marriage. Zael swears allegiance to Arganan, who orders Zael to direct Lazulis towards the Gurak lands. During this time, Asthar accepts Zael as a new pupil and gives him a medal following a successful sparring. Shortly after this, Gurak assassins attack. Asthar is killed, telling Zael the medal is a key before dying. Zael is accused of Asthar's murder by Jirall and imprisoned. Calista frees him. Dagran suggests Jirall is likely the real killer, and prompts Zael to search Jirall's room, where he finds the murder weapon and a letter revealing dealings with the Gurak. Jirall is imprisoned, freeing Calista to be betrothed to Zael. When Zael's suspicions are later aroused, Dagran admits to him that he framed Jirall in order to ensure Zael's liberty. Lazulis arrives in Gurak lands and takes their keep with minimal resistance. Zael learns there that the Gurak are suffering the same degradation of the land as humans are, which motivated their invasion. Zael's brand reacts with Calista's blood and Asthar's medal to reveal a secret location on Lazulis. Joined by Therius, they enter and meet a Sorceress, who reveals that the \"Outsider\" is an extraterrestrial being that absorbs energy. At the bidding of her lover, Arganan's ancestor, she summoned the Outsider to the planet in an attempt to end conflict. After realizing that it was destroying the land in order to collect its energy, they split it into two halves in order to slow the land's death. If the two halves, now respectively controlled by humans and the Gurak, are reunited and released, the land's decay will halt and the motive for the war will no longer exist.\n\nRealizing Arganan must have known of this, Zael refuses his knighthood and sets out with Calista to destroy Lazulis' cannon, which is powered by Lazulis' half of the Outsider. However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to retrieve Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships. On board is Jirall, who has been given a cursed sword by Zangurak for him to kill Zael. Realizing the sword is affecting Jirall's mind, Zael tries to save Jirall by disarming him, but the cursed sword moves unaided and kills Jirall. Meanwhile, the Gurak take Calista to Zangurak.\n\nThe mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally injured by a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan blood and the Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had commanded the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with the ultimate goal of using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.\n\nThe initial concepts for \"The Last Story\" came to Hironobu Sakaguchi after his departure from Square (now Square Enix) in 2003. After a period working on games at his new studio Mistwalker, Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends. Later, he elaborated that \"The Last Story\" was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of \"Blue Dragon\" (2006) and \"Lost Odyssey\" (2007): while they tried to innovate with the story, they kept the gameplay very traditional. Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game, and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto, a designer from AQ Interactive who had worked with Sakaguchi on \"Blue Dragon\". They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market, and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating something new. In an interview with IGN, Sakaguchi said that development took three years: the first year was devoted to a trial-and-error development process devoted to the battle system. A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with Gamasutra. According to Matsumoto, the team leads went to the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) each year and were assured that their game was in-step with current gameplay trends. Production of \"The Last Story\" was a collaboration between Mistwalker, AQ Interactive and Nintendo, and was Sakaguchi's first work as a director since \"Final Fantasy V\" (1992). The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010, and according to Sakaguchi was \"complete\" by December that year.\n\nAlthough Sakaguchi's previous RPGs from Mistwalker had been released for the Xbox 360, \"The Last Story\" was created for the Wii. According to Sakaguchi, this was because Nintendo's Shinji Hatano shared their vision of a role-playing game that did not follow genre conversions, and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration. After being contacted regarding both \"The Last Story\" and fellow Wii ARPG \"Xenoblade Chronicles\", Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a \"romanticist approach\". When explaining why \"The Last Story\" was exclusive to the Wii, Sakaguchi said that it was because a large proportion of the late development staff, including the testers, came from Nintendo. In a later interview, he said that working with the Wii, which did not use high-definition graphics, presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions. Despite this, the team aimed to create a game that would look good when compared to games on high-definition consoles. Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game, which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game. He also stated that Nintendo's creative and development aid in fine-tuning the game was the reason for its extended development.\n\nThe basic story was conceived by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script was written by Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki. The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested something that would be out of character for one of the cast. According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was \"shot down\" by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters. Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments. The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation. Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the \"all-important drama that takes place between a man and a woman\", but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same. Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both \"Uncharted\" and television series \"The West Wing\". The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking doors open, and how his companions would comment on how he always did this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior. Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation. The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines. The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.\n\nThe characters were designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka had a lot of leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.\n\nDeveloping the gameplay began at the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be \"order\" and \"chaos\": whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the trial-and-error period for it running on for a long time. The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types. A concept that did not make it into the final game was \"Replay\": after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.\n\nMatsumoto was responsible for the level design. While preparing destructible elements within the environment, the staff took care that they could be easily recognized by the player. So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs, the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael, so the player would be kept within his point of view. A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay, which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re-balancing it. The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as \"chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords, magic and guns or ally command systems\". The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system's design. This concept was a hangover from the game's origins as a science fiction story. For the multiplayer, Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players to be rude to one-another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single-player campaign. This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game.\n\nThe game's music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a long-time collaborator with Sakaguchi who had worked on the \"Final Fantasy\" series, \"Blue Dragon\" and \"Lost Odyssey\". Uematsu initially had a rough time: the first three pieces of music he sent were rejected, and then Uematsu did not respond for some time. Sakaguchi worried that Uematsu might quit the project altogether. In fact, Uematsu realized Sakaguchi's wishes for the title and had to rethink his approach entirely. With the second submission, Uematsu stated that he might leave if his music still did not fit, but it did and he remained as composer. In contrast to the majority of his earlier works, which made heavy use of purely melodic pieces and \"jogging music\", Uematsu concentrated on a mixture between video game and film music to emphasize emotion and ambient sounds. He also worked to avoid creating signature jingles and fanfares. The most difficult pieces for him were battle tracks: the main battle theme was seven minutes long, but broken into small pieces that varied depending on situations and could be cued in depending on what was happening on the battlefield. The game's theme song, , was composed by Uematsu with lyrics by Sakaguchi. Its lyrics are about the world someone is in not being where they are meant to be, with the phrase \"going home\" being used progressively through the song. According to Sakaguchi, the theme was quite personal for him, and also displays the \"foreignness\" of the game.\n\nSakaguchi revealed that he was working on a new game in July 2009. Initially targeted for a reveal that year, this was delayed for unknown reasons into 2010. The game was announced by Nintendo in January 2010, alongside its platform and logo. It was released on January 27, 2011. Despite prompting interest from genre fans in the west since its official announcement, shortly before its Japanese release, Nintendo announced that \"The Last Story\" would remain exclusive to Japan. Nintendo explained that the effort involved in bringing \"The Last Story\" overseas would be too much work on top of other important releases such as \"Kirby's Epic Yarn\" and titles for the Nintendo 3DS. Despite this, Nintendo stated that there was a strong possibility of it releasing in the United Kingdom due to its growing RPG market. It was officially announced for Europe in June 2011. The European localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe, using the same team that had done \"Xenoblade Chronicles\". British voice actors were used for the dubbing, making use of various accents for the different characters. Some of the original programmers helped with the implementation of the localization, and it underwent unspecified adjustments. The game released in Europe on February 24, 2012. It received a limited edition, featuring a CD with seven music tracks and an artbook. It was also released in Australia on February 23.\n\nAfter a continued lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started a campaign to raise awareness for \"The Last Story\", \"Xenoblade Chronicles\", and another Wii RPG titled \"Pandora's Tower\". This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated that there were no plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought \"The Last Story\" would never make it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about \"The Last Story\", and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.\n\nThe game’s story received generally positive reactions from critics, although some criticized it for a lack of originality in the RPG genre. While they did not comment much on the story, \"Famitsu\" called \"The Last Story\" \"very classical RPG\". Eurogamer's Martin Robinson found the characters the most appealing part of the game, an opinion shared by Francesco Dagostino of 1UP.com, who particularly cited Syrenne's portrayal. GameSpot's Mark Walton shared this opinion while also praising the story's epic scale. IGN's Keza MacDonald said that it presented a good story and characters within familiar themes and settings. \"Edge Magazine\" found the story fairly traditional despite a strong cast and emotional power, while Matthew Castle of \"Computer and Video Games\" praised the effort made to flesh out the party members in side-missions despite referring to the main narrative as \"tedious\". GameTrailers, while noting the familiar plotlines the game explored, said that \"The Last Story\" handled its plot better than others of its kind, praising its character development. \"Game Informer\"'s Joe Juba was fairly critical, finding the story overly predictable and the characters shallow. Jason Wishnov of G4 was also critical of the characters and plot, calling the former \"one-note\" despite convincing camaraderie and well-written in-game dialogue, and the latter impeded by problems with formulaic writing despite some late-game twists. Simon Parkin, writing for \"Official Nintendo Magazine\", found the characters likable despite a predictable story; \"Nintendo Power\" shared points of praise with other reviewers, in addition to praising Zael and Calista's romance, saying that it held the game together during some mid-game stumbles. RPGamer's Alex Fuller said that the story was great despite it using well-worn cliches. Multiple critics gave high praise to the British-voiced localization.\n\nThe gameplay was generally well received. \"Famitsu\" praised the battle system, saying that it was friendly towards casual gamers. MacDonald likewise praised the battle system as \"one of the best combat systems I've played with in any RPG, Japanese or otherwise\". Walton found the battle system fun and enjoyed the amount of side quests, while Dagostino was highly positive about the game's successful efforts in moving away from genre tradition. Juba enjoyed the multiplayer and praised the game for moving away from the genre's traditional battle systems despite faults with their overall implementation, while Robinson found the gameplay suffered from the design goals that had fueled its creation. Castle was positive about the variety of gameplay and tactical elements despite some stiff combat mechanics, but noted the inability to alter difficulty being a point against the game. Wishnov praised the fast pace and variety of the combat, but found that more cumbersome RPG elements and a lack of overall control negatively impacted the experience. GameTrailers generally praised about the way gameplay and combat was handled despite some \"clunky\" moments, but was less positive the multiplayer option's balance and variety. \"Edge\", while noting multiple core similarities with other games within the genre, found that other elements came together to make it a more fast-paced cinematic experience than other traditional RPGs; Fuller enjoyed the battle system, but thought that it lacked challenge and had difficulties with the camera. Parkin was generally positive about combat, particularly about the blending and gradual growth of character abilities, while \"Nintendo Power\" called the battle system \"satisfying\" and the multiplayer \"surprisingly worthwhile\". Multiple reviewers commented on the game's linear structure, with opinions ranging from indifferent to negative.\n\nOpinions on the game's visual style varied. Walton called the game's visuals \"some of the best ever seen on the Wii\", which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald. Castle was generally positive about the game's aesthetics, citing the water effects as particularly good. \"Edge\" was fairly mixed, saying that well-done environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations. Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be \"ugly and muddy in comparison\"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing them, said that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed. GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments \"remarkable\" for the Wii hardware despite a lack of scale, while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand-out moments. \"Nintendo Power\" said that the graphics gave the game's setting an \"authentic\" appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their \"sepia tone\". Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers. Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics.\nUpon release, \"The Last Story\" topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units. Assessments by Media Create stated that while the game had achieved higher sales than \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers who already owned a Wii console. By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15. After the release of \"The Last Story\" in North America, Xseed Games released a statement saying that \"The Last Story\" was their most successful title to date, with its Premium Edition selling out quickly and needing to be replaced with a different special edition.\n\nUpon its release, the game received critical acclaim, earning an aggregate score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 61 critic reviews. It was cited by GamesRadar and \"Forbes\" as one of the best games of the year. Similarly, 1UP.com named it as one of the top ten best RPGs on the Wii. In addition it was nominated for \"Best Wii/Wii U Game\" at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, and \"RPG of the Year\" in GameSpot's RPG of the Year award category. In IGN's \"Best of 2012\" awards, it was awarded as \"Best Wii U/Wii Sound\".\n\n"}

The word \"trope\" has also come to be used for describing commonly recurring literary and rhetorical devices, motifs or clichés in creative works.\n\nThe term \"trope\" derives from the Greek (\"tropos\"), \"turn, direction, way\", derived from the verb τρέπειν (\"trepein\"), \"to turn, to direct, to alter, to change\". Tropes and their classification were an important field in classical rhetoric. The study of tropes has been taken up again in modern criticism, especially in deconstruction. Tropological criticism (not to be confused with tropological reading, a type of biblical exegesis) is the historical study of tropes, which aims to \"define the dominant tropes of an epoch\" and to \"find those tropes in literary and non-literary texts\", an interdisciplinary investigation of which Michel Foucault was an \"important exemplar\".\n\nA specialized use is the medieval amplification of texts from the liturgy, such as in the \"Kyrie Eleison\" (\"Kyrie, / magnae Deus potentia, / liberator hominis, / transgressoris mandati, / eleison\"). The most important example of such a trope is the \"Quem quaeritis?\", an amplification before the \"Introit\" of the Easter Sunday service and the source for liturgical drama. This particular practice came to an end with the Tridentine Mass, the unification of the liturgy in 1570 promulgated by Pope Pius V.\n\nRhetoricians have closely analyzed the great variety of \"twists and turns\" used in poetry and literature and have provided an extensive list of precise labels for these poetic devices. These include:\n\n\nFor a longer list, see Figure of speech: Tropes.\n\nKenneth Burke has called metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony the \"four master tropes\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "73257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73257", "title": "V for Vendetta", "text": "V for Vendetta\n\nV for Vendetta is a British graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony Weare). Initially published in black and white as an ongoing serial in the short-lived UK anthology \"Warrior\", it morphed into a ten-issue limited series published by DC Comics. Subsequent collected editions have been typically published under DC's more specialized imprint Vertigo. The story depicts a dystopian and post-apocalyptic near-future history version of the United Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a nuclear war in the 1980s which had devastated most of the rest of the world. The Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist Norsefire political party has exterminated its opponents in concentration camps and rules the country as a police state.\n\nThe comics follow its title character and protagonist, V, an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, as he begins an elaborate and theatrical revolutionist campaign to kill his former captors, bring down the fascist state and convince the people to abandon democracy in favour of anarchy, while inspiring a young woman, Evey Hammond, to be his protégé.\n\nDC Comics had sold more than 500,000 copies of the books in the United States as of 2006. Warner Bros. released a film adaptation of the same title in 2005.\n\nThe first episodes of \"V for Vendetta\" appeared in black-and-white between 1982 and 1985, in \"Warrior\", a British anthology comic published by Quality Communications. The strip was one of the least popular in that title; editor/publisher Dez Skinn remarked, \"If I’d have given each character their own title, the failures would have certainly outweighed the successes, with the uncompromising 'V for Vendetta' probably being an early casualty. But with five or six strips an issue, regular [readers] only needed two or three favorites to justify their buying the title.\"\n\nWhen the publishers cancelled \"Warrior\" in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the \"Warrior\" stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in \"Warrior\" No. 27 and No. 28. Tony Weare drew one chapter (\"Vincent\") and contributed additional art to two others (\"Valerie\" and \"The Vacation\"); Steve Whitaker and Siobhan Dodds worked as colourists on the entire series.\n\nThe entire series has appeared collected in paperback () and hardback () form, including Moore's \"Behind the Painted Smile\" essay and two \"interludes\" outside the central continuity. Later collections include reissued paperbacks, published in the US by DC's Vertigo imprint () and in the UK by Titan Books (). A new hardback edition was published in 2005 featuring improved printing and coloring. In August 2009 DC published a slipcased Absolute Edition (); this includes newly coloured \"silent art\" pages (full-page panels containing no dialogue) from the series' original run, which have not previously appeared in any previous collected edition.\n\nDavid Lloyd's paintings for \"V for Vendetta\" in \"Warrior\" first appeared in black and white.\n\nIn writing \"V for Vendetta\", Moore drew upon an idea for a strip titled \"The Doll\", which he had submitted in 1975 at the age of 22 to DC Thomson. In the essay \"Behind the Painted Smile\",\n\nYears later, Skinn reportedly invited Moore to create a dark mystery strip with artist David Lloyd. \"V for Vendetta\" was intended to recreate something similar to their popular Marvel UK Night Raven strip in a 1930s noir. They chose against doing historical research and instead set the story in the near future rather than the recent past.\n\nThen \"V for Vendetta\" emerged, putting the emphasis on \"V\" rather than \"Vendetta\". David Lloyd developed the idea of dressing V as Guy Fawkes after previous designs followed the conventional superhero look. During the preparation of the story, Moore made a list of what he wanted to bring into the plot, which he reproduced in \"Behind the Painted Smile\":Orwell. Huxley. Thomas Disch. \"Judge Dredd\". Harlan Ellison's \"\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman\", \"Catman\" and \"The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World\" by the same author. Vincent Price's \"Dr. Phibes\" and \"Theatre of Blood\". David Bowie. \"The Shadow\". \"Night Raven\". \"Batman\". \"Fahrenheit 451\". The writings of the New Worlds school of science fiction. Max Ernst's painting \"Europe After the Rain\". Thomas Pynchon. The atmosphere of British Second World War films. \"The Prisoner\". Robin Hood. Dick Turpin... The influence of such a wide number of references has been thoroughly demonstrated in academic studies, above which dystopian elements stand out, especially the similarity with George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" in several stages of the plot.\n\nThe political climate of Britain in the early 1980s also influenced the work, with Moore positing that Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government would \"obviously lose the 1983 elections\", and that an incoming Michael Foot-led Labour government, committed to complete nuclear disarmament, would allow the United Kingdom to escape relatively unscathed after a limited nuclear war. However, Moore felt that fascists would quickly subvert a post-holocaust Britain. V, an anarchist, initially murders members of the fascist government, but as the story develops, Moore deliberately made V's actions \"very, very morally ambiguous\" with the aim that \"I didn't want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to tell people to think.\"\n\nMoore's scenario remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:Naïveté can also be detected in my supposition that it would take something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell you how reliable we were in our roles as Cassandras.\n\nThe February 1999 issue of \"The Comics Journal\" ran a poll on \"The Top 100 (English-Language) Comics of the Century\": \"V for Vendetta\" reached 83rd place.\n\nOn Guy Fawkes Night in London in 1997, a financially desperate 16-year-old, Evey Hammond, sexually solicits men who are actually members of the state secret police, called \"The Finger\". Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by V, a cloaked anarchist wearing a mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the Houses of Parliament before bringing Evey to his contraband-filled underground lair, the \"Shadow Gallery\". Evey tells V her life story, which reveals that a global nuclear war in the late 1980s has since triggered the rise of England's fascist government, Norsefire.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force—\"the Nose\"—begins investigating V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including \"the Finger,\" led by Derek Almond, and \"the Head,\" embodied by Adam Susan: the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's \"Fate\" computer system. Finch's case thickens when V mentally deranges Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality; forces the suicide of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a paedophile priest; and prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at a former Norsefire \"resettlement camp\" near Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that V—a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments—was able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers for what they did. Finch reports these findings to Susan, and suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.\n\nFour months later, V breaks into Jordan Tower, the home of Norsefire's propaganda department, \"the Mouth\"—led by Roger Dascombe—to broadcast a speech that calls on the people to resist the government. V escapes using an elaborate diversion that results in Dascombe's death. Finch is soon introduced to Peter Creedy, the new head of the Finger, who provokes Finch to strike him and thus get sent on a forced vacation. All this time, Evey has moved on with her life, becoming romantically involved with a much older man named Gordon. Evey and Gordon unknowingly cross paths with Rose Almond, the widow of the recently killed Derek. After Derek's death, Rose reluctantly began a relationship with Dascombe, but now, with both of her lovers murdered, she is forced to perform demoralizing burlesque work, increasing her hatred of the unsupportive government.\n\nWhen a Scottish gangster named Ally Harper murders Gordon, a vengeful Evey interrupts a meeting between Harper and Creedy, the latter of whom is buying the support of Harper's thugs in preparation for a coup d'état. Evey attempts to shoot Harper, but is suddenly abducted and then imprisoned. Amidst interrogation and torture, Evey finds an old letter hidden in her cell by an inmate named Valerie Page, a film actress who was imprisoned and executed for being a lesbian.\n\nEvey's interrogator finally gives her a choice of collaboration or death; inspired by Valerie, Evey refuses to collaborate, and, expecting to be executed, is instead told that she is free. Stunned, Evey learns that her supposed imprisonment is in fact a hoax constructed by V so that she could experience an ordeal similar to the one that shaped him at Larkhill. He reveals that Valerie was a real Larkhill prisoner who died in the cell next to his and that the letter is not a fake. Evey forgives V, who has hacked into the government's \"Fate\" computer system and started emotionally manipulating Adam Susan with mind games. Consequently, Susan, who has formed a bizarre romantic attachment to the computer, is beginning to descend into madness.\n\nThe following 5 November (1998), V blows up the Post Office Tower and Jordan Tower, killing \"the Ear\" leader Brian Etheridge; in addition to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy's men and Harper's associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey that he has not yet achieved what he calls the \"Land of Do-as-You-Please\", meaning a functional anarchistic society, and considers the current chaotic situation an interim period of \"Land of Take-What-You-Want\". Finch has been mysteriously absent and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the \"Fate\" computer all along, which would explain V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes LSD to conjure up memories of his own devastated past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned Victoria Station, which he enters.\n\nV takes Finch by surprise, resulting in a scuffle which sees Finch shoot V and V wound Finch with a knife. V claims that he cannot be killed since he is only an idea and that \"ideas are bulletproof\"; regardless, V is indeed mortally wounded and returns to the Shadow Gallery deeper within, dying in Evey's arms. Evey considers unmasking V, but decides not to, realising that V is not an identity but a symbol. She then assumes V's identity, donning one of his spare costumes. Finch sees the large amount of blood that V has left in his wake and deduces that he has mortally wounded V. Occurring concurrently to this, Creedy has been pressuring Susan to appear in public, hoping to leave him exposed. Sure enough, as Susan stops to shake hands with Rose during a parade, she shoots him in the head in vengeance for the death of her husband and the life she has had to lead since then. Following Rose's arrest, Creedy assumes emergency leadership of the country, and Finch emerges from the subway proclaiming V's death.\n\nDue to his LSD-induced epiphany, Finch leaves his position within \"the Nose\". The power struggle between the remaining leaders results in all of their deaths: Harper betrays and kills Creedy at the behest of Helen Heyer (wife of \"the Eye\" leader Conrad Heyer, who had outbid Creedy for Harper's loyalty), and Harper and Conrad Heyer kill each other during a fight precipitated by Heyer's discovery that his wife Helen had had an affair with Harper.\n\nWith the fate of the top government officials unknown to the public, Stone acts as leader of the police forces deployed to ensure that the riots are contained should V still be alive and make his promised public announcement. Evey appears to a crowd, dressed as V, announcing the destruction of 10 Downing Street the following day and telling the crowd they must \"...choose what comes next. Lives of your own, or a return to chains\", whereupon a general insurrection begins. Evey destroys 10 Downing Street by blowing up an Underground train containing V's body, in the style of an explosive Viking funeral. She abducts Stone, apparently to train him as her successor. The book ends with Finch quietly observing the chaos raging in the city and walking down an abandoned motorway whose lights have all gone out.\n\nThe two conflicting political viewpoints of anarchism and fascism dominate the story.\n\nMoore stated in an interview that V is designed as an enigma, as Moore \"didn't want to tell people what to think\" but wanted them to consider some extreme events that have recurred throughout history.\n\nIn December 2005 Warner Bros. released a feature-film adaptation of \"V for Vendetta\", directed by James McTeigue from a screenplay by the Wachowskis. Natalie Portman stars as Evey Hammond and Hugo Weaving as V.\n\nAlan Moore distanced himself from the film, as he has with other screen adaptation of his works. He ended co-operation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the movie.\n\nAfter reading the script, Moore remarked:\nHe later adds that if the Wachowskis had wanted to protest about what was going on in the United States, then they should have used a political narrative that directly addressed the issues of the USA, similar to what Moore had done before with Britain. The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual anarchism in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer Joel Silver reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut \"superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world,\" a simplification that goes against Moore's own statements about V's role in the story.\n\nCo-author and illustrator David Lloyd, by contrast, embraced the adaptation. In an interview with \"Newsarama\" he states:\n\nSteve Moore (no relation to Alan Moore) wrote a novelisation of the film's screenplay, published in 2006.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 was developing a television series based on the comic book.\n\nSince the release of the film adaptation, hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks from the books and film have been sold every year since the film's release, as of 2011. Time Warner owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask.\n\nAnonymous, an Internet-based group, has adopted the Guy Fawkes mask as their symbol (in reference to an Internet meme). Members wore such masks, for example, during Project Chanology's protests against the Church of Scientology in 2008. Alan Moore had this to say about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif adopted from his comic \"V for Vendetta\", in an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\":\nAccording to \"Time\", the protesters' adoption of the mask has led to it becoming the top-selling mask on Amazon.com, selling hundreds of thousands a year.\n\nThe film allegedly inspired some of the Egyptian youth before and during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. \n\nOn 23 May 2009, protesters dressed up as V and set off a fake barrel of gunpowder outside Parliament while protesting over the issue of British MPs' expenses.\n\nDuring the Occupy Wall Street and other ongoing Occupy protests, the mask appeared internationally as a symbol of popular revolution. Artist David Lloyd stated: \"The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\"\n\nOn 17 November 2012 police officials in Dubai warned against wearing Guy Fawkes masks painted with the colours of the UAE flag during any celebration associated with the UAE National Day (2 December), declaring such use an illegal act after masks went on sale in online shops for 50 DHS.\n\n"}
{"id": "19705522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19705522", "title": "Venetic theory", "text": "Venetic theory\n\nThe Venetic theory () is an autochthonist theory of the origin of the Slovenes that denies the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps in the 6th century, claiming that proto-Slovenes (also regarded as the Veneti people by the proponents of this theory) have inhabited the region since ancient times. Although it has been rejected by scholars, it has been an influential alternative explanation of the Slovenian ethnogenesis. During the 1980s and 1990s, it gained wide attention in Slovenia and the former Yugoslavia. \n\nA version of this theory states that most of Central Europe and portions of today's northern Turkey were originally inhabited by a single people - the Veneti - a people that were subsequently dispersed by several invasion from the North in the form of Celtic and Germanic migrations and by the push northwards of the Roman Empire. According to this variant, the Armorican Veneti, the Adriatic Veneti, the Vistula Veneti as well as portion of the Illyrians and the Veneti of northern Turkey were all related people who spoke the same or similar language. The theory also counts among the Veneti several peoples of North Spain, Northern coastal France as well as portions of Denmark, Wales and of Ireland. In this version, most of the northern Slavs as well as the Slovenes and some Croats are the last remnant the original European Veneti. \n\nThe theory was advanced in the mid 1980s by a group of Slovenian authors, notably Jožko Šavli, Matej Bor and Ivan Tomažič. In a book published in 1984, the three authors proposed an alternative view on the ethnogenesis of the Slovene people: they rejected the notion that the Slovenes were descended from Slavs that settled the area in the 6th century, claiming that the ancestors of the modern Slovenes were in fact a pre-Roman people they call Veneti (which would include the Adriatic Veneti, the Baltic Veneti, the Pannonians, the Noricans and some other peoples that traditional historiography identified either as Celts or Illyrians). According to the Venetic theory, the ancient Veneti spoke a proto-Slavic language from which modern Slovene and West Slavic languages emerged.\n\nThere were several similar antecedents to the Venetic theory. The priest Davorin Trstenjak (1817–1890) claimed that the Slovenes were ancient indigenous inhabitants of Slovenia and that Slavs had ruled Europe, Africa, and Asia in antiquity; however, he gave up these claims after he found they were scientifically untenable. The lawyer Henrik Tuma (1858–1935) declared that the Slovenes had been the first humans to settle Europe. The writer and journalist Franc Jeza (1916–1984) asserted that the Slovenes had Swedish origins.\n\nThe Venetic theory is based on several different arguments. One is the traditional Germanic denomination of several Slavic peoples as Wends (Proto-Germanic *Wénethōz > ); this tradition has remained in the archaic German name for the Sorbs (\"Wenden\") and Slovenes (\"Windischen\" or \"Winden\"). Some medieval chroniclers also equated ancient Veneti with Slavs. The second argument on which the theory is based are supposed Slavic (proto-Slovene) toponyms found throughout Central Europe and Northern Italy; these toponyms have been studied by Šavli. The third argument is based on the ancient Venetic inscriptions found in North-Eastern Italy and in the Slovenian Littoral, which Bor interpreted as being Slavic.\n\nThe Venetic theory created a great controversy in the Slovenian and Yugoslav public in the late 1980s. Several of the most prominent Slovenian historians, such as Bogo Grafenauer and Peter Štih, entered into open polemics with the creators of the theory. On the other hand, many prominent public figures publicly supported the claims advanced by the Venetic theory, among them the designer Oskar Kogoj, authors Zorko Simčič and Lucijan Vuga, and politician Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti. In the 1990s, the theory gained institutional support of the World Slovenian Congress, publishing much of the literature advocating the theory and organizing international symposiums. The theory has also gained support in some nationalist circles. However, the theory has been challenged by certain writers, and it has been rejected by both mainstream linguists and historians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "407800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407800", "title": "William Tell", "text": "William Tell\n\nWilliam Tell (in the four languages of Switzerland: ; ; ; ) is a folk hero of Switzerland. \nAccording to the legend, Tell was an expert marksman with the crossbow who assassinated Albrecht Gessler, a tyrannical reeve of the Habsburg dukes positioned in Altdorf, in the canton of Uri. Tell's defiance and tyrannicide encouraged the population to open rebellion and a pact against the foreign rulers with neighbouring Schwyz and Unterwalden, marking the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy.\nSet in the early 14th century (traditional date 1307, during the rule of Albert of Habsburg), the first written records of the legend date to the latter part of the 15th century, when the Swiss Confederacy was gaining military and political influence.\nTell is a central figure in Swiss national historiography, along with Arnold von Winkelried the hero of Sempach (1386). He was important as a symbol during the formative stage of modern Switzerland in the 19th century, known as the period of Restoration and Regeneration, as well as in the wider history of 18th- to 19th-century Europe as a symbol of resistance against aristocratic rule, especially in the Revolutions of 1848 against a House of Habsburg which still ruled Austria five hundred years later.\n\nThe first reference to Tell, as yet without a specified given name, appears in the \"White Book of Sarnen\" (German: \"Weisses Buch von Sarnen\"). This volume was written in c. 1474 by Hans Schriber, state secretary (\"Landschreiber\") Obwalden. \nIt mentions the Rütli oath (German: \"Rütlischwur\") and names Tell as one of the conspirators of the Rütli, whose heroic tyrannicide triggered the Burgenbruch rebellion.\n\nAn equally early account of Tell is found in the \"Tellenlied\", a song composed in the 1470s, with its oldest extant manuscript copy dating to 1501. The song begins with the Tell legend, which it presents as the origin of the Confederacy, calling Tell the \"first confederate\". The narrative includes Tell's apple shot, his preparation of a second arrow to shoot Gessler, and his escape, but it does not mention any assassination of Gessler.\nThe text then enumerates the cantons of the Confederacy, and says was expanded with \"current events\" during the course of the Burgundy Wars, ending with the death of Charles the Bold in 1477.\n\nAegidius Tschudi, writing c. 1570, presents an extended version of the legend. Still essentially based on the account in the \"White Book\", Tschudi adds further detail.\nTschudi is known to habitually have \"fleshed out\" his sources, so that all detail from Tschudi not found in the earlier accounts may be suspected of being Tschudi's invention.\nSuch additional detail includes Tell's given name Wilhelm, and his being a native of Bürglen, Uri in the Schächental, the precise date of the apple-shot, given as 18 November 1307 as well as the account of Tell's death in 1354.\nIt is Tschudi's version that became influential in early modern Switzerland and entered public consciousness as the \"William Tell\" legend. According to Tschudi's account, William Tell was known as a strong man, a mountain climber, and an expert shot with the crossbow. In his time, the House of Habsburg emperors of Austria were seeking to dominate Uri, and Tell became one of the conspirators of Werner Stauffacher who vowed to resist Habsburg rule. Albrecht Gessler was the newly appointed Austrian \"Vogt\" of Altdorf, Switzerland. He raised a pole under the village lindentree, hung his hat on top of it, and demanded that all the townsfolk bow before it.\n\nIn Tschudi's account, on 18 November 1307, Tell visited Altdorf with his young son. He passed by the hat, but publicly refused to bow to it, and was consequently arrested. Gessler was intrigued by Tell's famed marksmanship, but resentful of his defiance, so he devised a cruel punishment. Tell and his son were both to be executed; however, he could redeem his life by shooting an apple off the head of his son Walter in a single attempt. Tell split the apple with a bolt from his crossbow. Gessler then noticed that Tell had removed two crossbow bolts from his quiver, so he asked why. Tell was reluctant to answer, but Gessler promised that he would not kill him; he replied that, had he killed his son, he would have killed Gessler with the second bolt. Gessler was furious and ordered Tell to be bound, saying that he had promised to spare his life, but would imprison him for the remainder of his life.\n\nTschudi's continues that Tell was being carried in Gessler's boat to the dungeon in the castle at Küssnacht when a storm broke on Lake Lucerne, and the guards were afraid that their boat would sink. They begged Gessler to remove Tell's shackles so that he could take the helm and save them. Gessler gave in, but Tell steered the boat to a rocky place and leaped out. The site is known in the \"White Book\" as the \"Tellsplatte\" (\"Tell's slab\"); it has been marked by a memorial chapel since the 16th century. Tell ran cross-country to Küssnacht with Gessler in pursuit. Tell assassinated him using the second crossbow bolt, along a stretch of the road cut through the rock between Immensee and Küssnacht, which is known as the \"Hohle Gasse.\" Tell's act sparked a rebellion, which led to the formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy. According to Tschudi, Tell fought again against Austria in the 1315 Battle of Morgarten. Tschudi also has an account of Tell's death in 1354, according to which he was killed trying to save a child from drowning in the Schächental River in Uri.\n\nThere are a number of sources for the Tell legend later than the earliest account in the \"White Book of Sarnen\" but earlier than Tschud's version of ca. 1570.\n\nThese include the account in the chronicle of Melchior Russ from Lucerne. Dated to 1482, this is an incoherent compilation of older writings, including the \"Song of the Founding of the Confederation\", Conrad Justinger's \"Bernese Chronicle,\" and the \"Chronicle of the State of Bern\" (in German, \"Chronik der Stadt Bern\").\nAnother early account is in Petermann Etterlin's \"Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation\" (German: \"Kronika von der loblichen Eydtgenossenschaft\") of 1507, the earliest printed version of the Tell story.\n\nThe \"Chronicon Helveticum\" was compiled by Aegidius Tschudi of Glarus in the years leading up to his death in early 1572. \nFor more than 150 years, it existed only in manuscript form, before finally being edited in 1734–1736. Therefore there is no clear \"date of publication\" of the chronicle, and its date of composition can only be given approximately, as \"ca. 1570\", or \"before 1572\". It is Tschudi's account of the legend, however, which became the major model for later writers, even prior to its edition in print in the 1730s, \n\nA widespread veneration of Tell, including sight-seeing excursions to the scenes of his deeds, can be ascertained for the early 16th century.\nHeinrich Brennwald in the early 16th century mentions the chapel (\"Tellskapelle\") on the site of Tell's leap from his captors' boat. Tschudi mentions a \"holy cottage\" (\"heilig hüslin\") built on the site of Gessler's assassination. Peter Hagendorf, a soldier in the Thirty Years' War, mentions a visit to 'the chapel where William Tell escaped' in his diary.\n\nThe first recorded Tell play (\"Tellspiel\"), known as the \"Urner Tellspiel\" (\"Tell Play of Uri\"), was probably performed in the winter of either 1512 or 1513 in Altdorf.\n\nThe church of Bürglen had a bell dedicated to Tell from 1581, and a nearby chapel has a fresco dated to 1582 showing Tell's death in the Schächenbach.\n\nThe Three Tells (\"die Drei Tellen\", also \"die Drei Telle\") were symbolic figures of the Swiss Peasant War of 1653. They expressed the hope of the subject population to repeat the success story of the rebellion against Habsburg in the early 14th century.\n\nBy the 18th century, the Drei Tellen had become associated with a sleeping hero legend. They were said to be asleep in a cave at the Rigi. The return of Tell in times of need was already foretold in the Tellenlied of 1653 and symbolically fulfilled in the impersonation of the Three Tells by costumed individuals, in one instance culminating in an actual assassination executed by these impersonators in historical costume.\n\nTell during the 16th century had become closely associated and eventually merged with the Rütlischwur legend, and the \"Three Tells\" represented the three conspirators or \"Eidgenossen\" Walter Fürst, Arnold von Melchtal and Werner Stauffacher.\n\nIn 1653, three men dressed in historical costume representing the Three Tells appeared in Schüpfheim. Other impersonations of the Three Tells also appeared in the Freie Ämter and in the Emmental.\n\nThe first impersonators of the Three Tells were Hans Zemp, Kaspar Unternährer of Schüpfheim and Ueli Dahinden of Hasle. They appeared at a number of important peasant conferences during the war, symbolizing the continuity of the present rebellion with the resistance movement against the Habsburg overlords at the origin of the Swiss Confederacy. Unternährer and Dahinden fled to the Entlebuch alps before the arrival of the troops of general Sebastian Peregrin Zwyers; Zemp escaped to the Alsace. After the suppression of the rebellion, the peasants voted for a tyrannicide, directly inspired by the Tell legend, attempting to kill the Lucerne Schultheiss Ulrich Dulliker.\n\nDahinden and Unternährer returned in their roles of Tells, joined by Hans Stadelmann replacing Zemp. In an ambush, they managed to injure Dulliker and killed a member of the Lucerne parliament, Caspar Studer. The assassination attempt — an exceptional act in the culture of the Old Swiss Confederacy — was widely recognized and welcomed among the peasant population, but its impact was not sufficient to rekindle the rebellion.\n\nEven though it did not have any direct political effect, its symbolic value was considerable, placing the Lucerne authorities in the role of the tyrant (Habsburg and Gessler) and the peasant population in that of the freedom fighters (Tell). The Three Tells after the deed went to mass, still wearing their costumes, without being molested. Dahinden and Unternährer were eventually killed in October 1653 by Lucerne troops under Colonel Alphons von Sonnenberg. In July 1654, Zemp betrayed his successor Stadelmann in exchange for pardon and Stadelmann was executed on 15 July 1654.\n\nThe Three Tells appear in a 1672 comedy by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.\nThe \"sleeping hero\" version of the Three Tells legend was published in \"Deutsche Sagen\" by the Brothers Grimm in 1816 (no. 298).\n\nThroughout the long nineteenth century, and into the World War II period, Tell was perceived as a symbol of rebellion against tyranny both in Switzerland and in Europe.\n\nAntoine-Marin Lemierre wrote a play inspired by Tell in 1766 and revived it in 1786. The success of this work established the association of Tell as a fighter against tyranny with the history of the French Revolution.\nThe French revolutionary fascination with Tell was reflected in Switzerland with the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. Tell became, as it were, the mascot of the short-lived republic, his figure being featured on its official seal. The French Navy also had a \"Tonnant\" class ship of the line named \"Guillaume Tell\", which was captured by the British Royal Navy in 1800.\n\nTschudi's \"Chronicon Helveticum\" continued to be taken at face value as a historiographical source well into the 19th century, \nso that Tschudi's version of the legend is not only used as a model in Friedrich Schiller's play \"William Tell\" (1804)\nbut is also reported in historiographical works of the time, including Johannes von Müller's \"History of the Swiss Confederation\" (German: \"Geschichte Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft\", 1780). \n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe learned of the Tell saga during his travels through Switzerland between 1775 and 1795. He obtained a copy of Tschudi's chronicles and considered writing a play about Tell, but ultimately gave the idea to his friend Friedrich von Schiller, who in 1803–04 wrote the play \"Wilhelm Tell,\" first performed on 17 March 1804, in Weimar. \nSchiller's Tell is heavily inspired by the political events of the late 18th century, the French and American revolutions, in particular. Schiller's play was performed at Interlaken (the \"Tellspiele\") in the summers of 1912 to 1914, 1931 to 1939 and every year since 1947. In 2004 it was first performed in Altdorf itself.\n\nGioachino Rossini used Schiller's play as the basis for his 1829 opera \"William Tell.\" The \"William Tell Overture\" is one of his best-known and most frequently imitated pieces of music; in the 20th century, the \"coda\" of the \"Overture\" became the theme for the radio, television, and motion picture incarnations of The Lone Ranger, a fictional American frontier hero.\n\nIn 1836 the first William Tell patterned playing cards were produced in Pest, Hungary. They were inspired by Schiller's play and made during tense relations with the ruling Habsburgs. The cards became popular throughout the Austrian Empire during the Revolution of 1848.\n\nIn 1858, the Swiss Colonization Society, a group of Swiss and German immigrants to the United States, founded its first (and only) planned city on the banks of the Ohio River in Perry County, Indiana. The town was originally dubbed Helvetia, but was quickly changed to Tell City to honor the legendary Swiss hero. The city became known for its manufacturing, especially of fine wood furniture. William Tell and symbols of an apple with an arrow through it are prominent in the town, which includes a bronze statue of Tell and his son, based on the one in Altdorf, Switzerland. The statue was erected on a fountain in front of city hall in 1974. Tell City High School uses these symbols in its crest or logo, and the sports teams are called \"The Marksmen.\" The William Tell Overture is often played by the school's pep band at high school games. Each August since 1958, Tell City's centennial year, the town has held \"Schweizer Fest,\" a community festival of entertainment, stage productions, historical presentations, carnival rides, beer garden, sporting events and class reunions, to honor its Swiss-German heritage. Many of the activities occur on the grounds of City Hall and Main Street, at the feet of the Tell statue.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, was inspired by Tell. Lamenting the negative reaction to his action, Booth wrote in his journal on 21 April 1865 \"with every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; For doing what Brutus was honored for and what made Tell a Hero. And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat.\"(He himself was shot to death, without standing trial, days later.)\n\nFollowing a national competition, won by Richard Kissling, Altdorf in 1895 erected a monument to its hero. Kissling casts Tell as a peasant and man of the mountains, with strong features and muscular limbs. His powerful hand rests lovingly on the shoulder of little Walter, but the apple is not shown. The depiction is in marked contrast with that used by the Helvetic Republic, where Tell is shown as a landsknecht rather than a peasant, with a sword at his belt and a feathered hat, bending down to pick up his son who is still holding the apple.\n\nThe first film about Tell was made by French director Charles Pathé in 1900; only a short fragment survives.\nA version of the legend was retold in P.G. Wodehouse's \"William Tell Told Again\" (1904), written in prose and verse with characteristic Wodehousian flair.\nThe design of the Federal 5 francs coin issued from 1922 features the bust of a generic \"mountain shepherd\" designed by Paul Burkard, but due to a similarity of the bust with Kissling's statue, in spite of the missing beard, it was immediately widely identified as Tell.\n\nAdolf Hitler was enthusiastic about Schiller's play, quoting it in his \"Mein Kampf,\" and approving of a German/Swiss co-production of the play in which Hermann Göring's mistress Emmy Sonnemann appeared as Tell's wife. However, on 3 June 1941, Hitler had the play banned. The reason for the ban is not known, but may have been related to the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1938 by young Swiss Maurice Bavaud (executed on 14 May 1941, and later dubbed \"a new William Tell\" by Rolf Hochhuth), or the subversive nature of the play. Hitler is reported to have exclaimed at a banquet in 1942: \"Why did Schiller have to immortalize that Swiss sniper!\"\n\nCharlie Chaplin parodies William Tell in his famous 1928 silent movie \"The Circus.\"\nSalvador Dalí painted \"The Old Age of William Tell\" and \"William Tell and Gradiva\" in 1931, and \"The Enigma of William Tell\" in 1933.\nSpanish playwright Alfonso Sastre re-worked the legend in 1955 in his \"Guillermo Tell tiene los ojos tristes\" (William Tell has sad eyes); it was not performed until the Franco regime in Spain ended.\n\nIn Switzerland, the importance of Tell had declined somewhat by the end of the 19th century, outside of Altdorf and Interlaken which established their tradition of performing Schiller's play in regular intervals in 1899 and 1912, respectively. \nDuring the World Wars, Tell was again revived, somewhat artificially, as a national symbol. \nFor example, in 1923 the Swiss Post introduced horns for their coach service based on the overture of Rossini's \"Tell\" opera, \nand in 1931, the image of a crossbow was introduced as a logo indicating Swiss products. The \"Tell-Museum\" in Bürglen, Uri, opened in 1966.\n\nAfter 1968, with ideological shift of academic mainstream from a liberal-radical to a deconstructivist leftist \noutlook, Swiss historians were looking to dismantle the foundational legends of Swiss statehood as unhistorical national myth.\nMax Frisch's \"William Tell for Schools\" (1971) deconstructs the legend by reversing the characters of the protagonists: Gessler is a well-meaning and patient administrator who is faced with the barbarism of a back-corner of the empire, while Tell is an irascible simpleton.\nTell still remains a popular figure in Swiss culture. According to a 2004 survey, a majority of Swiss believed that he actually existed.\n\n\"Schweizer Helden\" (\"Swiss Heroes\", English title \"Unlikely Heroes\") is a 2014 film about the performance of a simplified version of Schiller's play by asylum seekers in Switzerland.\n\nThe historicity of William Tell has been subject to debate. François Guillimann, a statesman of Fribourg and later historian and advisor of the Habsburg Emperor Rudolph II, wrote to Melchior Goldast in 1607: \"I followed popular belief by reporting certain details in my \"Swiss antiquities\" [published in 1598], but when I examine them closely the whole story seems to me to be pure fable.\"\n\nIn 1760, Simeon Uriel Freudenberger from Luzern anonymously published a tract arguing that the legend of Tell in all likelihood was based on the Danish saga of Palnatoki. A French edition of his book, written by Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller (\"Guillaume Tell, Fable danoise\"), was burnt in Altdorf.\n\nThe skeptical view of Tell's existence remained very unpopular. Friedrich von Schiller used Tschudi's version as the basis for his play \"Wilhelm Tell\" in 1804, interpreting Tell as a glorified patriot assassin. This interpretation became very popular, especially in Switzerland, where the Tell figure was used in the early 19th century as a \"national hero\" and identification figure in the Helvetic Republic, and later in the beginnings of the \"Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft\", the modern democratic federal state that developed. When historian Joseph Eutych Kopp dared to question the legend in the 1830s, his effigy was burnt on the \"Rütli\", a meadow above Lake Lucerne where—according to the legend—the oath was sworn that concluded the alliance between the founding cantons of the Swiss confederacy.\n\nIt has been mostly undisputed among historians since the second half of the 19th century that there is no evidence for Tell as a historical individual, let alone for the apple-shot story. \nDebate in the late 19th to 20th centuries mostly surrounded the extent of the \"historical nucleus\" in the chronistic traditions surrounding the early Confederacy.\nThe desire to defend the historicity of the \"Befreiungstradition\" (\"liberation tradition\") of Swiss history had a political component, as since the 17th century its celebration had become mostly confined to the Catholic cantons, so that the declaration of parts of the tradition as ahistorical was seen as an attack by the urban Protestant cantons on the rural Catholic cantons. \nThe decision, taken in 1891, to make 1 August the Swiss National Day is to be seen in this context, an ostentative move away from the traditional \"Befreiungstradition\" and the celebration of the deed of Tell to the purely documentary evidence of the Federal Charter of 1291. In this context, Wilhelm Öchsli was commissioned by the federal government with publishing a \"scientific account\" of the foundational period of the Confederacy in order to defend the choice of 1291 over 1307 (the traditional date of Tell's deed and the Rütlischwur) as the foundational date of the Swiss state.\nThe canton of Uri, in defiant reaction this decision taken at the federal level, erected the Tell Monument in Altdorf in 1895, with the date 1307 inscribed prominently on the base of the statue.\n\nLater proposals for the identification of Tell as a historical individual, such as a 1986 publication deriving the name \"Tell\" from the placename \"Tellikon\" (modern Dällikon in the Canton of Zürich), are outside of the historiographical mainstream.\n\nThe Tell legend has been compared to a number of other myths or legends, specifically in Norse mythology, involving a magical marksman coming to the aid of a suppressed people under the sway of a tyrant.\nThe story of a great outlaw successfully shooting an apple from his child's head is an archetype present in the story of Egil in the Thidreks saga (associated with the god Ullr in Eddaic tradition) as well as in the stories of Adam Bell from England, Palnatoki from Denmark and a story from Holstein.\n\nSuch parallels were pointed out as early as 1760 by Gottlieb Emanuel von Haller and the pastor Simeon Uriel Freudenberger in a book titled \"William Tell, a Danish Fable\" (German: \"Der Wilhelm Tell, ein dänisches Mährgen\"). This book offended Swiss citizens, and a copy of it was burnt publicly at the Altdorf square. Von Haller underwent a trial, but the authorities spared his life, as he made abject apologies.\n\nRochholz (1877) connects the similarity of the Tell legend to the stories of Egil and Palnatoki with the legends of a migration from Sweden to Switzerland during the Middle Ages. He also adduces parallels in folktales among the Finns and the Lapps (Sami). From pre-Christian Norse mythology, Rochholz compares Ullr, who bears the epithet of \"Boga-As\" (\"bow-god\"), Heimdall and also Odin himself, who according to the \"Gesta Danorum\" (Book 1, chapter 8.16) assisted Haddingus by shooting ten bolts from a crossbow in one shot, killing as many foes. Rochholz further compares Indo-European and oriental traditions and concludes (pp. 35–41) that the legend of the master marksman shooting an apple (or similar small target) was known outside the Germanic sphere (Germany, Scandinavia, England) and the adjacent regions (Finland and the Baltic) in India, Arabia, Persia and the Balkans (Serbia).\n\nThe Danish legend of Palnatoki, first attested in the twelfth-century \"Gesta Danorum\" by Saxo Grammaticus, is the earliest known parallel to the Tell legend. As with William Tell, Palnatoki is forced by the ruler (in this case King Harald Bluetooth) to shoot an apple off his son's head as proof of his marksmanship. \nA striking similarity between William Tell and Palnatoki is that both heroes take more than one arrow out of their quiver. When asked why he pulled several arrows out of his quiver, Palnatoki, too, replies that if he had struck his son with the first arrow, he would have shot King Harald with the remaining two arrows. \nAccording to Saxo, Palnatoki later joins Harald's son Swein Forkbeard in a rebellion and kills Harald with an arrow.\n\n\nNon-Swiss figures:\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8736223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8736223", "title": "Zellige", "text": "Zellige\n\nZellige (; ; also zelige or zellij) is mosaic tilework made from individually chiseled geometric tiles set into a plaster base. This form of Islamic art is one of the main characteristics of Moroccan architecture. It consists of geometrically patterned mosaics, used to ornament walls, ceilings, fountains, floors, pools and tables.\n\nThe Moorish art of zellige flourished during the Hispano-Moresque period (Azulejo) of the Maghreb and the area known as Al-Andalus (modern day Spain) between 711-1492. The technique was highly developed during the Nasrid dynasty and Merinid dynasty who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of Fes and Meknes in Morocco, remain the centers of this art.\n\nPatrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful geometric patterns. This framework of expression arose from the need of Islamic artists to create spatial decorations that avoided depictions of living things, consistent with the teachings of Islamic law.\n\nFez and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the Miocene grey clay of Fez. The clay from this region is primarily composed of Kaolinite. For Fez and Meknes, the clay composition is 2-56% clay minerals, calcite 3-29%. Meriam El Ouahabi states that:\n\nAs the colour palette of the zellige tiles increased over the centuries, it became possible to multiply the compositions \"ad infinitum\". The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are possible: the octagon combined with a cabochon, a star, a cross, etc. It is then moulded with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the corners cut to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave an area, bejmat, a paving stone of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.\n\n\"An encyclopedia could not contain the full array of complex, often individually varied patterns and the individually shaped, hand-cut tesserae, or furmah, found in zillij work. Star-based patterns are identified by their number of points—'itnashari for 12, 'ishrini for 20, arba' wa 'ishrini for 24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. The so-called khamsini, for 50 points, and mi'ini, for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, because geometry requires that the number of points of any star in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences based on five and on eight.) Within a single star pattern, variations abound—by the mix of colors, the size of the furmah, and the complexity and size of interspacing elements such as strapping, braids, or \"lanterns.\" And then there are all the non-star patterns— honeycombs, webs, steps and shoulders, and checkerboards. The Alhambra's interlocking zillij patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist M.C. Escher.\"\n\nThemes often employ Kufic script, as it fits well with the geometry of the mosaic tiles, and patterns often culminate centrally in the Rub El Hizb. The tessellations in the mosaics are currently of interest in academic research in the mathematics of art.\n\nThese studies require expertise not only in the fields of mathematics, art and art history, but also of computer science, computer modelling and software engineering, all used for the Hassan II Mosque.\nIslamic decoration and craftsmanship had a significant influence on Western art when Venetian merchants brought goods of many types back to Italy from the 14th century onwards.\n\nZellige making is considered an art in itself. The art is transmitted from generation to generation by \"maâlems\" (master craftsmen). A long training starts at childhood to implant the required skills.\n\nAssiduous attention to detail is needed when creating zellige. The small shapes (cut according to a precise radius gauge), painted and enamel covered pieces are then assembled in a geometrical structure as in a puzzle to form the completed mosaic. The process has not varied for a millennium, though conception and design has started using new technologies such as data processing.\n\n\n\n"}
