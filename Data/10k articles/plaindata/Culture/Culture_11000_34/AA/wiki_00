Union of India is a landmark Indian case decided by the Delhi High Court, which for the first time upheld the moral right of an author under the Indian Copyright Act and awarded damages. The government was also asked to return his mural.\n\nThe plaintiff, Amar Nath Sehgal is a renowned artist and sculptor, who created a mural in the lobby of Vigyan Bhawan, Delhi on the direction of appropriate authority. In the year 1957, the Government of India commissioned Mr. Sehgal for creating a bronze mural for Vigyan Bhavan, the most prominent International Convention Hall in Delhi. The Bronze sculpture so commissioned, of about 140 ft. span and 40 ft. sweep took five years to complete and was placed on the wall of the Lobby in the Convention hall. This embellishment on a national architecture became a part of the Indian art heritage. However, in 1979, the mural was pulled down and consigned to the store room of the Union without notice or permission or authorization of Amarnath. When Mr. Sehgal came to know of this ill treatment, he made representations to the government authorities for restoration of the mural, to no avail. As this act of destruction of the mural as it was improperly handled which cause minor damage to the sculpture. He filed a petition under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 in the Delhi High Court praying for an apology from the defendants, a permanent injunction on the defendants to restrain them from distorting, mutilating or damaging the plaintiff’s mural and damages to the tune of Rs. 50 lacs.\n\nThe Court termed the Moral rights as the soul of the author’s works. \"The author has a right to preserve, protect and nurture his creations through his moral rights. A creative individual is uniquely invested with the power and mystique of original genius, creating a privileged relationship between a creative author and his work.\"\n\nThe Court elucidated on the moral rights that flow from art and literary work .They are Identification right or attribution right, right to dissemination, Right to integrity that is to maintain the purity of work and right to withdraw from the publication of the work .The language of the Section 57 makes it possible to legally protect the cultural heritage of India through the moral rights of the artist. \"Intellectual property and knowledge are interconnected. Intellectual property embodies traditional thought and knowledge with value addition. Thus, physical destruction or loss of intellectual property has far reaching social consequence. Knowledge which has grown with it is also lost.\" Court ruled that moral rights in the work of art acquire the status of the cultural heritage of the nation and India being a signatory to many conventions , it would be the obligation of the state to protect such work.\n\nFurther, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 includes destruction of a work of art as a ground as it is the extreme form of mutilation and reduces the volume of the author’s creative corpus and affects his reputation prejudicially as being actionable under said section. Further, in relation to the work of an author, subject to the work attaining the status of a modern national treasure, the right would include an action to protect the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation.\n\nThe Court held that the plaintiff has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in the defendants. It was further held that the defendants have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated the integrity of the work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered the defendants to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with the defendants henceforth and ordered the defendants to pay damages with costs.\n\nThe decision taken by the single bench of the Delhi High Court was instrumental in determining the course of moral rights in the country. It also gave a broad construction to the term moral rights in the country, by not only providing for the right of the author in the case of any distortion, mutilation, modification or other act in relation to the work if such distortion etc. would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation but also ‘right of the author to receive the copyrighted work for the purposes of restoration and sell it’. It included within the moral right of integrity the right to protect an artistic work from outright destruction. \nThe interim decision in the case, given by Justice Jaspal Singh, given in favour of the plaintiff, restricted the Indian Government from causing any further loss to the plaintiff by destroying the property. The interim ruling, given in 1992, established two central points about the ambit of moral rights within India. Firstly, that the moral right of integrity under Indian Law can in fact protect an artistic work from outright destruction and secondly, that the Government has a duty of care towards artworks in its possession.\nThis gave rise to amendments in the Copyright Act in 1994. Even though the purported primary motive of the Government was to bring the Indian Act in conformity with the Berne Convention, the wording of the amendment seemed to be a direct reaction to the interim ruling. Under the amended Section 57, a legal claim by an author against unauthorized modifications to his work had to establish that the treatment of the work has been prejudicial to his honour or reputation. The revised Section 57 corresponded to Article 6bis of the Berne Convention and also provided that failure to display a work, or to display it in accordance with the wishes of the author, would not qualify as a violation of the author’s moral rights.\n\nIn light of this amendment in 1994, an important question that Justice Nandrajog needed to address was that of which law would be applicable to the final ruling, the pre amendment or post amendment Copyright Act. There were compelling arguments for both the sides, as the old provisions of the Copyright Act would apply because they governed the time when the acts of destruction occurred, and when the case was actually filed before the court. On the other hand, he could have said that the post amended provisions should apply because they reflected the currently policy of the Govt. and were actually in force at the time of the judgment. However, he sidestepped the question and chose neither of the paths, arguing that the law must be read to fulfil the higher objective of protecting our cultural heritage, in light of the many international treaties on cultural heritage that India is a signatory to. The artwork in question constituted an ‘outstanding work of art’ and in such cases there is an overriding obligation to protect their integrity, no matter which law is applied.\n\n"}

Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \"a story with a point.\"\n\nAnecdotes may be real or fictional; the anecdotal digression is a common feature of literary works, and even oral anecdotes typically involve subtle exaggeration and dramatic shape designed to entertain the listener. However, an anecdote is always presented as the recounting of a real incident, involving actual persons and usually in an identifiable place. In the words of Jurgen Heine, they exhibit \"a special realism\" and \"a claimed historical dimension.\"\n\nThe word \"anecdote\" (in Greek: ἀνέκδοτον \"unpublished\", literally \"not given out\") comes from Procopius of Caesarea, the biographer of Justinian I, who produced a work entitled (\"Anekdota\", variously translated as \"Unpublished Memoirs\" or \"Secret History\"), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the Byzantine court. Gradually, the term \"anecdote\" came to be applied to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of Estonian, Lithuanian, Bulgarian and Russian humor, an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is an informal account of evidence in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to scientific evidence, as evidence that cannot be investigated using the scientific method. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an informal fallacy.\n\nWhen used in advertising or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a testimonial. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. Psychologists have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.\n\n"}

The work on the establishment of the Azerbaijan Customs History Museum was completed on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. On January 27, 2007, a section of the Museum of the History of Customs, the union of \"Azerterminalcomplex\" was opened.\n\nIn 2008 the Museum was accepted into the Azerbaijan National Committee of the International Council of Museums. Since September 2008 the museum is a member of the International Association of Customs Museums. In 2010, the \"Azerterminalcomplex\" section transformed into a branch of the Museum of Customs History. After confirmation from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan, the branch of the museum obtained its own fund and permanent exposition.\n\nMost of the museum's collection is arranged of cultural, scientific, historical and artistic cultural assets seized by customs officers and seized by the judicial authorities. From time to time most of these examples of art have been donated to museums, scientific institutions, and religious organizations, churches and mosques in Baku.\n\nExhibits of the Customs Museum are exhibited mainly in EU countries.\n\nThe collection of the museum is broadly focused on both thematic and regional aspects. The museum collection mainly consists of documents and photographs reflecting the customs history, as well as works of art created by various masters. The museum exhibition covers different periods, as well as exhibits exported for smuggling from Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan Customs History Museum, which exhibits various antique goods and other works of historical and artistic value, is evidence of the fight against smuggling of customs officials and serves as a sign of observance of national interests and moral values. Until 2006, customs officers were transferring all confiscated art objects to museums. Later they began to systematize the found antiques, which were tried to be exported abroad.\n\nThe collection of the branch of the Customs History Museum has a modern fine art department represented by painting, sculpture, art and crafts. The first millennium excavations, carpets, oriental sculptures, copper items, ancient coins, antique and ancient icons, jewelry, firearms, weapons of the 17th-19th centuries, Quran and Bible copies, that were confiscated while trying to be exported from Azerbaijan are kept in the department. This department was created by the joint efforts of the museum and the Union of Artists of Azerbaijan.\n\nAzerbaijan Customs History Museum exhibits confiscated historical and religious books, icons, other religious and religious rites and historical and cultural objects that have been confiscated as of today. For the first time, a museum was established by the State Customs Committee in 1999 for the transfer of religious books and icons confiscated by the Azerbaijani customs authorities in relevant religious assemblies.\n\nBelow is a gallery of postage stamps depicting the exhibits of Azerbaijan Customs History Museum\n"}
{"id": "2587694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2587694", "title": "Bereavement in Judaism", "text": "Bereavement in Judaism\n\nBereavement in Judaism () is a combination of \"minhag\" and \"mitzvah\" derived from Judaism's classical Torah and rabbinic texts. The details of observance and practice vary according to each Jewish community.\n\nIn Judaism, the principal mourners are the first-degree relatives: parent, child, sibling, and spouse. There are some customs that are unique to an individual mourning a parent.\n\nHalachot concerning mourning do not apply to those under thirteen years of age. Also, \"halachos\" of mourning do not apply when the deceased is aged 30 days or less.\n\nUpon receiving the news of the passing, the following blessing is recited:\n\nThere is also a custom of rending one's clothes at the moment one hears news of a passing. Another prevalent custom is to tear at the funeral so that the procedure is done properly.\n\n\nThe \"chevra kadisha\" (Hebrew: חברה קדישא \"holy society\") is a Jewish burial society usually consisting of volunteers, men and women, who prepare the deceased for proper Jewish burial. Their job is to ensure that the body of the deceased is shown proper respect, ritually cleansed, and shrouded.\n\nMany local \"chevra kadishas\" in urban areas are affiliated with local synagogues, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the \"chevra kadisha\" of their choice, so that when the time comes, the society will not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby Jewish cemetery.\n\nIf no gravediggers are available, then it is additionally the function of the male society members to ensure that graves are dug. In Israel, members of \"chevra kadishas\" consider it an honor to not only prepare the body for burial but also to dig the grave for a fellow Jew's body, particularly if the deceased was known to be a righteous person.\n\nMany burial societies hold one or two annual fast days, especially the 7th day of Adar, Yartzeit of Moshe Rabbeinu. and organize regular study sessions to remain up to date with the relevant articles of Jewish law. In addition, most burial societies also support families during the \"shiva\" (traditional week of mourning) by arranging prayer services, preparing meals, and providing other services for the mourners.\n\nThere are three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (\"rechitzah\"), ritual purification (\"taharah\"), and dressing (\"halbashah\"). The term \"taharah\" is used to refer both to the overall process of burial preparation, and to the specific step of ritual purification.\n\nPrayers and readings from Torah, including Psalms, Song of Songs, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah are recited.\n\nThe general sequence of steps for performing \"taharah\" is as follows.\n\n\nAfter the closing of the casket, the \"chevra\" asks forgiveness of the deceased for any inadvertent lack of honor shown to the deceased in the preparation of the body for burial.\n\nThere is no viewing of the body and no open casket at the funeral. Sometimes the immediate family pay their final respects before the funeral.\nIn Israel caskets are not used at all, with the exception of military and state funerals. Instead, the body is carried to the grave wrapped in a \"tallit\" and placed directly in the earth. In the Diaspora, in general, a casket is only used if required by local law.\n\nFrom death until burial, it is traditional for guards or watchers (\"shomrim\") to stay with the deceased. It is traditional to recite Psalms (\"tehillim\") during this time.\n\nThe Jewish funeral consists of a burial, also known as an interment. Cremation is forbidden. Burial is considered to allow the body to decompose naturally, therefore embalming is forbidden. Burial is intended to take place in as short an interval of time after death as possible. Displaying of the body prior to burial does not take place. Flowers are usually not found at a traditional Jewish funeral but may be seen at statesmen's or heroes' funerals in Israel.\n\nIn Israel, the Jewish funeral service usually commences at the burial ground. In the United States and Canada, the funeral service commences either at a funeral home or at the cemetery. Occasionally the service will commence at a synagogue. In the case of a prominent individual, the funeral service can begin at a synagogue or a yeshivah. If the funeral service begins at a point other than at the cemetery, the entourage accompanies the body in a procession to the cemetery. Usually the funeral ceremony is brief and includes the recitation of psalms, followed by a eulogy, or \"hesped\" and finishes with a traditional closing prayer, the El Moley Rachamim. The funeral, the procession accompanying the body to the place of burial, and the burial, are referred to by the word \"levayah,\" meaning \"escorting.\" \"Levayah\" also indicates \"joining\" and \"bonding.\" This aspect of the meaning of \"levayah\" conveys the suggestion of a commonality among the souls of the living and the dead.\n\nYemenite Jews, prior to their immigration to the land of Israel, maintained an ancient practice during the funeral procession to halt at at least seven stations before the actual burial of the dead, beginning from the entrance of the house from whence the bier is taken, to the graveyard itself. This has come to be known as \"Ma'amad u'Moshav\", (lit. \"Standing and Sitting\"), or \"seven standings and sittings,\" and is mentioned in Tosefta \"Pesahim\" 2: 14-15, during which obsequies only men and boys thirteen years and older took part, but never women. At these stations, the bier is let down by the pallbearers upon the ground, and those accompanying will recite \"\"Hatzur Tamim Pe'ulo\",\" etc. \"\"Ana Bakoach\",\" etc., said in a doleful dirge-like melody, and which verses are followed by one of the party reading certain Midrashic literature and liturgical verse that speaks about death, and which are said to eulogize the deceased.\n\nThe mourners traditionally make a tear (\"keriah\" קריעה) in an outer garment before or at the funeral. The tear should be on the left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters), children, and spouses (and does not need to be visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the \"keriah\" in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel \"per se\".\n\nIn the instance when a mourner receives the news of the death and burial of a relative after an elapsed period of 30 days or more, there is no \"keriah\", or tearing of the garment, except in the case of a parent. In the case of a parent, the tearing of the garment is to be performed no matter how long a period has elapsed between the time of death and the time of receiving the news.\n\nIf a child of the deceased needs to change clothes during the \"shiva\" period, s/he must tear the changed clothes. No other family member is required to rend changed clothes during \"shiva\". Children of the deceased may never sew the rent clothes, but any other mourner may mend the clothing 30 days after the burial.\n\nA \"hesped\" is a eulogy, and it is common for several people to speak at the start of the ceremony at the funeral home, as well as \nprior to burial at the gravesite.\n\n\"and Abraham came to eulogize Sarah.\" Gen. 23:2 uses the word \"Lispod\" from which is derived the Hebrew term Hesped.\n\nThere is more than one purpose for the eulogy.\n\nSome people specify in their wills that nothing should be said about them.\n\nEulogies are forbidden on certain days; likewise on a Friday afternoon.\n\nSome other times are:\n\nA more general guideline is that when the Tachanun (supplication prayer) is omitted, it is permitted to deliver a brief eulogy emphasizing only the praise of the departed; the extensive eulogy is postponed, and may be said at another time during the year of mourning.\n\n\"Kevura\", or burial, should take place as soon as possible after death. The \"Torah\" requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals. Burial is delayed \"for the honor of the deceased,\" usually to allow more time for far-flung family to come to the funeral and participate in the other post-burial rituals, but also to hire professionals, or to bury the deceased in a cemetery of their choice.\n\nRespect for the dead can be seen from many examples in the \"Torah\" and \"Tanakh\". For example, one of the last events in the \"Torah\" is the death of Moses when God himself buries him: \"[God] buried him in the depression in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor. No man knows the place that he was buried, even to this day.\"\n\nIn many traditional funerals, the casket will be carried from the hearse to the grave in seven stages. These are accompanied by seven recitations of Psalm 91. There is a symbolic pause after each stage (which are omitted on days when a eulogy would also not be recited.)\n\nWhen the funeral service has ended, the mourners come forward to fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or participate in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of death to life and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.\n\nSome have the custom to initially use the shovel \"backwards\" for the first few shovelfuls. Even within those who do it, some limit this to just the first few participants.\n\nWhen someone is finished, they put the shovel back in the ground, rather than handing it to the next person, to avoid passing along their grief to other mourners. This literal participation in the burial is considered a particularly good mitzvah because it is one for which the beneficiary — the deceased — can offer no repayment or gratitude and thus it is a pure gesture.\n\nSome have a custom, once the grave is filled, to make a rounded topping shape.\n\nAfter burial, the Tziduk Hadin prayer may be recited affirming that Divine Judgment is righteous. The family of deceased may then be comforted by other mourners with the formula:\n\nThe first stage of mourning is \"aninut\", or \"intense mourning.\" \"Aninut\" lasts until the burial is over, or, if a mourner is unable to attend the funeral, from the moment he is no longer involved with the funeral itself.\n\nAn \"onen\" (a person in \"aninut\") is considered to be in a state of total shock and disorientation. Thus the \"onen\" is exempt from performing mitzvot that require action (and attention), such as praying and reciting blessings, wearing \"tefillin\" (phylacteries), in order to be able to tend unhindered to the funeral arrangements. However the \"onen\" is still obligated in commandments that forbid an action (such as not violating the Shabbat).\n\n\"Aninut\" is immediately followed by \"avelut\" (\"mourning\"). An \"avel\" (\"mourner\") does not listen to music or go to concerts, and does not attend any joyous events or parties such as marriages or Bar or Bat Mitzvahs, unless absolutely necessary. (If the date for such an event has already been set prior to the death, it is strictly forbidden for it to be postponed or cancelled.)\n\n\"Avelut\" consists of three distinct periods.\n\nThe first stage of \"avelut\" is \"shiva\" (), a week-long period of grief and mourning. Observance of \"shiva\" is referred to by English-speaking Jews as \"sitting \"shiva\"\". During this period, mourners traditionally gather in one home and receive visitors.\n\nWhen they get home, the mourners refrain for a week from showering or bathing, wearing leather shoes or jewelry, or shaving. In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since they should not be concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being \"brought low\" by the grief. The meal of consolation (\"seudat havra'ah\"), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled eggs and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of Jacob purchasing the birthright from Esau with stewed lentils (Genesis 25:34); it is traditionally stated that Jacob was cooking the lentils soon after the death of his grandfather Abraham. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them (\"\"shiva\" calls\").\n\nIt is considered a great \"mitzvah\" (commandment) of kindness and compassion to pay a home visit to the mourners. Traditionally, no greetings are exchanged and visitors wait for the mourners to initiate conversation. The mourner is under no obligation to engage in conversation and may, in fact, completely ignore his/her visitors.\n\nVisitors will traditionally take on the hosting role when attending a Shiva, often bringing food and serving it to the mourning family and other guests. The mourning family will often avoid any cooking or cleaning during the Shiva period; those responsibilities become those of visitors.\n\nThere are various customs as to what to say when taking leave of the mourner(s). One of the most common is to say to them:\n\nDepending on their community's customs, others may also add such wishes as: \"You should have no more \"tza'ar\" (distress)\" or \"You should have only \"simchas\" (celebrations)\" or \"we should hear only \"besorot tovot\" (good tidings) from each other\" or \"I wish you a long life\".\n\nTraditionally, prayer services are organized in the house of mourning. It is customary for the family to lead the services themselves.\n\nIf the mourner returns from the cemetery after the burial before sundown, then the day of the funeral is counted as the first of the seven days of mourning. Mourning generally concludes in the morning of the seventh day. No mourning may occur on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), nor may the burial take place on Shabbat, but the day of Shabbat does count as one of the seven days. If a Jewish holiday occurs after the first day, that curtails the mourning period. If the funeral occurs during a festival, the start of the mourning period is delayed to the end of the festival. Some holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, cancel the mourning period completely.\n\nThe thirty-day period following burial (including \"shiva\") is known as \"shloshim\" (). During \"shloshim\", a mourner is forbidden to marry or to attend a \"seudat mitzvah\" (religious festive meal). Men do not shave or get haircuts during this time.\n\nSince Judaism teaches that a deceased person can still benefit from the merit of \"mitzvot\" (commandments) performed in their memory, it is considered a special privilege to bring merit to the departed by learning Torah in their name. A popular custom is to coordinate a group of people who will jointly study the complete Mishnah during the \"shloshim\" period. This is due to the fact that \"Mishnah\" (משנה) and \"Neshamah\" (נשמה), soul, have the same (Hebrew) letters.\n\nThose mourning a parent additionally observe a twelve-month period (), counted from the day of death. During this period, most activity returns to normal, although the mourners continue to recite the mourner's kaddish as part of synagogue services for eleven months. In Orthodox tradition, this is an obligation of the sons (not daughters) as mourners. There remain restrictions on attending festive occasions and large gatherings, especially where live music is performed.\n\nA headstone (tombstone) is known as a \"matzevah\" (monument). Although there is no Halakhic obligation to hold an unveiling ceremony (the ritual became popular in many communities toward the end of the 19th century), there are varying customs about when it should be placed on the grave. Most communities have an unveiling ceremony a year after the death. Some communities have it earlier, even a week after the burial. In Israel it is done after the \"shloshim\" (the first 30 days of mourning). There is no universal restriction about the timing, other than the unveiling cannot be held during Shabbat, (work-restricted) Jewish holidays, or Chol Ha'Moed.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, a cloth or shroud covering that has been placed on the headstone is removed, customarily by close family members. Services include reading of several psalms. Gesher HaChaim cites (chapters) \"33, 16, 17, 72, 91, 104, and 130; then one says Psalm 119 and recites the verses that spell the name of the deceased and the letters of the word \"Neshama\".\". This is followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (if a \"minyan\" is available), and the prayer \"El Malei Rachamim\". The service may include a brief eulogy for the deceased.\n\nOriginally, it was not common practice to place names on tombstones. The general custom for engraving the name of the deceased on the monument is a practice that goes back (only) \"the last several hundred years.\"\n\nJewish communities in Yemen, prior to their immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!” Philosopher and Halachic decisor, Maimonides, likewise, ruled that it is not permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men. In contrast, the more recent custom of Spanish Jewry, following the teachings of the Ari z”l (\"Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi\"), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet (RASHBA) wrote that it is a way of showing honor to the dead. In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and Ashkenaz. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.\n\n\"Yahrtzeit\", יאָרצײַט, means \"Time (of) Year\" in Yiddish. Alternative spellings include \"yortsayt\" (using the YIVO standard Yiddish orthography), \"Jahrzeit\" (in German), \"Yohr Tzeit\", \"yahrzeit\", and \"yartzeit\". The word is used by Yiddish speaking Jews, and refers to the anniversary of the day of death of a relative. Yahrtzeit literally means \"time of [one] year\".\n\nThe commemoration is known in Hebrew as \"nachala\" (\"legacy,\" or \"inheritance\"). This term is used by most Sephardic Jews, although some use the Ladino terms \"meldado\" or less commonly, \"anyos\" (\"years\"). It is widely observed, and based on the Jewish tradition that mourners are required to commemorate the death of a relative.\n\nJews are required to commemorate the death of parents, siblings, spouses, or children. \n\nThe \"Yahrtzeit\" usually falls annually on the Hebrew date of the deceased relative's death according to the Hebrew calendar. There are questions that arise as to what the date should be if this date falls on Rosh Chodesh or in a leap year of the Hebrew calendar. In particular, there are a few permutations, as follows:\n\nYahrzeit is done each year, for a full day on the date of death according to the Hebrew calendar. The Synagogue notifies members of the secular date.\n\nThe main \"halachic\" obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the \"Kaddish\" prayer three times (evening of the previous day, morning, and afternoon), and many attend synagogue for the evening, morning, and afternoon services on this day.\n\nDuring the morning prayer service the mourner's Kaddish is recited at least three times, two that are part of the daily service and one that is added in a house of mourning. Both there and in the synagogue, another Kaddish, the Rabbi's Kaddish, is also said in the morning service once in Nusach Ashkenaz and twice in Sfard/Sfardi.\n\nAs a widely practiced custom, mourners also light a special candle that burns for 24 hours, called a \"\"Yahrzeit\" candle\".\n\nLighting a yahrtzeit candle in memory of a loved one is a \"minhag\" (\"custom\") that is deeply ingrained in Jewish life honoring the memory and souls of the deceased.\n\nSome Jews believe that strict Jewish law requires that one should fast on the day of a parent's Yahrzeit; although most believe this is not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting on the day of the \"Yahrtzeit\", or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many Orthodox Jews it has become customary to make a siyum by completing a tractate of Talmud or a volume of the Mishnah on the day prior to the \"Yahrtzeit\", in the honor of the deceased. A \"halakha\" requiring a \"siyum\" (\"celebratory meal\"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.\n\nMany synagogues will have lights on a special memorial plaque on one of the synagogue's walls, with names of synagogue members who have died. Each of these lights will be lit for individuals on their \"Yahrzeit\" (and in some synagogues, the entire Hebrew month). All the lights will be lit for a \"Yizkor\" service. Some synagogues will also turn on all the lights for memorial days, such as \"Yom Ha'Shoah\".\n\nSome have a custom to visit the cemetery on fast days (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 559:10) and before Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (581:4, 605), when possible, and for a \"Yahrzeit.\" During the first year the grave is often visited on the shloshim, and the yartzeit (but may be visited at any time).\n\nEven when visiting Jewish graves of someone that the visitor never knew, the custom is to place a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, and is also a way of participating in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to tend the grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of cairn), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated the existence of the site.\n\nThe tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient.\n\nKaddish Yatom (\"heb.\" קדיש יתום \"lit. \"Orphan's Kaddish\"\") or the \"Mourner's\" Kaddish, is said at all prayer services, as well as at funerals and memorials. Customs for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In many Ashkenazi synagogues, particularly Orthodox ones, it is customary that everyone in the synagogue stands. In Sephardi synagogues, most people sit for most sayings of Kaddish. In many non-Orthodox Ashkenaz ones, the custom is that only the mourners themselves stand and chant, while the rest of the congregation sits, chanting only responsively. \n\nIn many Sephardic communities, Hashkabóth (\"remembrance\") prayers are recited for the deceased in the year following death, on the deceased's death anniversary (\"nahalah\" or \"años\"), and upon request by the deceased's relatives. Some Sephardic communities also recite Hashkabóth for all their deceased members on Yom Kippur, even those who died many years before.\n\n\"Yizkor\" (\"remembrance\") prayers are recited by those that have lost either one or both of their parents. These may additionally says Yizkor for other relatives. Some might also say Yizkor for a deceased close friend. It is customary in many communities for those with both parents alive to leave the synagogue during the Yizkor service while it is said.\"\n\nThe Yizkor prayers are recited four times a year, and are intended to be recited in a synagogue with a minyan; if one is unable to be with a minyan, one can recite it without one. These four Yizkor services are held on Yom Kippur, Shemini Atzeret, on the last day of Passover, and on Shavuot (the second day of Shavuot, in communities that observe Shavuot for two days).\n\nThe \"El Malei Rachamim\" prayer, in which God is asked to remember and grant repose to the souls of the departed, is recited as the primary prayer of the \"Yizkor\" services.\n\nYizkor is customarily not said within the first year of mourning, until the first \"yahrzeit\" has passed. This practice is a custom and historically not regarded to be obligatory.\n\nIn Sephardic custom there is no Yizkor prayer, but the \"Hashkabóth\" serve a similar role in the service.\n\nAv Harachamim is a Jewish memorial prayer that was written in the late 11th Century, after the destruction of the German Jewish communities around the Rhine river by Crusaders. It is recited on many Shabbatot before Musaf, and also at the end of the Yizkor service.\n\nMost Jewish communities of size have non-profit organizations that maintain cemeteries and provide \"chevra kadisha\" services for those in need. They are often formed out of a synagogue's women's group.\n\nZAKA (heb. זק\"א \"abbr. for Zihui Korbanot Asson lit. \"Identifying Victims of Disaster\"\" – חסד של אמת \"Hessed shel Emet lit. \"True Kindness\"\" – איתור חילוץ והצלה), is a community emergency response team in the State of Israel, officially recognized by the government. The organization was founded in 1989. Members of ZAKA, most of whom are Orthodox, assist ambulance crews, identify the victims of terrorism, road accidents and other disasters and, where necessary, gather body parts and spilled blood for proper burial. They also provide first aid and rescue services, and help with the search for missing persons. In the past they have responded in the aftermath of disasters around the world.\n\nThe Hebrew Free Burial Association is a non-profit agency whose mission is to ensure that all Jews receive a proper Jewish burial, regardless of their financial ability. Since 1888, more than 55,000 Jews have been buried by HFBA in their cemeteries located on Staten Island, New York, Silver Lake Cemetery and Mount Richmond Cemetery.\n\nFormed in 1854 for the purpose of \"…procuring a piece of ground suitable for the purpose of a burying ground for the deceased of their own faith, and also to appropriate a portion of their time and means to the holy cause of benevolence…,\" the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles established the first Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive in Chavez Ravine (current home to Dodger Stadium). In 1968, a plaque was installed at the original site, identifying it as California Historical Landmark #822.\n\nIn 1902, because of poor environmental conditions due to the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in the area, it was proposed by Congregation B'nai B'rith to secure a new plot of land in what is now East LA, and to move the buried remains to the new site, with a continued provision for burial of indigent people. This site, the Home of Peace Memorial Park, remains operational and is the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. The original society is now known as the \"Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles\".\n\nBeing an organ donor is absolutely prohibited by some, and permitted, in principle, by others.\n\nAccording to some Jewish denominations, once death has been clearly established, provided that instructions have been left in a written living will, donation may be done. However, there are a number of practical difficulties for those who wish to adhere strictly to Jewish law. For example, someone who is dead by clinical standards may not yet be dead according to Jewish law. Jewish law does not permit donation of organs that are vital for survival from a donor who is in a near-dead state but who is not yet dead according to Jewish law. Orthodox and Haredi Jews may need to consult their rabbis on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince 2001, with the founding of the Halachic Organ Donor Society, organ donation has become more common in modern orthodox Jewish communities, especially with the support of rabbis like Moshe Tendler and Norman Lamm.\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) forbids cremation.\n\nAn ancient historian described as \"a distinguishing characteristic\" that \n\"Jews buried, rather than burned, their dead.\" Judaism stresses burial in the earth (included entombment, as in caves) as a religious duty of laying a person's remains to rest. This, as well as the belief that the human body is created in the image of the divine and is not to be vandalized before or after death, teaches the belief that it was necessary to keep the whole body intact in burial, in anticipation of the eventual resurrection of the dead in the messianic age. Nevertheless, some Jews who are not religiously adherent, or who have attached to an alternative movement or religious stream that does not see some or all the laws of the Torah as binding upon them, have chosen cremation, either for themselves prior to death, or for their loved ones, a choice made in 2016 by more than 50% of non-Jews in the United States.\n\nAs Judaism considers suicide to be a form of murder, a Jew who commits suicide is denied some important after-death privileges: No eulogies should be given for the deceased, and burial in the main section of the Jewish cemetery is normally not allowed.\n\nIn recent times, most people who die by suicide have been deemed to be the unfortunate victims of depression or of a serious mental illness. Under this interpretation, their act of \"self-murder\" is not deemed to be a voluntary act of self-destruction, but rather the result of an involuntary condition. They have therefore been looked upon as having died of causes beyond their control.\n\nAdditionally, the Talmud (in Semakhot, one of the minor tractates) recognizes that many elements of the mourning ritual exist as much for the living survivors as for the dead, and that these elements ought to be carried out even in the case of the suicide.\n\nFurthermore, if reasonable doubt exists that the death may not have been suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), the benefit of the doubt is given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a minor is considered a result of a lack of understanding (\"da'at\"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) forbids tattoos, and there is a persistent myth that this prevents burial in a Jewish cemetery, but this is not true. A small minority of burial societies will not accept a corpse with a tattoo, but Jewish law does not mention burial of tattooed Jews, and nearly all burial societies have no such restriction. Removing the tattoo of a deceased Jew is forbidden as it would be considered \"damaging the body\". This case has been one of public interest in the current generations due to the large population tattooed in Nazi concentration camps between 1940 and 1945. However, it must be noted that, since those tattoos were forced upon the recipients in a situation where any resistance could expect official murder or brutality, their presence is not in any way reflective of any violation of Jewish law on the part of both the living and deceased; rather under these circumstances it shows adherence to the positive command to preserve innocent life, including one's own, by passively allowing the mark to be applied.\n\nThere is no mourning for an Apostate Jew according to Jewish law. (See that article for a discussion of precisely what actions and motivations render a Jew an \"apostate.\")\n\nIn the past several centuries, the custom developed among Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews (including Hassidic and Haredi Jews), that the family would \"sit shiva\" if and when one of their relatives would leave the fold of traditional Judaism. The definition of \"leaving the fold\" varies within communities; some would sit \"shiva\" if a family member married a non-Jew; others would only sit \"shiva\" if the individual actually converted to another faith, and even then, some would make a distinction between those who chose to do so of their own will, and those who were pressured into conversion. (In Sholom Aleichem's Tevye, when the title character's daughter converts to Christianity to marry a Christian, Tevye sits \"shiva\" for her and generally refers to her as \"dead.\") At the height of the Mitnagdim (anti-Hassidic) movement, in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, some Mitnagdim even sat \"shiva\" if a family member joined Hassidism. (It is said that when Leibel Eiger joined Hassidism, his father, Rabbi Shlomo Eiger sat \"shiva\", but his grandfather, the famed Rabbi Akiva Eiger, did not. It is also said that Leibel Eiger came to be \"menachem avel\" [console the mourner]). By the mid-twentieth century, however, Hassidism was recognized as a valid form of Orthodox Judaism, and thus the (controversial) practice of sitting \"shiva\" for those who realign to Hassidism ceased to exist.\n\nToday, some Orthodox Jews, particularly the more traditional ones (such as many Haredi and Hassidic communities), continue the practice of sitting \"shiva\" for a family member who has left the religious community. More liberal Jews, however, may question the practice, eschewing it as a very harsh act that could make it much more difficult for the family member to return to traditional practice if/when s/he would consider doing so.\n\nThe Rohr Jewish Learning Institute teaches courses on the spiritual purpose of bereavement and the soul after death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYizkor definition\n\n\n"}

The term \"Building services engineering\" is widely used in Commonwealth countries (incl. United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Australia), but in the United States of America, the field is also known as \"Building systems engineering\", \"Architectural engineering\" or \"Building engineering\", though the latter two disciplines generally have a broader scope, also encompassing elements of Structural engineering and more traditional architectural tasks such as room planning and material selection. In India the engineers are known as \"facilities planners\". In some counties, a \"building services architect\" is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services.\n\nBuilding services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the technical services in buildings (including mechanical, electrical and public health systems, also known as MEP or HVAC), in order to ensure the safe, comfortable and environmentally friendly operation. Building services engineers work closely with other construction professionals such as architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. Building services engineers influence the architectural design of building, in particular facades, in relation to energy efficiency and indoor environment, and can integrate local energy production (e.g. façade-integrated photovoltaics) or community-scale energy facilities (e.g. district heating). Building services engineers therefore play an important role in the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings (including green buildings, passive houses, and Plus-houses, and Zero-energy buildings). With buildings accounting for about a third of all carbon emissions and over a half of the global electricity demand, building services engineers play an important role in the move to a low-carbon society, hence mitigate global warming.\n\nThe career path of a building services engineer can take a very wide range of directions. Within the broad field of building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example specialization in renewable energy, sustainability, low-carbon technologies, energy management, building automation, and building information modeling (BIM). Building services engineers increasingly seek status as accredited LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), or CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) auditors, in addition to their status as chartered/professional engineer.\n\nBuilding services engineering encompasses much more than just MEP or HVAC), but also the following:\n\nExamples of roles/duties a Building Services Engineer may have include:\n\nThe two most notable professional bodies are:\n\nBuilding services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually 3–4 years for a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and 5–6 years for a Master of Engineering (MEng).\n\nThe list below includes accredited education programs. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) accredits university degrees in Building Services Engineering. In the United States, ABET accredits degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany tasks in building services engineering involve the use of engineering software, for example to design/model or draw solutions. The most common types of tool are whole building energy simulation and CAD (traditionally 2D) or the increasingly popular Building Information Modeling (BIM) which is 3D. 3D BIM software can have integrated tools for Building Services calculations such sizing ventilation ducts or estimating noise levels. Another use of 3D/4D BIM is that empowers more informed decision making and better coordination between different disciplines, such as 'collision testing'.\n\n"}

While Haros was involved many computation projects at the Bureau du Cadastre including the computation of de Prony’s tables of logarithms and the preparation of the French ephemeris, Connaissance des Temps, he is best known for a small table he prepared to convert fractions to their decimal equivalents.\n\nHaros’ conversion table appeared in a tract, \"Instruction Abrégée sur les nouvelles Mesures qui dovient étre introduites dans toute république, au vendémiaire an 10; avec tables de rapports et reductions\", that was presented to the Mathematics Section of the Institut de France and subsequently abstracted in Journal de l'École Polytechnique under the title ‘’Tables pour évaluer une fraction ordinaire avec autant de decimals qu’on voudra; et pour trouver la fraction ordinaire la plus simple, et qui approche sensiblement d’une fraction décimale.‘’\n\nIn preparing his table Haros needed to create the list of all 3,003 irreducible (vulgar) fractions with denominators less than 100. In order to make sure he got them all he harnessed an algorithm elucidated by Nicolas Chuquet some one-hundred and fifty years earlier. Chuquet called it his ‘’règle des nombres moyens‘’. Today we call it the mediant. The mediant is the fraction between two fractions a/c and b/d whose numerator is the sum of the numerators, a+b, and whose denominator is the sum of the denominators, c+d. That is, the mediant of the fractions a/c and b/d is the fraction (a+b)/(c+d).\n\nIn his paper Haros demonstrated that the mediant is always irreducible and, more importantly for this purposes, if you start with the sequence of fractions\n\nand just keep applying the rule, only keeping the result if the denominator is less than one-hundred, then you generate all 3,003.\n\nRoughly fifteen years later in England, Henry Goodwyn set out to create a much more ambitious version of Haros’ table. In particular, Goodwyn wanted to tabulate the decimal values for all irreducible fractions with denominators less than or equal to 1,024. There are 318,963 such fractions. As a warm up and a test of the commercial market for such a table in 1816 he published for private circulation The First Centenary of a Series of Concise and Useful Tables of all the Complete Decimal Quotients, which can arise from dividing a unit, or any whole Number less than each Divisor by all Integers from 1 to 1024.\n\nJohn Farey observed the mediant property in this table and mused in a letter to The Philosophical Magazine and Journal as follows:\n\nAugustin Cauchy read Farey’s letter and published a paper “Démonstration d’un Théorème Curieux sur les Nombres” reproving Haros’ results without acknowledgement. In his paper Cauchy referred to the mediant as “a remarkable property of ordinary fractions observed by M. J. Farey.” Thus, an ordered sequence of all vulgar fractions with denominators less than a given value became known as a Farey sequence rather than perhaps more rightfully as either a Chuquet sequence or a Haros sequence.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39208", "title": "Commerce", "text": "Commerce\n\nCommerce relates to \"the exchange of goods and services, especially on a large scale.\"\n\nIt includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that operate in any country or internationally.\n\nThe English-language word \"commerce\" derives from the Latin \"commercium\", from \"cum\" (\"together\") and \"merx\" (\"merchandise\").\n\nSome commentators trace the origins of commerce to the very start of transactions in prehistoric times. Apart from traditional self-sufficiency, trading became a principal facility of prehistoric people, who bartered what they had for goods and services from each other (the barter system was popular in ancient times where one could get goods and services by offering the other person some other good and service according to their need instead of paying with monetary systems, which developed later). Historian Peter Watson and Ramesh Manickam date the history of long-distance commerce from circa 150,000 years ago.\n\nIn historic times, the introduction of currency as a standardized money facilitated the wider exchange of goods and services. Numismatists have collections of tokens, which include coins from some Ancient-World large-scale societies, although initial usage involved unmarked lumps of precious metal.\n\nThe circulation of a standardized currency provides a method of overcoming the major disadvantage to commerce through use of a barter system, the \"double coincidence of wants\" (which means if someone wants something from a person, that person should also be in need of a thing or a service which they can provide), necessary for barter trades to occur. For example, if a person who makes pots for a living needs a new house, he/she may wish to hire someone to build it for him/her. But he/she cannot make an equivalent number of pots to equal this service done for him/her, because even if the builder could build the house, the builder might not want many or any pots. Also, the barter system had a major drawback in that whatever goods a person get as payment may not necessarily store for long amounts of time. For example: if a person has got dozens of fruits as his payment, he/she can't store fruit for long or they may rot - which means a person will have to bear a huge loss. Currency solved this problem by allowing a society as a whole to assign values and thus to collect goods and services effectively and to store them for later use, or to split them among minions.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, commerce developed in Europe through the trading of luxury goods at trade fairs. Some wealth became converted into movable wealth or capital. Banking systems developed where money on account was transferred across national boundaries. Hand-to-hand markets became a feature of town life, and were regulated by town authorities.\n"}
{"id": "42734050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42734050", "title": "Complex Projects Contract", "text": "Complex Projects Contract\n\nThe CIOB Complex Projects Contract 2013 was a form of construction and engineering contract, developed by the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB). Its formal name was the 'Contract for Use with Complex Projects, First Edition 2013'.\n\nIn November 2015, the Complex Projects Contract was updated by the Chartered Institute of Building in response to feedback from the industry. Despite effectively being a second edition, it was renamed the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 (abbreviated to TCM15) to reflect the core strengths of the contract.\n\nBased upon extensive research carried out by the CIOB, the contract was formally launched on 23 April 2013. The contract was billed as the world’s first contract specifically aimed at the management of time in complex construction and engineering projects. The authors also stated that it was the first form to follow the Society of Construction Law Delay and Disruption Protocol, and that it was also the first standard form contract to cater for Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the future of collaborative design.\n\nIt is suited for works of high value or complexity, major real estate projects and engineering or infrastructure projects. It is not suited to simpler works, those of short duration or with inexperienced clients /contractors. It anticipates Special Conditions for the particular requirements of each project and if using construction management as the procurement method, it cannot be used without the appropriate terms being included in the Special Conditions.\n\nCPC2013 is designed for use by companies and public authorities in the UK and in any other country where works comprise complex building and / or engineering, which cannot reasonably be expected to be managed intuitively. It can be used where the contractor is expected to construct only that designed by or under the direction of the client with traditional drawings, specification and/or bills of quantities, or BIM, or on projects which require a contractor’s design in part, or for design-build projects in which the contractor designs the whole of the works with or without an employer’s reference design.\n\nThe contract requires a collaborative approach to the management of design, quality, time and cost. The working schedule, planning method statement and progress records (which are to be inspected and accepted by a competent project time manager and independently audited for quality assurance) are at the core of management. They are the tools by which all time and time-related cost issues are to be determined and are to conform with the standards required by the conditions, appendices and the CIOB’s Guide to Good Practice in the Management of Time in Complex Projects.\n\nIn order to promote collaboration and to ensure transparency of data, schedule and database submittals are to be made in native file format either by maintenance of the material in a common data environment or transfer by a file transfer protocol to all having a continuing design, administrative, or supervisory role, who are identified as Listed Persons. The contract also requires the appointment of a Contract Administrator to carry out administrative functions during the course of construction, a Project Time Manager to advise on time related matters, a Valuer to advise on cost matters, a Design Coordination Manager to manage the integration of the Contractor's design, and a Data Security Manager to supervise and maintain the integrity and security of digital communications.\n\nCentral to the philosophy of the Complex Projects Contract is its approach to transparency in risk management. CPC2013 provides for both the owner and contractor each to identify one or more time contingency allowance, which each can use as it wishes to manage its own risks. Unusually for a standard form construction contract, it defines \"float\" and provides that if either party creates free float or total float as a result of its own improvement of progress, that party may keep the created float as its own contingency. Additional powers are provided in CPC2013 to enable the construction project's developer, following consultation, to instruct acceleration, recovery and changes in resources sequences and logic in order to manage its risks contemporaneously.\n\nCPC2013 is distinctive in taking a prescriptive approach to the management of time and associated cost risk and combining critical path network techniques with resource-based planning. The time model, referred to as the Working Schedule, combines a high-density, short-term look-ahead similar in concept to that used in agile software development with medium and long-term lower density schedule along the lines of that used in the waterfall model planning technique, the whole being revised regularly on the Rolling Wave planning principle. In the short-term look-ahead, the logic is to be resource and location-related, instead of activity based, as it is in waterfall. The agile part of the schedule is to have its activity durations calculated by reference to the resources to be applied and their expected productivity.\n\nThe activities in the Working Schedule are also to be valued so that the Working Schedule also functions as the pricing schedule to predict current value for the purposes of interim payment and the ultimate out-turn cost for cost risk management purposes.\n\nProgress is required to be recorded in a database identifying, at specified intervals, the resources used, productivity achieved and earned value. Apart from being the source data for subsequent progress update of the schedule, the database also serves for benchmarking productivity achievable for quality assurance of the schedule and future planning.\n\nThe emphasis of CPC2013 is on contemporaneous Issue Resolution by an appropriate expert. CPC2013 it also provides for an escalating Dispute Resolution procedure, embracing negotiation, mediation, adjudication and arbitration. Where issues are required to be determined by Issue Resolution within a certain timescale, if the procedure is not invoked there are deeming provisions which determine the outcome of an issue. If Dispute Resolution is required, the expert, adjudicator or arbitrator are either those named in the contract or, in default, they are appointed by the Academy of Experts in London or the CIOB. The default adjudication rules are those of the Scheme for Construction Contracts and the default arbitration procedure is that of the London Court of International Arbitration.\n\nA back-to-back Consultancy Appointment and Subcontract, both of which followed the same principles of time and cost risk management, were published in November 2015 as part of the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 suite.\n\nA number of reviews and commentaries have been written on the subject of the Complex Projects Contract. Some have criticized the complexity of the contract itself .\n\n"}

The impact of 9/11 has extended beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of American flags. The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative or thematic elements in film, television, music and literature. Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns. 9/11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from scientists, engineers, and historians. 9/11 has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals; for some it strengthened, to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely, because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion.\n\nThe culture of the United States succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel.\n\nDue to the significance of the attacks, media coverage was extensive, including disturbing live pictures, and prolonged discourse about the attacks in general, resulting in iconography and greater meaning associated with the event. Don DeLillo called it \"the defining event of our time\". The attacks spawned a number of catchphrases, terms, and slogans, many of which continue to be used more than a decade later.\n\nThrough an endless reproductions in mass media and popular culture the attacks have an important cultural meaning for many people: \"The attacks percolate as a central theme or historical backdrop in countless works of art, which bear witness to the complexity of 9/11 as historical, political, and media event, and contribute to the negotiation of its cultural meaning.\" Regarding the attacks of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor Arthur G. Neal said:\n\"[W]e create the world through our perceptions of it and seek to maintain that world in a manner consistent with our beliefs about it. It is through such symbolic constructions that we are provided with usable frameworks for shaping our memories and organizing them into coherent systems of meaning.\"\n\nAmerican comic books have always carried patriotic tones, especially during the cold war—perhaps the most notable example is the character Captain America. 9/11 shifted the political climate and with it re-centered the public's attention on Muslims. Perhaps the most mainstream example of the influence 9/11 had on comic books is Iron Man, who was previously an anti-communist crusader; his canon was rewritten in comics after 9/11 and in the widely popular 2008 film Iron Man. In the film billionaire Tony Stark learns his weapons were sold without his knowledge to various terrorist groups after he was kidnapped and tortured in Afghanistan.\n\nThe September 11 attacks gained an iconographic meaning. This was due to the fact that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City were portrayed as symbolic buildings representing American financial power, and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia was portrayed as a symbolic building representing American military power. Backed up by the media and literature, many people see 9/11 as an attack on the economic and military power of America. Furthermore, the attacks are often pictured as a symbol for an era of war and terrorism.\n\n\nVarious slogans and captions were employed by media outlets to brand coverage of the September 11th terrorist attack, its after effects, and the U.S. government response. The slogans for American media were typically positioned on the bottom third of television broadcasts, or as banners across the top of newspaper pages. Designs typically incorporated a patriotic red, white, and blue motif, along with an explicit graphic of the American flag. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "273482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273482", "title": "Facilitated communication", "text": "Facilitated communication\n\nFacilitated communication (FC), supported typing or hand over hand, is a discredited technique used by some caregivers and educators in an attempt to assist people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The technique involves providing an alphabet board, or keyboard. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move their hand and amplify their gestures. In addition to providing physical support needed for typing or pointing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support. In addition to human touch assistance, the facilitator's belief in their communication partner's ability to communicate seems to be a key component of the technique.\n\nThere is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that facilitators, not the person with the communication disability, are the source of all or most messages obtained through FC, by guiding the arm of the patient towards answers they expect to see or that form intelligible language.<ref name=\"Ganz/Katsiyannis/Morin\"></ref> Alternatively, the facilitator may hold the alphabet board and move it to the disabled person's finger. Studies asking about things the facilitator cannot know (for example showing the patient but not the facilitator an object) have confirmed this, showing that a facilitator is generally unable to ‘help’ the patient sign out the answer to a question where they do not know what the answer should be. In addition, numerous cases have been reported by investigators in which disabled persons were assumed by facilitators to be signing a coherent message while their eyes were closed, or they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board.\n\nSome promoters of the technique have countered that FC cannot be clearly disproven by testing, since a testing environment might feel confrontational and alienating to the subject. Because the scientific consensus is that FC is a pseudoscience which causes great risk and emotional distress to people with communication disabilities, their families, and their caregivers, the technique is now rejected outside a few fringe groups and organizations, including Syracuse University in the United States. In 2015 Sweden banned the use of FC in special needs schools.\n\nFacilitated communication is promoted as a means to assist people with severe communication disabilities in pointing to letters on an alphabet board, keyboard or other device so that they can communicate independently. It also appears in the literature as \"supported typing\", \"progressive kinesthetic feedback\", and \"written output communication enhancement\". It is somewhat related to the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM), also known as \"informative pointing\", which has no evidence of efficacy.\n\nThe person with disabilities, who is often not able to rely on speech to communicate, is referred to as the \"communication partner\". The caregiver, educator or other provider offering physical support to the person with disabilities is called the \"facilitator\". The facilitator holds or gently touches the communication partner's elbow, wrist, hand, sleeve or other parts of the body while the communication partner points to letters of the alphabet printed on a piece of paper or laminated cardboard, letters on an alphabet board, laptop, keyboard or mobile communication device such as an iPad.\n\nThe Canon Communicator, a small, portable, lightweight device that printed a tape of letters when activated, was popular with early FC users. However, two companies, Crestwood Co. of Glendale, Wisconsin and Abovo Co. of Chicopee, Massachusetts, would later be charged by the Federal Trade Commission for making \"false and unsubstantiated claims\" that the device could enable people with autism and other disabilities to communicate using FC. The companies settled and stopped mentioning FC in their advertising campaigns.\n\nProponents of FC claim that motor issues (e.g., the neurological condition of apraxia) prevent people with autism from communicating effectively. Although this claim is unsubstantiated (many people with autism have no difficulty pointing to or picking up objects independently, but do exhibit severe communication difficulties characteristic of the disorder), proponents argue that physical support and touch are necessary components of communicating through FC. Candidates for FC, presumably, \"lack confidence in their abilities\" and physical support, purportedly, helps them overcome this obstacle to communication.\n\nThe role of the facilitator is depicted by proponents as integral to helping the person with disabilities point to letters (by holding his or her finger or hand), reducing or eliminating uncontrollable arm movements (shaking or flapping), avoiding mistakes in typing, controlling the initiation of movement, and speaking words aloud. As well as physical support in typing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support. Along with human touch, the facilitator's belief in their communication partner's ability to communicate is seen to be a key component of the technique.\n\nFormer facilitator Janyce Boynton, who came to reject the technique after taking part in double-blind trials, later reported that she received training from University of Maine that took for granted that the process worked, and that the complexity of facilitation made it hard to realise that messages were coming from her expectations and not from her patients: \"When you’re facilitating, you’re so distracted by other things. You’re carrying on conversations, you’re asking and answering questions, you’re trying to look at the person to see if they’re looking at the keyboard...Your brain is so engaged that you lose sight of what’s happening with your hand...that’s what makes it feel like it’s working because the more you practice it, the more the movements feel really fluid.”.\n\nThe FC movement may be traced back to the 1960s in Denmark where it failed to take hold because of lack of scientific evidence. FC experienced a period of rapid growth and popularity in Australia in the 1970—1980s, largely due to the efforts of special educator Rosemary Crossley. Arthur Schawlow, a Nobel laureate whose son was autistic, and Douglas Biklen, then a special education professor from Syracuse University who observed Crossley's work in Australia, are credited with popularizing FC in the United States in the late 1980s, early 1990s. FC has also received attention in many other parts of the world: Canada, Germany, Austria, Finland, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Asia.\n\nEarly adopters of the technique praised FC for its apparent simplicity. FC was promoted as a \"teaching strategy\" and not an experimental or even risky technique that required objective evaluation or close monitoring. As early as 1991, however, more than 40 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals involving more than 400 people with autism not only failed to demonstrate FC's efficacy, but indicated that any success reported by proponents of the technique was due to facilitator influence. Many researchers attribute facilitator influence, for the most part, to non-conscious movements. It is thought that facilitators are genuinely unaware that they, not their client or family member, are controlling the communications.\n\nIn 1994, the American Psychological Association (APA), followed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), and the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) passed a resolution cautioning practitioners against the use of FC, citing lack of scientific evidence. The APA also recommended that information obtained via FC should not be used to confirm or deny allegations of abuse or make diagnostic or treatment decisions. In recognition of continued scientific evidence against the technique, other organizations joined suit, passing their own resolutions advising their membership to avoid the technique. A British government report concluded in 1998 that \"the phenomenon fails to materialise once facilitator effects have been controlled. It would be hard to justify further research on this\".\n\nBy 2001 Mark P. Mostert of Regent University School of Education in Virginia Beach, Virginia, reported in the second of his comprehensive reviews of peer-reviewed literature investigating FC that \"Facilitated Communication (FC) had largely been empirically discredited as an effective intervention for previously uncommunicative persons with disabilities, especially those with autism and related disorders. Key empirical findings consistently showed that the facilitator and not the client initiated communication.\"\n\nMany people believed FC had passed its peak, dismissing it as a fad and characterizing it as pseudo-scientific. However, despite these findings, FC proponents continued their adherence to the technique, dismissing empirical investigations as irrelevant, flawed or unnecessary, characterizing FC as an \"effective and legitimate intervention\" in pro-FC literature, and refusing to change their minds or admit their mistakes. The FC movement retained popularity in some parts of the United States, Australia, and Germany, and continued to be used in many countries . Mostert writes:All the newer pro-FC studies operate from the premise that FC works and is a legitimate practice to be used in investigating any number of other phenomena related to people with autism and other related severe communication problems. Such assumptions increasingly morph FC into a valid intervention among readers who are unaware of the empirical dismissal of the intervention and who might not be skilled in distinguishing solid from suspect research. In this regard, it is likely that FC will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners. These perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the Facilitated Communication Institute at Syracuse University, a fairly wide acceptance of FC internationally, and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful.\n\nFacilitated communication is closely related to the rapid prompting method (RPM), although proponents of RPM deny similarities with FC because the aide or facilitator in RPM holds the letter board but \"does not touch the person typing\" and that the prompts are \"nonspecific.\" However, critics of RPM point out that subtle cuing takes place during RPM that makes it \"highly susceptible to facilitator influence.\"\n\nOther similarities between RPM and FC include: reluctance or refusal to test facilitator/client pairs in controlled settings (purportedly because the process breaks the trust between the pair), presumed competence, reliance on anecdotal accounts as proof of efficacy, maintenance of practices, techniques and claims that are inconsistent with the known body of work around the behavior and communication skills of individuals with developmental disabilities or proven remediation techniques, claims of extraordinary literacy or intellectual breakthroughs, unconscious verbal or physical cuing by facilitators to obtain the expected responses, inadequate or non-existent protocols to fade supported or facilitated prompts.\n\n\nOne of the central questions regarding facilitated communication is who is really doing the communicating. The ultimate goal of using such a technique, as suggested by Stephen Von Tetzchner, professor of psychology at the University of Oslo, is \"genuine \"communication\", in which the messages obtained through FC originate from the person with disabilities\" and are not, in any way, influenced by the facilitator. However, as von Tetzchner also points out, there are two other potential outcomes of FC: \n\nFacilitators using the technique reported unexpected literacy skills in people otherwise thought to be nonverbal, illiterate and incapable of learning more than basic life skills. They proposed that FC unlocked the thoughts and feelings of moderately to severely impaired individuals inaccessible by traditional means. Naturally, parents reported their joy and excitement upon seeing their\nchild, with his or her facilitator, type \"I love you\" for the first time. Educators and care givers claimed students who were not directly instructed in reading, writing or mathematics were, through FC, capable of expressing\ncomplex thoughts through writing and solving multiplication and long division problems. It was felt that people with disabilities were, themselves, able to write books and poetry, to advocate for better treatment of people with disabilities, express a desire to go to college or leave their care facility, get married, have sexual relations, decide important medical issues, and, in some cases, report abuses allegedly occurring in their homes, despite being physically supported in their typing by facilitators. FC seemed to bring with it the hope of \"shattering old beliefs and methods of working with autistics...and opening doors to new beliefs and methods that no one can yet conceive.\"\n\nFC workshops, training materials, newsletters and newspaper accounts of its use contained emotionally compelling stories—alleged breakthroughs using FC—and, often, espoused the sentiment that FC could empower people with disabilities to \"speak\" for themselves for the first time. These materials, authored by \"persuasive, sincere, authoritative-sounding individuals\"—university professors, psychologists, speech-language pathologists—helped set up an ideologic mindset that led many well-meaning facilitators into a cognitive trap rife with confirmation\nbias and self-deception with one of the key assertions being \"assume competence on the part of the communication partner without testing that assumption.\"\n\nGuidelines for facilitators also included instructions to prevent errors during facilitation (by pulling back on the communication partner's hand), expect the emergence of hidden skills and sensitive personal information, use anecdotal data to validate authorship, avoid objective scrutiny, and emphasize \"facilitated\" over spoken communication. Through the guise of public opinion and qualitative studies, rather than the systematic gathering of empirical data through quantitative studies, facilitators were not only convinced of FC's efficacy, but ready\nto overturn more than 40 years of autism research.\n\nDespite claims from FC promoters that autism is a motor control and emotional (i.e. confidence) problem that can be overcome with physical support, autism is largely accepted in the academic and clinical arenas as being a neurological problem often accompanied by intellectual disabilities. A core feature of autism is severe communication problems which cannot be overcome simply by supportively holding onto someone's hand.\n\nProponents claim that a few individuals using FC have developed the ability to type independently or with minimal support (e.g., a light touch to the shoulder or to the back of the neck). Facilitators attributing messages obtained through FC to their communication partners have co-authored books, articles and plays. These, seemingly, addressed the miraculous, freeing nature of FC and, purportedly, gave outsiders a glimpse of the inner worlds of people with autism: \"Annie's Coming Out\" (1980), \"The Secret World of Arthur Wold\" (1993),\n\"Out of Silence\" (1994), \"In Dark Hours I Find My Way\" (1995), \"Miracles\" (1997), \"The Mind Tree\" (2003), and \"I am Intelligent\" (2012), to name a few.\n\nWith their facilitators attending classes, assisting them in typing out class notes, completing homework and taking tests, some people with autism reliant on FC even graduated from high school or college. However, these claims of independent typing, to date, are anecdotal and have not been substantiated by objective means.\n\nPeople more critical of the technique noticed that, while the facilitators were intent on watching the letter board, their communication partners were often distracted, staring off into space, rolling around on the floor while facilitating, falling asleep, or otherwise not paying attention. Sometimes the communication partners spoke words that conflicted with the words being typed. The language structures and vocabulary used by children being facilitated often exceeded what would normally be considered appropriate for their age and experience. Supposedly highly competent individuals gave wrong answers to simple questions or information that should have been readily known (e.g. the name of the family dog, the names of family members, the spelling of their own name). Still others questioned why people with autism who exhibit excellent fine motor skills needed to have physical support from facilitators in order to point to a keyboard while many people with autism type independently.\n\nBernard Rimland, a research psychologist who founded the Autism Research Institute of San Diego and the Autism Society of America, asked \"How is it possible that an autistic kid can pick up the last tiny crumbs of potato chips off a plate but not have sufficient motor coordination to type the letter E?\" Howard Shane, director of the Center for Communication Enhancement at Children's Hospital in Boston and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, finds it \"curious that those being facilitated can only create [these] insightful comments\" when helped by an assistant. Why, when technology allowed people with severe disabilities the opportunity to access independent communication with even the slightest movement (e.g., an eye wink, movement of an eyebrow, a puff of air into a straw), would a facilitator need to hold their hand?\n\nResearchers familiar with the ideomotor, Clever Hans, or Ouija effect, noticed small movements made by the facilitators; movements of which the facilitator was often unaware. All this raised concerns about authorship, the role facilitators have in communicating through FC, and the time facilitating took away from the pursuit of scientifically proven\ncommunication techniques. Psychologist Adrienne Perry cautioned: \"The adult or child with autism is made a 'screen' for a facilitator's hostilities, hopes, beliefs or suspicions\" and that \"concentrating on this method could deprive people of the chance to learn other skills that would be more useful to them.\"\n\nWhile proponents insist that FC \"should never involve guiding a person as he or she attempts to point or type,\" facilitators can and do influence facilitated movements without realizing it. Gina Green, director of research for the New England Center for Autism in Massachusetts, E.K. Shriver Center for Mental Retardation, and Northeastern University, stated: \"Very subtle influence can affect people's behavior. It doesn't even have to be touch. It can be the slightest sound, the slightest visual cue.\" And, in regards to videotapes in which it appears the person with autism is typing independently, \"You can edit videotape and show whatever you want. They'll show you a close-up of the finger moving across the keyboard...but you're not getting what else is going on.\"\n\nResearchers James Mulick, John Jacobson and Frank Kobe states that the medical community can offer \"a bewildering ... and conflicting information\" to \"parents who hear that their child has a significant disability... the anguish is profound\". A \"miracle cure from Australia\" such as FC can use this stress and grief to promote a belief in FC. The only evidence of success are \"transcripts of apparent conversational content\". These families are used \"... (to) stroke their hopes with empty promises, regardless of their sincerity, while reaping personal or political rewards and working hard to prevent systematic verification of their claims\". The researchers go on to say that \"people with handicaps can be valued members of their families and communities without resorting to appeals to miracle cures\". Scientific and genuine help are available, \"advances in treatment and understanding come at the price of rigorous training, dedication to accuracy and scientific standards, and objective verification of all treatment claims\".\n\nPat Mirenda, professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology and Special Education at the University of British Columbia and co-author David R. Beukelman, Barkley Professor of Communication Disorders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, decided not to include FC in revised versions of their textbook \"Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs. \"Earlier versions of the textbook are quoted in pro-FC literature. In 2015, Mirenda stated, \"I came to recognize (painfully, to be honest) that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what I saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible (e.g., subtle prompting, resulting in an ideomotor effect), and that, even if independent typing did occur subsequent to FC exposure, only correlational—but definitely not causal—evidence exists with regard to its relationship to FC. In short, I do not endorse FC as a communication or instructional technique, and I do not support its use.\"\n\nStephen N. Calculator of the University of New Hampshire, an early proponent of FC who also distanced himself from the movement because he could not replicate claims of independent communication in his own research studies, summed up the importance of determining the extent of facilitator influence: \"The consequences of falsely attributing messages to communicators, rather than facilitators, continue to have significant financial, social and moral ramifications. Facilitators must take extraordinary precautions to assure that they are not unduly influencing messages and thereby impinging on communicators' freedom of speech. The rights of individuals to express their thoughts and ideas should not be circumvented by facilitators who communicate for them, unwilling or not.\"\n\nJanyce Boynton, who at one time was a strong proponent of the use of FC, is now one of FC’s leading critics. In the early 1990s, Ms. Boynton was the facilitator for a non-speaking high school girl with autism who, through FC with Ms. Boynton, described having been sexually abused by her parents, resulting in the girl and her brother being removed from the parents' home. Systematic testing by Howard Shane revealed, however, that the girl was incapable of being the author of the messages (see The Wheaton Case below and the description of the case in the 1993 PBS Frontline documentary “Prisoners of Silence”). Unlike many in the FC-proponent community (e.g., Douglas Biklin), Ms. Boynton accepted the clear evidence from this testing (and from other well controlled scientific studies) that indicated that FC was not a valid assisted communication technique. She stopped using FC, convinced her school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use, and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with. More recently, she has maintained a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about FC, and has served as one of the leaders of a group of professionals who successfully convinced the University of Northern Iowa to cease their sponsorship of an annual workshop that had included instruction in FC. As noted by another member of that group (Stuart Vyse), “this is just the beginning. There are a number of other universities and governmental organizations that tacitly or explicitly endorse FC and/or its related techniques, and Ms. Boynton and her allies have their eyes on a number of these future targets”, including the University of Syracuse (home to the FC-supporting Institute on Communication and Inclusion).\n\nTestifying in the Anna Stubblefield court case, psychology professor James Todd stated in court (FC) \"It's become the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities.\" Every \"methodologically sound\" study of FC has shown it invalid. Writing about that case in the journal \"Disability and Society\", Mark Sherry voiced similar concerns about FC's lack of scientific validity, calling it a \"sham\", \"hoax\" and a \"fraud.\" Sherry's was the first article published in a Disability Studies journal which thoroughly critiqued Stubblefield's actions—a noteworthy contribution because Stubblefield had also been in Disability Studies and had previously published about FC in the journal \"Disability Studies Quarterly\". Sherry suggested that some of the defenders of Stubblefield (and FC more broadly) are either her personal friends or work in institutions which receive substantial income from providing FC.\n\nThe editorial for the Syracuse University newspaper called it \"inexcusable\" and \"embarrassing\" that the University continues to support FC after over 25 years of research has discredited it.\n\nPsychologist Stuart Vyse writes that in some cases of autism, parents reject the autism diagnosis and \"claim their children have a physical -- rather than a developmental -- disability\". With FC or RPM their diagnosis is confirmed. Their child with the help of a facilitator communicates with the parent revealing that they can speak oftentimes at levels beyond their age. Vyse states that the \"overwhelming evidence ... shows that it is the adult facilitator... communicating ... It is a Ouija-like phenomenon\".\n\nLeaders in the FC movement, such as Crossley from Australia and Biklen in the United States, insist that communications by FC occur independent from the facilitator, whose role is to serve as a passive recipient of the messages, and rely on anecdotal and observational data (e.g., the existence of unique spellings or unexpected skills or revelations made during the communication session) in order to back up their claims. Individuals—parents and researchers alike—who questioned the stance and supported evaluating FC by objective methods were accused of being \"oppressors of the disabled,\" told they were narrow-minded, outmoded, evil, jealous they weren't the ones to discover FC, and, in some cases, accused of hate speech for advocating a more studied approach.\n\nMostert wrote in 2001, \"FC proponents must be encouraged to subject their claims to further scientific verification, the claims of anecdotal evidence notwithstanding. If any small part of FC is ever to be found effective or even plausible, it is abundantly clear that only by careful use of controlled experimental methods will this be established.\" Still, psychologists, speech-language pathologists, researchers and parents maintain that controlled testing, where the facilitator does not already know the answers to questions and, therefore, cannot inadvertently or purposefully cue their communication partner to obtain the desired answer, is the only way to determine whether or not the communications are truly independent. They caution that even though the facilitator may feel like he or she is not moving the other person's hand and that the messages are originating from the communication partner, the facilitator, may, indeed, be providing cues that lead to specific letters on the keyboard.\n\nKathleen M. Dillon, professor of psychology at Western New England College in Springfield, Massachusetts says, \"This is a hard reality to grasp.\" As Julie Riggot wrote in an article for \"Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice\", \"Sometimes, the influence of the facilitator is less obvious, because the facilitator might not hold the person's hand, but support an arm or touch a shoulder--or even simply observe the typing.\" Because cueing is often subtle and is not possible to observe the influence of the facilitator in all instances where it might occur, naked-eye, informal observations and facilitator reports have proven unreliable in determining authorship. Many facilitators deny they are in any way influencing their communication partners' movements, even when faced with evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn 2006, Rom Houben was initially hailed by Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys for his ability to type out thoughts on a keypad, via the help of his facilitator Linda Wouters. However, \"when concerns were raised regarding the veracity of his messages, independent tests were carried out: Houben was shown a range of objects and asked to name them. When Houben was unable to name any of the objects shown to him when Wouters had not been in the room, Laureys accepted that Houben had not been responsible for any of the messages, and conceded that FC – in all its flawed promise and false hope – was responsible for Houben’s apparent cogency.\"\n\nDespite cautions from people like Eric Schopler, then director of an autism education program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and editor of the Journal of Autism, that promoting facilitated communication with no empirical evidence was \"reckless\", stories of FC's purported success were reported (and continue to be reported) in magazines such as \"Reader's Digest\", in movies and plays, and on television shows such as ABC's \"20/20\" Prime Time Live with Diane Sawyer. Thousands of people—teachers, parents, speech pathologists, psychologists—struggling to find a way to communicate with individuals who, otherwise, demonstrated little ability to use spoken word to communicate their wants and needs—adopted FC with \"blinding speed\" with little public scrutiny or debate.\n\nOf FC's rapid rise in popularity, particularly in the United States, doctors John W. Jacobson, James A. Mulick, and Allen A. Schwartz wrote: The general acceptance of FC by the public and segments of the professional community has called into question the rigor with which educational and therapeutic interventions are evaluated in publicly funded programs and the ability of many professionals to critically assess the procedures they use. As such, FC serves as a case study in how the public and, alarmingly, some professionals, fail to recognize the role of science in distinguishing truth from falsity and its applicability to assessing the value of treatment modalities.James Randi, a magician familiar with the ideomotor effect commonly attributed to dowsing and later linked to FC, put it more succinctly when he called facilitated communication \"a crock that does more harm than good by raising false hopes among families of autistic children\" after he was called in to investigate the technique at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1992. The James Randi Educational Foundation has offered a million-dollar prize \"to a valid demonstration of facilitated communication.\" In 2009, Randi responded in an interview for the Rom Houben case, where it was shown that messages from a Belgian man who was believed to be in a coma for 23 years were generated by the facilitator, \"Our prize is still there.\"\n\nThis issue of testing the messages obtained through FC has, historically, been problematic for those in the FC community who support its use. Proponents claim that testing is demeaning to the disabled person, that the testing environment creates performance anxiety, or that those being facilitated may purposely produce nonsense, refuse to respond or give wrong answers to counteract the negative attitudes of those who are skeptical of the technique. Observations by researchers attending an FC class in 1993 were that the \"client\" did not always look at the keyboard, and that \"physical force\" was used to \"prevent movement of the learner's hand away from the keyboard\" eventually, they learned the \"patient\" through FC \"will thank you for doing so\" and only open ended questions were asked, never factual questions. They were told that \"one should just be receptive to what is produced\". In 1992, when FC was fairly new to the United States, Douglas Biklen was quoted in \"The Washington Post\" as saying he \"welcomed scientific studies\", but the reporter, Amanda Spake, went on to explain: he doesn't want to do them. He's an educator, not a psychiatrist, and like other educators who have written about facilitated communication, he is comfortable with the fact that there is often a lag time between the application of a new method and its scientific validation.However, in arguing against suggestions that FC may be difficult or impossible to objectively test, James T. Todd, psychologist from Eastern Michigan University, wrote: the determination of authorship in FC involves a straightforward application of basic experimental methods described comprehensively by Mill (1843) more than a century and half ago, but understood for millennia. We are not speaking of obscure or controversial techniques. We are speaking of authorship validation by selectively presenting different information to two people then observing what is produced.\n\nDespite the FC community's reluctance to participate in testing, researchers outside the community did set up double-blind testing in an attempt to identify in a controlled way who was doing the communicating. Some testing was conducted as a direct response to a growing number of cases involving sexual abuse allegations that have plagued users of FC, including Crossley, made through the use of facilitated communication against parents, teachers, and caregivers of people with disabilities. However, a number of controlled evaluations of FC were conducted by clinicians, researchers, and program administrators who were considering the use of FC, but wanted an objective, empirical basis for deciding what role, if any, FC would have in their programs.\n\nThe O.D. Heck Center in Schenectady, New York was one of the first in the United States to go public with their findings, which were that their clients produced meaningful responses through facilitated communication only when their facilitators had access to the correct responses. The report went on to virtually rule out issues of confidence or skepticism on the part of the evaluators. All twelve participants (people with disabilities) were chosen for the evaluation because their facilitators believed in their ability to communicate through FC. The study demonstrated that the communication partners were \"systematically and unknowingly\" being influenced by their facilitators. The researchers wrote:In fact, the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced, but was controlled and determined by the facilitators. To all appearances, these participants had been producing thoughtful communication, and several had consistently engaged in interactive conversations using facilitated communication. Many people serving these individuals believed that this output reflected the valid expressions of the participants.The result of the O.D. Heck study seemed so startling, especially in light of the positive response FC was getting in the popular press, that \"Frontline\" featured the story in its 1993 \"Prisoners of Silence\". In 1993, Genae A. Hall, research director for the Behavior Analysis Center for Autism, wrote: The fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called \"facilitator influence,\" which seems to be a misnomer. \"Facilitator influence\" suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior, and the facilitator is exerting partial control (or \"influence\") over that behavior. Although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs, such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of FC. Rather than influencing the typed messages, the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages. Thus, the focus of analysis is shifted from the disabled person's behavior to the facilitator's behavior.The O.D. Heck study was not the only double blind research study to receive such results. In fact, multiple studies had been conducted to determine authorship before or around the same time as the O.D. Heck study. Whenever conditions were adequately controlled to prevent the facilitator from knowing the answers to questions presented to the disabled communication partner, the results revealed facilitator influence, if not direct authorship.\n\nIn 1994, Thistledown Regional Centre in Ontario, Canada conducted an internal study of 20 people with autism and stopped using FC when the results showed facilitator influence was \"contaminating the messages being produced.\" By 1995, these results had been replicated by researchers worldwide in at least 24 studies in credible, peer-reviewed research journals using \"a variety of methods to see what happens when the facilitator doesn't know or can't guess the message that is expected or doesn't look at the letter display.\"\n\nIn 1997, reflecting on the trajectory FC has taken in several countries, including Denmark, the U.S. and Australia, von Tetzchner wrote:In the struggle to keep up to date with an increasing number of published papers, both researchers and practitioners tend to forget history. In order to avoid making the same mistakes over again, the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques--as well as other intervention methods--in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews. When an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears, the likely reason is lack of positive results.By 2005, more than 50 controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted, in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases. The studies consistently showed \"without a doubt\" that the messages obtained through facilitated communication were controlled by the facilitators and not their communication partners.\n\nIn October 2018, Provost Jim Wohlpart disclosed the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) would stop supporting a conference on facilitated communication it had hosted for the last five years, following representations from scientists and academics arguing the practice had long been discredited.\n\nA group of over thirty researchers and academics around the globe had called for the University of Northern Iowa to cancel the fifth Midwest Summer Institute held June 18–19, 2018, because the conference promotes Facilitated Communication. The conference was co-sponsored by Waverly-based Inclusion Connection and Syracuse University’s Institute on Communication and Inclusion, formerly called the Facilitated Communication Institute. The \"30-plus academics and professionals — from Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, Emory University, the University of Melbourne in Australia, the University of London in England, and three UNI professors — have sent a letter to UNI College of Education Dean Gaetane Jean-Marie asking her to reconsider supporting the event and its promotion of 'this invalidated and demonstrably harmful practice.'\" The letter sent to the University stated that this \"practice was 'thoroughly discredited over 25 years ago.'\" According to \"The Gazette\" article from June 15, 2018, the UNI had not responded to questions about money, attendance or students receiving college credit for the class. Mark Sherry, a spokesman for the critics, stated that \"I would like the university to come out and be consistent with the scientific academic community and disavow facilitated communication\" continuing he emphasized: “This is not even debatable. Study after study after study for 30 years has found that the messages are offered by the facilitator.\" FC supporter and workshop speaker Marilyn Chadwick said that she has seen people's lives change for the good once they can communicate, but \"Maybe the typing will lead to talking, and maybe the talking will lead to independence\". Jason Travers speaking for the skeptical group \"It’s not only dubious, it’s dangerous\".\n\nAn article by Forbes published on June 18, 2018 was highly critical of the University of Northern Iowa's support of Facilitated Communication. The article featured comments from former facilitator Janyce Boynton who was quoted as saying \"By the mid-1990s, the scientific community had proved over and over again that it was the facilitator—not the disabled communication partner—who was typing the messages. Every time. Full stop.\"\n\nIn a statement issued on the second day of the 2018 conference UNI spokesman Scott Ketelsen acknowledged that concerns about the practices presented at the event had been raised and said that UNI will be reevaluating its sponsorship of the Midwest Summer Institute. \"We regularly evaluate UNI’s sponsorship of conferences and events to ensure that we are supporting high-quality programming consistent with the mission of the university. As part of this regular review, we will be convening a group of faculty experts from across campus to discuss the practices presented at this conference.\" \nProponents of the method have defended the conference. Following the decision in October to stop hosting the conference, UNI did not indicate whether or not they would help to relocate it.\n\nThe concept and technique of facilitated communication is one that has been increasingly debated over the last few decades with the vast majority of evidence indicating that it is not scientifically valid. However, this information has not stopped many individuals from using this technique under various circumstances and furthermore, advocating for its effectiveness.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of evidence from studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that the likely explanation for any \"positive\" results—that is, anything indicating that facilitated communication has worked—can be attributed to the facilitators themselves. Be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or the creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating. Further examination into this technique has discovered various examples in which the disabled individual using facilitated communication could correctly respond to simple questions only when the facilitator was in the room to hear the questions. This included asking the facilitator to leave and then proceeding to show the disabled individual a picture of an animal. Next, the facilitator would return to the room and be asked to help the individual answer the question: \"what animal did I just show you?\" In all of these cases, the questions were answered incorrectly. However, when asked questions while the facilitator was in the room, the correct response would be made. Shockingly, this technique has also led to a series of false sexual abuse cases in which the facilitator would indicate that the disabled individual revealed that they had been sexually abused. Unsurprisingly, these cases were later dismissed upon the discovery that these false accusations were actually a result of the facilitator fabricating these stories.\n\nFinally, even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.\n\nThere have been instances in which a person, through facilitated communication, seems to disclose experiences of sexual or physical abuse. Often, the alleged abuse is sexual and contains \"extensive, explicit, pornographic details.\" While facilitators are taught to expect their communication partners to reveal sensitive, personal issues, it is not known whether FC generates more abuse allegations than other suggestive techniques.\n\nResearchers suspect that facilitators involved in this type of case may, mistakenly, believe there is a link between early abuse and autism or, for other reasons, suspect familial abuse. As Green wrote in a 1995 article:suggestions about sexual abuse permeate the culture. Just watch Oprah or Phil [Donahue] almost any time or scan the pop psychology section at your local bookstore. Couple that with mandatory abuse reporting laws, mix in a little bit of crusading zeal to \"save\" people with disabilities from mistreatment, and you have a potent set of antecedents for facilitators to produce allegations.In 1993, \"Frontline\"'s \"Prisoners of Silence\" featured the story of Gerry Gherardi of North Carolina who was accused, through FC-generated messages, of sexually abusing his son. Despite protestations of innocence, Gherardi was forced to stay away from his home for six months. The charges were dropped when court-ordered double-blind tests showed that Gherardi's son could not write. In the same year, Rimland reported in a \"New York Times\" article that he knew of about 25 cases where families were accused through facilitated communication of sexually abusing their children.\n\nBy 1995, there were five dozen known cases, with untold numbers of others settled without reaching public visibility. Since then, the number of cases continues to increase. In addition to accusations of sexual abuse, facilitators, reportedly, have fallen in love with their communication partners and, relying on FC for consent, initiated sexual, physical contact with people in their care, raising serious ethical and legal problems for facilitators, protective service agencies, law enforcement, court officials, educators, and family members alike.\n\nAbout the same time FC was gaining popularity in the United States in the early 1990s, the Guardianship and Administration Board in Melbourne, Australia, was reviewing a landmark case involving allegations of sexual abuse and facilitated communication. The 1990 case involved a 28-year-old woman (pseudonym \"Carla\") with severe disabilities who was removed, twice, from her home by state authorities because of messages obtained through FC that she was being sexually abused at home.\n\nNine facilitators, including Crossley, one of Australia's leaders in FC movement, over a course of nine months, obtained messages through FC that, allegedly involved incest, rape and other sexual depredations. Crossley had assessed Carla in August 1998, indicating that her ability to spell was very good and expressing amazement at the extent of Carla's vocabulary and perceptions during the evaluation. Officials removed Carla from the home when one of the facilitators, through another facilitated session, indicated Carla threatened suicide if she was not removed from her home.\n\nA 15-month custody battle ensued, during which Carla was subjected to over 100 hours of psychological and other testing. In the end, the Guardianship Board concluded that Carla was severely intellectually disabled, unable to differentiate between letters of the alphabet, and could not have authored the messages. The double-blind testing, conducted by psychologist Tony Cantanese, demonstrated that the only meaningful responses obtained through FC were when the facilitator knew the questions being asked of Carla. The court determined that Carla and her family were \"victims\" and admonished the facilitators: \"the one step that would have prevented the case occurring--prior verification that the woman could communicate with facilitated communication--had not been done.\" All charges were dropped and custody was granted to Carla's family.\n\nIn 1991, Mark Storch from Shokan, New York, was charged with abusing his daughter after the Department of Social Services received reports that his daughter, Jenny, a 14-year-old with autism, had, through facilitated communication, disclosed recurring sexual assaults, including 200 vaginal and anal rapes. Storch's wife, Laura, was charged with neglect. Despite no physical evidence of abuse, inconsistencies in the facilitated testimony, and questions about the facilitator's troubling personal history, officials pressed charges, which led to a costly, 10-month legal battle. The case was dropped because FC lacked sufficient testing and acceptance in the scientific community.\n\nBennett Leventhal, head of pediatric psychology at the University of Chicago, testified in the Storch's defense, saying: The obligation of an investigator into a new technique is to show how it works. With FC, there's this basic assumption of \"What can it hurt?\" The Storch trial is living proof of how dangerous it is to embrace new science before it has been tested.\n\nIn 1992, the parents of Betsy Wheaton, a 16-year-old nonspeaking person with autism, were, through facilitated communication, falsely accused of sexually abusing their daughter. The facilitator, Janyce Boynton, who was trained in FC at the University of Maine, interpreted Betsy's hitting and scratching during facilitated sessions as reenactments of abuses occurring at home. Boynton reported these incidents to the Department of Human Services, and Betsy and her brother were removed from the home. The brother was also implicated. The parents' attorney hired Howard Shane of Boston Children's Hospital to conduct testing of authorship. It was determined through double blind testing that Boynton, not Betsy, was authoring the messages obtained through facilitation. Boynton, unlike many other facilitators who have undergone testing, accepted the results, stopped using FC, and persuaded the school system to stop using FC as well.\n\nLooking back on her training, Boynton could see that it had been inadequate. She had not worked with anyone who was nonverbal, and she was pronounced \"good to go\" after only two days of mostly lectures. She knew that disabled people suffer relatively high levels of abuse, was taught that there was a strong affinity between patient and facilitator, so, she has stated, \"you get this sense in your head that you're the only one this person trusts... And then you get overly protective and you have that thought in your head that maybe they've been abused.\" She describes the process of facilitating as '\"everything happening at once... you're so distracted by other things.\" Until she was tested, she fully believed that she was protecting Betsy. Howard Shane states: 'You're expected to believe (the person has been abused) and then, bam, the accusation happens.\"\n\nOf the Wheaton case, Todd wrote: The real responsibility for the Wheaton tragedy lies with Rosemary Crossley, Douglas Biklen, and their acolytes. Despite all of their advanced degrees, professional credentials, and university appointments, they failed in their professional and ethical responsibility to show that FC was safe and effective before foisting it on the world. Having donned the trappings of expertise and put themselves out as authorities, they incurred what John Erskine called \"the moral obligation to be intelligent.\" Long before they even thought to put pen to paper and write their extravagant tales of extra-ordinary awakenings, they should have heeded not just the technical lessons of Clever Hans, but the findings of more than a century of scientific and practical investigations of automatic writing, experimenter bias, mental telepathy, unconscious influence, subjective validation, stimulus leakage, expectancy effects, deception and self-delusion. Had they exercised due scientific diligence, the developers of FC would have quickly realized that they had done nothing better than turn pliant arms into Ouija planchettes and reinvent the seance.\n\nIn 1993, Gregory Cracchiolo, a teacher of students with severe developmental disabilities in Whittier, California, was accused of sexually assaulting four of his students, with facilitated communication being the only source of evidence. The student making the allegation was unable to communicate by speech to verify these claims. Cracchiolo lost his job and faced 11 felony counts of forcible sodomy and forced oral copulation. He faced a maximum sentence of 88 years in prison. While authorship testing was not done, the charges were dropped after a month, because FC lacked the scientific evidence to determine its efficacy. The prosecutor continued to believe the abuses occurred. Cracchiolo's career as an educator was ruined.\n\nIn 1993, David and Jean Lehman of Newmarket, Ontario, were charged with sexually abusing their 20-year-old son, Derek, based solely on evidence obtained through facilitated communication. At birth, Derek had been diagnosed with autism and severe mental retardation and, at the time of the allegations, lived in a group home. He was not able to speak but could use two hand signals: \"please\" and \"toilet\". He was not able to recognize numbers beyond three and was not aware of his own sex or that of others.\n\nDuring authorship testing, conducted by Mary Konstantareas, psychology professor at the University of Guelph, Derek was not able to name an object that he had seen but his facilitators had not. After a year-long court battle, the charges were proven unfounded and dropped. The ordeal left the Lehmans in debt, nearly losing their business, and drove David Lehman to nearly committing suicide. The Lehmans filed an $8.5 million civil suit and accepted a settlement for an undisclosed amount. They were also granted custodianship of their son.\n\nIn 1997, a New York couple, who had lost custody of their daughter, was awarded $750,000 by a federal jury when jurors concluded that the officials in the case \"knew or should have known the girl's facilitated allegations of abuse were bogus.\"\n\nIn 1999, a 50-year-old business man from the south of England was accused, through FC, of abusing his 17-year-old son. The son, reportedly, had severe autism and epileptic fits and was not able to speak. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, President of the High Court Family Division, ruled on the first case of its kind in England, saying FC was \"dangerous\" and should not be used by UK courts to \"back up or dismiss allegations of abuse.\" She also indicated the court was \"entirely satisfied the allegations were unfounded\", since there was no evidence that the father or anyone else was a perpetrator, or that the abuse had ever occurred.\n\nIn 2007, Julian Wendrow of West Bloomfield, Michigan, was charged with sexually abusing his daughter, Aislinn, and placed in jail for 80 days. His wife, Tali, was accused of severely mentally and emotionally abusing her children and was forced to wear an electronic tether. Their 13-year-old son was also named as a perpetrator. Both children were placed in foster care.\n\nThe allegations resulted from messages obtained via FC at school while an aide helped guide the girl's hand. The case was a \"virtual rerun\" of the 1992 Betsy Wheaton case. When lawyers questioned the girl without the facilitator present, she was unable to answer questions, including \"What color is your sweater?\" and \"Are you a boy or a girl?\" The case fell apart due to lack of physical evidence of abuse and facilitated testimony that contained information inconsistent with the Wendrow's family, lifestyle and living arrangements: relatives that did not exist, Christian theology attributed to observant Jewish parents, nonexistent rooms and photos.\n\nAislinn testified, through FC, that she was afraid of her father because of a gun. Police found no guns in the home. As a result, the charges were dropped and the children returned to their parents. Prosecutors continued to believe the girl was afraid of her father. A wrongful arrest suit was settled for $1.8 million, which, according to the attorney representing the Police Department, was a business decision made by the insurance company and was not an admission of wrongdoing or liability.\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Gigi Jordan of New York was found by police in the Peninsula New York hotel. She was incoherent from a drug overdose. Jude Mirra, her 8-year-old son, was also found, dead from a mixture of painkillers and anti-inflammatories which Jordan force-fed him. Jordan, at the time, was under the impression Mirra wanted to die because of alleged sexual abuse typed out during sessions involving FC. Despite testifying that she was \"by Jude's side at all hours of the day\", Jordan believed the biological father, her ex-husband, had been abusing the boy for years and that Mirra's diagnosis of autism was actually a catatonic psychosis brought on by the alleged abuse. To Jordan, the killing was \"altruistic filicide\"; a mercy killing.\n\nMirra, who was diagnosed with autism, was not able to speak. Jordan indicated that Mirra, through FC, had told her \"I need a lot of drugs to die peacefully\" and \"I wish you do it soon.\" Although Jordan and Mirra communicated by typing together on a Blackberry, no witnesses ever observed Mirra type by himself. In reviewing typed messages provided by Jordan of her son's disclosures, court officials questioned whether Mirra had the capacity to understand or spell words like \"aggressively\" and \"sadistic\".\n\nJordan also believed her second ex-husband, a pharmaceutical executive, was stealing millions of dollars from her and wanted her killed. Both men denied the accusations. No evidence of any crimes committed in connection with the case were found against either of the two men. In November, 2014, the jury accepted Jordan's claim of extreme emotional disturbance and found her guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the death of her son.\n\nIn 2012, the parents of a young woman with severe intellectual disabilities, autism and profound communication problems were reunited with their daughter after the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales concluded they had been wrongfully arrested on suspicion of serious sexual assault obtained via FC. The family had been separated for six months. No charges were brought against the parents. Rowan Wilson, a psychiatrist, had, on November 8, 2010, assessed the woman's mental capacity using FC, though he, admittedly, had no knowledge or experience of the system. He also failed to consider the discrepancy between the woman's language fluency with and without FC. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Services ruled that Wilson was still fit to practice because \"he had shown remorse and insight into the errors he was highly unlikely to repeat.\" Wilson participated in further training in autism.\n\nIn 2015, Anna Stubblefield, a Rutgers University–Newark philosophy professor, was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault against a man with severe mental disabilities. Stubblefield stated that the two of them had a mutually consenting relationship established through facilitated communication. At the time the investigation began in 2011, Stubblefield was the chair of Rutgers-Newark's philosophy department, whose professional work centered on ethics, race, and disability rights. She was married and had a family.\n\nStubblefield was indicted in January 2013. The victim was identified as D.J., a 33-year-old African-American man with severe mental disabilities, whom Stubblefield met in 2008 through D.J.'s brother, a student of hers and one of D.J.'s legal guardians. D.J. cannot speak, has cerebral palsy and is unable to stand independently or accurately direct movements of his body. Based on evidence of mental disability, his mother and brother were appointed his legal guardians. Stubblefield, a proponent of facilitated communication, used the technique with D.J., and stated that she had successfully communicated with him, determining he was of normal intelligence. She subsequently brought him to conferences where she \"held him out as a success story\". Speaking with the assistance of Stubblefield using facilitated communication, D.J. is quoted, by Stubblefield, in the chapter \"Living a Good Life...in Adult-Sized Diapers\" in \"Disability and the Good Human Life\":The right to communication is the right to hope...I am jumping for joy knowing I can talk, but don't minimize how humiliating it can be to know people jump to the conclusion I am mentally disabled. If people understand the punishment of perceiving other people as inhuman, then things will get better. Stubblefield's web site says that she was \"certified as a Facilitated Communication Trainer by the FC Institute (now the Institute on Communication and Inclusion) at the School of Education, Syracuse University. She provides motor planning support for communication and literacy for adults and children.\"\n\nOn Memorial Day in 2011, Stubblefield revealed to D.J.'s mother and brother that she had had sexual relations with D.J. and that they were in love. She attributed consent to messages received while facilitating. Testing of D.J. by family members failed to establish the ability to communicate, Stubblefield was thanked, but denied further access to D.J. However, she continued to attempt to maintain contact with D.J. and began challenging control of D.J.'s legal guardians over him. In August 2011, the family went to the Rutgers police, who contacted Essex County prosecutors.\n\nDespite 20 years of psychological testing, which concluded that D.J. is severely mentally disabled, Stubblefield considered D.J. mentally capable, having the capacity to understand questions, communicate using facilitated communication, and give consent to sex. Prosecutors argued that FC has been scientifically discredited and that D.J. did not have the ability to give consent for or to refuse sexual relations. Stubblefield pleaded not guilty to the charges, but was put on administrative leave without pay and removed as chair of the philosophy department. D.J. was not allowed to testify using facilitated communication as it was ruled unreliable under New Jersey law. Experts evaluating D.J. testified he did not have the intellectual ability to consent to sexual activity. After a three-week trial, the jury found Stubblefield guilty of two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault. After conviction, the judge revoked bail saying that she was a flight risk. Sentencing, with possible penalties of between ten and twenty years in prison on each count, was scheduled for January 15, 2016. Stubblefield filed a motion to have the jury's verdict set aside on the grounds that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to prove that she knew or should have known that D.J. was not capable of giving consent. On January 15, 2016, she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. She will be required to register as a sex offender. In a press release, the Assistant Prosecutor, Eric Plant, said: \"Knowing how desperately families of disabled individuals are for some hope, she misled the victim's family into believing that she was making progress in helping their son to communicate while all the while she was simply satisfying her own tawdry desires\".\n\nOn April 3, 2017, Jeff McMahan, a former professor of philosophy at Rutgers and a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Oxford, and Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University and laureate professor at the University of Melbourne, published a joint op-ed in \"The New York Times\" about this case. They expressed dismay at the exclusion of evidence at trial that might have supported Stubblefield's contention that D.J. is and was cognitively able to communicate using facilitated communication and consent to sexual activity, and concluded that \"Stubblefield herself is a victim of grievous and unjust harms\". On March 19, 2018 Stubblefield \"pleaded guilty to third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact\". On May 11, 2018 she was sentenced to time served. In October 2016, the family was awarded $4 million in a civil lawsuit against Stubblefield.\n\nIn 2014, Martina Susanne Schweiger of Queensland, Australia, received an 18-month suspended jail sentence for two counts of indecent dealing with a 21-year-old client with severe autism with whom she worked at a disability services home. The client required 24-hour support and was not able to speak, write or use manual sign-language.\n\nSchweiger believed the client expressed love for her through FC, the purported feeling that she claimed to reciprocate. She also believed the client, again through FC, indicated a desire to have sex. On one occasion, Schweiger removed her clothes in front of her client. On another, she \"play wrestled\" with him, touching his penis with her hands and mouth. She confessed her actions to her employer. After hearing reports from Alan Hudson, psychology professor at RMIT University, that FC \"did not work for the young man\", Judge Gary Long of Maroochydore District Court found Schweiger guilty of the charges, indicating that FC was neither reliable nor accurate as a method of communication.\n\nIn 2018, Jose Cordero spent 35 days in jail and was barred from seeing his family for months after he was accused of abusing his 7-year-old son with autism. The accusations arose through the child's teacher using the \"hand-over-hand\" method of FC. Miami-Dade prosecutors grew suspicious when, through the facilitator the boy made even more outlandish claims and language not typical for someone that age. After being paired with a different teacher and specialist the child was no longer able to reproduce a single word. Coupled with negative DNA testing this resulted in the charges being dropped. According to a final State Attorney report, \"Due to significant inconsistencies within the victim’s disclosures coupled with controversial means by which the disclosure was obtained, and a lack of corroborating witnesses, the state would be unable to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt at this time.\"\n\nThe case raises questions about whether or not the teacher, Saul Fumero, made up the allegations and whether the district was aware he was using a discredited communication method. Fumero acknowledged that he has had no formal training in FC. A Miami-Dade Schools spokeswoman did not say whether the district would review Fumero's actions, but noted that teachers are required by law to immediately report allegations of abuse. The spokeswoman, Daisy Gonzalez-Diego, added that the district \"does not endorse the facilitated communication method and does not provide training\" for it because it is not accepted by those working in the field of \"augmentative and alternative communication.\"\n\n"}

Since the first series aired in 2011, \"Fake or Fortune?\" has drawn audiences of 5 million viewers in the UK, the highest for an arts show in that country.\n\n\"Fake or Fortune?\" was created by art dealer and art historian Philip Mould and producer Simon Shaw, inspired by Mould’s book \"Sleuth\" (2009), which was the programme’s working title during the development phase. It is co-presented by Mould and journalist Fiona Bruce, with specialist research carried out by Dr. Bendor Grosvenor during the first five seasons. Forensic analysis and archival research is carried out by various fine art specialists. Each series first aired on BBC One, except the third series accidentally first aired on SVT. The seventh series aired in August and September 2018.\n\nIn each episode Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce focus their attention on a painting (or a group of paintings), usually related to one particular artist. Season 7, episode 5 saw the show tackle their first sculpture, a work attributed to Alberto Giacometti. The team, assisted by Bendor Grosvenor in series 1 to 5, investigate the paintings on a number of fronts: establishing the provenance of the piece by working backwards from present day to the time of the work's creation; on a forensic level, with investigation and scientific tests on the materials used to help establish specific time frames; and examining the unique painting styles and quirks of the artist.

The plots deal with four main characters, known formally as Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm, and how they adapt to the superpowers they attain.\n\nConstantin Film bought the film rights for the characters in 1986. A low-budget film was produced in 1992 by New Horizon Studios owned by Roger Corman. In 2004, with a distribution deal from 20th Century Fox, a second \"Fantastic Four\" film entered production. \"Fantastic Four\" was released in 2005 and the sequel \"\" was released in 2007. Both films received mixed to negative reviews from critics, yet earned a combined worldwide at the box office. Due to 20th Century Fox's disappointment with the box-office return of \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\", a potential third \"Fantastic Four\" film and a Silver Surfer spin-off film were canceled.\n\nIn 2009, the development for a reboot was announced. Directed by Josh Trank, \"Fantastic Four\" was released on August 7, 2015 and received negative reviews from both critics and public, and Trank himself. A sequel to the reboot was scheduled to be released on June 9, 2017, but it was removed from Fox's upcoming slate.\n\nThe story of the film focused on four astronauts that were bombarded with cosmic rays from a comet while on an experimental space craft. In the process, they acquired extraordinary abilities.\n\nIn 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film acquired the film rights of the Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film in order to keep the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled \"The Fantastic Four\", had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.\n\nThe story features Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm and Victor von Doom getting hit by a space storm after boarding a space station. As a result of the radiation from the storm, they gain new abilities and powers that they have deal with in their own ways.\n\nChris Columbus was hired by 20th Century Fox to write and direct the film in 1995. In 1997, Peter Segal was attached to a script which had been written by Columbus and Michael France. Segal later left the project in the same year. Phillip Morton worked on the script, and Sam Hamm did rewrites in 1998. The following year, Raja Gosnell signed on as director. The film was announced in August 2000 as being aimed for a July 4, 2001 release date. Gosnell decided to leave the project to film \"Scooby-Doo.\" Peyton Reed served as replacement in April 2001. Reed contemplated making the film as a period piece set in the early 1960s during the space race. He later dropped out from the film. In April 2004, Tim Story was hired to direct and principal photography began in August in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with re-shoots carried on until May 2005. Starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon, the film was released on July 8, 2005.\n\nThe story, both inspired by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's \"Fantastic Four\" comic-book storyline \"The Galactus Trilogy\" and Warren Ellis's comic-book \"Ultimate Extinction\", features the Silver Surfer, whose cosmic energy has been affecting the planet Earth and leaving craters around the planet. Set against an impending wedding between Reed and Susan, the U.S. Army recruits the Fantastic Four to help stop the Silver Surfer, and separately gain help from Doom.\n\nWith \"Fantastic Four\" grossing $330.5 million worldwide, 20th Century Fox hired director Tim Story and screenwriter Mark Frost in December 2005 to return to work for the sequel. Don Payne was also hired to write the screenplay. Principal photography began on August 28, 2006 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The film was released on June 15, 2007.\n\nDue to 20th Century Fox's disappointment in the box-office performance of the film, a potential third \"Fantastic Four\" film and a Silver Surfer spin-off film were cancelled.\n\nThe story, loosely based on the \"Ultimate Fantastic Four\" comic-books, features four people teleporting to an alternate universe, which alters their physical form and grants them new abilities. They must learn to harness their abilities and work together as a team to save the Earth from a familiar enemy.\n\nIn August 2009, the development for the reboot of the \"Fantastic Four\" film franchise was announced by 20th Century Fox. In July 2012, Josh Trank was hired to direct. Michael Green, Jeremy Slater, Seth Grahame-Smith and Simon Kinberg were hired to write the screenplay with Slater and Kinberg receiving credit. Casting began in January 2014 with the announcement of the cast occurred in the following months. Principal photography began in May 2014 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and ended in August the same year. Starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell, the film was released on August 7, 2015. A sequel was originally planned for 2017, but was removed from the studio's schedule in November 2015.\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con International 2017, Noah Hawley said that he was developing a film centered on Doctor Doom. Dan Stevens was also said to be involved with the film. In June 2018, Hawley stated that the script was almost finished, but that there was \"a little uncertainty\" about whether it would be filmed due to his upcoming film \"Pale Blue Dot\" and the fact that Disney plans to acquire Fox.\n\nA Silver Surfer film is in the works with writer Brian K. Vaughan attached to the script.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company agreed to a $52.4 billion dollar deal to acquire 21st Century Fox, including its subsidiary 20th Century Fox. Disney's CEO Bob Iger stated that they plan to integrate the Fantastic Four into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released \"Fantastic Four\" (2005), \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" and \"Fantastic Four\" (2015) on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download. The films were also released on DVD and Blu-ray box sets:\n\nThe \"Fantastic Four\" film series is the fourth highest-grossing film series based on Marvel Comics characters after the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the \"Spider-Man\" films and the \"X-Men\" film series respectively grossing over $342 million in North America and over $787 million worldwide.\n\nNone of the \"Fantastic Four\" films have been positively received by critics. Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic called the 1994 film \"[a] painfully silly film, one with more heroic intentions than actual assets.\"\n\nRene Rodriguez of \"The Miami Herald\" gave negative reviews to the \"Fantastic Four\" films directed by Tim Story. Regarding \"Rise of the Silver Surfer\", he stated, \"Story does the same sort of efficient, impersonal job he did on the first film, keeping things at such a basic, almost childish level that it seems the movie is aimed squarely, if not exclusively, at the 12-and-under set.\" However, Roger Moore of \"Orlando Sentinel\" gave Story's \"Fantastic Four\" films good reviews. He called the first film as a \"popcorn popper\" and a \"cinematic sugar buzz\" and the second film an \"entertaining film that doesn't overstay its welcome.\"\n\nThe 2015 \"Fantastic Four\" film was the weakest reviewed of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story. Josh Trank, who directed the film, was himself not satisfied, posting a message on Twitter stating he had envisioned a better version of the film, but it was ruined by Fox; he later deleted the message.\n"}

Americans are asked, without prompting, to say what man and woman \"living today in any part of the world, do [they] admire most?\" The result is published as a top ten list. Most years the most admired man is the sitting President of the United States and the most admired woman is or has been the First Lady of the United States.\n\nSitting U.S. presidents have captured the top spot for men in 58 out of 70 years. Through 2016, evangelist Billy Graham had 60 appearances in the top 10, the most of anyone, with eight second-place finishes. The second most is Ronald Reagan with 31, and Jimmy Carter with 28 and Pope John Paul II with 27 follow. The sitting pope has finished in the top ten in every year since 1977.\n\nAmong women, the poll has shown Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Hillary Clinton as U.S. First Ladies with the most appearances on the list. The high mark for top 10 appearances belongs to Queen Elizabeth II with 48 through 2016. The high mark for most appearances at number 1, the most admired woman in the world, belongs to Hillary Clinton who served as the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, United States Senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, First Lady of the United States during the presidency of Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, and First Lady of Arkansas from 1983 to 1992.

In the 1940s, GAC's name was changed to General Artists Corporation to avoid confusion with a registered coin-machine company. General Artists Corporation, through a series of acquisitions and mergers, evolved first into a larger agency called Creative Management Associates, and then, in 1974, into ICM Partners.\n\nGAC was founded in the early 1930s as a partnership between Thomas G. Rockwell (–1958) and Francis \"Cork\" O'Keefe (1900–1990). It was called the Rockwell-O'Keefe Theatrical Agency. Their clients, then, included Bing Crosby and the newly formed Dorsey Brothers band. In 1939, when O'Keefe retired, Rockwell reorganized the firm and changed the name to General Amusement Corporation. In the 1940s, the only larger booking firm was Music Corporation of America (MCA).\n"}
{"id": "27307224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27307224", "title": "Good Luck Flag", "text": "Good Luck Flag\n\nThe Good Luck Flag, known as in the Japanese language, was a traditional gift for Japanese servicemen deployed during the military campaigns of the Empire of Japan, though most notably during World War II. The flag given to a soldier was a national flag signed by friends and family, often with short messages wishing the soldier victory, safety, and good luck.\n\nThe Japanese call their country's flag \"hinomaru\", which translates literally to \"sun's circle\", referencing the red circle on a white field. When the \"hinomaru\" was signed, the Japanese characters were usually written vertically, and radiated outward from the edge of the red circle. This practice is referenced in the second term, \"yosegaki\", meaning \"sideways-writing\". The phrase \"hinomaru-yosegaki\" can be interpreted as \"To write sideways around the red sun\", describing the appearance of the signed flag.\n\nThe \"hinomaru yosegaki\" was traditionally presented to a man prior to his induction into the Japanese armed forces or before deployment. Generally, relatives, neighbors, friends, and co-workers of the person receiving the flag would write their names, good luck messages, exhortations, or other personal messages on the field of the flag. The writing usually flowed out sideways in a rayed pattern away from the red sun. However, if the messages became crowded, well-wishers improvised and wrote wherever they could squeeze in a message.\n\nNormally, some kind of exhortation such as \"Bu un Chou kyu\" is written across the top within the white field. Loosely translated into English, \"Bu un Chou kyu\" means \"May your military fortunes be long lasting.\" Dark, medium-sized characters may normally be seen that run vertically down the right or left hand margin of the flag. These usually occur in one, two or three columns and are generally the names of the man receiving the flag, and the name of the individual or organization presenting the gift to him. The \"kanji\" characters were typically written with a calligraphy brush and ink. While it was normally the custom to sign only around the red center of the flag, some examples may be found with characters written upon the red center as well.\n\nWhen the custom of writing on flags began is up for debate. Some sources indicate that signed flags became part of the military man's off-to-war gear, along with a \"Thousand-stitch sash\" (\"senninbari\"), during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895.) Any good luck flags that pre-date the Manchurian Incident (1931) should be considered rare. It is generally agreed that most \"hinomaru yosegaki\" seen today come from just before or during the period of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945.)\n\nFor the military man stationed far away from home and loved ones, the \"hinomaru yosegaki\" offered communal hopes and prayers to the owner every time the flag was unfolded. It was believed that the flag, with its many signatures and slogans would provide a combined force or power to see its owner through tough times. Furthermore, it reminded him in a material way to do his duty. The performance of that duty meant that the warrior was not expected to return home from battle. Often, the departing serviceman left clipped fingernails and hair behind so that his relatives would have something of him in which to hold a funeral. Great honor was brought upon the family of those whose sons, husbands, brothers, and fathers died in the service of country and Emperor. The belief of self-sacrifice was a central one within Japanese culture and was much exalted during World War II. Culturally, the Japanese believed that in doing one's duty, the soldier, sailor, or aviator must offer up his life freely to the Emperor just as the cherry blossoms fall freely from the tree at the height of their beauty. As part of the samurai or bushido code (Way of the Warrior), this worldview was brought forward into twentieth-century Japan from the old warring days of feudal Japan and was impressed upon twentieth-century soldiers, most of whom descended from non-samurai families.\n\nIn Sid Phillips's book, \"You'll Be Sor-ree\", he describes the role of Japanese flags played in the Pacific War, \"Every Jap seemed to have a personal silk flag with Jap writing all over it and a large meatball in the center.\" There are numerous books describing these souvenirs taken home by U.S. Marines and U.S. Army Infantry. Another example is Eugene Sledge's book \"With the Old Breed\", \"The men gloated over, compared, and often swapped their prizes. It was a brutal, ghastly ritual the likes of which have occurred since ancient times on battlefields where antagonists have possessed a profound mutual hatred.\" In a 2008 article of the \"Monroe News\", a World War II veteran talked about the flag brought from the Pacific theatre. He said he did not search every Japanese soldier he shot, as there was usually not enough time. He found the flag while fighting on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. He said soldiers did not take large souvenirs, such as a katana (sword), for fear that someone would steal it; a flag could be easily concealed. The flag was being returned to Japan through Dr. Yasuhiko Kaji who searches for the owner and/or their family.\n\nOBON SOCIETY (formerly OBON 2015) is a non-profit affiliate organization with the mission to return \"good luck flags\" to their families in Japan. The American Embassy in Tokyo wrote a letter to OBON 2015 declaring; \"OBON 2015 continues President Kennedy's spirit of reconciliation and friendship.\" In 2015, OBON SOCIETY's efforts were acknowledged by the Japanese government when Rex and Keiko Ziak, founders of OBON SOCIETY traveled to Japan with a group of U.S. veterans and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. With the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, OBON SOCIETY's work has been recognized by Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs as an important symbol of reconciliation, mutual understanding, and friendship between our two countries. As of August 2017 they have returned 108 flags and have more than 295 other flags they are currently working on returning. On 15 August 2017, OBON SOCIETY arranged Marvin Strombo, 93 years old WWII Veteran a trip to Japan to return his flag back to the family (Tatsuya Yasue, 89 years old younger brother) in their village. Published news stories and interviews indicate that the effort to return the flags is seen as a humanitarian act which can provide closure for the family members.\n\nThe United States' National World War II Museum publishes a preservation guide with a list of recommendations for storing and preserving synthetic materials such as flags. Such artifacts should be stored in climate-controlled areas, never in attics or basements, and should also be kept away from bright light such as sunlight and fluorescent lights which have large amounts of UV rays. If intended for display, a flag or any textile artifact should be supported by a backing, never allowed to hang by its own weight. If storing in a box, make sure the textile is flat with no creases. Do not use sealed plastic bags; however, muslin bags can be used. Direct Human contact may cause damage to these artifacts as well, since hands can transfer oils, sweat, or make-up to the artifact and cause damage. Wear clean cotton or nylon gloves when handling heirloom textiles.\n\n"}
{"id": "161487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161487", "title": "Ico", "text": "Ico\n\nThe protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.\n\n\"Ico\" introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, bloom lighting, and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. It has been called one of the greatest games of all time, and is often brought up in discussions about video games as an art form. It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with \"Shadow of the Colossus\", the spiritual successor to \"Ico\".\n\n\"Ico\" is primarily a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle. \n\nThese actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open.\n\nEscaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.\n, a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across , a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it slips up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.\n\nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She wakes up and smiles at Ico.\n\nLead designer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for \"Ico\" in 1997, envisioning a \"boy meets girl\" story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication. Ueda's original inspiration for \"Ico\" was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the manga series \"Galaxy Express 999\" (1977–1981), where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on Kenji Eno's Sega Saturn game \"Enemy Zero\", which influenced the animation work, cinematic cutscenes, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game \"Another World\" (\"Outer World\" in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any head-up display elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited Sega Mega Drive games, \"Virtua Fighter\", \"Lemmings\", \"Flashback\" and the original \"Prince of Persia\" games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in Lightwave to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of \"Shadow of the Colossus\", the team's next effort.\n\nUeda began working with producer Kenji Kaido in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the PlayStation. \"Ico\"s design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting. This was achieved through the use of \"subtracting design\"; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality. This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors. Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the \"subtracting design\", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures. Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as Team Ico. On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with \"Shadow of the Colossus\".\n\nAfter two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the Emotion Engine of the PlayStation 2, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform. Character animation was accomplished through key frame animation instead of the more common motion capture technique. The game took about four years to create. Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.\n\nThe cover used for releases in Japan and PAL regions was drawn by Ueda himself, and was inspired by the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico and his work \"The Nostalgia of the Infinite\". Ueda believed that \"the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico\". The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once. The development team was unable to provide Ueda's cover or the additional features such as the two-player mode in time for Sony's planned North American release date, but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions. On reflection, Yasuhide Kobayashi, vice-president of Sony's Japan Studio, believed the North American box art and lack of an identifiable English title led to the game's poor sales in the United States, and stated plans to correct that for the release of \"The Last Guardian\". For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box. The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of \"Shadow of the Colossus\", \"Ico\"s spiritual sequel, to allow players to \"fill the gap in their collection\".\n\n\"Ico\" uses minimal dialog in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game. Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shindō as Ico, Rieko Takahashi as Yorda, and Misa Watanabe as the Queen. Ico and the Queen's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda's speech is presented in a symbolic language. Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the \"holding hands\" concept of the game. In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles.\n\n\"Ico\"s audio featured a limited amount of music and sound effects. The soundtrack, , was composed by Michiru Oshima and sound unit \"pentagon\" (Koichi Yamazaki & Mitsukuni Murayama) and released in Japan by Sony Music Entertainment on February 20, 2002. The album was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works. The last song of the CD, \"ICO -You Were There-\", includes vocals sung by former Libera member Steven Geraghty.\nA novelization of the game titled was released in Japan in 2004. Author Miyuki Miyabe wrote the novel because of her appreciation of the game. A Korean translation of the novel, entitled 이코 - 안개의 성 (\"I-ko: An-gae-eui Seong\") came out the following year, by Hwangmae Publishers, while an English translation was published by Viz Media on August 16 of 2011.\n\nCostumes (including Ico and Yorda), stickers, and sound effects from \"Ico\" are part of an add-on pack for the game \"LittleBigPlanet\", alongside similar materials from \"Shadow of the Colossus\", after being teased by the game's developers Media Molecule about two weeks prior.\n\nA film adaption of \"Ico\" may come about based on the success of the adaptation of \"Shadow of the Colossus\" being created by Misher Films in conjunction with Sony and Fumito Ueda.\n\n\"Ico\" received strong reviews, becoming a cult hit among gamers. The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40. The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; \"Edge\" ranked \"Ico\" as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing, while IGN ranked the game at number 18 in 2005, and at number 57 in 2007. \"Ico\" has been used as an example of a game that is a work of art. Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance \"Ico\" from conventional video games due to the negative image that video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title.\n\nSome reviewers have likened \"Ico\" to older, simpler adventure games such as \"Prince of Persia\" or \"Tomb Raider\", that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; IGNs David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was \"near indescribable.\" The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that \"The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it.\" Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects. \"Ico\"s ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of \"The New York Times\" summed up his review stating that \"Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.\" Herold later commented that \"Ico\" breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but \"Ico\" creates the sense of \"trust and childish fragility\" around Yorda, and that these leads to the character being \"the game's entire focus\".\n\nThe game is noted for its simple combat system that would \"disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth\", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that \"you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do\". \"Ico\" is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls \"painfully short\" with \"no replay outside of self-imposed challenges\". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that \"the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings\". The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" notes that \"Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending.\"\n\nDespite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions, Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as \"Ico\" lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.\n\n\"Ico\" received several gaming acclamations from the video gaming press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as \"Halo\", \"\", and \"Grand Theft Auto III\". The game received three Game Developers Choice Awards in 2002, including \"Excellence in Level Design\", \"Excellence in Visual Arts\", and \"Game Innovation Spotlight\". The game won two Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 2002 for \"Art Direction\" and \"Character or Story Development\", and was nominated for awards of \"Game of the Year\", \"Game Design\", \"Level Design\" and \"Sound Design\".\n\n\"Ico\" is stated by Chris Kohler of \"Wired\" to have influenced numerous other video games, borrowing from its simple and visual design ideals. Several game designers, such as Eiji Aonuma, Hideo Kojima, and Jordan Mechner, have cited \"Ico\" as having influenced the visual appearance of their games, including \"\", \"\", and \"\", respectively. Marc Laidlaw, scriptwriter for the \"Half-Life\" series, commented that, among several other more memorable moments in the game, the point where Yorda attempts to save Ico from falling off the damaged bridge was \"a significant event not only for that game, but for the art of game design\". The Naughty Dog team used \"Ico\" as part of the inspiration for developing \"Uncharted 3\". Vander Caballero credits \"Ico\" for inspiring the gameplay of \"Papo & Yo\". Phil Fish used the design by subtraction approach in developing the title \"Fez\". The developers of both \"\" and \"Rime\" have \"Ico\" as a core influence on their design. Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator and director of the \"Souls\" series, cited \"Ico\" as a key influence to him becoming involved in developing video games, stating that \"Ico\" \"awoke me to the possibilities of the medium\".\n\nFilm director Guillermo del Toro cited both \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\" as \"masterpieces\" and part of his directorial influence. Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead considers, of his top ten video games, \"\"Ico\" might be the best one\".\n\n, released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2005 in Japan and North America, was developed by the same team that developed \"Ico\". The game features similar graphics, gameplay, and storytelling elements as \"Ico\". The game was referred by its working title \"Nico\" (\"Ni\" being Japanese for the number 2\") until the final title was revealed. Ueda, when asked about the connection between the two games, stated that \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is a prequel to \"Ico\".\n\nTeam Ico's third game, \"The Last Guardian\", was announced as a PlayStation 3 title at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009. The game centers on the connection between a young boy and a large griffin-like creature that he befriends, requiring the player to cooperate with the creature to solve the game's puzzles. The game fell into development hell due to hardware limitations and the departure of Ueda from Sony around 2012, along with other Team Ico members, though Ueda and the other members continued to work on the game via consulting contracts. Development subsequently switched to the PlayStation 4 in 2012, and the game was reannounced in 2015 and released in December 2016. Ueda has stated that \"the essence of the game is rather close to \"Ico\"\".\n\n\"Ico\", along with \"Shadow of the Colossus\", received a high-definition remaster for the PlayStation 3 that was released worldwide in September 2011. In addition to improved graphics, the games were updated to include support for stereoscopic 3D and PlayStation Trophies. The \"Ico\" port was also based on the European version, and includes features such as Yorda's translation and the two-player mode. In North America and Europe/PAL regions, the two games were released as a single retail collection, while in Japan, they were released as separate titles. Both games have since been released separately as downloadable titles on the PlayStation Network store. Patch 1.01 for the digital high-definition Ico version added the Remote Play feature, allowing the game to be played on the PlayStation Vita.\n\n"}

She is made entirely of mechanical parts and nanomachines. She is programmed based on the tenets of logic, probability, and the completion of her assigned mission. However, threats to the physical safety of her co-creator, Shion Uzuki, cause KOS-MOS to temporarily ignore these parameters. She is equipped with a \"Simulated Personality OS\" to aid in communication, although she appears incapable of emotion.\n\nKOS-MOS has significant powers believed to be superior to all other party members. In addition to superhuman strength and speed, the nanomachines her body is formed from allow her to morph parts of her body (specifically her arms) into various energy projectile and melee weapons. Her body is also able to self-repair and is very durable though not indestructible, and she is also protected by a force-shield. She also possesses the ability to summon weapons such as the F-GSHOT chainguns and her famous F-SCYTHE and equipment from another location via U.M.N. transport. She also has a long-range sensory array, the D.S.S.S. system and CPU that exceeds even those possessed by Observational Realians. She also possesses a Hilbert Effect projector whose power is thousands of times greater than that achieved by even the largest spaceships.\n\nKOS-MOS possesses several black box components left behind by Kevin Winnicot. Each of these black box features are found in each of her skeletons, Version 1, Version 2, Version 3 and Version 4. One of these is her potent X-BUSTER weapon, a powerful burst of energy beams from her abdomen that absorb the Gnosis. Others are related to her \"simulated personality\" OS and her self-awareness. KOS-MOS also has some form of energy manipulation tied to the Zohar. KOS-MOS has another weapon system called the \"Tertiary Weapon System\", which is seen periodically throughout the series. They consist of a set of energy wings, a pair of energy cannons and other attachments meant to be fitted onto her. While she is programmed to protect Vector personnel unconditionally, her highest priority is to protect Shion specifically.\n\nAn almost human alternate persona tends to come out from time to time in the form of a blue-eyed KOS-MOS. This blue-eyed KOS-MOS is far more powerful than red-eyed KOS-MOS and talks in a more empathetic human-sounding voice. This alternate KOS-MOS is in fact KOS-MOS' true personality that partially awakens at times when Shion is in extreme danger.\n\nKOS-MOS is one of many playable characters in the 2005 tactical role-playing game \"Namco × Capcom\", along with M.O.M.O. and Shion also from \"Xenosaga\". In 2008, she appeared as one of playable characters in the role-playing game \"\". That same year, KOS-MOS made a cameo appearance in the role-playing game \"Tales of Hearts\", where she is one of many supporting attack characters for the player. In 2010, she appeared as a playable character in \"\". In 2012, she appeared as a playable character in the tactical role-playing game \"Project X Zone\", as well as the 2015 sequel.\n\nIn 2005, she was included in the PlayStation 2 version of the 2005 fighting game \"Soulcalibur III\" as a hidden playable character, available only if the player completes her costume and then creates a custom character. In the 2008 role-playing game \"Tales of Vesperia\", KOS-MOS costume is available as a downloadable content for the character Judith in the PlayStation 3 version.\n\nThe limited edition of \"Xenosaga: Episode II\" included a figure of KOS-MOS dubbed \"Jashin MOK-KOS\" (\"Evil God MOK-KOS\"). Numerous other figures and figurines of KOS-MOS in various scales have been released in Japan, most of them are produced by the company Bandai. In 2013, Volks released a licensed 60 cm fashion doll of KOS-MOS Version 4, which was only available for purchase by a limited preorder. In a latest \"Xeno\" series entry \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\", KOS-MOS appears as one of the Rare Blades, an in-game anthropomorphic weapon obtainable via Core Crystals. KOS-MOS has a very low rate of appearance.\n\nKOS-MOS was well received by gaming media outlets. In 2009, GameDaily placed her 25th on their ranking of top video game robots, stating \"KOS-MOS is quite a looker, but she needs a personality\" and suggested her to \"download some emotions.\"\n\nIn 2008, IGN listed her as third top \"Soul\" series bonus character for her cameo appearance in \"Soulcalibur III\". In 2010, she was included on UGO's list of top 25 Japanese RPG characters her for being \"widely regarded as one of the most awesome characters to ever come out of Monolith's design department.\" That same year, Tim Turi of \"Game Informer\" chose KOS-MOS as one of the 20 Namco characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game \"Namco Vs Capcom\". In 2012, \"Complex\" included \"Capcom vs. Namco\" on the list of fighting game crossovers they would like to see the most, featuring KOS-MOS on Namco's side.\n\nIn 2011, Lisa Foiles of \"The Escapist\" listed her among the top five robots in games. Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\" ranked her as the third top AI character of the 2000s, stating she \"rises above as a powerhouse that can’t be forgotten.\"\n"}
{"id": "1070151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1070151", "title": "Kurgan hypothesis", "text": "Kurgan hypothesis\n\nThe Kurgan hypothesis (also known as the Kurgan theory or Kurgan model) or steppe theory is the most widely accepted proposal to identify the Proto-Indo-European homeland from which the Indo-European languages spread out throughout Europe, Eurasia and parts of Asia. It postulates that the people of a Kurgan culture in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea were the most likely speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE). The term is derived from the Russian \"kurgan\" (), meaning tumulus or burial mound.\n\nThe Kurgan hypothesis was first formulated in the 1950s by Marija Gimbutas, who used the term to group various cultures, including the Yamnaya, or Pit Grave, culture and its predecessors. David Anthony instead uses the core Yamnaya culture and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference.\n\nMarija Gimbutas defined the Kurgan culture as composed of four successive periods, with the earliest (Kurgan I) including the Samara and Seroglazovo cultures of the Dnieper–Volga region in the Copper Age (early 4th millennium BC). The people of these cultures were nomadic pastoralists, who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe.\n\nThree genetic studies in 2015 gave partial support to Gimbutas's Kurgan theory regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian and Ukrainian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.\n\nArguments for the identification of the Proto-Indo-Europeans as steppe nomads from the Pontic–Caspian region had already been made in the 19th century by German philologists Theodor Benfey and especially Otto Schrader. In his standard work about PIE and to a greater extent in a later abbreviated version, Karl Brugmann took the view that the urheimat could not be identified exactly at that time, but he tended toward Schrader's view. However, after Karl Penka's 1883 rejection of non-European origins, most scholars favoured a Northern European origin. The view of a Pontic origin was still strongly favoured, e.g., by the archaeologists V. Gordon Childe and Ernst Wahle. One of Wahle's students was Jonas Puzinas, who in turn was one of Gimbutas's teachers. Gimbutas, who acknowledges Schrader as a precursor, was able to marshal a wealth of archaeological evidence from the territory of the Soviet Union (and other countries then belonging to the eastern bloc) not readily available to scholars from western countries, enabling her to achieve a fuller picture of prehistoric Europe.\n\nWhen it was first proposed in 1956, in \"The Prehistory of Eastern Europe\", Part 1, Marija Gimbutas's contribution to the search for Indo-European origins was an interdisciplinary synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins identifies the Pontic–Caspian steppe as the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) urheimat, and a variety of late PIE dialects are assumed to have been spoken across the region. According to this model, the Kurgan culture gradually expanded until it encompassed the entire Pontic–Caspian steppe, Kurgan IV being identified with the Yamnaya culture of around 3000 BC.\n\nThe mobility of the Kurgan culture facilitated its expansion over the entire region, and is attributed to the domestication of the horse and later the use of early chariots. The first strong archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from the Sredny Stog culture north of the Azov Sea in Ukraine, and would correspond to an early PIE or pre-PIE nucleus of the 5th millennium BC. Subsequent expansion beyond the steppes led to hybrid, or in Gimbutas's terms \"kurganized\" cultures, such as the Globular Amphora culture to the west. From these kurganized cultures came the immigration of Proto-Greeks to the Balkans and the nomadic Indo-Iranian cultures to the east around 2500 BC.\n\nGimbutas defined and introduced the term \"Kurgan culture\" in 1956 with the intention of introducing a \"broader term\" that would combine Sredny Stog II, Pit Grave, and Corded ware horizons (spanning the 4th to 3rd millennia in much of Eastern and Northern Europe). The model of a \"Kurgan culture\" brings together the various cultures of the Copper Age to Early Bronze Age (5th to 3rd millennia BC) Pontic–Caspian steppe to justify their identification as a single archaeological culture or cultural horizon, based on similarities among them. The eponymous construction of kurgans (mound graves) is only one among several factors. As always in the grouping of archaeological cultures, the dividing line between one culture and the next cannot be drawn with hard precision and will be open to debate.\n\nCultures that Gimbutas considered as part of the \"Kurgan culture\":\n\nGimbutas's original suggestion identifies four successive stages of the Kurgan culture:\n\nIn other publications she proposes three successive \"waves\" of expansion:\n\n\nThe Kurgan hypothesis describes the initial spread of Proto-Indo-European during the 5th and 4th millennia BC. As used by Gimbutas, the term \"kurganized\" implied that the culture could have been spread by no more than small bands who imposed themselves on local people as an elite. This idea of the PIE language and its daughter-languages diffusing east and west without mass movement proved popular with archaeologists in the 1970s (the \"pots-not-people\" paradigm). The question of further Indo-Europeanization of Central and Western Europe, Central Asia and Northern India during the Bronze Age is beyond its scope, far more uncertain than the events of the Copper Age, and subject to some controversy. The rapidly developing field of archaeogenetics and genetic genealogy since the late 1990s has not only confirmed a migratory pattern out of the Pontic Steppe at the relevant time, it also suggests the possibility that the population movement involved was more substantial than anticipated.\n\nGimbutas believed that the expansions of the Kurgan culture were a series of essentially hostile military incursions where a new warrior culture imposed itself on the peaceful, matrilinear (hereditary through the female line), matrifocal, though egalitarian cultures of \"Old Europe\", replacing it with a patriarchal warrior society, a process visible in the appearance of fortified settlements and hillforts and the graves of warrior-chieftains:\n\nThe process of Indo-Europeanization was a cultural, not a physical, transformation. It must be understood as a military victory in terms of successfully imposing a new administrative system, language, and religion upon the indigenous groups.\n\nIn her later life, Gimbutas increasingly emphasized the authoritarian nature of this transition from the egalitarian process of the nature/earth mother goddess (Gaia) to a patriarchal society and the worship of the father/sun/weather god (Zeus, Dyaus). This supposed egalitarian, mother-goddess-worshipping society is not the same as a matriarchy in Gimbutas's view. Matriarchal hierarchy structures in Gimbutas's opinion are the same as a patriarchal society, not the actual opposite: an egalitarian society without hierarchy.\n\nJ. P. Mallory (in 1989) accepted the Kurgan hypothesis as the \"de facto\" standard theory of Indo-European origins, but he recognized criticism of any alleged, but not actually stated, \"radical\" scenario of military invasion; the slow accumulation of influence through coercion or extortion – Gimbutas's actual main scenario – was often taken as general and immediate raiding and then conquest:\nAlberto Piazza and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza have tried in the 2000s to align the Anatolian hypothesis with the Steppe theory. According to Alberto Piazza, writing in 2000, \"[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey.\" According to Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006), the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism. Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is \"\"some\" genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East.\" Nevertheless, the Anatolian hypothesis is controversial.\n\nDavid Anthony's \"The Horse, the Wheel and Language\" describes his \"revised steppe theory\". David Anthony considers the term \"Kurgan culture\" so lacking in precision as to be useless, instead using the core Yamnaya culture and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference. He points out that \nHe does not include the Maykop culture among those that he considers to be IE-speaking, presuming instead that they spoke a Caucasian language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It aired on Comedy Central on August 26, 2010. In the episode, the ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, Lrrr experiences marriage trouble with his queen, Ndnd. He departs for Earth, invading it in an attempt to overcome his mid-life crisis and reignite his marriage.\n\nThe episode was written by Patric M. Verrone and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson and guest stars \"Battlestar Galactica\"'s Katee Sackhoff and cartoonist Sergio Aragonés. Series creators and producers Matt Groening and David X. Cohen make cameos in the episode.\n\nOn his birthday, Ndnd becomes fed up with Lrrr's lack of motivation to conquer other worlds. He reluctantly invades Earth. However, he arrives during Comic-Con and is mistaken for a costume contest participant and leaves dejected. Concurrently, Fry attempts to author a superhero comic book featuring himself as the superhero saving a captured Leela from a malevolent alien. The crew is unimpressed with the comic, with the exception of the back page of novelty toy advertisements, including the Professor's disintegration guns, which are actually only teleportation guns. Leela's criticism leaves Fry to figure out how to make the story more compelling.\n\nBack on Omicron Persei 8, Ndnd learns of Lrrr's failure and kicks him out of their home. Lrrr returns to Earth, seeking shelter at the Planet Express building. The crew diagnoses Lrrr and his marriage problems as symptomatic of a mid-life crisis. Leela encourages Lrrr to recommit himself to his marriage with Ndnd, but he listens instead to Bender and gets plastic surgery, flashy new clothes, and goes out to a club to meet new women. There he meets an attractive female Omicronian named Grrrl. While on a date with her, she reveals that she is actually a human woman from the Comic-Con wearing an Omicronian costume. Though she is very attracted to real Omicronians, Lrrr rejects her and seeks Leela's advice on how to win back Ndnd.\n\nLeela and the crew help Lrrr stage an invasion of Earth using a fake broadcast with the help of the head of Orson Welles à la the 1938 \"The War of Worlds\" radio broadcast. Ndnd is fooled, but so are the Earthican army, who surrender Earth immediately to Lrrr. Leela scolds Lrrr, demanding that he end the charade and tell Ndnd the truth, but he hesitates due to Ndnd's renewed romantic interest and forces the citizens of Earth into slavery. While enslaved, Leela constantly nags Lrrr about telling Ndnd the truth, which causes Ndnd suspicion about their relationship. She confronts Lrrr, demanding to know if he is having an affair. Grrrl reappears, announcing that she loves Lrrr and will fight for him, brandishing a disintegration ray. Ndnd quickly takes the weapon and shoots Grrrl. Ndnd reveals that she is not upset that Lrrr may have been minutely romantically involved with Grrrl, but that Lrrr allowed Leela to nag him, which Ndnd feels is her role as his wife. Lrrr is reluctantly forced to prove his love for Ndnd by shooting Leela, whom he values as a friend, with the disintegration ray.\n\nAs he fires, Fry leaps in front of Leela, sacrificing his life. Ndnd is moved by Lrrr's demonstration of love and the two happily depart back to Omicron Persei 8. Leela is devastated by Fry's sacrifice. However, as the Omicronians depart, Grrrl reappears, shocking the crew. She reveals that the disintegration gun is merely one of the Professor's novelty teleportation guns that she purchased from an advertisement in the back of a comic book. Realizing that Fry is alive, the crew find him back at Planet Express, putting the finishing touches on his comic. Inspired by his own heroic actions, his super hero counterpart attempts to rescue \"Leela\" from the malevolent alien by leaping in front of its ray gun. Leela is pleased with the new ending and commends the comic book, giving Fry a kiss on the cheek.\n\nThis episode features a variety of guest stars including Katee Sackhoff as Grrrl, \"the future's equivalent of a furry\", and Sergio Aragonés, Matt Groening, and David X. Cohen as themselves.\n\nBongo Comics published a tie-in comic book, Delivery Boy-Man, as a free give-away at Comic-Con 2010. The comic is drawn in the same crude style depicted in the episode and features a fake letters page with fan mail from Bender.\n\nThe episode makes various cultural references and self-references. The episode title is a play on the title of the film \"Irreconcilable Differences\". One scene takes place at annual comic book convention Comic-Con, featuring a panel with cameos by series creator Matt Groening, co-producer and head writer David X. Cohen, and episode director Crystal Chesney-Thompson—along with visual references to other \"Futurama\" cast and crew, including the episode's writer, Patric M. Verrone, producer Claudia Katz, supervising director Peter Avanzino, and executive producer Ken Keeler—premiering a futuristic animated program named \"Futurella\" while attempting to dodge questions about Groening's other successful animated series, \"The Simpsons\". The episode also references the series' former television broadcasting company, Fox, and its cancellation policies. Other cultural references include Orson Welles and his famous 1938 radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\". The episode makes a brief reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon with the phrase \"Peace with honor\", which was a phrase President Nixon used to describe the Paris Peace Accord to end the Vietnam War in a speech on January 23, 1973.\n\n\"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\" premiered on Comedy Central on August 26, 2010. In its original American broadcast, it had an estimated 1.981 million viewers, up more than 200,000 than the previous week's episode, \"The Prisoner of Benda\". It also received a 1.1/2% Nielsen rating and a 1.1/3% rating in the 18–49 demographic, up three tenths of a point, matching the season high, not including premiere week.\n\nMerrill Barr of Film School Rejects gave the episode a positive review, stating, \"Like some other episodes this season, everything worked. There wasn't a single joke that fell flat, and I'm glad to see Futurama running at 100% capacity.\" Sean Gandert of \"Paste\" gave the episode a mixed review with an overall rating of 7.2. Gandert notes that after the recent run of excellent episodes his expectations made this episode a letdown. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, noting that he would prefer an episode which \"pushes itself a little harder\". Handlen and Gandert both note that the main plot of the episode has been done many times on previous sitcoms. However, where Gandert finds that the use of Lrrr and Ndnd drags the episode down, Handlen praises the fact that Lrrr is getting more screen time. Both reviewers also praise LaMarche's Orson Welles impersonation, which led to a 2011 Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance.\n\n"}

Manaul flew from right to left and landed on the bamboo. When Manaul pecked on the bamboo, it opened in half and released the first man, Malakas, and first woman, Maganda. Manaul afterwards flew from right to left again, signalling a \"labay\", or a good omen to proceed.\n"}

{"id": "4102640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4102640", "title": "Meaning (philosophy of language)", "text": "Meaning (philosophy of language)\n\nIn the philosophy of language, the nature of meaning, its definition, elements, and types, was discussed by philosophers Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. According to them \"meaning is a relationship between two sorts of things: \"signs\" and the kinds of things they \"mean\" (intend, express or signify)\". One term in the relationship of meaning necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. In other words: \"a sign is defined as an entity that indicates another entity to some agent for some purpose\". As Augustine states, a sign is \"something that shows itself to the senses and something other than itself to the mind\" (\"Signum est quod se ipsum sensui et praeter se aliquid animo ostendit\"; \"De dial.\", 1975, 86).\n\nThe types of meanings vary according to the types of the thing that is being represented. Namely:\n\nAll subsequent inquiries emphasize some particular perspectives within the general AAA framework.\n\nThe major contemporary positions of meaning come under the following partial definitions of meaning:\n\nThe evaluation of meaning according to each one of the five major substantive theories of meaning and truth is presented below. The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered to truthfully denote meaning, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories listed below. Each theory of meaning as evaluated by these respective theories of truth are each further researched by the individual scholars supporting each one of the respective theories of truth and meaning.\n\nBoth hybrid theories of meaning and alternative theories of meaning and truth have also been researched, and are subject to further assessment according to their respective and relative merits.\n\nCorrespondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements of meaning correspond to the actual state of affairs and that associated meanings must be in agreement with these beliefs and statements. This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \"things\", by whether it accurately describes those \"things.\" An example of correspondence theory is the statement by the Thirteenth Century philosopher/theologian Thomas Aquinas: \"Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus\" (\"Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect\"), a statement which Aquinas attributed to the Ninth Century neoplatonist Isaac Israeli. Aquinas also restated the theory as: \"A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality\"\n\nCorrespondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth and meaning are a matter of accurately copying what is known as \"objective reality\" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols. Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors. For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The German word \"Zeitgeist\" is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \"know\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in agglutinative languages). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski, whose semantic theory is summarized further below in this article.\n\nFor coherence theories in general, the assessment of meaning and truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system. A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole. Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.\n\nSome variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics. However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various alternative geometries. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the natural world, empirical data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.\n\nCoherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers, particularly of Spinoza, Leibniz, and G.W.F. Hegel, along with the British philosopher F.H. Bradley. Other alternatives may be found among several proponents of logical positivism, notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel.\n\nSocial constructivism holds that meaning and truth are constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \"constructed,\" because it does not reflect any external \"transcendent\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold). Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, are socially constructed.\n\nGiambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture along with their meaning were man-made. Vico's epistemological orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom\"verum ipsum factum\"\"truth itself is constructed\". Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\" and ideological knowledge is \"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\".\n\nConsensus theory holds that meaning and truth are whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person.\n\nAmong the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \"truth\" is the philosopher Jürgen Habermas. Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation. Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher.\n\nThe three most influential forms of the \"pragmatic theory of truth\" and meaning were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that meaning and truth are verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.\n\nPeirce defines truth as follows: \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\" This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as \"fallibilism\" and \"reference to the future\", are essential to a proper conception of meaning and truth. Although Peirce uses words like \"concordance\" and \"correspondence\" to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than \"nominal\" definitions, which he accords a lower status than \"real\" definitions.\n\nWilliam James's version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\" By this, James meant that truth is a \"quality\", the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \"pragmatic\").\n\nJohn Dewey, less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time \"if\" openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed meanings and truths.\n\nThough not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as \"negative pragmatism\". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth and its meaning always works. James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe meaning and truth to repeated testing which is \"self-corrective\" over time.\n\nPragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, \"... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\"\n\nSome have asserted that meaning is nothing substantially more or less than the truth conditions they involve. For such theories, an emphasis is placed upon reference to actual things in the world to account for meaning, with the caveat that reference more or less explains the greater part (or all) of meaning itself.\n\nThe logical positivists argued that the meaning of a statement arose from how it is verified.\n\nIn his paper \"Über Sinn und Bedeutung\" (now usually translated as \"On Sense and Reference\"), Gottlob Frege argued that proper names present at least two problems in explaining meaning.\n\n\nFrege can be interpreted as arguing that it was therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to. Instead, the meaning must be something else—the \"sense\" of the word. Two names for the same person, then, can have different senses (or meanings): one referent might be picked out by more than one sense. This sort of theory is called a mediated reference theory. Frege argued that, ultimately, the same bifurcation of meaning must apply to most or all linguistic categories, such as to quantificational expressions like \"All boats float\". It is now accepted by many philosophers as applying to all expressions \"but\" proper names .\n\nLogical analysis was further advanced by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their groundbreaking \"Principia Mathematica\", which attempted to produce a formal language with which the truth of all mathematical statements could be demonstrated from first principles.\n\nRussell differed from Frege greatly on many points, however. He rejected Frege's sense-reference distinction. He also disagreed that language was of fundamental significance to philosophy, and saw the project of developing formal logic as a way of eliminating all of the confusions caused by ordinary language, and hence at creating a perfectly transparent medium in which to conduct traditional philosophical argument. He hoped, ultimately, to extend the proofs of the \"Principia\" to all possible true statements, a scheme he called logical atomism. For a while it appeared that his pupil Wittgenstein had succeeded in this plan with his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\".\n\nRussell's work, and that of his colleague G. E. Moore, developed in response to what they perceived as the nonsense dominating British philosophy departments at the turn of the 20th century, which was a kind of British Idealism most of which was derived (albeit very distantly) from the work of Hegel. In response Moore developed an approach (\"Common Sense Philosophy\") which sought to examine philosophical difficulties by a close analysis of the language used in order to determine its meaning. In this way Moore sought to expunge philosophical absurdities such as \"time is unreal\". Moore's work would have significant, if oblique, influence (largely mediated by Wittgenstein) on Ordinary language philosophy.\n\nThe Vienna Circle, a famous group of logical positivists from the early 20th century (closely allied with Russell and Frege), adopted the verificationist theory of meaning. The verificationist theory of meaning (in at least one of its forms) states that to say that an expression is meaningful is to say that there are some conditions of experience that could exist to show that the expression is true. As noted, Frege and Russell were two proponents of this way of thinking.\n\nA semantic theory of truth was produced by Alfred Tarski for formal semantics. According to Tarski's account, meaning consists of a recursive set of rules that end up yielding an infinite set of sentences, \"'p' is true if and only if p\", covering the whole language. His innovation produced the notion of propositional functions discussed on the section on universals (which he called \"sentential functions\"), and a model-theoretic approach to semantics (as opposed to a proof-theoretic one). Finally, some links were forged to the correspondence theory of truth (Tarski, 1944).\n\nPerhaps the most influential current approach in the contemporary theory of meaning is that sketched by Donald Davidson in his introduction to the collection of essays \"Truth and Meaning\" in 1967. There he argued for the following two theses:\n\nThe result is a theory of meaning that rather resembles, by no accident, Tarski's account.\n\nDavidson's account, though brief, constitutes the first systematic presentation of truth-conditional semantics. He proposed simply translating natural languages into first-order predicate calculus in order to reduce meaning to a function of truth.\n\nSaul Kripke examined the relation between sense and reference in dealing with possible and actual situations. He showed that one consequence of his interpretation of certain systems of modal logic was that the reference of a proper name is \"necessarily\" linked to its referent, but that the sense is not. So for instance \"Hesperus\" necessarily refers to Hesperus, even in those imaginary cases and worlds in which perhaps Hesperus is not the evening star. That is, Hesperus is necessarily Hesperus, but only contingently the morning star.\n\nThis results in the curious situation that part of the meaning of a name — that it refers to some particular thing — is a necessary fact about that name, but another part — that it is used in some particular way or situation — is not.\n\nKripke also drew the distinction between speaker's meaning and semantic meaning, elaborating on the work of ordinary language philosophers Paul Grice and Keith Donnellan. The speaker's meaning is what the speaker intends to refer to by saying something; the semantic meaning is what the words uttered by the speaker mean according to the language.\n\nIn some cases, people do not say what they mean; in other cases, they say something that is in error. In both these cases, the speaker's meaning and the semantic meaning seem to be different. Sometimes words do not actually express what the speaker wants them to express; so words will mean one thing, and what people intend to convey by them might mean another. The meaning of the expression, in such cases, is ambiguous.\n\nW.V. Quine attacked both verificationism and the very notion of meaning in his famous essay, \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\". In it, he suggested that meaning was nothing more than a vague and dispensable notion. Instead, he asserted, what was more interesting to study was the synonymy between signs. He also pointed out that verificationism was tied to the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, and asserted that such a divide was defended ambiguously. He also suggested that the unit of analysis for any potential investigation into the world (and, perhaps, meaning) would be the entire body of statements taken as a collective, not just individual statements on their own.\n\nOther criticisms can be raised on the basis of the limitations that truth-conditional theorists themselves admit to. Tarski, for instance, recognized that truth-conditional theories of meaning only make sense of statements, but fail to explain the meanings of the lexical parts that make up statements. Rather, the meaning of the parts of statements is presupposed by an understanding of the truth-conditions of a whole statement, and explained in terms of what he called \"satisfaction conditions\".\n\nStill another objection (noted by Frege and others) was that some kinds of statements don't seem to have any truth-conditions at all. For instance, \"Hello!\" has no truth-conditions, because it doesn't even attempt to tell the listener anything about the state of affairs in the world. In other words, different propositions have different grammatical moods.\n\nDeflationist accounts of truth, sometimes called 'irrealist' accounts, are the staunchest source of criticism of truth-conditional theories of meaning. According to them, \"truth\" is a word with no serious meaning or function in discourse. For instance, for the deflationist, the sentences \"It's true that Tiny Tim is trouble\" and \"Tiny Tim is trouble\" are equivalent. In consequence, for the deflationist, any appeal to truth as an account of meaning has little explanatory power.\n\nThe sort of truth-theories presented here can also be attacked for their formalism both in practice and principle. The principle of formalism is challenged by the informalists, who suggest that language is largely a construction of the speaker, and so, not compatible with formalization. The practice of formalism is challenged by those who observe that formal languages (such as present-day quantificational logic) fail to capture the expressive power of natural languages (as is arguably demonstrated in the awkward character of the quantificational explanation of definite description statements, as laid out by Bertrand Russell).\n\nFinally, over the past century, forms of logic have been developed that are not dependent exclusively on the notions of truth and falsity. Some of these types of logic have been called modal logics. They explain how certain logical connectives such as \"if-then\" work in terms of necessity and possibility. Indeed, modal logic was the basis of one of the most popular and rigorous formulations in modern semantics called the Montague grammar. The successes of such systems naturally give rise to the argument that these systems have captured the natural meaning of connectives like if-then far better than an ordinary, truth-functional logic ever could.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, English philosophy focused closely on analysis of language. This style of analytic philosophy became very influential and led to the development of a wide range of philosophical tools.\n\nThe philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein was originally an artificial language philosopher, following the influence of Russell and Frege. In his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" he had supported the idea of an ideal language built up from atomic statements using logical connectives. However, as he matured, he came to appreciate more and more the phenomenon of natural language. \"Philosophical Investigations\", published after his death, signalled a sharp departure from his earlier work with its focus upon ordinary language use. His approach is often summarised by the aphorism \"the meaning of a word is its use in a language\". However, following in Frege's footsteps, in the \"Tractatus\", Wittgenstein declares: \"... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\"\n\nHis work would come to inspire future generations and spur forward a whole new discipline, which explained meaning in a new way. Meaning in a natural language was seen as primarily a question of how the speaker uses words within the language to express intention.\n\nThis close examination of natural language proved to be a powerful philosophical technique. Practitioners who were influenced by Wittgenstein's approach have included an entire tradition of thinkers, featuring P. F. Strawson, Paul Grice, R. M. Hare, R. S. Peters, and Jürgen Habermas.\n\nAt around the same time Ludwig Wittgenstein was re-thinking his approach to language, reflections on the complexity of language led to a more expansive approach to meaning. Following the lead of George Edward Moore, J. L. Austin examined the use of words in great detail. He argued against fixating on the meaning of words. He showed that dictionary definitions are of limited philosophical use, since there is no simple \"appendage\" to a word that can be called its meaning. Instead, he showed how to focus on the way in which words are used in order to do things. He analysed the structure of utterances into three distinct parts: locutions, illocutions and perlocutions. His pupil John Searle developed the idea under the label \"speech acts\". Their work greatly influenced pragmatics.\n\nPast philosophers had understood reference to be tied to words themselves. However, Sir Peter Strawson disagreed in his seminal essay, \"On Referring\", where he argued that there is nothing true about statements on their own; rather, only the uses of statements could be considered to be true or false.\n\nIndeed, one of the hallmarks of the ordinary use perspective is its insistence upon the distinctions between meaning and use. \"Meanings\", for ordinary language philosophers, are the \"instructions\" for usage of words — the common and conventional definitions of words. \"Usage\", on the other hand, is the actual meanings that individual speakers have — the things that an individual speaker in a particular context wants to refer to. The word \"dog\" is an example of a meaning, but pointing at a nearby dog and shouting \"This dog smells foul!\" is an example of usage. From this distinction between usage and meaning arose the divide between the fields of Pragmatics and Semantics.\n\nYet another distinction is of some utility in discussing language: \"mentioning\". \"Mention\" is when an expression refers to itself as a linguistic item, usually surrounded by quotation marks. For instance, in the expression \"'Opopanax' is hard to spell\", what is referred to is the word itself (\"opopanax\") and not what it means (an obscure gum resin). Frege had referred to instances of mentioning as \"opaque contexts\".\n\nIn his essay, \"Reference and Definite Descriptions\", Keith Donnellan sought to improve upon Strawson's distinction. He pointed out that there are two uses of definite descriptions: \"attributive\" and \"referential\". Attributive uses provide a description of whoever is being referred to, while referential uses point out the actual referent. Attributive uses are like mediated references, while referential uses are more directly referential.\n\nThe philosopher Paul Grice, working within the ordinary language tradition, understood \"meaning\" — in his 1957 article — to have two kinds: \"natural\" and \"non-natural\". \"Natural meaning\" had to do with cause and effect, for example with the expression \"these spots mean measles\". \"Non-natural\" meaning, on the other hand, had to do with the intentions of the speaker in communicating something to the listener.\n\nIn his essay, \"Logic and Conversation\", Grice went on to explain and defend an explanation of how conversations work. His guiding maxim was called the \"cooperative principle\", which claimed that the speaker and the listener will have mutual expectations of the kind of information that will be shared. The principle is broken down into four maxims: \"Quality\" (which demands truthfulness and honesty), \"Quantity\" (demand for just enough information as is required), \"Relation\" (relevance of things brought up), and \"Manner\" (lucidity). This principle, if and when followed, lets the speaker and listener figure out the meaning of certain implications by way of inference.\n\nThe works of Grice led to an avalanche of research and interest in the field, both supportive and critical. One spinoff was called Relevance theory, developed by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson during the mid-1980s, whose goal was to make the notion of \"relevance\" more clear. Similarly, in his work, \"Universal pragmatics\", Jürgen Habermas began a program that sought to improve upon the work of the ordinary language tradition. In it, he laid out the goal of a valid conversation as a pursuit of mutual understanding.\n\nMichael Dummett argued against the kind of truth-conditional semantics presented by Davidson. Instead, he argued that basing semantics on \"assertion conditions\" avoids a number of difficulties with truth-conditional semantics, such as the transcendental nature of certain kinds of truth condition. He leverages work done in proof-theoretic semantics to provide a kind of inferential role semantics, where:\nA semantics based upon assertion conditions is called a verificationist semantics: cf. the verificationism of the Vienna Circle.\n\nThis work is closely related, though not identical, to one-factor theories of conceptual role semantics.\n\nSometimes between the 1950-1990s, cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor said that use theories (of the Wittgensteinian kind) seem to assume that language is solely a public phenomenon, that there is no such thing as a \"private language\". Fodor thinks it is necessary to create or describe the \"language of thought\", which would seemingly require the existence of a \"private language\".\n\nIn the 1960s, David Kellogg Lewis described meaning as use, a feature of a social convention and conventions as regularities of a specific sort. Lewis' work was an application of game theory in philosophical topics. Conventions, he argued, are a species of coordination equilibria.\n\nThe idea theory of meaning (also ideational theory of meaning), most commonly associated with the British empiricist John Locke, claims that meanings are mental representations provoked by signs. \n\nThe term \"ideas\" is used to refer to either mental representations, or to mental activity in general. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of mind than the latter. Those who seek an explanation for meaning in the former sort of account endorse a stronger sort of idea theory of meaning than the latter.\n\nEach idea is understood to be necessarily \"about\" something external and/or internal, real or imaginary. For example, in contrast to the abstract meaning of the universal \"dog\", the referent \"this dog\" may mean a particular real life chihuahua. In both cases, the word is about something, but in the former it is about the class of dogs as generally understood, while in the latter it is about a very real and particular dog in the real world.\n\nJohn Locke, considered all ideas to be both imaginable objects of sensation and the very \"un\"imaginable objects of reflection. Locke said in his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", that words are used both as signs for ideas—but also to signify the lack of certain ideas. David Hume held that thoughts were kinds of imaginable entities. (See Hume's \"Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\", section 2). Hume argued that any words that could not call upon any past experience were without meaning.\n\nNonetheless, George Berkeley and Ludwig Wittgenstein held, in contrast to Locke and Hume, that ideas alone are unable to account for the different variations within a general meaning. For example, any hypothetical image of the meaning of \"dog\" has to include such varied images as a chihuahua, a pug, and a Black Lab; and this seems impossible to imagine, all of those particular breeds looking very different from one another. Another way to see this point is to question why it is that, if we have an image of a specific type of dog (say of a chihuahua), it should be entitled to represent the entire concept.\n\nAnother criticism is that some meaningful words, known as non-lexical items, don't have any meaningfully associated image. For example, the word \"the\" has a meaning, but one would be hard-pressed to find a mental representation that fits it. Still another objection lies in the observation that certain linguistic items name something in the real world, and are meaningful, yet which we have no mental representations to deal with. For instance, it is not known what Newton's father looked like, yet the phrase \"Newton's father\" still has meaning.\n\nAnother problem is that of composition — that it is difficult to explain how words and phrases combine into sentences if only ideas were involved in meaning.\n\nEleanor Rosch and George Lakoff advanced the theory of prototypes, which suggests that many lexical categories, at least on the face of things, have \"radial structures\". That is to say, there are some ideal member(s) in the category that seem to represent the category better than other members. For example, the category of \"birds\" may feature the \"robin\" as the prototype, or the ideal kind of bird. With experience, subjects might come to evaluate membership in the category of \"bird\" by comparing candidate members to the prototype and evaluating for similarities. So, for example, a penguin or an ostrich would sit at the fringe of the meaning of \"bird\", because a penguin is unlike a robin.\n\nIntimately related to these researches is the notion of a \"psychologically basic level\", which is both the first level named and understood by children, and \"the highest level at which a single mental image can reflect the entire category\". (Lakoff 1987:46) The \"basic level\" of cognition is understood by Lakoff as crucially drawing upon \"image-schemas\" along with various other cognitive processes.\n\nThe philosophers (Ned Block, Gilbert Harman, H. Field) and the cognitive scientists (G. Miller and P. Johnson-Laird) say that the meaning of a term can be found by investigating its role in relation to other concepts and mental states. They endorse a view called \"conceptual role semantics\". Those proponents of this view who understand meanings to be exhausted by the content of mental states can be said to endorse \"one-factor\" accounts of conceptual role semantics. and thus fit within the tradition of idea theories.\n\n\n"}

PY operated four programs focused primarily in Shabwa, Al-Baydha', Mareb, Ibb, and Al-Jawf, with national level activities and main office in the capital city of Sana’a.\n\nPartners for Democratic Change: was established in 1989. After leaving Community Boards Raymond Shonholtz established Partners for Democratic Change dedicated to building sustainable local capacity to advance civil society and a culture of change and conflict management worldwide. In the promising atmosphere following the downfall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, American and other foreign consultants flooded in with short-term training programs and policy recommendations. Partners took a different development path. Appreciating that democratic change and civil society building required new and acculturated skills and methods, Partners established from 1991 to 1994 six national Centers led by trained, local professionals, whose expertise over time would exceed the need of expatriate consultants. Today, Partners is the largest and only global change and conflict management institutional building organization. What began as an experiment within academic institutions is now an expanding, innovative international organization with 18 Centers, a hub in Brussels and one in Washington, DC, as well as Center and Partners programs in another 20 countries. Centers are among the preeminent institutions in their home countries, supporting civil society, inter-ethnic relations, network building, anti-corruption reform, family mediation, youth and women’s leadership, local government reform, and a host of other initiatives. Partners, the Centers, and PDCI are in a close partnership, pursuing a common mission while maintaining individuality and local independence.\n\nIn 2007 The Association for Conflict Resolution’s International Section (ACRIS) presented Partners for Democratic Change with the Outstanding Leadership Award in 2007 in recognition of that organization’s work building sustainable local capacity to advance civil society and a culture of change and conflict management worldwide. Partners for Democratic Change received the JAMS Foundation’s Fourth Annual Warren Knight Award in recognition of Partners effectively managing and resolving conflict and for assisting emerging democracies throughout the world to advance a civil society.\n"}

This principle is also called Frege's principle, because Gottlob Frege is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among Indian philosophers of grammar such as Yāska, and also in Plato's work such as in \"Theaetetus\".\nBesides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege, and it was arguably already assumed by George Boole decades before Frege’s work.\n\nThe principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the lexical parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence \"Socrates was a man\". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—\"Socrates\" and \"man\"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, \"S was a M\". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.\n\nIt is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by Donald Davidson, to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the T-schema with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of Montague grammar), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a homomorphism between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.\n\nThe principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the compositionality of programming languages.\n\nThe principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)\n\nScholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to empirical testing; an analytic truth, obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a methodological principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for idiomatic expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)\n\nFurther, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer sarcasm purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic context, which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)\n\n\n"}

These texts portray the Red Jews as an epochal threat to Christendom, one which would invade Europe during the tribulations leading to the end of the world.\n\nAndrew Gow studied the original German-language texts and concluded that the legend of the Red Jews conflated three separate traditions: the biblical prophetic references to Gog and Magog, the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, and an episode from the Alexander romance (3rd century AD), in which Alexander the Great encloses a race of heathens behind a great wall in the Caucasus. These traditions had some overlap already; Gog and Magog are among the nations trapped behind the wall in the \"Alexander Romance\", and the only ones named in the version of the story appearing in Qur'an Sura al-Kahf (The Cave) 18:89, while the 14th-century work \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" explicitly associates the confined nations with the Ten Lost Tribes.\n\nMany pamphlets circulated interpreting such events as the rise of Turkish power in the context of the legendary Red Jews. Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560), for example, claimed that the Ottoman Turks and Muslims were the \"Red Jews\".\n\nKevin Alan Brook, among others, speculated, but could not conclusively prove, that the legend of the Red Jews was actually based on misremembered accounts of the Khazars ( 7th century to the 10th century). Indeed, in his 9th-century \"Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam\", Christian of Stavelot refers to the Khazars as Hunnic descendants of Gog and Magog, as well as having been \"enclosed\" by Alexander, but having since escaped, demonstrating that the Khazars were indeed conflated with two of the three elements making up the legend of the Red Jews. Other medieval sources consider various connections with the Lost Tribes, and they are described in Arabic sources as having red hair, a trait associated with the Devil in medieval Germany and possibly the source of the term \"Red Jews\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "188863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188863", "title": "Sarcophagus", "text": "Sarcophagus\n\nA sarcophagus (plural sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \"sarcophagus\" comes from the Greek \"sarx\" meaning \"flesh\", and \"phagein\" meaning \"to eat\", hence \"sarcophagus\" means \"flesh-eating\"; from the phrase \"lithos sarkophagos\" ( ). Since \"lithos\" is Greek for \"stone\", \"lithos sarcophagos\" means \"flesh-eating stone\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.\n\nSarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. In Ancient Egypt, a sarcophagus acted like an outer shell.\n\nThe Hagia Triada sarcophagus is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in fresco; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in Klazomenian sarcophagi, produced around the Ionian Greek city of Klazomenai, where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge Lycian Tomb of Payava, now in the British Museum, is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.\n\nAncient Roman sarcophagi—sometimes metal or plaster as well as limestone—were popular from about the reign of Trajan, and often elaborately carved, until the early Christian burial preference for interment underground, often in a limestone sepulchre, led to their falling out of favor. However, there are many important Early Christian sarcophagi from the 3rd to 4th centuries.\n\nMost Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three of the sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the High Middle Ages often had a recumbent tomb effigy lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts, of which the most famous examples include the Habsburg Imperial Crypt in Vienna, Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.\n\nIn the early modern period, lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.\n\nSarcophagi, usually \"false\", made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, \"it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries\". They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included 8 pages of them, broken down into Georgian and Classical detail, a Gothic and Renaissance adaptation, and a Modern variant. Shown on the right are sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by Alexander Milne Calder (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.\n\nIn the Mekong Delta in southwestern Vietnam, it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of ancestor worship.\n\nIn Sulawesi, Indonesia, waruga are a traditional form of sarcophagus.\n\nNearly 140 years after British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed a sarcophagus from the hillocks of Pallavaram in Tamil Nadu, an identical artifact dating back by more than 2,000 years has been discovered in the same locality.\n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula it was found phoenician and paleochristian sarcophagus throughout history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "524461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524461", "title": "Self-destruct", "text": "Self-destruct\n\nA self-destruct is a mechanism that can cause an object to destroy itself after a predefined set of circumstances has occurred.\n\nSelf-destruct mechanisms are typically found on devices and systems where malfunction could endanger large numbers of people.\n\nSome types of modern land mines are designed to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of friendly casualties during the conflict or civilian casualties after the conflict's end. The Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), amended in 1996, requires that anti-personnel land mines deactivate and self-destruct, and sets standards for both. Landmines currently used by the United States military are designed to self-destruct between 4 hours and 15 days depending upon the type. The landmines have a battery and when the battery dies, the landmine self-destructs. The self-destruct system never failed in over 67,000 tested landmines in a variety of conditions. Not all self-destruct mechanisms are absolutely reliable, and most landmines that have been laid throughout history are not equipped to self-destruct. Landmines can also be designed to self-deactivate, for instance by a battery running out of a charge, but deactivation is considered a different mechanism from self-destruction.\n\nThe Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters were equipped with explosive charges so that the boosters could be destroyed in the event that control was lost on launch and a populated area was in danger.\nPhysically, this is done by detonation cords running along the booster. As they are set off, they cut open the booster's casing. This not only causes the solid rocket fuel to burn up rapidly by exposing a large reaction surface, the cut-open casing also allows combustion gases to escape sideways instead through the nozzle. Therefore, the booster no longer produces a significant thrust.\n\nThis feature can be seen in videos of the \"Challenger\" disaster. After the initial disintegration of the shuttle, the two solid rocket boosters continued firing until they exploded simultaneously 37 seconds later. This occurred when the Range Safety Officer decided that the separated boosters had the potential to endanger those on the ground and activated the self-destruct system.\n\nAnother form of a self-destruct system can be seen in the naval procedure of scuttling, which is used to destroy a ship or ships to prevent them from being seized and/or reverse engineered.\n\nA form of self-destruct system can be observed in deep-sea oil drilling. In the event of an oil well becoming disconnected from its oil rig, a dead man's switch may trigger activation of a blowout preventer blind shear ram which cuts the drill pipe and permanently seals the well to prevent an oil leak.\n\nSelf-destruct mechanisms are sometimes employed to prevent an apparatus or information from being used by unauthorized persons in the event of loss or capture. For example, they may be found in high-security data storage devices (e.g. IronKey), where it is important for the data to be destroyed to prevent compromise.\n\nSome artworks may have mechanisms in them to destruct themselves in front of many eyes watching. An example is the painting Love is in the Bin by Banksy, which shredded itself right after a £1 million auction at Sotheby's London on 5 October 2018.\n\nSelf-destruct mechanisms are frequent plot devices in science fiction stories, such as those in the \"\" fictional universe, or the \"Alien\" universe. They are applied to military installations and starships which would be too valuable to allow an enemy to capture. An artificial intelligence may invoke self-destruct due to cognitive dissonance. In many such stories, such a mechanism causes massive destruction in a large area, obliterating the object protected by the device. Often the characters have a limited amount of time to escape the destruction or to disable the mechanism, creating story tension. In the television series \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" and \"Mission Impossible\", sensitive intelligence or equipment is shown to self-destruct in order to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Usually the self-destruct sequence is lengthy and complex, as in \"Alien\", or requires multiple officers aboard the ship with individual passcodes to initiate the process, with countdown timers that can allow characters to escape. Passwords in 1970s and 1980s movies are noticeably unfit for purposes of such major impact, considering accounts with even low level security in modern times have far more complex password requirements, as the writers of the era did not anticipate the complexity level of computer generated brute-force attacks and security issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "26210425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26210425", "title": "Self-framing metal buildings", "text": "Self-framing metal buildings\n\nSelf-framing metal buildings are a form of pre-engineered building which utilizes roll formed roof and wall panel diaphragms as significant parts of the structural supporting system. Additional structural elements may include mill or cold-formed elements to stiffen the diaphragm perimeters, transfer forces between diaphragms and provide appropriate. As with most pre-engineered buildings, each building will be supplied with all necessary component parts to form a complete building system.\n\nRegardless of project site location, buildings must be designed in accordance with appropriate engineering due diligence. Buildings should be designed for all applicable loads including the following:\n\n\nEngineered structural design must comply with the applicable sections of the latest edition of the \"Specification for Structural Steel Buildings\" of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the \"Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members\" of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI).\n\nMany areas of the United States require the use of state or local building codes which may differ from the \"International Building Code\". Building codes such as the \"International Building Code\" and Uniform Building Code (UBC) are markedly different from each other and are often revised at the local level.\n\nSelf-framing buildings are within the scope of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) as adopted and modified by each Province and Territory. For steel structures, NBCC references CAN/CSA S16 Design of Steel Structures and CAN/CSA S136 North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.\n\nManufacturers are required to be certified in accordance with CSA A660 Certification of Manufacturers of Steel Building Systems. Among other requirements, the manufacturer must supply drawings and documents sealed by a professional engineer licensed in the province or territory of the project site. A Certificate of Design and Manufacturing Conformance, duly completed by an engineer knowledgeable with the design and manufacturing, must be provided to the owner and submitted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)with the permit application.\n\nThe building code requires documents to be adequate to allow a review of the structural competence of the building (e.g. NBCC Part 4). The Authority Having Jurisdiction will usually require drawings expressing architectural aspects (e.g. Parts 3, 5 and 11). Due to the limited complexity and size of self-framed buildings, the manufacturer's drawings are frequently accepted for this purpose but the owner should be aware that this may not always be the case.\n\nExterior roof panels are usually a single continuous length from eave to ridge line for gable style buildings or from low eave to high eave on single slope or shed style buildings. Many manufacturers provide minimum 24 gauge (nominal: 0.0239 inch; 0.61 mm) thick sheet steel in self-framing roof designs.\n\nExterior wall panels are usually a single continuous length from the base channel to the eave of the building except where interrupted by wall openings. Many manufacturers provide minimum 24 gauge (nominal: 0.0239 inch; 0.61 mm) thick sheet steel in self-framing wall designs.\n\nDiaphragm or racking strength of the wall and roof systems are dependent on issues such as the manufacturer's panel lap seam assembly and should be qualified by full-scale testing. Openings reduce the local structural capacity of the wall or roof assembly and should be considered in the original structural design. the manufacturer may provide guidance for limited field modifications for additional openings.\n\nBuilding width: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Width is primarily limited by the capability of the roof panel to support the applied gravity loads (e.g. self-weight, snow) and wind uplift loads. In taller buildings, the wall panel may be a limiting factor to width due to buckling of the unsupported wall panel length.\n\nBuilding length: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Length is primarily limited by the ability of the load path to transfer loads to a vertical brace system (e.g. gable endwall). Building length can be extended with added discrete brace systems (e.g. roof level horizontal brace, portal frame, diagonal brace, interior partition shear wall).\n\nBuilding height: 2.5 m (8' +/-) to 7.5 m (24' +/-) is common. Height is primarily limited by the capability of the wall panel to support the wind load. Height may be limited in narrow buildings due to shear capacity limit in the gable endwalls.\n\nMany manufacturers publish tables relating loads to building dimensions and limitations (e.g. ratio of partial height panels to full height panels where wall openings are required).\n\nTypically, self-framed buildings will be shipped to site in knocked-down condition with all parts and hardware. Smaller self-framed buildings may be fully assembled at the manufacturer's facility and transported to site.\n\nThe project architect, sometimes called the Architect of Record, is typically responsible for aspects such as aesthetic, dimensional, occupant comfort and fire safety. When a pre-engineered building is selected for a project, the architect accepts conditions inherent in the manufacturer's product offerings for aspects such as materials, colours, structural form, dimensional modularity, etc. Despite the existence of the manufacturer's standard assembly details, the Architect remains responsible to ensure that the manufacturer's product and assembly is consistent with the building code requirements (e.g. continuity of air/vapour retarders, insulation, rain screen; size and location of exits; fire rated assemblies) and occupant or owner expectations.\n\nMany jurisdictions recognize the distinction between the project engineer, sometimes called the Engineer of Record, and the manufacturer's employee or subcontract engineer, sometimes called a specialty engineer. The principal differences between these two entities on a project are the limits of commercial obligation, professional responsibility and liability.\n\nThe structural Engineer of Record is responsible to specify the design parameters for the project (e.g. materials, loads, design standards, service limits) and to ensure that the element and assembly designs by others are consistent in the global context of the finished building.\n\nThe specialty engineer is responsible to design only those elements which the manufacturer is commercially obligated to supply (e.g. by contract) and to communicate the assembly procedures, design assumptions and responses, to the extent that the design relies on or affects work by others, to the Engineer of Record – usually described in the manufacturer's erection drawings and assembly manuals. The manufacturer produces an engineered product but does not typically provide engineering services to the project.\n\nIn the context described, the Architect and Engineer of Record are the designers of the building and bear ultimate responsibility for the performance of the completed work.

It stars Robert Young, Maureen O'Hara, and Clifton Webb. The film was adapted by F. Hugh Herbert from the comic novel \"Belvedere\" (1947) by Gwen Davenport. It was directed by Walter Lang.\n\nThe character of Belvedere proved so popular, Webb reprised his role in two more movies: \"Mr. Belvedere Goes to College\" (1949), and \"Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell\" (1951).\n\nLawyer Harry (Robert Young) and his wife Tacey King (Maureen O'Hara) have trouble retaining a nanny for their three young rambunctious boys. When the latest in a string of servants quits, Tacey advertises and hires Lynn Belvedere sight unseen, only to find out that Lynn is a dapper older man (Clifton Webb), one with many skills and achievements. Despite their misgivings (and Belvedere's declaration that he detests children), the Kings reluctantly agree to a trial period. Belvedere quickly wins over the kids, but his superior attitude annoys Harry.\n\nWhen Harry has to go away on a business trip, Tacey agrees to take the baby and sleep over each night at the home of their friends, fellow lawyer Bill Philby (John Russell) and his wife Edna (Louise Allbritton), just to squelch any possibility of scandal in their suburban community of Hummingbird Hill. Late that night, however, one of the boys becomes sick. Tacey rushes over. It turns out to be just a stomach ache, but nosy neighbor Clarence Appleton (Richard Haydn) notices the lights on and comes over to investigate. He starts spreading scandalous rumors linking Belvedere and Tacey romantically. The gossip eventually reaches Horatio J. Hammond (Ed Begley), Harry's boss. When Harry returns triumphant from his trip, Hammond tells him that Tacey is endangering the law firm's reputation. Though Harry does not believe the stories, he still thinks it would be best if Belvedere found other employment, but is persuaded by his wife and children to change his mind.\n\nLater, Tacey and Edna attend a night lecture. Afterward, they go for a snack in a fancy restaurant. There they encounter Belvedere on his day off. Belvedere invites Tacey to dance. They are spotted dancing cheek to cheek by Appleton and his equally inquisitive mother, and the malicious rumors start again. This time, Harry is not so understanding. Insulted, Tacey quarrels with him and leaves for her parents.\n\nThen, Belvedere's novel (described as \"a screaming satire on suburban manners and morals\") is published and becomes a national bestseller. It contains thinly veiled accounts of the unseemly behavior of Hummingbird Hill's residents, upsetting everyone. Tacey rushes home and is reconciled with her husband. Hammond fires Harry and then Bill when he comes to defense of his friend. He decides to sue Belvedere, who is pleased, as he expects the action to increase already skyrocketing sales of his book. He hires Harry and Bill to defend him, then reveals the source of much of his information: Appleton. The informant flees, with Hammond and others in hot pursuit. Despite his new fame, Belvedere agrees to keep his job as the novel is only the first volume of a trilogy.\n\n\nThe film was originally titled \"Belvedere\", but then changed to \"Sitting Pretty\". John Payne was meant to play the role of the husband.\n\nPhotographer Loomis Dean visited the set to photograph the filming for \"Life\" and photographed Webb together with then yet unknown actresses Laurette Luez and Marilyn Monroe, who do not appear in the film.\n\nThis is one of few films Webb made where he dances. Before 1944, he was an accomplished Broadway star, known for his dancing, singing and comedy.\n\nBosley Crowther wrote in \"The New York Times\" that while \"The screen plays from Mr. Herbert are not conspicuous for their tax upon the brain\", \"Light in substance, but solid in humor, this material is handled dexterously by all who come anywhere near it - and especially, as we say, by Mr. Webb\". He also found Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young \"delightfully clever\".\n\n\nA radio adaptation was presented by \"Lux Radio Theater\" on February 14, 1949. The film also inspired the television series \"Mr. Belvedere\", starring Christopher Hewett, which first aired in 1985.\n\n"}

{"id": "188894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188894", "title": "The Tripods", "text": "The Tripods\n\nThe Tripods is a series of young adult novels written by John Christopher, beginning in 1967. The first two were the basis of a science fiction TV series, produced in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\n\nThe story of \"The Tripods\" is a variation on post-apocalyptic literature, wherein humanity has been enslaved by \"Tripods\" — gigantic three-legged walking machines, piloted by unseen alien entities (later identified as \"Masters\"). Human society is largely pastoral, with few habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is conducted under the watchful presence of the Tripods. Lifestyle is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, but small artefacts from the Modern Age are still used, such as watches.\n\nHumans are controlled from the age of 14 by implants called \"Caps\", which suppress curiosity and creativity. Some people, whose minds are broken by the Caps, become vagrants. According to \"The City of Gold and Lead\", Masters begin to believe that humans should be capped at an earlier age \"because some humans, in the year or two before they are Capped, become rebellious and act against the masters\", but this cannot be done, because Capping must wait until the braincase has stopped growing.\n\nLife goes on largely as it had in the pre-industrial era, excepting that all adult humans are subject to Tripod control. Protagonist Will, a thirteen-year-old boy living in the (fictional) English village of Wherton, is looking forward to the next \"Capping Day\", until a chance meeting with a mysterious fake-capped man named Ozymandias prompts him to discover a world beyond the Tripods' control. He is accompanied by his cousin Henry and a French teenager named Jean-Paul Deliet, nicknamed \"Beanpole\". The novel climaxes with Henry and Beanpole discovering that earlier, when Will had been captured by a Tripod, he had been unknowingly implanted with a tracking device. When Henry and Beanpole remove the device, a nearby Tripod attacks them, but the boys defeat the Tripod and eventually join the resistance, located in the eponymous White Mountains.\n\nAfter a year in the White Mountains, the resistance charges Will, Beanpole, and a German boy, Fritz, to infiltrate a Tripod city by competing in a regional sporting exhibition. Will, a boxer, and Fritz, a runner, win their respective contests, while Beanpole fails to win in the jumping events.\n\nThe winners are taken to the Tripod city in a pressurised dome astride a river. Inside the city, the boys discover the Tripods' operators, whom they refer to as the \"Masters\". Human males are slaves inside the cities, while beautiful females are killed and preserved for the Masters to admire. Slaves are furnished with breathing masks to survive the aliens' atmosphere, but are rapidly exhausted by the stronger artificial gravity and must therefore be periodically replaced. Although Fritz is abused by his Master, Will is treated as a privileged pet by his. Eventually, Will's Master reveals a plan to replace the Earth's atmosphere with the Masters' toxic air to enable full control of the Earth. When the Master finds Will's diary, Will kills him to maintain the secret. With the assistance of Beanpole, Will escapes, and they return to the White Mountains. The story's title refers to the gold colour prevalent in the Masters' cities, as well as the leaden weight of the increased gravity on the human slaves.\n\nWill and Fritz travel to Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Middle East to organize resistance against the Tripods. The resistance, having ambushed a Tripod and captured a Master, discover that alcohol has a strong soporific effect on them, and use this knowledge to simultaneously attack their cities. Having introduced alcohol into the aliens' city water systems, two raiding groups kill the Masters by forcing open airlocks and exposing the unconscious aliens to Earth's atmosphere; but the attack on the last city (located in Central America) fails. A secondary plan is undertaken using hot air balloons and newly developed bombs. The attack is initially unsuccessful as the timers on the bombs cause them to detonate either before making contact with the dome of the city, or after the bomb has fallen clear. Henry jumps from his balloon onto the city's domed roof and holds the bomb in place, killing himself but shattering the dome. Earth's atmosphere kills the Masters, and Henry is remembered as a hero.\n\nSeveral years later The Masters' atmosphere-seeding spaceship arrives and destroys the remains of their cities, presumably to prevent the humans from reverse engineering their technology — although Beanpole notes that they have already learned much from the cities — then leaves. Modern human technology, which was halted during the Masters' rule is rediscovered rapidly, including the theory of space travel. The saga ends with the Resistance leader Julius being deposed, and as a result the alliance built during the resistance falls apart, with nationalistic hostilities appearing, each country going their separate ways in contrast to Julius' efforts to unite the world.\n\n\"When the Tripods Came\" is a prequel written twenty years after the publication of the original trilogy. The plot follows the description of the conquest given in the second book of the main trilogy. Fearing the technological potential of humanity, the so-called \"Masters\", unable to defeat humanity in a conventional war, hypnotise people through a television show called \"The Trippy Show\", later using Caps to control them permanently. As in the original trilogy, the narrator of \"When the Tripods Came\" is a young English boy. As society slowly falls under the control of the Masters, he and his family escape to Switzerland, which has mounted the longest-lasting resistance. When the Swiss are eventually enslaved, the narrator and his family establish the \"White Mountains\" resistance movement of the original trilogy.\n\nEditions have been published by\n\nThe series has been translated into Arabic, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Persian, Spanish, Greek, and Mandarin Chinese (Taiwan).\nThe \"Masters\" are first mentioned and seen in chapter 6 of \"The City of Gold and Lead\".\n\nAccording to Will, the chief protagonist:\n\nAs well as physical differences to humans, the Masters display chemical ones. The air they breathe is thick and green, like a chlorine fog, although the precise composition of it is never revealed. The human slaves of their city must wear specially provided breathing apparatus, although they are provided with their own atmosphere in cramped, but functional, living quarters. Unprotected exposure to the air of the city is quickly fatal, as is exposure to the Earth's atmosphere for the Masters. The apparatus provided for slaves depends on a kind of spongy cartridge that must be periodically replaced. Similarly, foods eaten by Masters and Slaves have nothing in common, with the exception of sugars, although it is never revealed whether the Masters' food would be fatal to a human, or if the Masters are able to ingest normal Earth food.\n\n\"The Pool of Fire\" contained a subplot in which the capture and subsequent interrogation of a Master takes place. These events revealed that Masters can somehow sense harmful additions to their food, and will simply refuse to eat anything that contains drugs or poisons, with the exception of ethyl alcohol. It transpires that the Masters have a very low tolerance for this chemical, which later becomes an important plot point.\n\nThe Masters prefer high temperatures. Room temperature for them is somewhere around 40 degrees Celsius (about 105 degrees Fahrenheit). The pools in which they bathe are often extremely hot (described as \"only just bearable\"). This would indicate that their digestive and respiratory enzymes are quite different from those found in terrestrial life.\n\nA Master's preferred method of moving, described as a slapping hop on all three feet, is light and fast, completely untroubled by the incredible weight that their size must hold. As shown by this lightness in a heavy environment the Masters are, physically, extremely strong, able to easily lift a human male with just one of their three tentacles. Their skin is described as being damp, reptilian and leathery, thus very resilient to attack.\n\nThe Masters do have one crippling physical weakness. The area between their respiratory orifice and their ingestive orifice is extremely sensitive. A light brush to this area causes extreme pain. More forceful contact causes unconsciousness or death.\n\nOnly one form of disease appeared within the novels. This, called approximately \"The Curse of the Skloodzi\", evidently caused the Master sufficient discomfort as to preclude work; when Will's Master developed the ailment, he had Will retrieve him and return him to his home, where he used gas bubbles (see Technology) and his hot pool to at least ameliorate his discomfort. The ailment also caused his skin to discolour somewhat, becoming streaked with brown.\n\nThe Masters are also different from human beings psychologically. They are completely incapable of lying, finding it difficult to tell the difference between a novel and a biography. As such they are extremely gullible, taking everything told to them as indisputable truth.\n\nTheir reaction to despair, as well, shows a marked difference. The Masters are incredibly tolerant of hardship and difficulty, to the point of becoming ill if they do not work hard. However, if they find themselves in a situation to which there is absolutely no escape, they die. It is unknown whether this is natural or some form of suicide. When the Masters' xenoforming ship turned back after discovering the success of the human rebellion, the last Master on Earth, a prisoner of the Freemen, died. It is not explained how it knew that it had been abandoned.\n\nMasters have very little in the way of a social life. They spend most of their time in their own home. It is unlikely that Masters form any kind of nuclear family; throughout the books there is no mention of there being any more than one Master to an apartment.\n\nOn the rare occasions that they do meet with others, very little conversation or activity between the two takes place. There are various events and functions around their city — communal baths, museums, and others that have no human equivalent — but each Master will attend and enjoy these events on their own. Even when in close proximity to other Masters doing the same thing, they are unlikely to engage in any kind of social intercourse, and if they do then it will be short-lived and limited.\n\nSeveral forms of recreation exist. One, The Sphere Chase, involves Masters in smaller versions of their Tripod vehicles chasing a glowing sphere, with the evident goal of directing it through an opening in the side of the arena. Others involve listening to strange (by human standards) sounds or watching strange lights.\n\nMasters seem to appreciate alien beauty. They accept men and women into their cities, but only men serve as slaves. They kill and preserve the women, arranging them according to aesthetics of their own devising. In one exhibit, Will finds a girl he loved arranged with other women in the order of hair colour shades.\n\nBut this, and their habit of taking slaves generally, suggests that they do not hold life other than their own in high regard. Although some provision is made for slaves exhausted by heavy gravity to recover, slaves who become convinced they would not recover are programmed via their Caps (see Technology) to go to The Place of Happy Release. There, some form of energy kills them, and a moving belt carries the bodies to a furnace for incineration. The most profound indicator is their long term plan for Earth: en route from their home at the time of \"The City of Gold and Lead\" are spaceships containing components they cannot manufacture on Earth — parts of great machines that will accept Earth's atmosphere and turn out an atmosphere like that found on the Masters' home and in their cities. Such a transformation would be eventually fatal to all life on Earth, except such few live specimens that the Masters are debating whether to house in zoos.\n\nAt least some Masters enjoy an intoxicant they call (for the purposes of their slaves) a gas bubble. The master places the plastic bubble near his respiratory orifice, breaks it, and inhales the vapor. The effect is evidently mild; it takes several such bubbles to create personality changes noticeable to humans. Use of gas bubbles brings out latent personality traits in at least one Master.\n\nThe Masters are not of uniform character. Will's Master (the one whose personality is most explored in the trilogy) is something of an intellectual, constantly questioning and studying and learning. His reading of human literature awakens a loneliness, so he wishes to keep Will as a beloved pet. Fritz's Master, however, is a sadist, most interested in physical exertion as well as inflicting pain on whatever slave he happens to have at the moment. The captured prisoner, Ruki, the only Master to be named in the trilogy, is explored little. However, he is the only Master seen to display any understanding of humor and sarcasm.\n\nThe Masters power their city with a form of atomic energy that appears to uneducated and casual observers as a \"pool of fire.\" This description lent itself to the title of the third novel. It is loosely inferred by the character Jean Paul (Beanpole) to be nuclear fusion. A concentric series of chambers located near the center of the city and below ground level house this apparatus; the various doors do not align, so it is necessary to travel around the perimeter of each chamber to the next entrance. Within the innermost chamber is a single lever that functions as a main breaker. Moving it from the operating position to the off position deactivates the mechanism, while moving it in the other direction reactivates it. Contact with this lever while the mechanism is operating proves instantly fatal to humans.\n\nThe most visible artefacts of the Masters are the Tripods, immense machines that walk the world outside their cities on three long legs. Described as hemispherical, with legs equidistant, the tripods can interact with the world using long, tentacle-like manipulators, each of which is capable of lifting and crushing a Challenger 1 tank; this happens at their first contact meeting, as the tank plays the Anthem of Europe. At least some of these machines have chambers suited to Earth life, and can take individuals inside them for extended periods. When they reach age fourteen, individuals are taken inside a Tripod to be Capped: The machines visit larger towns, while people from smaller towns travel to nearby larger ones to be Capped. Tripods seem to follow a route consistently, but whether this is due to the psychology of their pilots or to some form of autopilot is never revealed. Among the facts inadvertently revealed to Will by his Master is the crew size — four individuals.\n\nMuch of the Masters' industry appears highly automated. Machines operating without supervision create everything from food and air to intoxicants. Among these are machines that create gravity at levels roughly twice that of Earth; this heaviness lent itself to the title of the second novel, \"The City of Gold and Lead\". According to Will's Master, this is less than the gravity enjoyed by the Masters on their home planet. It is not revealed if this is due to technical restrictions, energy saving, or because such extreme gravity would be very wearing on their human slaves.\n\nThe Masters' technology includes precision machining techniques. Their airlock doors fit so precisely that the seams are nearly invisible, and do not require gaskets or other flexible seals to compensate for imperfections.\n\nThey have the means to remove heat from objects, akin to air conditioning. Because of their water requirements, each of their cities straddles a major river. As part of treating the water before it leaves the city, mechanisms cool and filter it until it is very close to its original outside characteristics of temperature and composition.\n\nPerhaps their greatest technological skill is in the area of mind control. They understand brain physiology to a high degree. In the fourth book, \"When the Tripods Came\" they capture at least one human for the purpose of dissection; the individual's corpse is discovered later, his brain neatly drained and removed. They later intercept broadcast television signals, and add their own additional signals to the feed; these signals contain hypnotic suggestions. While not universally effective, these suggestions affect sufficient numbers of people so that the Masters have a substantial base of support in their early invasion effort. Whatever the method, these signals can convey detailed technical data and some of the individuals under this control construct and distribute the first Caps.\n\nAlthough their televised hypnosis is not permanent, control through a Cap evidently is, for as long as the Cap remains in place. Caps contain a fine mesh somewhat resembling an antenna. The first versions resemble ordinary hats and can even be removed, although the individual wearing such a cap will never voluntarily remove it and will actively attempt to prevent others from doing so. Successful removal of a Cap sometimes causes the individual to react in bizarre ways, becoming irrational or breaking down in tears. In a later phase of the invasion, Tripods dispatched to various locations remove the temporary caps and replace them with Caps \"married to the flesh\" through some kind of bioengineering. These Caps cannot be removed, although White Mountains resistance fighters eventually learn how to disable them by severing certain of the metal filaments. The Caps evidently depend on some form of transmission from within the cities of the Masters — when resistance elements turn off the city power supplies, Capped individuals ceased to venerate and obey the masters. As earlier, some reacted irrationally to the loss of outside will, even to the point of suicide.\n\nCaps create a worshipful attitude toward the Masters, an unhesitating obedience so profound that the Masters do not fear bringing Capped humans into their cities, an overconfidence that eventually defeats them. According to \"The White Mountains,\" about one person in twenty becomes a Vagrant due to some failure of the process. Will speculates that the Vagrants' brains attempt to resist the power of the Cap and eventually break under the strain. Vagrants are considered harmless (although this was not always true), but are generally unable to remain in one place for any length of time. Each community considers it a social responsibility to care for these unfortunates, who are unable to work, form families, or participate in most of society. Individuals seeking the resistance in the White Mountains are cautioned that if caught and Capped in a place where the natives spoke a different language, Vagrancy was almost certain, suggesting that each Cap receives and relays signals specific to expected thought processes of the wearer.\n\nThe Masters have a means of suppressing electrical activity at range. They disable a biplane attack on their Central American city in this fashion.\n\nTheir Home World is briefly mentioned to Will by his Master as being larger and hotter than Earth, and consisting mostly of swamps. Masters take care to bathe and wallow in water several times a day. The numerous pools in their domed cities compensate for this when the Masters are on Earth. Nothing is revealed about how much of the galaxy they have a hold on. The true name of their species is never revealed. The closest that is ever got to a name is \"Skloodzi\". Will comments that he is unsure whether this is his Master's name, his Master's family name, the name of his Master's race or the name of their species.\n\nMultiple graphic adaptations have been produced, notably including:\n\n\nThe television version of \"The Tripods\" was jointly produced by the BBC in the United Kingdom and the Seven Network in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by Ken Freeman. The series was noted for being one of the first to feature computer generated graphics and special effects.\n\nSeries one of \"The Tripods\", broadcast in 1984, which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the well-known author of many radio plays Alick Rowe, covers the first book, \"The White Mountains\"; the 12-episode second series (1985) covers \"The City of Gold and Lead\". Although a television script had been written for the third series, it never went into production.\n\nThe first series was released on both VHS and DVD. The BBC released \"Tripods — The Complete Series 1 & 2\" on DVD in March 2009.\n\nWhen the BBC made the television series of The Tripods in the 1980s, they departed from Christopher's description. The Masters somewhat resembled the Tripods they drove. This makes the Tripods seem much more like mecha than purely eccentric vehicles. In the BBC serial, the Masters did not need to eat, sleep or drink. Additionally, they were not the rulers of the city, but were, in turn, under the rule of beings made of pure energy, known as Cognoscs. The Masters came from a planet named Trion that was in the center of a triple star system.\n\nThe method by which the Masters name themselves is also different. Rather than having names, they are simply called by their address. Will's Master is called West Avenue 4, Sector 6, Level 8, or West 468.\n\nThe Masters in the BBC production did not breathe green air and did not prefer the high gravity and high temperature of those in the book, since these would have been extremely difficult or expensive to recreate onscreen at the time. Their treatment of the slaves, rather than being harsh and thoughtless, was reasonable to the point of being friendly, with luxuries provided for them.\n\nTo avoid an overuse of the mechanical Tripods, the producers invented a new faction, the \"Black Guards\", as a police force with the task to enforce the will of the masters. They served as a more immediate threat for Will, his friends and the resistance.\n\n"}
{"id": "2526781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2526781", "title": "Trancers", "text": "Trancers\n\nTrancers (also released as Future Cop) is a 1984 American science fiction film directed by Charles Band and starring Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, and Art LaFleur. It is the first film in the \"Trancers\" series.\n\nThe film revolves around Jack Deth (Thomerson), a Philip Marlowe-esque police detective from the 23rd century who travels to the 1980s in order to bring his old nemesis to justice. The film portrays a unique method of time travel: People can travel back in time by injecting themselves with a drug that allows them to take over the body of an ancestor.\n\nJack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is a police trooper in the year 2247 who has been hunting down Martin Whistler, a criminal mastermind who uses psychic powers to turn people into mindless \"trancers\" and carry out his orders. Deth can identify a tranced individual by scanning them with a special bracelet. All trancers appear as normal humans at first, but once triggered, they become savage killers with twisted features.\n\nBefore he can be caught, Whistler escapes back in time using a drug-induced time-traveling technique. Whistler's consciousness leaves his body in 2247 and travels down his ancestral bloodline arriving in 1985 and taking over the body of an ancestor, a Los Angeles police detective named Weisling.\n\nOnce Deth discovers what Whistler has done, he destroys Whistler's body—effectively leaving him trapped in the past with no vessel to return to—and chases after him through time the same way. Deth ends up in the body of one of his ancestors: a journalist named Phil Dethton.\n\nWith the help of Phil's girlfriend—a punk rock girl named Leena (Helen Hunt)—Deth goes after Whistler, who has begun to \"trance\" other victims. Whistler plots to eliminate the future governing council members of Angel City (the future name of Los Angeles), who are being systematically wiped out of existence by Whistler's murder spree of their own ancestors. Deth arrives too late to prevent most of the murders and can only safeguard Hap Ashby (Biff Manard), a washed-up former pro baseball player, who is the ancestor of the last surviving council member, Chairman Ashe (Anne Seymour).\n\nDeth is given some high-tech equipment, which is sent to him in the past: his sidearm (which contains two hidden vials of time drugs to send him and Whistler back to the future), and a \"long-second\" wristwatch, which temporarily slows time, stretching one second to ten. The watch has only enough power for one use, but he later receives another watch to pull the same trick again.\n\nDuring the end fight with Whistler, one of the drug vials in Jack's gun breaks, leaving only one vial to get home. Jack is forced to make a choice: kill the innocent Weisling (who is possessed by the evil Whistler), or use the vial to send Whistler back to 2247, which would strand Jack in the present. Jack chooses to inject Weisling with the vial, saving the lieutenant's life but condemning Whistler to an eternity without a body to return to. Jack then decides to remain with Leena in 1985, although observing him from the shadows is McNulty, his boss from the future, who has traveled down his own ancestral line, ending up in the body of a young girl.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45716", "title": "Transporter (Star Trek)", "text": "Transporter (Star Trek)\n\nA transporter is a fictional teleportation machine used in the \"Star Trek\" universe. Transporters convert a person or object into an energy pattern (a process called dematerialization), then \"beam\" it to a target, where it is reconverted into matter (rematerialization). The term \"transporter accident\" is a catch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly.\n\nAccording to \"The Making of Star Trek\", \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry's original plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to land the starship itself. However, this would have required unfeasible and unaffordable sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while landing, taking off, etc. The shuttlecraft was the next idea, but when filming began, the full-sized shooting model was not ready. Transporters were devised as a less expensive alternative, achieved by a simple fade-out/fade-in of the subject. Transporters first appear in the original pilot episode \"\". The transporter special effect, before being done using computer animation, was created by turning a slow-motion camera upside down and photographing some backlit shiny grains of aluminium powder that were dropped between the camera and a black background.\n\nAccording to the \"\", the three touch-sensitive light-up bars on the \"Enterprise\"-D's transporter console were an homage to the three sliders used on the duotronic transporter console on the original \"Enterprise\" in \"The Original Series\".\n\nIn August 2008, physicist Michio Kaku predicted in \"Discovery Channel Magazine\" that a teleportation device similar to those in \"Star Trek\" would be invented within 100 years. Physics students at University of Leicester calculated that to \"beam up\" just the genetic information a single human cell, not the positions of the atoms, just the gene sequences, together with a \"brain state\" would take 4,850 trillion years assuming a 30 gigahertz microwave bandwidth. A study by Eric Davis for the US Air Force Research Laboratory of speculative teleportation technologies showed that to dematerialize a human body by heating it up to a million times the temperature of the core of the sun so that the quarks lose their binding energy and become massless and can be beamed at the speed of light in the closest physics equivalent to the Star Trek teleportation scenario would require the equivalent of 330 megatons of energy. To meet the information storage and transmission requirements would require current computing capabilities to continue improve by a factor of 10 to 100 times per decade for 200 to 300 years.\n\nAccording to dialogue in the \"\" (\"ENT\") episode \"Daedalus\", the transporter was invented in the early 22nd century by Dr. Emory Erickson, who also became the first human to be successfully transported. Although the \"Enterprise\" (NX-01) has a transporter, the crew does not routinely use it for moving biological organisms. (Captain Jonathan Archer once said that he wouldn't even put his dog through it.) Instead, they generally prefer using shuttlepods or other means of transportation unless no other means of transportation are possible or feasible. The capability is rare; in \"The Andorian Incident\", the Andorians, technologically far superior to Starfleet in many regards, are explicitly stated not to possess the technology, and in \"Chosen Realm\", a group of alien religious extremists who hijack the ship is unaware of it to the point that when Archer, choosing himself after their leader insists on sacrificing a crew member, claims that the device disintegrates matter rather than teleporting it, he is unhesitatingly taken at his word. The crew aboard the 23rd century USS \"Enterprise\" frequently use the transporter. By the 24th century, transporter travel was reliable and \"the safest way to travel\" according to dialogue in the \"\" (\"TNG\") episode \"Realm of Fear\".\n\nAccording to the \"\" episode \"Homefront\", Starfleet Academy cadets receive transporter rations, and the Sisko family once used a transporter to move furniture into a new home.\n\nDespite its frequent use, characters such as Leonard McCoy and Katherine Pulaski are reluctant to use the transporter, as the characters express in the \"Next Generation\" episodes \"Encounter at Farpoint\" and \"\", respectively. Reginald Barclay expresses his outright fear of transporting in \"Realm of Fear\".\n\nThe television series and films do not go into great detail about transporter technology. The \"\" claims that the devices transport objects in real time, accurate to the quantum level. The episode \"Realm of Fear\" specifies the length of a transport under unusual circumstances would last \"... four or five seconds; about twice the normal time\". This calculates the length of a typical transport as between 2 and 2.5 seconds and possibly less. Heisenberg compensators remove uncertainty from the subatomic measurements, making transporter travel feasible. Further technology involved in transportation include a computer pattern buffer to enable a degree of leeway in the process. When asked \"How does the Heisenberg compensator work?\" by \"Time\" magazine, \"Star Trek\" technical adviser Michael Okuda responded: \"It works very well, thank you.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Original Series\" (\"TOS\") writers' guide, the effective range of a transporter is 40,000 kilometers, although thick layers of rock can reduce this range (\"TNG\": \"\"). The \"TOS\" episode \"\" however, appears to indicate that the transporters' maximum range, during that time period in \"Star Trek\" history, is actually around 30,000 kilometers. Transporter operations have been disrupted or prevented by dense metals (\"TNG\": \"\"), solar flares (\"TNG\": \"\"), and other forms of radiation, including electromagnetic (\"TNG\": \"\"; \"TNG\": \"\") and nucleonic (\"TNG\": \"\"), and affected by ion storms (\"TOS\": \"\"). Transporting, in progress, has also been stopped by telekinetic powers (\"TNG\": \"\") and by brute strength (\"TNG\": \"\"). The \"TNG\" episode \"\" features a dangerous and experimental \"subspace transporter\" capable of interstellar distances and the Dominion had the ability to transport over great distances (\"DS9\": \"\"). The 40,000-kilometer limit is also referenced in \"ENT\": \"\".\n\nStarfleet transporters from the \"TNG\" era onward include a device that can detect and disable an active weapon (\"TNG\": \"\"), and a bio-filter to remove contagious microbes or viruses from an individual in transport (\"TNG\": \"\", \"TOS\": \"The Naked Time\"). The transporter can also serve a tactical purpose, such as beaming a photon grenade or photon torpedo to detonate at remote locations (\"TNG\": \"\", \"\": \"\"), or to outright destroy objects (\"TNG\": \"Captain's Holiday\"). The \"TOS\" episode \"A Taste of Armageddon\" mentions Vendikar materializing fusion bombs over targets of enemy planet Eminiar VII in the course of theoretical computer warfare.\n\nWhenever a person or object is transported, the machine creates a memory file of the pattern. This has been used at least once in every \"Star Trek\" series to revert people adversely affected by a transport to their original state.\n\nVarious episodes of \"Deep Space Nine\" (\"DS9\") and \"Voyager\" (\"VOY\") have introduced two anti-transporter devices: transport inhibitors and transporter scramblers. Inhibitors prevent a transporter beam from \"locking on\" to whatever the device is attached. Scramblers distort the pattern that is in transit, literally scrambling the atoms upon rematerialization, resulting in the destruction of inanimate objects and killing living beings by rematerializing them as masses of random tissue; this was gruesomely demonstrated in the \"DS9\" episode \"\".\n\nTransporter operations can also be curtailed when either the point of origin and/or the intended target site is moving at warp velocities. In the \"TNG\" episode, \"\", a \"long-range\" or \"near-warp\" transport was required as a transporter beam cannot penetrate a warp field. (In the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film Kirk and Scotty beam aboard while the \"Enterprise\" is traveling at warp, however, the movie takes place in an alternate continuity, thus not affecting the Prime Continuity used in all previous media and the \"Star Trek\" Online computer game.) To deposit an away team on the planet Gravesworld while at the same time responding to a distress signal, the \"Enterprise\" would only drop out of warp drive just long enough to energize the transporter beam. Geordi La Forge personally performed the delicate operation, which involved compensating for the ship's relativistic motion. After materializing, Deanna Troi commented that for a moment she thought she was trapped in a nearby wall, to which Worf replied, \"For a moment, you were.\" In later stories (\"\" and \"\"), it was confirmed that the transporter would work at warp only if the sending and receiving sites were moving at equal velocities.\n\nIn his book \"The Physics of Star Trek\", after explaining the difference between transporting information and transporting the actual atoms, Krauss notes that \"The \"Star Trek\" writers seem never to have got it exactly clear what they want the transporter to do. Does the transporter send the atoms and the bits, or just the bits?\" He notes that according to the canon definition of the transporter the former seems to be the case, but that that definition is inconsistent with a number of applications, particularly incidents, involving the transporter, which appear to involve only a transport of information, for example the way in which it splits Kirk into two versions in the episode \"\" or the way in which Riker is similarly split in the episode \"\". Krauss elaborates that: \"If the transporter carries both the matter stream and the information signal, this splitting phenomenon is impossible. The number of atoms you end up with has to be the same as the number you began \nwith. There is no possible way to replicate people in this manner. On the other hand, if only the information were beamed up, one could imagine combining it with atoms that might be stored aboard a starship and making as many copies as you wanted of an individual.\"\n\nAside from external influences causing disruptions in the normal operations of transporters, the technology itself has been known to fail on occasion, causing serious injury or usually death to those being transported. This was demonstrated in Star Trek's 1979 film debut, \"\" when a malfunction in the transporter sensor circuits resulted in insufficient signal being present at the \"Enterprise\" end to successfully rematerialize the two subjects, and Starfleet was unable to pull them back to where they had dematerialized from. The transporter system attempted to rematerialize what little signal was available, and despite the efforts of Kirk and Scotty, the system failed and both subjects vanished from the transporter pad. Kirk, visibly shaken by what he had witnessed asked, \"Starfleet, do you have them?\", to which the response was made \"\"Enterprise\", what we got back didn't live long, fortunately\".\n\nBy the time of \"\", transporter technology has advanced considerably, meaning that accidents are now remote, if not near impossible. In the episode \"Realm of Fear\", Geordi La Forge states that there have been no more than two or three transporter accidents in the preceding 10 years. Reference is also made to the advancement of transporter technology in the same episode, where Chief O'Brien states that each individual transporter pad has four redundant scanners whereby in the event a scanner fails the other three will take over, and that he has never lost anyone having been a transporter operator for over twenty years.\n\nIn \"\", several adult Enterprise crew members were beamed off a shuttle and re materialized as children still in their adult sized clothing, the incoming \"matter stream\" had a commensurate drop in mass, the operator had initially thought the reduction in mass meant \"we may have lost one\".\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"Tuvix\", a transporter accident combines both the physical and behavioral aspects of Lt. Tuvok and Neelix into a single being wearing a melange of each other's clothing. Notably, Tuvix was of equal mass of both Tuvok and Neelix combined. When they were later separated, Neelix and Tuvok were both wearing Starfleet uniforms.\n\nWhile several characters have asserted that transporters cannot transport through a ship's shields or planetary defense shields, there are instances of this \"rule\" being broken through a technobabble solution (\"TNG\": \"\", \"DS9\": \"Trials and Tribble-ations\") or disregarded by the show's writers (\"Voyager\": \"\"). The non-canon \"TNG Technical Manual\" describes how a starship may create \"windows\" in the shield geometry through which a transporter beam may propagate at the expense of creating weak spots in the vessel's defensive field.\n\nIn \"\", Vice Admiral James T. Kirk and Lieutenant Saavik carry on a conversation during rematerialization. In \"\", Dr. Gillian Taylor jumps into Kirk's transporter beam during dematerialization, and rematerializes without any apparent ill effects. This is probably due to the \"annular confinement beam\", a component of the transporter mentioned in the various television episodes which serves to keep patterns separate from one another. In the same film, Mr. Spock is beamed onto a cloaked ship while walking.\n\nAccording to the \"TNG Technical Manual\", the transporter cannot move antimatter, but in the \"Voyager\" episode \"Dark Frontier\" \"Voyager\" transported a live photon torpedo equipped with antimatter onto a Borg ship. Also in \"TOS\" episode \"\" Kirk and a fellow crewman beam down to the surface of a planet with an antimatter bomb. The \"TAS\" episode \"One of Our Planets Is Missing\" has the \"Enterprise\" beaming a chunk of antimatter into a stasis box.\nIn the original series, beaming to and from the transporter chamber was a necessity. This is explained in the \"TOS\" episode \"Day of the Dove\". Spock and Scotty had said that doing a site-to-site transport, as they are referred to on the show, on board the ship could be risky. They could beam into a deck or other inanimate object and get stuck there. However, there are apparently safeguards in place to prevent people from being beamed into hostile environments such as under water and into lava pits, although it is possible to override this safety feature; for example, in the \"TOS\" episode \"And the Children Shall Lead\", two security guards are beamed into open space. In the following series, however, the transporter room seems to become mostly obsolete, the actual equipment notwithstanding. Characters are shown activating the transporter from ordinary consoles and beaming from place to place without apparent trouble. The main operator can likewise send those in transport anywhere with ease (for example, in the \"Voyager\" episode \"\", a medical console is used to transport a body from the morgue to the surgical bay). A possible explanation for this is put forward in the \"\", where such site-to-site transports would probably use twice as much energy as would be required for transport to or from the transporter room itself, since the subject would have to be beamed to the transporter, stored, then shunted to their destination. In addition, the six circles on the platform are generally used as targets for the subjects to stand on, but they do not appear to represent any limitation of the hardware to six or fewer people. People have been transported carrying others, in a coffin style transport, as well as animals, hay, and various inanimate objects.\n\nDialogue in \"Deep Space Nine\" indicates the existence of portable transporters, but these are never seen. The \"Next Generation\" episode \"\" features emergency transporter armbands, although these may have served only to activate a remote transporter. To confuse things more, \"\" featured the prototype \"emergency transport unit\". Tom Paris uses a portable transporter in the \"Voyager\" episode \"\". However, in \"Star Trek: Into Darkness\", Khan Noonien Singh uses a portable transporter to beam from a helicopter to the Klingon home world.\n\nFor special effects reasons, in \"TOS\", people generally appear immobilized during transport, with the exception of Kirk in the episode \"That Which Survives\". However, by \"TNG\", characters can move within the confines of the transporter beam while being transported, although this is rarely shown. Persons being transported are at least sometimes able to perceive the functioning of the transporter while they are in transit. In the \"TOS\" episode \"\", the \"Enterprise\" transporter malfunctions while transporting Scotty from the disabled USS \"Constellation\" to the \"Enterprise\" due to a power drain, and Scotty's pattern is nearly lost in transit. As soon as he successfully materializes, Scotty asks the transporter operator with concern, \"What's the matter with that thing?\" and orders the transporter to be taken offline for emergency repair.\n\nSome species do not use transporter technology for a variety of reasons. In the first appearance of Trill in the \"TNG\" episode \"\", Trill were unable to be transported, once joined with a symbiont. It seems that was due to the symbiont being detected and removed by the transporter technology as an infestation in the host. Odan, the Trill host in this episode, is reluctant to say why he will not travel this way, and it only becomes apparent that he is carrying a symbiont when he is later injured. All the crew of the \"Enterprise\" react as if they have had no contact with this species before. It later becomes apparent that joined Trill have been working in the Federation for some time.\n\nThe famous catchphrase \"Beam me up, Scotty\" refers to the transporter device, which was often operated by chief engineer Montgomery Scott during the original series. The phrase was never uttered by anyone in the original series, although the lines \"Scotty, beam us up\" and \"Beam me up\" were spoken by Captain Kirk in that series. \"Scotty, beam me up\" was spoken by Admiral Kirk in \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\". On the special edition DVD of \"Star Trek IV\", the text commentary provided by Michael and Denise Okuda (co-authors of \"The Star Trek Encyclopedia\" and \"The Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future\") indicates that this was the closest anyone came to using that catchphrase in an official \"Star Trek\" production.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7523798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7523798", "title": "Urdu movement", "text": "Urdu movement\n\nThe Urdu movement was a socio-political movement aimed at making Urdu the universal language and symbol of the cultural and political identity of the Muslim communities of the South Asia during the British Raj. The movement began with the fall of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, fuelled by the Aligarh Movement of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. It strongly influenced the All India Muslim League and the Pakistan movement.\n\nThe Hindi-Urdu controversy arose in 1867 when the British government prepared to accept the demand of the Hindu communities of the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar to change the Perso-Arabic script of the official language to Devanagari and adopt Hindi as the second official language on demand of Hindu activists. Muslim politician Sir Syed Ahmed Khan became the most vocal opponent of this change. He viewed Urdu as the \"lingua franca\" of Muslims. Having been developed by Muslim rulers of India, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society of Aligarh translated Western works only into Urdu. Sir Syed considered Urdu to be \"a common legacy of Hindus and Muslims\". The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu-medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India.\nTestifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that \"Urdu was the language of gentry and of people of high social standing, whereas Hindi was to be the vulgar.\" His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders and advocates of Hindi. \". The Hindus unified across the region to demand the recognition of Hindi. The success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of the Muslim intellectual and political class. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred on and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give it extensive official use and patronage.\n\nSir Syed's call for the adoption of Urdu as the language of Indian Muslims won extensive support from the Aligarh Movement and Muslim religious activists of the Deobandi and Wahabbi schools. Muslim religious and political leaders Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq developed organisations such as the Urdu Defence Association and the Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu, committed to the perpetuation of Urdu. Sir Syed's protege Shibli Nomani led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the Hyderabad State and as the medium of instruction in the Osmania University. This political campaign was criticised for making the use of Urdu a political issue that served as a wedge between Muslims and Hindus, who saw Sir Syed's advocacy as an effort to re-establish Muslim hegemony. To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu became an integral part of political identity and communal separatism. The division over the use of Hindi or Urdu would further fuel communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India. The All India Muslim League and the Jamaat-e-Islami projected Urdu as essential for the political and cultural survival of Islamic society in India. Muslim politicians like Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, Liaquat Ali Khan emphasised Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and political identity. The political cause of Urdu became a core issue at the heart of the \"Two-Nation Theory\", which advocated that Muslims and Hindus were irreconcilably separate nations. Advocates of the Pakistan movement sought to make Urdu a key argument in drawing distinctions with India's Hindu-majority population. Muslim religious leaders such as Maulana Mohammad Ali, Maulana Shaukat Ali and Maulana Maududi emphasised the knowledge of Urdu as essential for ordinary and religious Muslims.\n\nIn Pakistan, Urdu has been so far, the National language and the Lingua franca, while English holds the status of the official language of the state. However, this policy caused considerable political turmoil in East Bengal, which was home to Bengali-speaking population who constituted the majority of the population of Pakistan. Jinnah, most West Pakistani politicians emphasised that only Urdu would be recognised officially. This intensified the cultural and political gulf between West Pakistan and East Pakistan. The East Pakistan Awami Muslim League (the predecessor of the Awami League), established by A. K. Fazlul Huq, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1949 would lead the demand for the recognition of Bengali. Intensifying protests and strikes led by political groups, unions and students groups would lead to the imposition of martial law. The killing of protesting students by police in 1952 triggered a massive wave of protests in the province, which would come to be known as the Bengali Language Movement. Although politicians like Khwaja Nazimudin supported the cause of Urdu, a vast majority of Bengali nationalists saw the government policy as a symbol of racial discrimination. This wedge in Pakistani society would ultimately lead to the Bangladesh Liberation War and the establishment of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nIndependent India adopted Urdu as one of its 23 scheduled languages although its counterpart, Hindi, enjoys the status of official language. Urdu is also officially recognised by the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar and Delhi. Urdu is widely used by Indian Muslims across the country and there are a large number of Urdu-medium schools, colleges and universities, including madrassahs, the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University. Urdu is also a part of popular culture, media and publications. Numerous Urdu language films have been produced, which include \"Umrao Jaan\", \"Shatranj Ke Khiladi\" and \"Pakeezah\".\n\nDespite being given the status of a scheduled language, there have been concerns that the Urdu language has largely been on a decline in India. This decline has been attributed to reasons such as lack of promotional policies by central language regulation boards, the promulgation and preference of Urdu's counterpart Hindi as the Indian union's official language since 1950, the higher number of Hindi-speakers in India leading to the suppression of Urdu, the partition of India and Urdu's national language status in Pakistan overshadowing the language's prospects in India, as well as the lack of many schools in India teaching Urdu as a medium of instruction.\n\n"}
{"id": "22711940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22711940", "title": "Van Thanh Rudd", "text": "Van Thanh Rudd\n\nVan Thanh Rudd (born 1973) is an award winning and controversial Australian street artist, sculptor, children's book illustrator, former musician and unionist. He has balanced his twenty year artistic career with labouring jobs in hospitality, warehousing and construction. His political views have drifted toward the revolutionary left since the early 2000s, away from the centrist Australian Labor Party, the party of choice for the Rudd side of the family. He knows very little about his mother's Vietnamese side of the family, most of whom still live in Vietnam. A member of Socialist Alternative and electoral party, the Victorian Socialists his artworks contain radical left-wing commentary and positions. He is also a member of construction and maritime union, the CFMMEU and the newly forming Workers Art Collective with visual artists Sam Wallman, Tia Kass, Niki Minus, Mary Leunig, Sam Davis, SlimOne, with more members to join in the near future. He often uses the name Van T Rudd or Van as a signature on his art as a visual mockery of the popular Vans clothing company. He is influenced by the theories of Karl Marx, and many other revolutionary activists and artists who have been struggling against the forces of capitalism. \n\nRudd has been producing art for over twenty years. He was a musician, mostly as a drummer, bass guitarist and keyboardist in bands Cheezlekane (1993 to 2002), Seconds (2001 to 2007) and Granma (2005 to 2006). One of the first protest marches he attended was for Melbourne's public transport workers in 1997 with his younger brother, Rad. Also with his younger brother, he attended the large S11 anti-capitalism protests in 2000 in Melbourne at Crown Casino. In early 2008, preceding the Global Financial Crisis, he joined the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), which merged into Socialist Alternative in 2013, and contested the seat of Lalor in the 2010 federal election against Prime Minister Julia Gillard, generating 0.50% of the vote. Rudd began drawing cartoons at a young age and was largely self-taught. He nearly failed a humanities course in the early 1990s at Griffith University. After several art exhibitions and playing gigs in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, he eventually went on to study art at the RMIT University and Victorian College of the Arts, where he was elected student union representative with socialists Left Action. He was meant to complete a PhD in fine art at the Victorian College of the Arts but ran out of funding and also became fed up with the post-marxist saturation of theory and practise in art.\n\nRudd was born in Nambour, Queensland, to Vietnam veteran Malcolm Rudd (the brother of Kevin Rudd) and Tuoi, and now resides in Footscray, Melbourne. He has an older brother Dat and younger brother Rad. For many of his younger years, he was involved in numerous creative projects with Rad including film making and acting. As a drummer, Rudd joined a Brisbane-based indie pop-rock band called Cheezlekane in the early 1990s with members Patrick Devery (lead vocals), Cameron Peterson (bass guitar) and Nick Stamford (guitar). They played many pub gigs in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne and gained interest from Geffen Records in 1998 due to their first 4-track produced album called Knee High Fidelity. With musician friends Iain Wilson, Ritchie Giliberto and Mark Buggy, Rudd formed the band Seconds with his brother Rad as lead singer. He also was a keyboardist in a band called Stalis Vetch with Rad. He has a partner and experienced youth worker of Chilean heritage, Tania; daughter, Loyola; and son, Manolo. Rudd says that his deeper, leftist political awakening came after meeting his partner, whose family fled Chile after General Augusto Pinochet deposed the elected socialist Salvador Allende and began violently targeting leftists.Tania was an active member of the radical left DSP and campaigned for refugee rights. They formed a band called Granma in 2005 with Tania on drums and her brothers Ricardo on keyboards, Nicolas on Vocals, Simon on guitar and Rudd on Bass and vocals. Rudd decided to leave music in 2007 to focus more upon his visual art.\n\nIn 2004 Rudd was selected as a finalist in the 2004 Metro Art Competition with a realist-style artwork depicting a combined version of paintings by Albert Tucker and Jeffery Smart .\n\nIn 2004, as Rudd's paintings became more politicized, he decided that exhibiting his large paintings inside galleries wasn't going to reach large audiences, so he began carrying them in public. He was to call this The Carriers Project. He entered the project in various festivals based in Melbourne including Fringe and later the Big West Festival, and it later culminated in a national tour of Australia through kultour. Some of his paintings depicting 'exploding terrorists' created unease with authorities in Brisbane and Perth. He claims he was adding valuable commentary about the anti-terror laws in Australia. It was a coincidence that, in 2007, while Rudd was in Perth completing his national tour, that his uncle Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister of Australia. \n\nIn 2006, Rudd created an artwork called 'Portrait of an Exploding Terrorist'. It was a combined painting and billboard piece in one. He carried the painting around the streets of Melbourne, while exhibiting a large piece on the public billboard at Trocadero Art Space, Footscray.It wasn't long before the local council demanded the billboard piece be removed, claiming it constituted litter. Gallery director Michael Brennan and Rudd were forced to remove the piece to avoid paying a large fine. The piece was critical of the State of Israel and argued that it inflicted terror upon the Palestinian people. \n\nIn 2007 Rudd created an artwork depicting a large mural on a gallery wall at Trocadero Art Space in Footscray with signatories of Australians who supported a visit to the country by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. It was titled \"Smells Like Sulphur: A Tribute to Venezuela and the Art of Telling Bush to Piss Off\", referencing Chavez' UN General Assembly speech the previous year, when he called former US President George W. Bush \"the devil\".\n\nIn 2007, Rudd submitted an oil painting titled '100 000 to 400 000' to the Sunshine Coast Art Prize. The painting was awarded a second prize and artist Tony Albert won the main prize. The local media tried to whip up controversy around Rudd's painting because it showed a U.S flag burning. \n\nIn 2008 the City of Melbourne rejected a painting by Rudd depicting Ronald McDonald setting fire to Thích Quảng Đức with the Olympic torch. According to Rudd, the artwork was a homage to British street artist Banksy and a comment on human rights abuses in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games. Rudd accused the City of Melbourne of political censorship which they denied, claiming he was solely picked to feature in the Ho Chi Minh City exhibition for his Vietnamese heritage.\n\nIn 2009 Rudd made an artwork critical of Connex's parent company Veolia Environnement's light rail contract which is to link Israeli settlements in the West Bank with Jerusalem. The artwork was displayed at Platform Artists Group's public gallery, adjacent to Flinders Street Station, a major train station in Melbourne. Connex threatened Rudd with legal action over his use of a similar font and colour-scheme to the company's logo and the Anti-Defamation League accused the gallery of racism. The Electronic Intifada claimed that Rudd's artwork was a boost to the campaign against Connex and Veolia – a part of the general Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel – whose contract to run Melbourne trains expired in November 2009.\n\nIN 2009 Rudd exhibited in Melbourne a used part from an Afghan civilian car, purportedly destroyed by an International Security Assistance Force missile in Southern Afghanistan. It accompanied a price tag of $1.2 billion. Rudd estimated the value based on what he believed was \"the astronomical price paid by victims of war\". He broke down the multi-trillion dollar US war budget for the Middle East since 2001 and included other variables such as the cost of wounded civilians and soldiers.\n\nIn 2009, Rudd was again selected as a finalist in the Sunshine Coast Art Prize for the collage called 'Freedom Furniture' which was critical of the U.S.A's Operation Enduring Freedom by contrasting an image of a U.S marine placing a wounded child of Afghanistan into the sofa of a luxury home in a western lounge room setting from a home wares catalogue. \n\nOn Australia Day 2010, Rudd and RSP member, Sam King, dressed in Ku Klux Klan outfits with the signs \"Racism – Made in Australia\" in front of the outfits, outside the Rod Laver Arena during the Australian Open to protest the refusal of the Victorian Government to treat the attacks on Indians in Victoria as racially motivated and also the federal government's policies towards asylum seekers. Rudd and King were arrested within 10 minutes and charged with inciting a riot. Rudd also told the Indian weekly newsmagazine \"Outlook\" that the \"dominant culture in Australia is a racist culture.\"\n\nIn a 2010 interview on 3AW, Kevin Rudd expressed to Neil Mitchell that he was not a fan of his nephew's political views but supported the notion of free speech in Australia, adding, \"[you] can choose your friends but...\". According to a member of the RSP, the PM and his nephew are not in regular contact. In a later 2010 Fairfax radio interview, on the same subject Kevin Rudd stated: \"Do I agree in any way with what he's done? No I don't, absolutely.\" Rudd was the subject of an episode of ABC program \"Australian Story\", broadcast in August 2010, which reported his uncle had been invited to appear, but declined.\n\nRudd contested the seat of Lalor for the House of Representatives in the 2010 federal election against Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard for the unregistered RSP. This signals the RSP's failure to generate the 500-member minimum required by the Victorian Electoral Commission to register as an official political party. He garnered a total of 516 votes, scoring 0.50% of the overall vote, with a +0.50% swing. This placed him as the second least preferred candidate, ahead of regional tourism developer, Marc Aussie-Stone, compared to Gillard as first preference, who garnered 66,060 votes, scoring 64.26% of the overall vote, with a +4.37% swing. The artist claimed on an ABC radio interview his reason for running in the election was that the appointment of Gillard as PM marked \"a more conservative path for Labor\" and that she was \"influenced by the mining magnates... [and] the conservative unions\".\n\nIn 2011, Rudd was asked to submit an artwork for an art exhibition as part of the 2011 Human Rights Arts and Film Festival. He submitted a large canvas that was a celebration of the Arab Spring (2011) on one side, and also a contribution to the BDS campaign on the other. The Arab Spring side showed a cartoon-like body exploding with the words 'I'm not a terrorist, I'm just exploding with joy', and the BDS side showed in cartoon style, pop icon Justine Bieber spray painting graffiti on Israel's separation wall. The graffiti depicted Max Brenner Chocolates as Bieber announced that he wished he didn't play in Israel because he would be complicit in Israel's occupation of Palestine. Max Brenner was targeted by BDS campaigners for its complicity in Israel's occupation of Palestine at around the same period of this art exhibition at No Vacancy Gallery, QV Shopping Centre, Melbourne. But Rudd's artwork was censored before it got installed in the gallery. Rudd claimed the gallery directors confronted him in the gallery saying the artwork was violent. Rudd also took part in the anti-Max Brenner protests in the QV building but avoided being arrested. Several other protesters were arrested but later freed from charges in a landmark victory.\n\nOne of Rudd's more obscure, mysterious, yet incisive art projects is called the #RichForks. It made news at various outlets around the world. It began over fifteen years ago when Rudd began collecting luxury dinner forks that had just been used by the political and business elites of the world. As a waiter, he was able to get access to the soiled forks and is alleged to have made networks with other hospitality workers internationally in order to appropriate forks from some of the richest people on earth. Rudd claims the whole project is commentary on the massive class divide between struggling workers and wealthy capitalists. There has only been two exhibitions of the #RichForks - one in Footscray and one in Newcastle, Australia. It is not known whether Rudd will continue with this project into the near future.\n\nIn 2016, fifty-five Carlton & United Breweries maintenance workers in Abbottsford, Victoria, were sacked then re-employed on individual contracts with an overall 65% wage cut. When one of the organisers from the Electrical Trades Union made a call-out on social media for a street artist to paint a mural on a shipping container. Rudd jumped at the chance and painted an iconic murals at the site of their nine month protest. One of the murals, painted on the side of a shipping container, shows a large unionist's arm pulling aside the shipping container wall revealing the CUB boss stealing bags of money. Another shipping container at the Abbottsford site depicted horses appropriated from the CUB logo, only this time they were dying of thirst in drought conditions (i.e. Carlton Drought).The protest and boycott by the unionists and workers eventually achieved an important victory. After the #CUB55 protests, the murals were transported to the CFMMEU training centre in Port Melbourne. It wasn't long before they were used again, and transported to the striking workers at the Longford Gas Plant, Gippsland. Similar to the CUB55, about 200 workers were threatened with the sack if they didn't sign up to a different contract on significantly lower wages and conditions. Rudd also created a new mural for the protest site which showed an Exxon boss atop a gas platform, sinking workers deeper into the water while smoking a cigar from the gas flare. Rudd has since created a series of murals for the car park of the Electrical Trades Union office in North Melbourne with fellow artist and radical left unionist Azlan McLennan. In 2017, he also created a large mural commemorating the CUB55 victory in the car park at Victorian Trades Hall. In early 2018, Rudd created a mural for the striking waterside workers at Cube\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14791055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14791055", "title": "Western pattern diet", "text": "Western pattern diet\n\nThe Western pattern diet (WPD) or standard American diet (SAD) is a modern dietary pattern that is generally characterized by high intakes of red meat, processed meat, pre-packaged foods, butter, fried foods, high-fat dairy products, eggs, refined grains, potatoes, corn (and High-fructose corn syrup) and high-sugar drinks. The modern standard American diet was brought about by fundamental lifestyle changes following the Neolithic Revolution, and, later, the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBy contrast, a healthy diet has higher proportions of unprocessed fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole-grain foods, poultry, and fish.\n\nThis diet is \"rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains.\" Various foods and food processing procedures that had been introduced during the Neolithic and Industrial Periods had fundamentally altered 7 nutritional characteristics of ancestral hominin diets: glycemic load, fatty acid composition, macronutrient composition, micronutrient density, acid-base balance, sodium-potassium ratio, and fiber content.\n\nThe typical American diet is about 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 35% fat. These macronutrient intakes fall within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) for adults identified by the Food and Nutrition Board of the United States Institute of Medicine as \"associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients,\" which are 45-65% carbohydrate, 10-35% protein, and 20-35% fat as a percentage of total energy. However, the nutritional quality of the specific foods comprising those macronutrients is often poor, as with the \"Western\" pattern discussed above. Complex carbohydrates such as starch are believed to be more healthy than the sugar so frequently consumed in the Standard American Diet.\n\nA review of eating habits in the United States in 2004 found that about 75% of restaurant meals were from fast-food restaurants. Nearly half of the meals ordered from a menu were hamburger, French fries, or poultry — and about one third of orders included a carbonated beverage drink. From 1970 to 2008, the per capita consumption of calories increased by nearly one-quarter in the United States and about 10% of all calories were from high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nAmericans consume more than 13% of their daily calories in the form of added sugars. Beverages such as flavored water, soft drinks, and sweetened caffeinated beverages make up 47% of these added sugars.\n\nAmericans ages 1 and above consume significantly more added sugars, oils, saturated fats, and sodium than recommended in the Dietary Guidelines outlined by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. 89% of Americans consume more sodium than recommended. Additionally, excessive consumption of oils, saturated fats, and added sugars is seen in 72%, 71%, and 70% of the American population, respectively.\n\nConsumers began turning to margarine due to concerns over the high levels of saturated fats found in butter. By 1958, margarine had become more commonly consumed than butter, with the average American consuming 8.9 pounds of margarine per year. Margarine is produced by refining vegetable oils, a process that introduces trans elaidic acid not found naturally in food. The consumption of trans fatty acids such as trans elaidic acid has been linked to cardiovascular disease. By 2005, margarine consumption had fallen below butter consumption due to the risks associated with trans fat intake.\n\nVegetable consumption is low among Americans, with only 13% of the population consuming the recommended amounts. Boys ages 9 to 13 and girls ages 14 to 18 consume the lowest amounts of vegetables relative to the general population. Potatoes and tomatoes, which are key components of many meals, account for 39% of the vegetables consumed by Americans. 60% of vegetables are consumed individually, 30% are included as part of a dish, and 10% are found in sauces.\n\nWhole grains should consist of over half of total grain consumption, and refined grains should not exceed half of total grain consumption. However, 85.3% of the cereals eaten by Americans are produced with refined grains, where the germ and bran are removed. Grain refining increases shelf life and softens breads and pastries; however, the process of refining decreases its nutritional quality.\n\nBased on epidemiological studies, compared to a healthy diet, the Western pattern diet is positively correlated with an elevated incidence of obesity, death from heart disease, cancer (especially colon cancer), and other \"Western pattern diet\"-related diseases. There is an evolutionary mismatch between the ancient physiology of humans and a Western pattern diet; this underlies diseases of civilization, which include Type II diabetes, epithelial cell cancers, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obesity. There is also a correlation between a Western pattern diet and an increase in inflammatory diseases, which is particularly evident in relation to fiber and fat-content. The high level of omega-6 fatty acids compared to omega-3 fatty acids in the Western diet is believed to contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Acne is one of the inflammatory diseases which is increased by the Western pattern diet, due to too much carbohydrates with high glycemic load such as refined sugars or refined starches, milk and dairy products, and trans fats and saturated fats, along with a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nA Western pattern diet consisting of refined sugars and polyunsaturated fatty acids has been associated with Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease has its effects on the symbiotic bacteria within the human gut that show a positive correlation with a Western pattern diet. Crohn's is an inflammatory disease that is associated with immunological responses. Symptoms can range from severe abdominal pain to diarrhea and fever Inflammatory bowel disease has shown increased development with the Western pattern diet, and high consumption of sugar and low plant-based intake is directly correlated with an increase Crohn's disease. Inflammatory bowel disease showed no increase in risk factors only in relation to development of disease associated with the Western pattern diet.\n\nA Western pattern diet is associated with an increased risk of obesity. There is a positive correlation between a Western pattern diet and several plasma biomarkers that may be mediators of obesity, such as HDL cholesterol, fasting insulin, and leptin. Meta-analyses have also shown that, compared to a healthy diet, a Western pattern diet is linked to increased weight gain among females. Relative to a diet high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish, a Western diet is associated with increased risk of being overweight among adolescents.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between adoption of a Western pattern diet and incidence of type 2 diabetes among both men and women. A strong adoption of a Western pattern diet, when coupled with obesity and decreased physical activity, is associated with an especially elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, genetic predisposition to diabetes interacts cooperatively with a Western pattern diet to increase risk of diabetes.\n\nThe Western pattern diet has been generally linked to increased risk for cancer. Meta-analyses have found that diet patterns consistent with those of the Western pattern diet are positively correlated with risk for prostate cancer. Additionally, a 1998 case review found that the Western pattern diet is directly associated to heightened risks for colon cancer [2]. This conclusion has been verified by several other studies, which also indicate an increased rate of rectal cancer in cases who maintained a primarily Western pattern diet. No significant relation has been established between the Western pattern diet and breast cancer. Breast cancer epidemiologists have found that women with a more Western diet have a nominally increased risk of breast cancer that is not statistically significant. A recent study led by the National Institute of Health indicates that the Western pattern diet can actually lead to increased levels of free estradiol in women, which has benefits in regards to breast cancer prevention.\n\nThere are multiple studies associating the Western pattern diet with heart disease. In 2008, the INTERHEART study, funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research, concluded that risk of a myocardial infarction is 30% higher for individuals who consume a Western pattern diet than individuals who consume a prudent diet. A second study conducted in 2008 by \"Circulation\" also concluded that the Western pattern diet increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality in healthy US women. With that, meta-analyses and surveys in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology have associated cardiovascular disease and/or coronary heart disease with refined carbohydrates, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats, three major components of the Western pattern diet.\n\nThe western-versus-eastern dichotomy has become less relevant as such a diet is no longer \"foreign\" to any global region (just as traditional East Asian cuisine is no longer \"foreign\" to the west), but the term is still a well-understood shorthand in medical literature, regardless of where the diet is found. Other dietary patterns described in the medical research include \"drinker\" and \"meat-eater\" patterns. Because of the variability in diets, individuals are usually classified not as simply \"following\" or \"not following\" a given diet, but instead by ranking them according to how closely their diets line up with each pattern in turn. The researchers then compare the outcomes between the group that most closely follows a given pattern to the group that least closely follows a given pattern.\n\nThe Western diet present in today’s world is a consequence of the Neolithic revolution and Industrial revolutions. The Neolithic revolution introduced the staple foods of the western diet, including domesticated meats, sugar, alcohol, salt, cereal grains, and dairy products. The modern Western diet emerged after the Industrial Revolution, which introduced new methods of food processing including the addition of cereals, refined sugars, and refined vegetable oils to the Western diet, and also increased the fat content of domesticated meats. More recently, food processors began replacing sugar with high-fructose corn syrup.\n\n\n"}

She also appears in the opening chapters of \"Missee Lee\".\nThe ship would have been about 50 ft (15 m) long. In the book and the illustrations there is no mention of a head. This is typical of Arthur Ransome's reticence on the issue. \n\nThe name is taken from Wild Cat Island which features in all the books set in the Lake District. She was converted from a Baltic trading schooner by decking over the hold to make a saloon with a long skylight and four double cabins opening into it. The deckhouse has a couple of bunks which are used by the adults, Captain Flint and Peter Duck, in the book \"Peter Duck\". \n\nIn Ransome's book \"Missee Lee\", the ship was burned to the waterline and sinks when Gibber, Roger's monkey, put a lighted cigar in the fuel (petrol) holding tank. In \"Peter Duck\", the \"Swallow\" is aboard and is used as one of the ship's boats. In \"Missee Lee\", both the \"Swallow\" and \"Amazon\" are aboard and used as lifeboats when she sinks.\n\n<br> \n"}
