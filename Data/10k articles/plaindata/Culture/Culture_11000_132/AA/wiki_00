{"id": "158052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158052", "title": "Aguirre, the Wrath of God", "text": "Aguirre, the Wrath of God\n\nAguirre, the Wrath of God (), known in the UK as Aguirre, Wrath of God, is a 1972 West German epic historical drama film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role. The soundtrack was composed and performed by West German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado.\n\nUsing a minimalist approach to the story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization.\n\n\"Aguirre\" was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and the volatile Kinski. The director and the actor had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinski's tantrums terrorized both the crew and the local natives who were assisting the production. Shooting was entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties. Filming took place in the Peruvian rainforest on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on tributaries of the Ucayali region. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by natives.\n\n\"Aguirre\" opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international cult film following. It was given an extensive arthouse theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the director's best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on \"Time\" magazine's list of \"All Time 100 Best Films\". \"Aguirre\"'s visual style and narrative elements had a strong influence on Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\nIn 1560, several score of Spanish conquistadors, and a hundred Indian slaves, march down from the newly conquered Inca Empire in the Andes mountains into the jungles to the east, in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. Under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repullés), the men, clad in half armor, pull cannons down narrow mountainous paths and through dense, muddy jungle. On New Year's Eve, reaching the end of his supplies and unable to go on without more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don Pedro de Ursúa (Ruy Guerra) as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his second-in-command, fat nobleman Don Fernando de Guzmán (Peter Berling) representing The Royal House of Spain and Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro) to bring the word of God. Also accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro's better judgment, are Ursúa's mistress, Doña Inés (Helena Rojo) and Aguirre's teenage daughter, Florés (Cecilia Rivera, in her only film role).\n\nTraveling through rapids, one of the four rafts gets caught in an eddy, and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning the men on board are found dead, with two missing. Ursúa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for proper burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre hints to Perucho (Daniel Ades) to \"keep the rust off the cannon\". Perucho proceeds to fire the cannon at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.\n\nDuring the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Ursúa decides to return to Pizarro's group. Aguirre leads a mutiny against Ursúa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that Hernan Cortez won an empire in Mexico by disobeying orders. Ursúa attempts to put Aguirre in chains, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Inés cares for Ursúa. Aguirre coerces the soldiers to elect the fat, lazy Don de Guzmán as the new leader of the expedition. Aguirre proclaims de Guzmán emperor of the new country and declares Philip II dethroned. A farcical trial of Ursúa results in his being sentenced to death, but de Guzmán surprises Aguirre by granting Ursúa clemency.\n\nAguirre proves to be an oppressive leader, so terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only Inés has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Ursúa, Aguirre simply ignores her.\n\nThe expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An Indian couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion when presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for blasphemy. De Guzmán dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition's only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him. Soon afterwards he is found strangled near the raft's outhouse. After de Guzmán's death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Ursúa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an Indian village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught Inés walks into the jungle and disappears.\n\nOn the raft again, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a wooden ship perched in the highest branches of a tall tree, which Aguirre orders be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of final attacks by unseen assailants, the remaining survivors including Aguirre's daughter are killed by arrows. Aguirre alone remains alive on the slowly drifting raft. The raft becomes overrun by monkeys. The crazed Aguirre tells them: \"I, the Wrath of God, will marry my own daughter, and with her I will found the purest dynasty the world has ever seen. Together, we shall rule this entire continent. We shall endure. I am the Wrath of God... who else is with me?\" The final shot is of him waiting for the monkeys to respond.\n\n\nThe idea for the film began when Herzog borrowed a book on historical adventurers from a friend. After reading a half-page devoted to Lope de Aguirre, the filmmaker became inspired and immediately devised the story. He fabricated most of the plot details and characters, although he did use some historical figures in purely fictitious ways.\n\nHerzog wrote the screenplay \"in a frenzy\", and completed it in two-and-a-half days. Much of the script was written during a bus trip with Herzog's football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game and one of them vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims he cannot remember all of the things that he wrote on these pages.\n\nThe screenplay was shot as written, with some minor differences. In an early scene in which Pizarro instructs Ursúa to lead the scouting team down the river, in the script Pizarro mentions that in the course of the expedition Ursúa could possibly discover what happened to Francisco de Orellana's expedition, which had vanished without a trace years before (see \"Historical Accuracy\" section). Later in the screenplay, Aguirre and his men find a boat and the long-dead remains of Orellana's soldiers. Further down the river, they discover another ship lodged in some tree tops. In the screenplay, Aguirre and others explore the boat but find no sign of Orellana or his men. Herzog ultimately eliminated any such references to Orellana's expedition from the film. The sequence with the boat caught in the upper branches of a tree remains, but as filmed it seems to be simply a hallucinatory vision.\n\nThe finale is significantly different from Herzog's original script. The director recalled, \"I only remember that the end of the film was totally different. The end was actually the raft going out into the open ocean and being swept back inland, because for many miles you have a counter-current, the Amazon actually goes backwards. And it was tossed to and fro. And a parrot would scream: \"El Dorado, El Dorado\"...\"\n\nHerzog's first choice for the role of Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog's family apartment, and Kinski's often terrifying and deranged antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. \"Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang\", Herzog recalled. \"It took me at least a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre.\"\n\nFrom the beginning of the production, Herzog and Kinski argued about the proper manner to portray Aguirre. Kinski wanted to play a \"wild, ranting madman\", but Herzog wanted something \"quieter, more menacing\". In order to get the performance he desired, before each shot Herzog would deliberately infuriate Kinski. After waiting for the hot-tempered actor's anger to \"burn itself out\", Herzog would then roll the camera.\n\nOn one occasion, irritated by the noise from a hut where cast and crew were playing cards, the explosive Kinski fired three gunshots at it, blowing the tip off one extra's finger. Subsequently, Kinski started leaving the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident has given rise to the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint. However, Herzog has repeatedly denied the claim during interviews, saying he only verbally threatened Kinski in the heat of the moment, in a desperate attempt to keep him from leaving the set. The incident is parodied in \"Incident at Loch Ness\", which Herzog co-wrote.\n\nThe film was made for US$370,000, with one-third of the budget paying for Kinski's salary. It was filmed on location in the Peruvian rainforest, Machu Picchu (the stone steps of Huayna Picchu), and on the Amazon River tributaries of the Ucayali region. \"Aguirre\" was shot in five weeks, following nine months' worth of pre-production planning. The film was shot in chronological order, because Herzog believed the film crew's progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers' journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew floated in rafts down the Huallaga and Nanay rivers through the Urubamba Valley in Peru.\n\nAll of the actors spoke their dialogue in English. The members of the cast and crew came from sixteen different countries, and English was the only common language among them. In addition, Herzog felt that shooting \"Aguirre\" in English would improve the film's chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization \"left Peru with the man in charge of the process; both absconded \"en route\".\" The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality German language version, which was post-synched after production was completed. Herzog claims that Kinski requested too much money for the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.\n\nThe low budget precluded the use of stunt men or elaborate special effects. The cast and crew climbed up mountains, hacked through thick jungle, and rode ferocious Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by natives. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.\n\nThe camera used to shoot the film was stolen by Herzog from the Munich Film School. Years later, Herzog recalled:\n\nIt was a very simple 35mm camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.\n\nTo obtain the monkeys used in the climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys; he paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a veterinarian and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. Abashed, the handlers unloaded the monkeys, and Herzog loaded them into his jeep and drove away, used them in the shot they were required for, and released them afterwards into the jungle.\n\n\"Aguirre\"'s musical score was performed by Popol Vuh, a West German progressive/Krautrock band. The band was formed in 1970 by keyboardist Florian Fricke, who had known Herzog for several years prior to the formation of the band.\nHe had appeared as an actor in the director's first full-length film, \"Signs of Life\" (1968), playing a pianist. \"Aguirre\" was only the first of many collaborations between the band and the director.\n\nPopol Vuh's \"hypnotic music\" for \"Aguirre\" met with considerable acclaim. Roger Ebert wrote, \"The music sets the tone. It is haunting, ecclesiastical, human and yet something else... [T]he music is crucial to \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\"...\" AllMusic noted, \"The film's central motif blends pulsing Moog and spectral voices conjured from Florian Fricke's Mellotron-related \"choir organ\" to achieve something sublime, in the truest sense of the word: it's hard not to find the music's awe-inspiring, overwhelming beauty simultaneously unsettling. The power of the legendary opening sequence of Herzog's film...owes as much to Popol Vuh's music as it does to the director's mise-en-scène.\"\n\nHerzog explained how the choir-like sound was created, \"We used a strange instrument, which we called a 'choir-organ.' It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. ... All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that [it will] sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie.\"\n\nIn 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled \"Aguirre\". Although ostensibly a soundtrack album to Herzog's film, the six-track LP included only two songs (\"Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)\" and \"Aguirre II\") taken from \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\". The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of \"Aguirre\" the band members were Fricke (piano, Mellotron), Fichelscher (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), Djong Yun (vocals), and Robert Eliscu (oboe, pan pipe).\n\nThe film was produced in part by West German television station \"Hessischer Rundfunk\", which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany. However, outside Germany the film became an \"enormous cult favorite\" in \"such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers.\" The film had a theatrical run of fifteen months in Paris. \"Aguirre\" received a theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by New Yorker Films. It immediately became a cult film, and New Yorker Films reported four years after its initial release that it was the only film in its catalog that never went out of circulation.\n\nIn Germany, the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" described the film as \"a colour-drenched, violently physical moving painting\". The \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" described Kinski's acting as \"too theatrical\" to embody God's wrath.\n\nIn the US and the UK the film received mostly positive critical notices upon release. Vincent Canby, writing in \"The New York Times\", called it \"[A]bsolutely stunning ... Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions ... This is a splendid and haunting work.\" In \"Time\", Richard Schickel opined that \"[Herzog] does the audience the honor of allowing it to discover the blindnesses and obsessions, the sober lunacies he quietly lays out on the screen. Well acted, most notably by Klaus Kinski in the title role, gloriously photographed by Thomas Mauch, \"Aguirre\" is, not to put too fine a point on it, a movie that makes a convincing claim to greatness.\" \"Time Out's\" Tony Rayns noted, \"...each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog's flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in oneiric moments.\"\n\nThe film's reputation through the years has continued to grow. J. Hoberman has written that \"Aguirre\" \"is not just a great movie but an essential one ... Herzog's third feature ... is both a landmark film and a magnificent social metaphor.\" Danny Peary wrote, \"To see \"Aguirre\" for the first time is to discover a genuine masterpiece. It is overwhelming, spellbinding; at first dreamlike, and then hallucinatory.\" Roger Ebert has added it to his list of The Great Movies, and in a 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" poll of critics and filmmakers on the best films ever made, Ebert listed it in his top ten. In the same poll, critic Nigel Andrews and director Santosh Sivan also placed it in their top ten list. In 1999, \"Rolling Stone\" included the film on the magazine's \"100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years\" list. \"Aguirre\" was included in \"Time Magazine\"'s \"All Time 100 Best Films\", compiled by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss. Entertainment Weekly named it the 46th greatest cult film ever made. The film was ranked #19 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\n\"Aguirre\" has won several prestigious film awards. In 1973 it won the Deutscher Filmpreis (German Film Award) for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement: Cinematography\". In 1976 it was voted the \"Best Foreign Film\" by the French Syndicate of Film Critics. In 1977 the National Society of Film Critics US gave it their \"Best Cinematography\" Award. It won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association in 1976 and was nominated for a \"Best Film\" César Award.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola's 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\", a film based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella \"Heart of Darkness\", was influenced also by \"Aguirre\", as it contains seemingly deliberate visual \"quotations\" of Herzog's film. Coppola himself has noted, \"\"Aguirre\", with its incredible imagery, was a very strong influence. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.\"\n\nSeveral critics have noted that \"Aguirre\" appears to have had a direct influence on several other films. Martin Rubin has written that \"[a]mong the films strongly influenced by \"Aguirre\" are Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" and Terrence Malick's \"The New World\" (2005)\". J. Hoberman agreed, noting that Herzog's \"sui generis Amazon fever dream\" was \"the influence Malick's over-inflated \"New World\" can't shake.\" Channel 4 opined \"This is an astonishing, deceptively simple, pocket-sized epic whose influence, in terms of both style and narrative, is seen in films as diverse as \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Mission\", \"Predator\", and \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999).\"\n\nAlthough plot details and many of the characters in \"Aguirre\" come directly from Herzog's own imagination, historians have pointed out that the film fairly accurately incorporates some 16th-century events and historical personages into a fictional narrative. \nHerzog's screenplay merged two different expeditions: one led by Gonzalo Pizarro in 1541, which resulted in the discovery of the Amazon river by Francisco de Orellana, and another one that occurred in 1560.\nThe expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro and his men left from the city of Quito and entered the Amazon basin in search of El Dorado. Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by Francisco de Orellana to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found. This group utilized a brigantine to journey down the river. \nAfter failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the Napo River until he reached the estuary of the Amazon in 1542.\nAccompanying Orellana was Gaspar de Carvajal, who kept a journal of the group's experiences.\nThe historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500–1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indians. His general attitude towards the Indians was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas. This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that \"the church was always on the side of the strong.\" \nThe film's major characters, Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Florés, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru's governor, Ursúa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his mixed-race mistress, Doña Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Ursúa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as \"The Prince of Peru\". Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre's scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru. Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered Isla Margarita off the coast of Venezuela and made preparations to attack the mainland. However, by that time Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre's plans, and when the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre's men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Florés, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.\nOther Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story; the conversation in which the Indians refuse a Bible comes from events before the Battle of Cajamarca, in which Inca emperor Atahualpa allegedly rejected the Requerimiento. The chronicle of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, \"La Relación\" (\"The Account\"), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in Hispaniola:\n\nKinski's crazed performance bore similarities to the real Aguirre, a \"true homicidal megalomaniac\". Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman. Kinski's use of a limp reflected one that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre's frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man's noted \"simple but effective rhetorical ability.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "584224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=584224", "title": "Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics", "text": "Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics\n\nArthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics result from his doctrine of the primacy of the Will as the \"thing in itself\", the ground of life and all being; and from his judgment that individuation of the Will is evil. Schopenhauer held that art offers a way for people to temporarily escape the suffering that results from willing. Basing his doctrine on the dual aspect of the world as will and the world as representation, he taught that if consciousness or attention is fully engrossed, absorbed, or occupied with the world as painless representations or images, then there is no consciousness of the world as painful willing. Aesthetic pleasure results from being a spectator of \"the world as representation\" [mental image or idea] without any experience of \"the world as will\" [need, craving, urge]. Art, according to Schopenhauer, also provides essential knowledge of the world’s objects in a way that is more profound than science or everyday experience.\n\nFor Schopenhauer, the Will is an aimless desire to perpetuate itself, the basis of life. Desire engendered by the Will is the source of all the sorrow in the world; each satisfied desire leaves us either with boredom, or with some new desire to take its place. A world in thrall to Will is necessarily a world of suffering. Since the Will is the source of life, and our very bodies are stamped with its image and designed to serve its purpose, the human intellect is, in Schopenhauer's simile, like a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulders of a blind giant.\n\nSchopenhauer's aesthetics is an attempt to break out of the pessimism that naturally comes from this world view. Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished \"aesthetic experiences\" from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image. The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will. Schopenhauer analysed art from its effects, both on the personality of the artist, and the personality of the viewer.\n\nSchopenhauer believed that while all people were in thrall to the Will, the quality and intensity of their subjection differed:\n\nThe aesthetic experience temporarily emancipates the subject from the Will's domination and raises them to a level of pure perception. \"On the occurrence of an aesthetic appreciation, the will thereby vanishes entirely from consciousness.\" Genuine art cannot be created by anyone who merely follows standard artistic rules. A genius is required, that is, a person who creates original art without concern for rules. The personality of the artist was also supposed to be less subject to Will than most: such a person was a Schopenhauerian genius, a person whose exceptional predominance of intellect over Will made them relatively aloof from earthly cares and concerns. The poet living in a garret, the absent-minded professor, Vincent van Gogh struggling with madness, are all (at least in the popular mind) examples of Schopenhauer's geniuses: so fixed on their art that they neglect the \"business of life\" that in Schopenhauer's mind meant only the domination of the evil and painful Will. For Schopenhauer, the relative lack of competence of the artist and the thinker for practical pursuits was no mere stereotype: it was cause and effect.\n\nSchopenhauer believed that what gives arts such as literature and sculpture their value was the extent to which they incorporated pure perceptions. But, being concerned with human forms (at least in Schopenhauer's day) and human emotions, these art forms were inferior to music, which being a direct manifestation of will, was to Schopenhauer's mind the highest form of art. Schopenhauer's philosophy of music was influential in the works of Richard Wagner. Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Schopenhauer, and recommended the reading of Schopenhauer to his friends. His published works on music theory changed over time, and became more aligned with Schopenhauer's thought, over the course of his life. Schopenhauer had stated that music was more important than libretto in opera. Music is, according to Schopenhauer, an immediate expression of will, the basic reality of the experienced world. Libretto is merely a linguistic representation of transient phenomena. Wagner emphasized music over libretto in his later works after reading Schopenhauer's aesthetic doctrine.\n\nIn proposing that art could offer deliverance from the Will, Schopenhauer elevated art from mere artisanry or decoration, and held that art potentially offered temporary deliverance from the aimless strife of the Will in nature. In effect, Schopenhauer turned art into a substitute religion by offering a doctrine of salvation through aesthetic experiences. Artists were not merely skilled hands; they were priests or prophets of this doctrine. This teaching goes far to explain Schopenhauer's appeal to members of the creative communities over the second half of the nineteenth century. His doctrine of aesthetics justified artistic work as a matter of highest importance in human society.\n\nSchopenhauer's aesthetics remain influential today, and are perhaps the most lasting part of his philosophy. Their appeal to later generations of Romantics, and to all schools of bohemianism, is demonstrated. Wagner sent Schopenhauer a note expressing deep gratitude for Schopenhauer's discussion of music. Schopenhauer's philosophy in general left a deep impression on a number of important writers, especially Thomas Hardy, Marcel Proust, Stéphane Mallarmé, Thomas Mann, and Ivan Turgenev.\n\nSchopenhauer's aesthetics were directly responsible for the rise of the Symbolists and their allied movements, and to the general development of the concept of art for art's sake. It deeply influenced the aesthetics of Friedrich Nietzsche, although he ultimately rejected Schopenhauer's conception of Will as evil, whose famous opposition of the Apollonian and Dionysian is a translation of Schopenhauer's opposition of intellect against will in terms of Greek mythology. When the Marxist critique of capitalism was stirred into the aesthetic stew, Schopenhauer's essentially ascetic view of the purpose of art laid the foundation for the opposition of kitsch versus the avant-garde which is found in such critics as Clement Greenberg. Contemporary beliefs that artistic creation should not be swayed by financial gains or the demands of patrons or customers, and the belief that the greatest artists are those who create new and entirely unprecedented forms of expression, rather than those who develop already existing forms, all owe a great deal to the influence of Schopenhauer.\n\nSantayana praised Schopenhauer's doctrine that tragedy benefited audiences because it helped them to deny the will–to–live and to turn away from life. \"He [Schopenhauer] thought tragedy beautiful because it detached us from a\ntroubled world and did not think a troubled world\ngood, as those unspeakable optimists did, because it\nmade such a fine tragedy. It is pleasant to find\nthat among all these philosophers one at least was\na gentleman.\"\n\n\"…things are certainly beautiful to \"behold\", but to \"be\" them is something quite different.\" (\"The World as Will and Representation\", Vol. II, Ch. XLVI)\n\n\"…aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves.\" (\"The World as Will and Representation\", Vol. I, § 68)\n\n\"Perhaps the reason why common objects in \"still life\" seem so transfigured and generally everything \"painted\" appears in a supernatural light is that we then no longer look at things in the flux of time and in the connection of cause and effect …. On the contrary, we are snatched out of that eternal flux of all things and removed into a dead and silent eternity. In its individuality the thing itself was determined by time and by the [causal] conditions of the understanding; here we see this connection abolished and only the \"Platonic Idea\" is left.\" (\"Manuscript Remains\", Vol. I, § 80)\n\n\n"}

It has a deep stratified archaeological sequence of human presence, occupation and hunter-gatherer/herder acculturation dating back 80,000 years. The site's documentation contributed to the reconstruction of palaeo-environments in the context of changes in climate within periods of the Late Pleistocene (12,000 - 80,000 years BP) and the Holocene (since 12,000 years BP). The cave has served multiple functions during its occupation, such as a kraal (enclosure) for animals, a place for the storage of oil rich fruits and as a hunting camp. Circular stone hearths and calcified dung remains of domesticated sheep as well as stone adzes and pottery art (painted stones) were excavated indicating that humans lived at the site and kept animals.\n\nNote: The site is not to be confused with the Blombos Cave and is not situated in the \"Boomplaas region\", Chris Hani District Municipality, Eastern Cape.\n\nThe excavation conducted by H.J. Deacon from 1974 to 1979 was part of an archaeological and palaeo-ecological study (including the Klasies River Caves) to provide information on changes in vegetation and fauna, the cultural sequence and the function of the cave in the area. Together the sequences of the Boomplaas Cave and the Klasies River have established a unique record of the last 125,000 years for the region and southern Africa.\n\nFaunal remains are preserved in all layer that include bone accumulated through human occupation and the bones of rodents, accumulated by owls roosting in the cave when humans were absent. Comparative faunal samples were collected from carnivore lairs (hyena and leopard) in the valley and from other owl roosts and a vegetation survey of the surroundings was undertaken. Records provided a base for the interpretation of charcoal and plant remains and to assess the effects of climate fluctuations on vegetation and animal life.\n\nAnalysis of the artifacts in the Upper Pleistocene sequence suggest that the boundary between the Middle and Later Stone Age traditions is placed here between 30,000 and 40,000 years BP. and that while the Middle Stone Age populations may have been anatomically modern, their behaviour patterns do not show comparable continuity with the ethnographic present.\n\nThe stratigraphy of the deposits is very distinct and clearly visible and is documented in terms of sets of broadly contemporary layers (members), individual layers (units) and parts of layers (sub-units). The members recognised in the Boomplaas sequence are described as follows, from the top to the bottom.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n"}

It has been a Grade II* Listed Building since 1970. It has served as the offices of the High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom since 1925.\n\nThe building which would later become known as Canada House was built between 1824 and 1827 to designs by Sir Robert Smirke, the architect of the British Museum. It was originally two buildings used by the Union Club and the Royal College of Physicians. Under the leadership of High Commissioner Peter Charles Larkin the Canadian government acquired the Union Club in 1923 for the sum of £223,000. It was Larkin's intention to centralise the work of 200 Canadian employees scattered among offices in Victoria Street in one central building. Renovations cost $1.3 million CDN and were supervised by the architect Septimus Warwick, who moved the main entrance from Trafalgar Square to Cockspur Street. The designers imported Canadian furniture, carpets and maple and birch flooring. The exterior was reclad in Portland stone to match the facade of the Royal College of Physicians. The building was officially opened on 29 June 1925 by King George V.\n\nWhen he declared Canada House open, King George said: \"Canada is a great country: alike in the literal sense of vast extent from 'sea to sea' and great in achievement and in promise: and it is right and necessary that its official representatives here should be housed in a manner worthy of the Dominion and adequate to the discharge of their ever-growing and important duties.\"\n\nDuring the London Blitz, a bomb fell near the building, only away from future Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson, who was the secretary to the High Commissioner at the time. Canada increased its presence by acquiring the future Macdonald House, located at 1 Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, in 1961.\n\nIn 1993, Canada House was closed by the Canadian government as a cost-cutting measure with the intention of selling it. A change of government in Canada saw this decision reversed and renovations were planned instead, beginning in 1997. The building was officially reopened by Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, in May 1998. To commemorate the reopening, a detachment from the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, came to London and mounted the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace.\n\nCanada House was closed again in 2010 and re-opened in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee. It was used as Canada Olympic House during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The main work of the High Commission, including consular, public affairs, political, trade and administrative functions was then carried out from Macdonald House in Mayfair. In February 2013 the Government of Canada announced that it would consolidate its diplomatic presence at Canada House and sell off Macdonald House. As part of the plan the building next door to Canada House, known as 2-4 Cockspur Street, was acquired by Canada in 2013 (until this date 2-4 Cockspur Street served as headquarters of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport). The building at 2-4 Cockspur Street was constructed between 1926-29 for Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and had served as the Canadian Army's overseas headquarters in London during World War II. Over the next two years 2-4 Cockspur Street and Canada House were renovated. As part of the renovation, 2-4 Cockspur Street was joined to Canada House in July 2014. In November 2013 Macdonald House was sold, although as part of the transaction the diplomatic staff were permitted to stay until the renovations to Canada House were completed and the diplomatic staff did not move to Canada House until December 2014.\n\nThe Canadian High Commission transferred all of its diplomatic functions to Canada House on 15 December 2014. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh once again officially reopened Canada House on 19 February 2015.\n\nCanada House is the home of the High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom. It hosts consular facilities for Canadians to renew passports or apply for emergency assistance, visa and immigration processing services, a military liaison office, trade officers, political officers and a public affairs section. Canada House is used for special events, hosting conferences, receptions, lectures and lunches. The Canada House Gallery stages exhibitions of historical and contemporary art and artefacts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "324109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324109", "title": "Culture of Korea", "text": "Culture of Korea\n\nThe traditional culture of Korea refers to the shared cultural and historical heritage of Korea and southern Manchuria. As one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world, Koreans have passed down their traditional narratives in a variety of ways. Since the mid-20th century, Korea has been split between the North and South Korean states, resulting today in a number of cultural differences. Before Joseon Dynasty, the practice of Korean shamanism was deeply rooted in the Korean culture. \n\nThere is a distinction between court dance and folk dance. Common court dances are \"jeongjaemu\" (정재무) performed at banquets, and \"ilmu\" (일무), performed at Korean Confucian rituals. \"Jeongjaemu\" is divided into native dances (향악정재, \"hyangak jeongjae\") and forms imported from Central Asia and China (당악정재, \"dangak jeongjae\"). \"Ilmu\" are divided into civil dance (문무, \"munmu\") and military dance (무무, \"mumu\"). Many mask dramas and mask dances are performed in many regional areas of Korea. The traditional clothing is the genja, it is a special kind of dress that women wear on festivals. It is pink with multiple symbols around the neck area.\n\nTraditional choreography of court dances is reflected in many contemporary productions.\n\n\"Taekkyeon\", a traditional Korean martial art, is central to the classic Korean dance. Taekkyeon, being a complete system of integrated movement, found its core techniques adaptable to mask, dance and other traditional artforms of Korea.\n\nThe earliest paintings found on the Korean peninsula are petroglyphs of prehistoric times. With the arrival of Buddhism from India via China, different techniques were introduced. These techniques quickly established themselves as the mainstream techniques, but indigenous techniques still survived. Among them were the Goguryeo tomb murals, these murals inside many of the tombs are an invaluable insight into the ceremonies, warfare, architecture, and daily life of ancient Goguryeo people. Balhae kingdom, an successor state of Goguryeo, absorbed much of traditional Goguryeo elements.\n\nThere is a tendency towards naturalism with subjects such as realistic landscapes, flowers and birds being particularly popular. Ink is the most common material used, and it is painted on mulberry paper or silk.\n\nIn the 18th century indigenous techniques were advanced, particularly in calligraphy and seal engraving.\n\nDuring the Joseon period, new genres of Korean painting flourished, such as \"chaekgeori\" (paintings of books) and \"munjado\" (paintings of letters), revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.\n\nArts are both influenced by tradition and realism. For example, Han’s near-photographic \"Break Time at the Ironworks\" shows muscular men dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering foundry. Jeong Son’s \"Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang\" is a classical Korean landscape of towering cliffs shrouded by mists.\n\nThere is a unique set of handicrafts produced in Korea. Most of the handicrafts are created for a particular everyday use, often giving priority to the practical use rather than aesthetics. Traditionally, metal, wood, fabric, lacquerware, and earthenware were the main materials used, but later glass, leather or paper have sporadically been used.\n\nAncient handicrafts, such as red and black pottery, share similarities with pottery of Chinese cultures along the Yellow River. The relics found of the Bronze Age, however, are distinctive and more elaborate.\n\nMany sophisticated and elaborate handicrafts have been excavated, including gilt crowns, patterned pottery, pots or ornaments. During the Goryeo period the use of bronze was advanced. Brass, that is copper with one third zinc, has been a particularly popular material. The dynasty, however, is most prominently renowned for its use of celadon ware.\n\nDuring the Joseon period, popular handicrafts were made of porcelain and decorated with blue painting. Woodcraft was also advanced during that period. This led to more sophisticated pieces of furniture, including wardrobes, chests, tables or drawers. Korean furniture represents one of the great woodworking and design heritages of Asia and the world. It is part of a craft that goes back well over a millennium, keeping alive a tradition that remains unchanged from at least the seventeenth century. It is this tradition that has made Korean furniture one of the most sought-after styles of exotic furniture by antique dealers and collectors worldwide. Immediately recognizable as Korean, this unique art was only \"discovered\" by the West in the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe use of earthenware on the Korean peninsula goes back to the Neolithic. The history of Korean Ceramics is long and includes both Korean pottery a later development after the traditional use of coils and hammered clay to create early votive and sculptural artifacts. During the Three Kingdoms period, pottery was advanced in Silla. The pottery was fired using a deoxidizing flame, which caused the distinctive blue grey celadon color. The surface was embossed with various geometrical patterns.\n\nIn the Goryeo period, jade green celadon ware became more popular. In the 12th century sophisticated methods of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in different colours. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn McCune states, \"During the twelfth century, the production of ceramic ware reached its highest refinement. Several new varieties appeared simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must be considered a Korean invention.\" Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese had produced inlaid celadon, which was unique to Goryeo wares. William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England, who after World War II wrote, \"The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, they are the most gracious and unaffected pottery ever made. They have every virtue that pottery can have. This Corean pottery, in fact, reached heights hardly attained even by the Chinese.\"\n\nWhite porcelain became popular in the 15th century. It soon overtook celadon ware. White porcelain was commonly painted or decorated with copper.\n\nDuring the Imjin wars in the 16th century, Korean potters were brought back to Japan where they heavily influenced Japanese ceramics.\nMany Japanese pottery families today can trace their art and ancestry to these Korean potters whom the Japanese captured by the thousands during its repeated conquests of the Korean peninsula.\n\nIn the late Joseon period (late 17th century) blue-and-white porcelain became popular. Designs were painted in cobalt blue on white porcelain.\n\nThere is a genre distinction between folk music and court music. Korean folk music is varied and complex in different ways, but all forms maintain a set of rhythms (called 장단; Jangdan) and a loosely defined set of melodic modes. Korean folk musics are Pansori (판소리) performed by one singer and one drummer. Occasionally, there might be dancers and narraters. They have been designated an intangible cultural property in UNESCO's Memory of the world, and Pungmul (풍물) performed by drumming, dancing and singing. Samul Nori is a type of Korean traditional music based on Pungmul, and Sanjo (산조) that is played without a pause in faster tempos. Nongak (농악) means \"farmers' music\".\n\nKorean court music can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Korean court musics include A-ak, Dang-ak and Hyang-ak. Korean music is still played and sung a lot.\n\nKorean traditional houses are called Hanok (Hangul:한옥). Sites of residence are traditionally selected using traditional geomancy. Although geomancy had been a vital part of Korean culture and Korean Shamanism since prehistoric times, geomancy was later re-introduced by China during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea's history.\n\nA house should be built against a hill and face south to receive as much sunlight as possible. This orientation is still preferred in modern Korea. Geomancy also influences the shape of the building, the direction it faces and the material the house is constructed with. \n\nTraditional Korean houses can be structured into an inner wing (안채, \"anchae\") and an outer wing (사랑채, \"sarangchae\"). The individual layout largely depends on the region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the \"sarangchae\". The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 \"kan\". A \"kan\" is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.\n\nThe inner wing normally consisted of a living room, a kitchen and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wing. Floor heating (온돌, \"ondol\") has been used in Korea since prehistoric times. The main building materials are wood, clay, tile, stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.\n\nThe principles of temple gardens and private gardens are the same. Korean gardening in East Asia is influenced by primarily Korean Shamanism and Korean folk religion. Shamanism emphasizes nature and mystery, paying great attention to the details of the layout. In contrast to Japanese and Chinese gardens, which fill a garden with man made elements, traditional Korean gardens avoid artificialities, trying to make a garden \"more natural than nature\".\n\nThe lotus pond is an important feature in the Korean garden. If there is a natural stream, often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure of watching the water. Terraced flower beds are a common feature in traditional Korean gardens.\n\nThe Poseokjeong site near Gyeongju was built in the Silla period. It highlights the importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The garden of Poseokjeong features an abalone-shaped watercourse. During the last days of the Silla kingdom, the king's guests would sit along the watercourse and chat while wine cups were floated during banquets.\n\nThe traditional dress known as \"hanbok\" (한복, 韓服) (known as \"joseonot\" [조선옷] in the DPRK) has been worn since ancient times. The \"hanbok\" consists of a shirt (\"jeogori\") and a skirt (\"chima\").\n\nAccording to social status, Koreans used to dress differently, making clothing an important mark of social rank. Impressive, but sometimes cumbersome, costumes were worn by the ruling class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewellery to distance themselves from the ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant in the shape of certain elements of nature which was made of precious gemstones, to which a tassel of silk was connected.\n\nCommon people were often restricted to undyed plain clothes. This everyday dress underwent relatively few changes during the Joseon period. The basic everyday dress was shared by everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and ceremonial clothes.\n\nDuring the winter people wore cotton-wadded dresses. Fur was also common. Because ordinary people normally wore pure white undyed materials, the people were sometimes referred to as the \"white-clad people\".\n\n\"Hanbok\" are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first birthday (doljanchi), a wedding or a funeral. Special dresses are made for purposes such as shamans, officials.\n\nToday the \"hanbok\" is still worn during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress, however, has been lost. However, elderly still dress in hanbok as well as active estates of the remnant of aristocratic families from the Joseon Dynasty. Though this may be changing with something of a modern interest in the traditional dress among some of the young.\n\nRice is the staple food of Korea. Having been an almost exclusively agricultural country until recently, the essential recipes in Korea are shaped by this experience. The main crops in Korea are rice, barley, beans and Gochujang (hot pepper paste), but many supplementary crops are used. Fish and other seafood are also important because Korea is a peninsula.\n\nFermented recipes were also developed in early times, and often characterize traditional Korean food. These include pickled fish and pickled vegetables. This kind of food provides essential proteins and vitamins during the winter.\n\nA number of dishes have been developed. These can be divided into ceremonial foods and ritual foods. Ceremonial foods are used when a child reaches 100 days, at the first birthday, at a wedding ceremony, and the sixtieth birthday. Ritual foods are used at funerals, at ancestral rites, shaman's offerings and as temple food.\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Temple Food is that it does not use the common five strong-flavoured ingredients of Korean cuisine--(garlic, spring onion, wild rocambole, leek, and ginger), and meat.\n\nKimchi is one of the famous foods of Korea. Kimchi is pickled vegetables which contain vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, iron, calcium, carotene, etc. There are many types of kimchi including cabbage kimchi, spring onion kimchi, cucumber kimchi, radish kimchi, and sesame kimchi.\n\nFor ceremonies and rituals rice cakes are vital. The colouring of the food and the ingredients of the recipes are matched with a balance of yin and yang.\n\nToday, surasang (traditional court cuisine) is available to the whole population. In the past vegetable dishes were essential, but meat consumption has increased. Traditional dishes include \"ssambap\", \"bulgogi\", \"sinseollo\", \"kimchi\", \"bibimbap\", and \"gujeolpan\".\n\nOriginally tea was used for ceremonial purposes or as part of traditional herbal medicine. Some of teas made of fruits, leaves, seeds or roots are enjoyed. Five tastes of tea are distinguished in Korea: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent.\n\nThe traditional Korean calendar was based on the lunisolar calendar. Dates are calculated from Korea's meridian. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture. The Korean lunar calendar is divided into 24 turning points (절기, \"jeolgi\"), each lasting about 15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the agrarian society in the past, but is vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was officially adopted in 1895, but traditional holidays and age reckoning are still based on the old calendar. Older generations still celebrate their birthdays according to the lunar calendar.\n\nThe biggest festival in Korea today is Seollal (the traditional Korean New Year). Other important festivals include Daeboreum (the first full moon), Dano (spring festival), and Chuseok (harvest festival).\n\nThere are also a number of regional festivals, celebrated according to the lunar calendar. See also Public holidays in North Korea and Public holidays in South Korea.\n\nThe original religion of the Korean people was Shamanism, which though not as widespread as in ancient times, still survives to this day. Female shamans or \"mudang\" are often called upon to enlist the help of various spirits to achieve various means.\n\nBuddhism and Confucianism were later introduced to Korea through cultural exchanges with Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, and many privileges were given to Buddhist monks during this period. However, the Joseon period saw the suppression of Buddhism, where Buddhist monks and temples were banned from the cities and confined to the countryside. In its place a strict form of Confucianism, which some see as even more strict than what had ever been adopted by the Chinese, became the official philosophy. Korean Confucianism was epitomized by the seonbi class, scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.\n\nThroughout Korean history and culture, regardless of separation, the traditional beliefs of Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism have remained an underlying influence of the religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture. In fact, all these traditions coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years. They still exist in the more Christian South and in the North, despite pressure from its government.\n\nThere are a number of designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Korea.\n\nThe Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1995 and is located in Seoul. The shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the ancestors of the royal family of the Joseon Dynasty. It is heavily influenced by Korean Confucian tradition. An elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as \"Jongmyo jeryeak\" is performed there each year.\n\nWhen it was built in 1394 it was to be one of the longest buildings in Asia. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in 19 chambers. The shrine was burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars, but rebuilt in 1608.\n\nChangdeokgung is also known as the \"palace of illustrious virtue\". It was built in 1405, burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609. For more than 300 years Changdeokgung was the site of the royal seat. It is located in Seoul.\n\nThe surroundings and the palace itself are well matched. Some of the trees behind the palace are now over 300 years old, besides a preserved tree which is over 1000 years old. Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1997.\n\nBulguksa is also known as the temple of the \"Buddha Land\" and home of the \"Seokguram Grotto\". The temple was constructed in 751 and consists of a great number of halls. There are two pagodas placed in the temple.\n\nThe \"Seokguram\" grotto is a hermitage of the Bulguksa temple. It is a granite sanctuary. In the main chamber a Buddha statue is seated. The temple and the grotto were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.\n\nHaeinsa is a large temple in the South Gyeongsang province. It was originally built in 802 and home to the \"Tripitaka Koreana\" wood blocks, the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the world. The carving of these wood blocks was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The wood blocks are testimony to the pious devotion of king and his people.\n\nThe word \"Tripitaka\" is Sanskrit and stands for three baskets, referring to the Buddhist laws of aesthetics. The \"Tripitaka Koreana\" consists of 81'258 wood blocks and is the largest, oldest, and most complete collection of Buddhist scripts. Amazingly there is no trace of errata or omission on any of the wood blocks. The \"Tripitaka Koreana\" is widely considered as the most beautiful and accurate Buddhist canon carved in Hanja.\n\nThe site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.\n\nHwaseong is the fortification of the city Suwon south of Seoul in South Korea. Its construction was completed in 1796 and it features all the latest features of Korean fortification known at the time. The fortress also contains a magnificent palace used for the King's visit to his father's tomb near the city.\n\nThe fortress covers both flat land and hilly terrain, something rarely seen in East Asia. The walls are 5.52 kilometres long and there are 41 extant facilities along the perimeter. These include four cardinal gates, a floodgate, four secret gates and a beacon tower.\n\nHwaseong was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1997.\n\nNamhansanseong became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014.\n\nThe Sansa are Buddhist mountain monasteries located throughout the southern provinces of the Korean Peninsula. The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property, established from the 7th to 9th centuries, present common characteristics that are specific to Korea – the ‘madang’ (open courtyard) flanked by four buildings (Buddha Hall, pavilion, lecture hall and dormitory). They contain a large number of individually remarkable structures, objects, documents and shrines. These mountain monasteries are sacred places, which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present.\n\nThe Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.\n\nThe sites of \"Gochang\", \"Hwasun\" and \"Ganghwa\" were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. These sites are home to prehistoric graveyards which contain hundreds of different megaliths. These megaliths are gravestones which were created in the 1st century B.C. out of large blocks of rock. Megaliths can be found around the globe, but nowhere in such a concentration as in the sites of Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa.\n\nThe historic area around Gyeongju was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. Gyeongju was the capital of the Silla kingdom. The tombs of the Silla rulers can still be found in the centre of the city. These tombs took the shape of rock chambers buried in an earthen hill, sometimes likened with the pyramids. The area around Gyeongju, in particular on the Namsan mountain, is scattered with hundreds of remains from the Silla period. Poseokjeong is one of the most famous of these sites, but there is a great number of Korean Buddhist art, sculptures, reliefs, pagodas and remains of temples and palaces mostly built in the 7th and 10th century.\n\nThe Complex of Goguryeo Tombs lies in Pyongyang, Pyong'an South Province, and Nampo City, South Hwanghae Province, North Korea. In July 2004 it became the first UNESCO World Heritage site north of the 38th parallel.\n\nThe site consists of 63 individual tombs from the later Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It was founded around northern Korea and Manchuria around 32 BC, and the capital was moved to Pyongyang in 427. This kingdom dominated the region between the 5th and 7th century AD.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46568171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46568171", "title": "Dinosaur erotica", "text": "Dinosaur erotica\n\nDinosaur erotica, part of the larger genre of monster erotica, is a subgenre of erotic literature that involves sexual encounters between humans and dinosaurs. Works include titles such as \"Taken by the T-Rex\", \"Ravished by Triceratops\" and \"A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay\". Despite being called by some in the media \"the Kardashian of erotica,\" the genre's titles have generated sales and media interest. Recently the genre has seen a surge in popularity, which can most likely be attributed to Teknotrans's Instagram account.\n\nWorks of dinosaur erotica tend to be self-published short stories and often focus on common themes such as prehistoric female hunters who save their tribes from threatening (male) dinosaurs by having sex with them. According to Professor Clarissa Smith of the University of Sunderland, who co-edits the journal \"Porn Studies\", dinosaur erotica is essentially an appeal to sexual fantasies: \"The idea of having sex with [a dinosaur] is outside the realms of possibility. It’s a bit like 'magic', where all rules become suspended, and for that reason it may well allow ... for kinds of imaginative risk-taking impossible in more standard couplings.\"\n\nNoted authors of dinosaur erotica include Christie Sims, Alara Branwen, Pippa Pout, Chuck Tingle and Hunter Fox (all pseudonyms). The genre was pioneered by Sims and Branwen, who were at Texas A&M University together when they came up with the idea. Sims' author biography claims that \"while my outward tastes are relatively simple, my inner thoughts are filled with lusty thoughts of big, strong, powerful monsters having their way with beautiful maidens\".\n\nHer co-author Alara Branwen describes their source of inspiration in rather more mundane terms. She was working in a supermarket to help pay her bills when a co-worker mentioned how people were publishing fiction online and suggested that she should try writing erotica. After researching what sold well, she decided to experiment with the subgenre of monster erotica. Her first story, \"Doing the Dragon\" (involving a dragon having sex with a human girl), was a success and she was soon earning so much that she quit her supermarket job and went part-time at her college so that she could focus full-time on writing erotica together with Sims. One day, thinking about the movie \"Jurassic Park\", she \"pictured dinosaurs having their way with women. I died laughing. I was about to dismiss these thoughts as the workings of my freaky mind, but then I had an epiphany. Dinosaur erotica was something new that I’d never tried before.\" Dinosaur erotica is not the only genre tackled by the duo, who also write in other subgenres including \"Dragon Beast Erotica\", \"Centaur Erotica\" and \"Dinosaur Beast Mating Erotica\".\n\nWhile Sims and Branwen's titles focus on heterosexual sex, gay dinosaur erotica also exists. \"The Guardian's\" columnist Damien Walter has published a review of Hunter Fox's short story \"A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay\" by speculative fiction author Phronk. The review comments that the book \"has no intrinsic redeeming qualities. It is horribly written, morally questionable, and even the sex in it seems like an afterthought ... It's the Kardashian of crappy erotica.\" Nonetheless, its mere success gives it meaning and appeal: The title alone is delightful, tapping into deep-seated cynicism about post-\"50-Shades\" erotica and today’s publishing industry. Its unjustifiably high Amazon ranking delights and frustrates traditional authors and self-published authors alike. And the horrid writing only underscores how ridiculous it is that this bizarre artifact even exists.\n\nThe Spaniard author Virginia Lauda was the first writer in Spanish with the trilogy \"Loved by a deinonychus\". Virginia Lauda was the author that introduced the lesbianism between human and dinosaurs.\n"}
{"id": "368361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368361", "title": "Downshifting (lifestyle)", "text": "Downshifting (lifestyle)\n\nThe term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a manual transmission. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a social behavior or trend in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the rat race.\n\nThe long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as economic materialism, as well as reduce the \"stress and psychological expense that may accompany economic materialism\". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved balance between leisure and work, while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.\n\nDown-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with simple living. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living. In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the mainstream media, and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in industrial societies, especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nDown-shifters are people that adopt long-term voluntary simplicity in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint. One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more leisure time in the company of others, especially loved ones. \n\nThe primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from work-and-spend cycle, and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple: To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.\n\nBecause of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum. An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of civic engagement and social interaction.\n\nThe scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society — adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments — are able to downshift.\n\nIn practice, down-shifting involves a variety of behavioral and lifestyle changes. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a temporal dimension, because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.\n\nThe most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment. The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social ideology of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the work–life balance away from the workplace.\n\nEconomically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential income, work hours, and spending levels. Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.\n\nOn an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours. Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned. Simply not working overtime or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.\n\nCareer downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of wealth, a promotion or higher social status. Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts. Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.\n\nMany reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal cost–benefit analysis of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long commutes can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed. If the down-shifter wants more non-material benefits like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.\n\nWork down-shifting may also be a key to considerable health benefits as well as a healthy retirement. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. We can see by looking at The Health and Retirement Study, done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, women can show the long term health benefits of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from middle age till retirement. Men that down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies can be a key to being healthy while in retirement. \n\nAnother aspect of down-shifting is being a conscious consumer or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to consumerism as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an unattainable quantity of material possessions. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.\n\nThis realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less brand-conscious. These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.\n\nUnions, business, and governments could implement more flexible working hours, part-time work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual entrepreneurship and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.\n\nThe catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is \"Slow Down and Green Up\". Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by fossil fuels and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The latent function of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the carbon footprint of the individual down-shifter. An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.\n\nAs a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community. This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.\n\nAlthough downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal overconsumption as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the \"hip-pocket nerve\", proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and economic recessions. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.\n\nAlthough consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent, of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice. Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.\n\nLike downshifters, the Cultural Creatives is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream consumerism and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.\n\nIn his book \"In Praise of Slowness\", Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and simple living to the global Slow Movement.\n\nThe emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society. Downshifting and similar, post-materialist ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their grassroots nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized social movements without political aspirations or motivating grievances.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "91136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91136", "title": "Dying-and-rising deity", "text": "Dying-and-rising deity\n\nA dying-and-rising, death-rebirth, or resurrection deity is a religious motif in which a god or goddess dies and is resurrected. \n\"Death or departure of the gods\" is motif A192 in Stith Thompson's \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" (1932), while \"resurrection of gods\" is motif A193.\n\nExamples of gods who die and later return to life are most often cited from the religions of the Ancient Near East, and traditions influenced by them include Biblical and Greco-Roman mythology and by extension Christianity.\nThe concept of a dying-and-rising god was first proposed in comparative mythology by James Frazer's seminal \"The Golden Bough\" (1890). Frazer associated the motif with fertility rites surrounding the yearly cycle of vegetation. Frazer cited the examples of Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis and Attis, Dionysus and Jesus Christ.\n\nFrazer's interpretation of the category has been critically discussed in 20th-century scholarship, to the conclusion that many examples from the world's mythologies included under \"dying and rising\" should only be considered \"dying\" but not \"rising\", and that the genuine dying-and-rising god is a characteristic feature of Ancient Near Eastern mythologies and the derived mystery cults of Late Antiquity.\n\nThe motif of a dying deity appears within the mythology of diverse cultures – perhaps because attributes of deities were derived from everyday experiences, and the ensuing conflicts often included death.\nThe methods of death vary, \"e.g.\", in the myth of Baldr (whose account was likely first written down the 12th century), he is inadvertently killed by his blind brother Höðr who is tricked into shooting a mistletoe-tipped arrow at him, and his body is then set aflame on a ship as it sails out to sea. Baldr does not come back to life because not all living creatures shed tears for him, and his death then leads to the \"doom of the gods\". \n\nIn contrast, in most variations of his story, Quetzalcoatl (whose story dates to around the first century) is tricked by Tezcatlipoca to over-drink and then burns himself to death out of remorse for his own shameful deeds. Quetzalcoatl does not resurrect and come back to life as himself, but some versions of his story have a flock of birds flying away from his ashes, and in some variants, Quetzalcoatl sails away on the ocean never to return.\n\nHawaiian deities can die and depart the world in a number of ways; \"e.g.\", some gods who were killed on Lanai by Lanikuala departed for the skies. In contrast, Kaili leaves the world by a canoe which is never seen again. The Japanese god Izanami, on the other hand, dies of a fever and Izanagi goes to Yomi, the land of gloom, to retrieve her, but she has already changed to a deteriorated state and Izanagi will not bring her back, and she pursues Izanagi, but he manages to escape.\n\nSome gods who die are also seen as either returning or bring about life in some other form, \noften associated with the vegetation cycle, or a staple food, in effect taking the form of a vegetation deity. Examples include Ishtar and Persephone, who die every year. The yearly death of Ishtar when she goes underground represents the lack of growth, while her return represents the rebirth of the farming cycle. Most scholars hold that although the gods suggested in this motif die, they do not generally return in terms of rising as the same deity, although scholars such as Mettinger contend that in some cases they do.\n\nThe term \"dying god\" is associated with the works of James Frazer, Jane Ellen Harrison, and their fellow Cambridge Ritualists. At the end of the 19th century, in their \"The Golden Bough\" and \"Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion\", Frazer and Harrison argued that all myths are echoes of rituals, and that all rituals have as their primordial purpose the manipulation of natural phenomena.\nEarly in the 20th century, Gerald Massey argued that there are similarities between the Egyptian dying-and-rising god myths and Jesus. However, Massey's historical errors often render his works nonsensical, \"e.g.\", Massey stated that the biblical references to Herod the Great were based on the myth of \"Herrut\" the evil hydra serpent, while the existence of Herod the Great can be well established without reliance on Christian sources. Massey's scholarship has been widely rejected by mainstream academics, including, among many others, Christian Evangelical writers such as Stanley E. Porter.\n\nThe Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung argued that archetypal processes such as death and resurrection were part of the \"trans-personal symbolism\" of the collective unconscious, and could be utilized in the task of psychological integration. He also proposed that the myths of the pagan gods who symbolically died and resurrected foreshadowed Christ's literal/physical death and resurrection. The overall view of Jung regarding religious themes and stories is that they are expressions of events occurring in the unconscious of the individuals - regardless of their historicity. From the symbolic perspective, Jung sees dying and rising gods as an archetypal process resonating with the collective unconscious through which the rising god becomes the greater personality in the Jungian self. In Jung's view, a biblical story such as the resurrection of Jesus (which he saw as a case of dying and rising) may be true or not, but that has no relevance to the psychological analysis of the process, and its impact.\nThe analysis of Osiris permeates the later religious psychology of Carl Jung more than any other element. In 1950 Jung wrote that those who partake in the Osiris myth festival and follow the ritual of his death and the scattering of his body to restart the vegetation cycle as a rebirth \"experience the permanence and continuity of life which outlasts all changes of form\". Jung wrote that Osiris provided the key example of the rebirth process in that initially only the Pharaohs \"had an Osiris\" but later other Egyptians nobles acquired it and eventually it led in the concept of soul for all individuals in Christianity. Jung believed that Christianity itself derived its significance from the archetypal relationship between Osiris and Horus versus God the Father and Jesus, his son. However, Jung also postulated that the rebirth applied to Osiris (the father), and not Horus, the son.\n\nThe general applicability of the death and resurrection of Osiris to the dying-and-rising-god analogy has been criticized, on the grounds that it derived from the harvesting rituals that related the rising and receding waters of the Nile river and the farming cycle. The cutting down of barley and wheat was related to the death of Osiris, while the sprouting of shoots was thought to be based on the power of Osiris to resurrect the farmland. In general rebirth analogies based on the vegetation cycle are viewed as the weakest elements in the death-rebirth analogies.\n\nIn Greek mythology Dionysus, the son of Zeus was a horned child who was torn to pieces by Titans who lured him with toys, then boiled and ate him. Zeus then destroyed the Titans by thunderbolt as a result of their action against Dionysus and from the ashes humans were formed. However, Dionysus' grandmother Rhea managed to put some of his pieces back together (principally from his heart that was spared) and brought him back to life. Scholars such as Barry Powell have suggested Dionysus as an example of resurrection.\n\nThe category \"dying-and-rising-god\" was debated throughout the 20th century, most modern scholars questioning its ubiquity in the world's mythologies.\nBy the end of the 20th century the overall scholarly consensus had emerged against the category, given its limited applicability outside of Ancient Near Eastern religions and derived traditions. \nTryggve Mettinger (who supports the category) states that there is a scholarly consensus that the category is inappropriate from a historical perspective. \nKurt Rudolph in 1986 argued that the oft-made connection between the mystery religions and the idea of dying and rising divinities is defective. Against this view, Mettinger (2001) affirms that many of the gods of the mystery religions do indeed die, descend to the underworld, are lamented and retrieved by a woman and restored to life.\n\nWhile the concept of a \"dying-and-rising god\" has a longer history, it was significantly advocated by Frazer's \"Golden Bough\" (1906–1914). At first received very favourably, the idea was attacked by Roland de Vaux in 1933, and was the subject of controversial debate over the following decades.\nOne of the leading scholars in the deconstruction of Frazer's \"dying-and-rising god\" category was Jonathan Z. Smith, whose 1969 dissertation discusses Frazer's \"Golden Bough\", and who in Mircea Eliade's 1987 \"Encyclopedia of religion\" wrote the \"Dying and rising gods\" entry, where he dismisses the category as \"largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts\", suggesting a more detailed categorisation into \"dying gods\" and \"disappearing gods\", arguing that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who \"died\" did not return, and those who returned never truly \"died\".\nSmith gave a more detailed account of his views specifically on the question of parallels to Christianity in \"Drudgery Divine\" (1990).\nSmith's 1987 article was widely received, and during the 1990s, scholarly consensus seemed to shift towards his rejection of the concept as oversimplified, although it continued to be invoked by scholars writing about Ancient Near Eastern mythology.\nAs of 2009, the \"Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion\" summarizes the current scholarly consensus as ambiguous, with some scholars rejecting Frazer's \"broad universalist category\" preferring to emphasize the differences between the various traditions, while others continue to view the category as applicable. \nGerald O'Collins states that surface-level application of analogous symbolism is a case of parallelomania which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances, long abandoned by mainstream scholars.\n\nBeginning with an overview of the Athenian ritual of growing and withering herb gardens at the Adonis festival, in his book \"The Gardens of Adonis\" Marcel Detienne suggests that rather than being a stand-in for crops in general (and therefore the cycle of death and rebirth), these herbs (and Adonis) were part of a complex of associations in the Greek mind that centered on spices. These associations included seduction, trickery, gourmandizing, and the anxieties of childbirth. From his point of view, Adonis's death is only one datum among the many that must be used to analyze the festival, the myth, and the god.\n\nA main criticism charges the group of analogies with reductionism, insofar as it subsumes a range of disparate myths under a single category and ignores important distinctions. Marcel Detienne argues that it risks making Christianity the standard by which all religion is judged, since death and resurrection are more central to Christianity than many other faiths. Dag Øistein Endsjø, a scholar of religion, points out how a number of those often defined as dying-and-rising-deities, such as a number of figures in ancient Greek religion, actually died as ordinary mortals, only to become gods of various stature after they were resurrected from the dead. Not dying as gods, they thus defy the definition of “dying-and-rising-gods”.\n\nSince the 1990s, Smith's scholarly rejection of the category has been widely embraced by Christian apologists wishing to defend the historicity of Jesus, while scholarly defenses of the concept (or its applicability to mystery religion) have been embraced by the new atheism movement wishing to argue the Christ myth theory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7724855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724855", "title": "Elene", "text": "Elene\n\nElene is a poem in Old English, that is sometimes known as Saint Helena Finds the True Cross. It was translated from a Latin text and is the longest of Cynewulf's four signed poems. It is the fifth of six poems appearing in the Vercelli manuscript, which also contains \"The Fates of the Apostles\", \"Andreas\", \"Soul and Body I\", the \"Homiletic Fragment I\" and \"Dream of the Rood\". The poem is the first English account of the finding of the Holy Cross by Saint Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine. The poem was written by Cynewulf some time between 750 and the tenth century. It is written in a West Saxon dialect, but certain Anglianisms and metrical evidence concerning false rhymes suggest it was written in an Anglian rather than Saxon dialect. It is 1,321 lines long.\n\nCynewulf’s signature, which is always in runes, appears on \"Christ II\", \"Juliana\", \"The Fates of the Apostles\" and \"Elene\". The dialect in his poems suggests that he was either Mercian or Northumbrian. He was probably most active around the late 8th and early 9th centuries, though there is other research to support that he was active between the late 9th and late 10th centuries.\n\nCynewulf’s true identity is still unknown, but there have been efforts to narrow down the list of possible poets. The four most favored candidates are Cynewulf, who was the bishop of Lindisfarne in Northumbria in around 783; Cynulf, a priest (ca. 803); Cynewulf, the father of Bishop Cyuneweard of Wells, who died in 975; and Cenwulf, an abbot of Peterborough Abbey in around 1006). There is not enough evidence to support any of these claims.\n\n\"Elene\" is contained in the \"Vercelli Book\", appearing on fol. 121a-133b.\n\nThe story is loosely based on historical events and takes place within an anachronistic setting that amalgamates wars of the fourth-century involving the Romans, the Huns and the Franks. \"Elene\" fits into a subgenre of \"inventio\", the search for sacrosanct relics of the saints. Cynewulf’s source for the legend of St. Helena's Finding of the Cross was probably the \"Acta Cyriaci\" and a version of it is written in the \"Acta Sanctorum\" for May 4.\n\nThe poem begins with Constantine, emperor of Rome, riding out to battle the Huns and Hrethgoths. He is a mighty king made strong by God, though he is not aware of the Christian God yet. He sees a vision in the sky and he is told that he will halt his enemies with the symbol that is shown to him by the heavens. The battle begins and Constantine reveals the symbol that he was shown, a cross. The cross sends his enemies running in all directions and they are easily defeated by the Romans.\n\nConstantine returns home and addresses an assembly on whether they know the meaning of the symbol that saved his people. Only the wisest know that the cross is the symbol of the Lord in Heaven, Jesus Christ. Constantine is baptized and becomes a devout Christian, due to his experience. He learns from the Bible how and where Christ was killed, so he orders Helen, his mother, to lead an army to the land of the Jews to find where the true cross is buried. She leads an army of men onto a ship and begins the journey to Israel.\n\nOnce in the city of Jerusalem, she calls an assembly of sage Jews and scorns them for having condemned Jesus to death, leaving them wondering what they have done to anger the queen. Judas tells his fellow Jews that he knows the queen searches for the cross. Judas was brought up on Christian teachings, and his brother Stephen was stoned to death for being a Christian. The Jews refuse to help Helen find the cross, so she threatens them with death. Frightened, they hand over Judas. He also refuses to tell her where it is, so she locks him in a dark prison for seven days without food. On the seventh day he cries out that he cannot take the torture any longer and will reveal where the cross is. He leads the queen to the hill where Jesus was crucified.\n\nJudas converts to Christianity in a passionate speech to God acknowledging Jesus as his Savior. God gives Judas a smoke sign in the sky, which convinces him of his new-found belief. He digs and finds three crosses. A crowd forms, but no one knows which of the three was the cross of Christ. They set the crosses up in the city hoping that Christ would show them the truth. A corpse is brought forth, and each cross is held over him. The third cross brings him back to life.\n\nSatan appears in grotesque form angry that he has had a soul stolen from him. Judas cleverly argues with Satan with his new faith, but Satan leaves with a threat that he will raise up a king to retaliate. Helen sends word home to Constantine, who tells her to build a church on the hillside where the crosses were found. She encases the true cross in gold and jewels and places it in the church. Judas is baptized and puts away his false religion. He is appointed to priesthood and is renamed Cyriacus because of his rebirth.\n\nHelen then decides she needs to find the nails that held Christ up on the cross. Cyriacus searches for them, and God again gives him a sign in the form of fire to show where they are buried. Helen receives the gift with tears of joy, and the Holy Spirit fills her with the gift of wisdom and forever protects the saint. She goes to a wise man to find out how she should use the nails, and he advises her to use them in the bit of Constantine’s horse so that he would always be victorious in battle. The epilogue of the poem is devoted to the personal reflection of Cynewulf and his interpretation of Doomsday. Cynewulf tells of how he has experienced a spiritual metamorphosis. His depiction of the Last Judgement resembles a sort of Purgatory where people are divided into three groups, two of which undergo cleansing to reach salvation, while the third is damned to eternal Hell.\n\nHelen is not the typical passive Old English heroine. She is strong and autonomous, more like the women in Old Norse literature rather than the Graeco-Roman saints. Old Norse heroines are strong, assertive, and persuade physically instead of verbally. Cynewulf purposely wanted his audience to view Helen as a strong individual. He does not include her death in the poem as the Latin version does and he does not have her submitting to Constantine and Cyriacus as she does in the Latin version. In fact it is the opposite. We see Cyriacus completely submitting himself to Helen: \"hæfde Ciriacus / eall gefylled swa him seo æðele bebead, / wifes willan\" (line 1129b), \"('Cyriacus had completely done as the noble woman bade him to do, the will of the woman')\".\n\nHelen can be understood as an allegory of the Christian Church and its mission to lead men to salvation through acceptance of the Cross. Literally, her mission is to find the true cross, but allegorically, her mission is to evangelize the Jews. Helen is referred to as a warrior queen and she has an army of warriors, but they never fight. The warriors are there to subjugate a powerful enemy, which could be Satan or non-believers. Judas and Helen are an allegory for the relationship of the Church with its members. Judas’s dialogue reveals him to be of the human condition; he has the capacity for saintliness and wickedness.\n\nAnti-Semitism is a topic of discussion for scholars regarding the poem: Elene’s oppressive tactics towards the Jewish elders are rewarded in the end. A Marxist argument can also be made when looking at how Judas eventually submits to his oppressor. He arises from the pit as a heroic-type figure and it seems the reins of authority Elene exercises only do good in the end. It is contended that this justifies the authority of royalty in Cynewulf’s time.\n\nIn terms of symbolism, the good-bad dichotomy, which is prevalent in Old English verse, finds itself in the oppositions of light and dark imagery in the poem. For instance, it is observed in the poem that Judas spends seven nights in a pit, and the 'darkness' can be seen to convey his obstinacy in refusing to see the 'light' of Christianity.\n\nAlong with alliteration, which is a key part to all Old English poetry, there are also places in the poem where Cynewulf applies rhyme in order to emphasize certain words, such as in the battle scene (50-55a):\n<poem>\n\"Ridon ymb rofne, ðonne rand dynede,\n</poem>\n\"('They rode about the famous one; then the shield dinned, the battle-tarp clanged, the king advanced with a troop, a battalion to the battle. The raven yelled from above, dark and greedy for carrion. The troop was on the march. The horn-bearers ran, the heralds called out, the horse trod the earth\"), In this example, the rhymes emphasize the din of voices and the crash of weapons, which builds excitement throughout the battle scene.\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast to national or international Esperanto organizations, an Esperanto club usually limits its activities only to a certain city or region. Esperanto clubs have been forming the backbone of the Esperanto movement since the beginning of the movement, although recently the situation is starting to change due to the possibility of immediate and first-hand communication that is provided by the Internet.\n\nThe first Esperanto club was founded in Nuremberg on 18 February 1885, before Esperanto was published (1887) – originally it was a group of supporters of Volapük, who in 1888 unanimously converted to Esperanto, under the influence of Leopold Einstein. The Nuremberg club was also the first to start publishing an Esperanto magazine, \"La Esperantisto\".\n\nEsperanto clubs may differ in a variety of ways:\n\nFollowing is a list of Esperanto clubs founded between 1887 and 1895, i.e. during the first nine years of Esperanto's existence (names of the founders are given in brackets):\n\n\nHowever, at the end of 1904, only three of these clubs were still in existence: Uppsala, Saint Petersburg, and Odessa. Other clubs often did not survive more than a year, as it was the case of the group in Reims, which was formed by young students of the local lyceum.\n\n\n"}

Led by dancer/choreographer Melaku Belay, they operate a venue, tour, record, and perform under the name Fendika.\n\nBorn in 1980 in Ethiopia, Melaku Belay lived as an orphan on the streets of Addis Ababa. As a child Belay earned a living shining shoes and taught himself to dance through participation in folk traditions and religious festivals. He worked for seven years as a dancer for tips in Addis Ababa's Kazanchis neighborhood at a local \"azmari bet\"—a tavern that hosts azmari story-songsters who accompany themselves on the masenko (a one-stringed violin) or krar (a type of lyre). Each night after work, the young Melaku slept under the bar and eventually saved enough money to buy the club, Fendika Azmari Bet, from its owners.\n\nWhen not working at the azmari bet, Melaku traveled extensively through Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and South Sudan to learn as many dances as he could from more than 80 tribes around the Horn of Africa, including the traditions of Gurage, Wolaita, Tigray, Wollo, Konso, Gonder, and Gojam, as well as dances from Somali and Afar regions. Melaku also became a nationally celebrated artist in \"eskesta\", a shoulder dance style whose movements share roots with hip hop's traditions of locking and popping.\n\nWith Ethiopia's capital city being a nexus of culture, music, and dance from other nations, Melaku incorporated these into his repertoire as well, gradually assembling a 13-piece ensemble called the Ethiocolor Cultural Band. Combining tribal dances and folk instruments with jazz, rock, theater and elaborate costumes. The group became a staple at Fendika, rooted in the azmari tradition but with amplified versions of its instruments. In 2009 Melaku assembled a smaller group out of the larger Ethiocolor ensemble, featuring three musicians, two dancers, and one singer. With a more portable acoustic sound and azmari folk aesthetic, the group named themselves Fendika in tribute to the establishment from which they originated.\nThrough the Fendika venue's hosting touring artists from all over the world, the ensemble has established an international network enabling them to travel and collaborate with musicians from around the globe. They have toured the United States and eastern Africa with Boston-area Ethiojazz orchestra Debo Band, and in 2010 the two groups released a joint live recording from a concert given at the Sauti za Busara African music festival in Zanzibar. Fendika has also toured throughout Europe with Dutch post-punk band The Ex and released records through the band's label. In 2018 Fendika toured Scandinavia in collaboration with Paal Nilssen-Love’s free jazz orchestra Large Unit before embarking on their first U.S. solo tour, performing as headliners to Ethiopia Fest Chicago and Boston's Global Music Fest.\n\nIn their home city of Addis Ababa, Fendika have collaborated with many of their nation's most well-known musicians, including singer Mahmoud Ahmed, begena player Alemu Aga, and saxophonist Getatchew Mekuria.\n\nFendika often leads workshops in traditional Ethiopian music and dance. The group also supports a school for migrant children which aims to prevent youth homelessness and child labor by providing cultural education for these children and their families. At the azmadi bet, Belay supports a dozen young azmadis with room and board plus stipends to support their work. Fendika has also collaborated with members of The Ex, Instant Composers Pool, and others to bring electronic, punk, and improvised music education to Ethiopia.\n\nIn 2011 Melaku Belay won the Alliance Ethio-Francaise award for dance excellence and in 2015 was named Chevalier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\nIn 2011 Los Angeles rock group the Red Hot Chili Peppers released the song \"Ethiopia\" for their album \"I'm with You\" based on band members' time spent at Fendika. While visiting Ethiopia with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, Peppers' bass player Flea had called up Melaku and asked to play at the venue. Inspired by their experience at Fendika, the musicians returned home and penned the song.\n\nFendika and Ethicolor perform, tour, and record in different configurations with ensembles that vary from 5 to 20 members at any given time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The theory currently prevailing, however, is that Francien was one of the dialects in the dialect continuum on top of which an administrative language, untrammelled by perceived regionalisms, was imposed as a compromise means of communication and record to replace Latin.\n\nThe existence and the definition of Francien was put forward in the 19th century, partly to support the idea of the French language as enjoying a direct and pure lineage from Latin and to minimise the contribution of the various Romance languages of France. Now, the question of Francien is a controversial topic in discussions of language policy in France.\n\n"}
{"id": "3844882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3844882", "title": "Fuck (film)", "text": "Fuck (film)\n\nFuck is a 2005 American documentary film by director Steve Anderson about the word \"fuck\". The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film \"Perversion for Profit\". Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist Sam Donaldson talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian Billy Connolly states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and \"Oxford English Dictionary\" editor Jesse Sheidlower, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.\n\nAnderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word \"fuck\" by comedian George Carlin's monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\". He named the film \"Fuck\" despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator Bill Plympton provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the AFI Film Festival on November 7, 2005, at ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood.\n\n\"Fuck\"'s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic A. O. Scott called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. \"The Washington Post\" and the New York \"Daily News\" criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness – the word \"fuck\" is used 857 times in the film. In his 2009 book \"\", law professor Christopher M. Fairman called the movie \"the most important film using 'fuck'\". The American Film Institute said, \"Ultimately, \"Fuck\" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay.\"\n\n\"Fuck\" begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film \"Perversion for Profit\", followed by a clip from \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" which states that the word can be used as a \"sentence enhancer\". The documentary includes commentary from film and television writers Kevin Smith and Steven Bochco; comedians Janeane Garofalo, Bill Maher, Drew Carey and Billy Connolly; musicians Chuck D, Alanis Morissette and Ice T; political commentators Alan Keyes and Pat Boone; and journalists Michael Medved and Judith Martin. The word \"fuck\" is used 857 times during the film.\nScholarly analysis is provided by \"Maledicta\" publisher Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and \"Oxford English Dictionary\" editor Jesse Sheidlower. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg says, \"You could think of that [word] as standing in for most of the changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones\".\n\nThe film next features author Hunter S. Thompson in his final documented interview. \"Fuck\" later includes archival footage of comedians Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, and analysis of the word's use in popular culture, from \"MASH\" (1970) to \"Scarface\" (1983) and \"Clerks\" (1994). Carlin's 1972 monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\" is excerpted in the film. Journalist Sam Donaldson comments on the versatility of \"fuck\": \"It's one of those all-purpose words.\" Bill Maher comments, \"It's the ultimate bad word\", observing that thanks to Lenny Bruce, comedy clubs have become \"the freest free-speech zone\" in the United States.\n\nConnolly states that \"fuck\" \"sounds exactly like what it is\", noting that the emotional impact of saying \"fuck off\" cannot be translated. He says that if you are in Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling \"fuck off\" will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave. Morissette says, \"The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it.\" Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his surname instead. Radio talk show host Dennis Prager says that it is acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members. In the film, opponents of the word \"fuck\" use an argument commonly known as \"Think of the children\".\n\n\"Fuck\" observes that the original use of the word is unknown to scholars, noting that its earliest written appearance was in the 1475 poem \"Flen flyys\". It was not, as is often claimed, originally an acronym for \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\" or \"Fornication Under Consent of the King\". The word has been used by authors including Robert Burns, D. H. Lawrence (in his 1928 \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\") and James Joyce. The film explains that \"fuck\" established its current usage during the First and Second World Wars, and was used by General George S. Patton in a speech to his forces who were about to enter France.\n\n\"Fuck\" states that the first use of the word in a large-studio film was in \"M*A*S*H\" (1970), and it entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1972. That year, the word was also recorded during the Apollo 16 United States mission to land on the Moon. The film includes a segment from the 1987 film \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" with actor Steve Martin, in which \"fuck\" is repeated for comedic effect. \"Fuck\" states that the most financially successful live action comedy film to date had the suggestive title of \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004). The director analyzes the uses and connotations of \"fuck\" and the feelings it evokes on several levels. Bruce is quoted as saying, \"If you can't say 'fuck', you can't say 'fuck the government'\". Steve Anderson argues that \"fuck\" is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship.\n\n\"Fuck\" includes songs with similarly themed titles, including \"Shut Up and Fuck\" by American hard rock band Betty Blowtorch, \"Fucking Fucking Fuck\" by Splatpattern and \"I Love to Say Fuck\" by American horror punk supergroup Murderdolls. Journalist Sam Peczek of \"Culture Wars\" compared the film's music to that in softcore pornography, and observed that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.\n\nAnderson made his directorial debut in 2003 with the film \"The Big Empty\", starring actors Daryl Hannah and Jon Favreau, and became fascinated by the usage of the word \"fuck\". In an interview with the \"Democrat and Chronicle\", Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production. He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer. Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word \"fuck\" came from \"Class Clown\" by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\".\n\nThe director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word \"fuck\" because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary. \"The Observer\" quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word \"fuck\", and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture. He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.\n\nAnderson explained to the \"Los Angeles Times\" the confusing, forbidden nature of the word \"fuck\" in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it. He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself. In an interview with the \"South China Morning Post\", Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.\n\nThe director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on \"NYPD Blue\", and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.\n\nAnderson stated in an interview with IndieWire that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost. He classified the word \"fuck\" as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech. He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than \"fuck\", but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue. Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty. During production, \"Fuck\" was known as \"The Untitled F-Word Film\".\n\nIn an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film \"Fuck\" instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it \"Fuck\", because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as \"The New York Times\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as \"LA Weekly\". Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.\n\nAnderson explained that although the title of his documentary was \"Fuck\", he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as \"Fuck\", including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep \"Fuck\" as its title.\n\nThe film features animation by American graphic designer and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, \"Fuck\" uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two films in the documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear to be talking to each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nRainstorm Entertainment was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004. The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel, and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi. Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of Spokane, Washington.\nThirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, \"The Big Empty\", and had industry credibility as executive producer of \"Napoleon Dynamite\". Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on \"Fuck\". After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on \"Fuck\", it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.\n\nDistribution rights to \"Fuck\" were obtained by THINKFilm in 2006. Movie chains did not use the film's title in their promotion, instead using references such as \"The Four-Letter Word Film\". Mark Urman, chief of the theatrical division of THINKFilm, told \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" that it was especially difficult (as an independent film distributor) to promote a film with a title media outlets did not wish to print. Urman told \"Variety\" that the intent of the production staff during promotion was a creative, original marketing campaign. THINKFilm marketed the documentary as a comprehensive, humorous look at the dichotomy between the taboo nature and cultural universality of the word \"fuck\".\n\n\"Fuck\" was shown for the first time on November 7, 2005, at the American Film Institute Film Festival at the ArcLight Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. On March 10, 2006, interest increased after the opening night of the 20th South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas. At the 30th Cleveland International Film Festival, it sold out two screenings (which were standing-room only events).\n\n\"Fuck\" was featured on March 31 and April 2, 2006, at the Florida Film Festival. It was screened in April 2006 during the Philadelphia Film Festival at Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia. It had its Washington, D.C. premiere in June 2006, and was shown on June 15 at the Nantucket Film Festival.\n\n\"Fuck\" opened in Los Angeles on August 23, 2006 and in New York on November 10. It made its Canadian debut at the 2006 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, and began regular showings at the Bloor Cinema on December 1. The documentary began screening at the Century Centre Cinema in Chicago on November 17, 2006. \"Fuck\" had two screenings in April 2007 during the Hong Kong International Film Festival in Tsim Sha Tsui. According to a 2011 interview with Anderson in the \"Santa Barbara Independent\", the documentary was shown in about 100 film festivals worldwide and was screened in about 65 cities during its theatrical release.\n\n\"Fuck\" received mixed reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 56% approval rating with an average rating of 5.8/10 based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"A documentary that sets out to explore a lingual taboo but can't escape its own naughty posturing.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted-mean rating from 0–100 based on reviews by film critics, the film has a rating score of 58 based on 23 reviews (a mixed, or average, film). The American Film Institute wrote, \"Ultimately, \"Fuck\" is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay\".\n\nJack Garner of the \"Democrat and Chronicle\" gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, concluding that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite \"Fuck\"s repetitive use of the word. In \"The Boston Globe\" Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of \"Film Threat\" said that the crux of the film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane\". In the \"Chicago Reader\", Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of \"The Miami Herald\", the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.\n\nIn a review for \"The Austin Chronicle\" Marjorie Baumgarten gave the film a rating of 4.5 out of five stars, concluding that it helped unravel myths surrounding the word and describing it as captivating and educational. Steve Schneider reviewed the film for the \"Orlando Weekly\", comparing it to an academic thesis despite its repeated use of off-color humor. Noel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a grade of B-minus, stating that \"Fuck\" succeeded where Kirby Dick's \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" did not, by providing viewpoints from multiple perspectives. Karl French wrote in a review for the \"Financial Times\" that the documentary was unique and reasonably entertaining. Moira MacDonald asked, in a review for \"The Seattle Times\", if viewers could embrace the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and still be leery of the word's omnipresence in society. Mick LaSalle wrote in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that the commentators seemed monotonous and formulaic in debating freedom of speech, and criticized the film's repetition of the word \"fuck\".\n\nPeter Keough reviewed the film for the \"Boston Phoenix\"; giving it a rating of two out of four stars, he also said that the repeated use of \"fuck\" grew tiresome. In a critical review for \"The Observer\" Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality. In a review for \"Empire\" magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded; he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough. In \"Time Out London\" David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship. A critical review by Noah Sanders of \"The Stranger\" concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized. The \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" criticized the film's length, which was echoed by \"The Washington Post\", the \"Deseret News\", \"The Herald\" and the \"New York Daily News\". In a review for the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech. Mike Pinsky of \"DVD Verdict\" concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved by the beginning of the documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.\n\nTHINKFilm reached an agreement to screen the documentary on the American premium cable channel Showtime in 2007, and it aired on the Documentary Channel on May 28, 2011. The DVD for \"Fuck\" was released by THINKFilm on February 13, 2007, and a United Kingdom DVD edition was released in 2009. For the DVDs, THINKFilm remastered the video for \"Fuck\"; it was optimized for home viewing with 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer to a 16:9 anamorphic full-frame presentation and Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 audio.\n\nTrailers for \"Shortbus\", \"Farce of the Penguins\" and \"The Aristocrats\" appear on the DVD before the documentary. Special features include a commentary track by Steve Anderson, interviews with Anderson and Bill Plympton, the film's theatrical trailer, a gallery for the introductory trailers, deleted scenes and interviews with Hunter S. Thompson and Tera Patrick. The disc includes an optional on-screen counter, giving viewers a running total of utterances (and appearances) of the word \"fuck\" during play.\n\n\"Fuck\" has been a resource for several university courses. Christopher M. Fairman discussed the documentary in his article, \"Fuck\", published in February 2007 in the \"Cardozo Law Review\". Fairman cited Anderson's decision to call his film \"Fuck\" and the marketing problems this entailed, saying that he and Anderson both found the title of their works helped spur debate on word taboos in society.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Santa Barbara Independent\", Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students. The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class. Anderson said it was not the use of the word \"fuck\" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a \"Fuck for Forest\" concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy. The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at William Penn High School without previewing it or sending permission slips home to parents. He told the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse. He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent. The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring. An analysis of the incident by the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.\n\n\"Fuck\" was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal \"Communication Teacher\", \"Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth? \"F*ck: A Documentary\" and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom\", by Miriam Sobre-Denton of Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Jana Simonis. Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for communication studies students studying university-level intercultural relations. Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from graduate-level classes in language and culture. Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated taboo words with social forms of power, rebelliousness, professionalism and gender roles.\n\n\n\n"}

They have been linked to intimidation of members of the public by gang members.\n\nEach of the country's gangs has its own forms of insignia, of which the most prominent is often a large symbol, frequently worn by members on their clothing as a symbol of their gang membership. The patch is often seen as being as important to gang members as a military flag is to members of an army group, and any insult to the patch is taken as being an insult to the gang as a whole.\n\nAs such, the term has a more general meaning. Being a \"patched\" member of a gang is to be a fully initiated member of the gang and often a ranking member of the gang's structure. The physical patches are highly valued and have been used with some success in negotiations.\n\nWanganui District Council has banned the wearing of gang patches within parts of their jurisdiction. The ban was tested by judicial review in a hearing before Clifford J in November 2010. The judge reserved his decision.\n\n\n"}

It features a playable faction based on the grey goo scenario.\n\nIn \"Grey Goo\" players can choose one of three playable factions, the Humans, the Beta, or the Goo, and use them to complete a single-player campaign or play in a competitive multiplayer mode versus other players. Each faction features a unique set of units, structures, and play style as well as its own segment of the single-player campaign. The Beta faction relies on speed, mobility, and power to dominate the battle through battle machines and specific units able to mount themselves on \"hard-points\" for defense. The human faction is well-rounded and highly based on reconfiguration of their base. They possess teleportation technology, able to reconfigure their sentinels and other structures and also transport their units to anywhere on the battlefield. The Goo faction features the game's namesake, self replicating nanobots that can move around the map consuming enemies and forming themselves into new units. Due to this, they only rely on pure strength and speed to destroy anything in their way. The game bases itself around \"macro decisions over micro management\" and features a qwert hotkey system for unit control and construction. Also, maps feature terrain obstructing vision similar to games such as \"DotA\" and \"League of Legends\".\n\nThe story takes place 500 years after humans first ventured outside of the solar system. The Beta (or \"Mora\", as they call themselves), a once-spacefaring culture, has fled with the remainder of their civilization to Ecosystem 9 (which they call \"Falkannan\"), the planet the game takes place on, from an unknown threat they call the Silent Ones. During a test firing of the wormhole they meant to use to return to the stars, they are attacked by enemies coming through the portal, or \"Keyhole\". These advanced drone units are first suspected to belong to the Silent Ones but are later revealed to be human in origin. As the conflict between the Beta settlers, led by Aran (Commander) Saruk, and the human forces intensifies, an explosion in orbit scatters wreckage all over their colony, from which the Goo emerge and attack both sides.\n\nAfter a long history of war and exploration in space, during which no intelligent life was found, humans had returned to planet Earth in an attempt to seek peace and stability in a post-scarcity society guided by AI. A signal is detected from the distant planet Ecosystem 9 in the outer Crux Arm, and the starship \"LSV Darwin\", captained by Lucy Tak, is sent to investigate. Landing forces are engaged by the Beta (who are designated as such by the humans because their original planet was the \"beta candidate\" for intelligent life during previous radio telescope surveys, but subsequent investigation did not receive any more signals — likely a consequence of the Silent Ones' attack) and collect samples from the surface, including Goo, which promptly escapes and destroys the \"Darwin\", reaching the Beta colony site in the re-entering wreckage. Despite their initial conflict, the Beta and the now-stranded humans agree to an alliance to destroy the Goo that threatens them, which is revealed to be part of the artificially intelligent \"Pathfinder\" Von Neumann probe system sent from Earth centuries prior to chart the galaxy in advance of the human expansion. The probes were believed to have been decommissioned when exploration was abandoned, but presumably the Goo on Ecosystem 9 somehow altered its own programming, becoming self-directing.\n\nAfter sacrificing himself to destroy what was believed to be the last Goo on the planet, the robotic human commander Singleton's consciousness merges with the Goo. It is revealed that the Goo are attempting not to consume life, but rather to protect it from \"the growing shroud of Silence\" that is expanding across the galaxy — the same unknown force that destroyed the Beta civilization. All previous hostile actions were merely attempts to expand in order to effectively defend the planet. With Singleton's assistance, the Goo fights back from the brink of extinction and carves a path to the Beta's Keyhole device in the hope of contacting and reuniting with the scattered Goo across the galaxy, to stand united against the Silence. Singleton attempts to negotiate with the Humans and Beta, but the Goo is forced to destroy the opposing armies. Defeated, Saruk, Tak and others who were spared watch as countless Goo masses emerge from Keyholes across the planet. In an after-credits scene it is hinted that the \"growing silence\" has discovered Ecosystem 9.\n\n\"Grey Goo\" was originally announced on March 13, 2014, with a release slated for fall 2014. This date was pushed back, and the game was released on January 23, 2015.\n\nThe DLC pack \"Emergence\", containing three new single player missions, was released on June 11, 2015. The missions are centered on the robotic human commander Singleton, and how he became the guiding consciousness of the Goo following the events of the main human campaign.\n\nThe DLC pack \"The Descent of the Shroud\", containing new single player missions, was released on February 1, 2016. The missions are set months after the game finishes, where it introduces a new faction, The Shroud, also called The Silent Ones.\n\n\"Hardcore Gamer\" gave the game a 4 out of 5, stating: \"\"Grey Goo\" is a stand-out RTS that has found an expert way of blending old with new to create something familiar but fresh. Fans of old-school real-time strategy classics such as \"Command & Conquer\" will find much to love here\". HonestGamers gave the game an 8 out of 10, opining it is \"a reinvention of how RTS games used to be, looking back on that time when you’d send harvesters out to collect spice and hoped to hell a sandworm didn't eat the bloody thing, or when you geared up to take on that one bald guy from Nod. Just in this case, the production values have been ramped up, and it hates you just a little bit more\". GameWatcher scored it 8.0, saying that Grey Goo is \"probably Petroglyph’s best game (especially if you’re not a Star Wars fan), it won’t steal the RTS crown from Blizzard or Creative Assembly but if you want a straight fun strategy you won’t regret being absorbed by Grey Goo\".\n"}

Made in conjunction with a line of \"Hanazuki\" toys, it is based on characters and concepts which were developed by Hanneke Metselaar and Niko Stumpo before Hasbro purchased them in 2010. Set in a fictional galaxy comprising countless moons, the series follows Hanazuki, a childlike being called a Moonflower who uses her emotion-based powers to protect her home from being obliterated by a dark force known as the \"Big Bad\".\n\nThe series debuted on YouTube on January 12, 2017, and was produced in conjunction with a line of merchandise to be released later the same year, including a toyline and digital app. The web series received praise from critics, drawing favorable comparisons to other animated series such as \"\" and \"Steven Universe\" for its storytelling, visual aesthetic, and darker undertones. As of May 2017, the series has amassed over 120 million views. It has been renewed for a second season, which will premiere in 2018. A third season and a feature-length film are also in development.\n\n\"Hanazuki\" began airing on Discovery Family on December 1, 2018, marking its American televised debut.\n\nThe series is set in a fictional galaxy of moons that is beset by the \"Big Bad\", a black, inky miasma that drains the life and color of anything it touches. Each moon is protected by a Moonflower, a plantlike child who uses his or her emotional states to activate magical \"treasures\" that are supplied by an infantile being named Little Dreamer, which can then be planted to grow trees that ward off the Big Bad. The series opens with Hanazuki, a newly born Moonflower, arriving on a moon populated by numerous denizens, including colorful rabbit-like creatures called Hemka. Several episodes focus on Hanazuki and her friends' escapades as she learns about her responsibilities and emotions, ending with her growing a colored Treasure Tree that corresponds with her mood in that episode. As the series progresses, Hanazuki encounters other Moonflowers that have failed at saving their own moons and seek to learn from Hanazuki in order to properly harness their powers against the Big Bad.\n\nMoonflowers are childlike beings who are guardians of the galaxy's moons. Created by Little Dreamer, they have white flowers on their heads and highlights that change color depending on their moods, enabling them to grow Treasure Trees that protect their moons from the Big Bad.\n\n\nThe Hemka (or Hemkas) are small, rabbit-like creatures that inhabit Hanazuki's moon. They speak in gibberish that others except Hanazuki can fully understand, and they have malleable bodies that allow them to merge and change into different objects. Each Hemka is of a different color and represents a specific personality trait that Hanazuki reflects.\n\n\nUnicorns in the series are native to Kiyoshi's moon. They possess the same colors and personality traits as the Hemka, with the additional ability to perform magic using their horns. Most unicorns in the series are voiced by Debi Derryberry.\n\n\n\nThe original concept of \"Hanazuki\" was first developed in 2005 as an independent toy line by Norwegian art director Niko Stumpo and his Dutch partner, Hanneke Metselaar, under the self-formed Hanazuki Company in the Netherlands. Hasbro purchased the rights to the \"Hanazuki\" brand in 2010, with The Hanazuki Company being rebranded Thisisarobot. By 2013, \"Hanazuki\" was being developed as an interactive game for children from ages 7 to 12, with a scheduled release date for Fall 2014. A preview of Hanazuki was included in the 2013 United States home media release of Hasbro Studios' \"\". On January 10, 2017, Hasbro announced \"Hanazuki\" as a web series that would premiere on their YouTube channel on January 12.\n\nThe web-series was produced by Titmouse, Inc. for Hasbro Studios, with animation service provided by Inspidea in Malaysia.\n\nA second season was announced on May 9, 2017, and is scheduled to premiere in 2018.\n\nA third season was announced on August 3, 2017 during investor day and will premiere sometime in 2019.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, it was announced that Hasbro was preparing a series of 1- to 2-minute-long shorts that would be released between the first and second seasons. Eight shorts were released on June 16, 2018 in the United Kingdom via the Pop Fun mobile app.\n\nReleased beginning on January 12, 2017 on the property's official website and by Hasbro's official YouTube channel, the first season consists of 27 episodes, with the first 18 released in two sets of nine in accordance with the full moon of the lunar calendar. The remaining nine episodes were released weekly from May 19 to July 14, 2017.\n\nIn Canada, \"Hanazuki: Full of Treasures\" aired as a sneak peek on January 28, 2017 on YTV, Teletoon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel, all operated by Corus Entertainment.\n\nIn the United States, Discovery Family began broadcasting the first season on December 1, 2018.\n\nThe web series was made in conjunction with a line of \"Hanazuki\" toys first announced at the 2017 New York Toy Fair, which will launch in June the same year. A digital app for the series was released for iOS and Android on April 4, 2017, offering a tie-in interactive video game along with episodes of the web series. A companion book authored by Brandon T. Snider, titled \"Hanazuki: Book of Treasures – The Official Guide\", was released on November 7, 2017. A series of four chapter books set within the universe of the web-series was also announced, with the first book written by Stacy Davidowitz, titled \"Hanazuki: A Spark in the Dark\", released on May 8, 2018.\n\nA \"Hanazuki\" short was released theatrically with Hasbro Studio's \"\" on October 6, 2017, the plot of which focuses on Hanazuki as she tries to get a treasure back from the playful Yellow Hemka. During Hasbro's investor day on August 3, 2017, an animated feature based on the series was announced to be in early stages of development, set to be released by Paramount Pictures.\n\n\"Hanazuki: Full of Treasures\" was met with critical praise and online popularity upon release, with several favorably comparing it to the television series \"\" (another Hasbro property) and \"Steven Universe\" for its light-hearted tone, visual aesthetic, and methodical storytelling. As of May 2017, the series has accumulated over 120 million views on YouTube.\n\nIn her review of the web series, Lauren Orsini of \"Forbes\" commented on the involvement of \"Friendship Is Magic\" writer Dave Polsky as a story editor, considering \"Friendship Is Magic\" to be lucrative to Hasbro's success, and concluding that the series was an attempt by the company to incite similar success with \"Hanazuki\". In a later article, Orsini attributed the series' popularity on YouTube to its \"spunky characters and high production values\". Mercedes Milligan of \"Animation Magazine\" said of the series, \"\"Hanazuki\" puts a modern, cross-platform spin on a premise that will be familiar to '80s kids who grew up with Rainbow Brite, et al.\" Ella Anders of BSC Kids praised the opening episodes for its setting, lore, characters, and overarching storytelling. She additionally interpreted the series as a Western magical girl series that \"doesn't play off the traditional magical girl path or tropes\". Nathalie Medina of \"iDigitalTimes\" gave the series a score of 4 out of 5, complimenting the characters and hints of a more complex underlying story, and comparing its visual style to \"a Lisa Frank folder with a 2000s aesthetic\".\n\n"}
{"id": "138848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138848", "title": "History of literature", "text": "History of literature\n\nThe history of literature is the historical development of writings in prose or poetry that attempt to provide entertainment, enlightenment, or instruction to the reader/listener/observer, as well as the development of the literary techniques used in the communication of these pieces. Not all writings constitute literature. Some recorded materials, such as compilations of data (e.g., a check register) are not considered literature, and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above.\n\nLiterature and writing, though connected, are not synonymous. The very first writings from ancient Sumer by any reasonable definition do not constitute literature—the same is true of some of the early Egyptian hieroglyphics or the thousands of logs from ancient Chinese regimes. Scholars have often disagreed concerning when written record-keeping became more like \"literature\" than anything else; the definition is largely subjective.\n\nMoreover, given the significance of distance as a cultural isolator in earlier centuries, the historical development of literature did not occur at an even pace across the world. The problems of creating a uniform global history of literature are compounded by the fact that many texts have been lost over the millennia, either deliberately, by accident, or by the total disappearance of the originating culture. Much has been written, for example, about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria in the 1st century BC, and the innumerable key texts which are believed to have been lost forever to the flames. The deliberate suppression of texts (and often their authors) by organisations of either a spiritual or a temporal nature further shrouds the subject.\n\nCertain primary texts, however, may be isolated which have a qualifying role as literature's first stirrings.\nVery early examples include \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", in its Sumerian version predating 2000 BC, and the \"Egyptian Book of the Dead\" written down in the \"Papyrus of Ani\" in approximately 1250 BC but probably dates from about the 18th century BC.\nAncient Egyptian literature was not included in early studies of the history of literature because the writings of Ancient Egypt were not translated into European languages until the 19th century when the Rosetta stone was deciphered.\n\nMany texts handed down by oral tradition over several centuries before they were fixed in written form are difficult or impossible to date. The core of the Rigveda may date to the mid 2nd millennium BC. The Pentateuch is traditionally dated to the 15th century, although modern scholarship estimates its oldest part to date to the 10th century BC at the earliest.\n\nHomer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" date to the 8th century BC and mark the beginning of Classical Antiquity. They also stand in an oral tradition that stretches back to the late Bronze Age.\n\nIndian śruti texts post-dating the Rigveda (such as the Yajurveda, the Atharvaveda and the Brahmanas), as well as the Hebrew Tanakh and the mystical collection of poems attributed to Lao Tze, the Tao te Ching, date to the Iron Age, but their dating is difficult and controversial. The great Hindu epics were also transmitted orally, likely predating the Maurya period.\n\nThe Classic of Poetry (or Shijing) is the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry, comprising 305 works by anonymous authors dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC.\nThe Chu Ci anthology (or Songs of Chu) is a volume of poems attributed to or considered to be inspired by Qu Yuan's verse writing. Qu Yuan is the first author of verse in China to have his name associated to his work and is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures of Romanticism in Chinese classical literature.\n\nThe first great author on military tactics and strategy was Sun Tzu, whose \"The Art of War\" remains on the shelves of many modern military officers (and its advice has been applied to the corporate world as well). Philosophy developed far differently in China than in Greece—rather than presenting extended dialogues, the \"Analects\" of Confucius and Lao Zi's \"Tao Te Ching\" presented sayings and proverbs more directly and didactically. The \"Zhuangzi\" is composed of a large collection of creative anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables; a masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers and poets for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty to the present.\n\nAmong the earliest Chinese works of narrative history, Zuo Zhuan is a gem of classical Chinese prose. This work and the Shiji or Records of the Grand Historian, were regarded as the ultimate models by many generations of prose stylists in ancient China.\n\nThe books that constitute the Hebrew Bible developed over roughly a millennium. The oldest texts seem to come from the eleventh or tenth centuries BCE, whilst most of the other texts are somewhat later. They are edited works, being collections of various sources intricately and carefully woven together.\n\nThe Old Testament was compiled and edited by various men over a period of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BC. The works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious). Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.”\n\nAncient Greek society placed considerable emphasis upon literature. Many authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\", which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred. Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who defined, in many ways, lyric poetry as a genre.\n\nA playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. In doing so, he essentially invented \"drama\": his \"Oresteia\" trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play \"Oedipus Rex\". Euripedes, conversely, used plays to challenge societal norms and mores—a hallmark of much of Western literature for the next 2,300 years and beyond—and his works such as \"Medea\", \"The Bacchae\" and \"The Trojan Women\" are still notable for their ability to challenge our perceptions of propriety, gender, and war. Aristophanes, a comic playwright, defines and shapes the idea of comedy almost as Aeschylus had shaped tragedy as an art form—Aristophanes' most famous plays include the \"Lysistrata\" and \"The Frogs\".\n\nPhilosophy entered literature in the dialogues of Plato, who converted the give and take of Socratic questioning into written form. Aristotle, Plato's student, wrote dozens of works on many scientific disciplines, but his greatest contribution to literature was likely his \"Poetics\", which lays out his understanding of drama, and thereby establishes the first criteria for literary criticism.\n\nThe New Testament is an unusual collection of texts--John's \"Book of Revelation\", though not the first of its kind, essentially defines apocalypse as a literary genre.\n\nIn many respects, the writers of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire chose to avoid innovation in favor of imitating the great Greek authors. Virgil's \"Aeneid\", in many ways, emulated Homer's \"Iliad\"; Plautus, a comic playwright, followed in the footsteps of Aristophanes; Tacitus' \"Annals\" and \"Germania\" follow essentially the same historical approaches that Thucydides devised (the Christian historian Eusebius does also, although far more influenced by his religion than either Tacitus or Thucydides had been by Greek and Roman polytheism); Ovid and his \"Metamorphoses\" explore the same Greek myths again in new ways. It can be argued, and has been, that the Roman authors, far from being mindless copycats, improved on the genres already established by their Greek predecessors. For example, Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" creates a form which is a clear predecessor of the stream of consciousness genre. What is undeniable is that the Romans, in comparison with the Greeks, innovate relatively few literary styles of their own.\n\nSatire is one of the few Roman additions to literature—Horace was the first to use satire extensively as a tool for argument, and Juvenal made it into a weapon.\n\nAugustine of Hippo and his \"The City of God\" do for religious literature essentially what Plato had done for philosophy, but Augustine's approach was far less conversational and more didactive. His \"Confessions\" is perhaps the first true autobiography, and it gave rise to the genre of confessional literature which is now more popular than ever.\n\nKnowledge traditions in India handed down philosophical gleanings and theological concepts through the two traditions of Shruti and Smriti, meaning \"that which is learnt\" and \"that which is experienced\" - this included the Vedas. It is generally believed that the Puranas are the earliest philosophical writings in Indian history, although linguistic works on Sanskrit existed earlier than 1000 BC. Puranic works such as the Indian epics: Ramayana and \"Mahabharata\", have influenced countless other works, including Balinese Kecak and other performances such as shadow puppetry (wayang), and many European works. Pali literature has an important position in the rise of Buddhism. Classical Sanskrit literature flowers in the Maurya and Gupta periods, roughly spanning the 2nd century BC to the 8th century AD.\n\nAfter the fall of Rome (in roughly 476), many of the literary approaches and styles invented by the Greeks and Romans fell out of favor in Europe. In the millennium or so that intervened between Rome's fall and the Florentine Renaissance, medieval literature focused more and more on faith and faith-related matters, in part because the works written by the Greeks had not been preserved in Europe, and therefore there were few models of classical literature to learn from and move beyond. What little there was became changed and distorted, with new forms beginning to develop from the distortions. Some of these distorted beginnings of new styles can be seen in the literature generally described as Matter of Rome, Matter of France and Matter of Britain.\n\nFollowing Rome's fall, Islam's spread across Asia and Africa brought with it a desire to preserve and build upon the work of the Greeks, especially in literature. Although much had been lost to the ravages of time (and to catastrophe, as in the burning of the Library of Alexandria), many Greek works remained extant: they were preserved and copied carefully by Muslim scribes.\n\nIn Europe Hagiographies, or \"lives of the saints\", are frequent among early medieval texts. The writings of Bede—\"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\"—and others continue the faith-based historical tradition begun by Eusebius in the early 4th century. Playwriting essentially ceased, except for the mystery plays and the passion plays that focused heavily on conveying Christian belief to the common people. Around 400 AD the \"Prudenti Psychomachia\" began the tradition of allegorical tales. Poetry flourished, however, in the hands of the troubadours, whose courtly romances and \"chanson de geste\" amused and entertained the upper classes who were their patrons. Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote works which he claimed were histories of Britain. These were highly fanciful and included stories of Merlin the magician and King Arthur. Epic poetry continued to develop with the addition of the mythologies of Northern Europe: \"Beowulf\" and the Norse sagas have much in common with Homer and Virgil's approaches to war and honor, while poems such as Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" take much different stylistic directions.\n\nIn November 1095 - Pope Urban II preached the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont. The crusades would affect everything in Europe and the Middle East for many years to come and literature would, along with everything else, be transformed by the wars between these two cultures. For instance the image of the knight would take on a different significance. Also the Islamic emphasis on scientific investigation and the preservation of the Greek philosophical writings would eventually affect European literature.\n\nBetween Augustine and \"The Bible\", religious authors had numerous aspects of Christianity that needed further explication and interpretation. Thomas Aquinas, more than any other single person, was able to turn theology into a kind of science, in part because he was heavily influenced by Aristotle, whose works were returning to Europe in the 13th century.\n\nThe most well known fiction from the Islamic world was \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"), which was a compilation of many earlier folk tales told by the Persian Queen Scheherazade. The epic took form in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales were often called \"Arabian Nights\" when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\", in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as \"Arabian Nights\" despite existing in no Arabic manuscript.\n\nThis epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. However, no medieval Arabic source has been traced for Aladdin, which was incorporated into \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\" by its French translator, Antoine Galland, who heard it from an Arab Syrian Christian storyteller from Aleppo. The popularity of the work may in part be due to greater popular knowledge of history and geography since it was written. This meant that the plausibility of great marvels had to be set at a greater distance of time (\"long ago\") and place (\"far away\"). This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in fantasy fiction having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A number of elements from Arabian mythology and Persian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements he felt the genie, dwarf and fairy were stereotypes to avoid.\n\nA number of stories within the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\") also feature science fiction elements. One example is \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In another \"Arabian Nights\" tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other \"Arabian Nights\" tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. \"The City of Brass\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city. \"The Ebony Horse\" features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the \"Third Qalandar's Tale\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. \"The City of Brass\" and \"The Ebony Horse\" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.\n\nDante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", considered the greatest epic of Italian literature, derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter directly or indirectly from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology: the \"Hadith\" and the \"Kitab al-Miraj\" (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as \"Liber Scale Machometi\", \"The Book of Muhammad's Ladder\") concerning Muhammad's ascension to Heaven, and the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi. The Moors also had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William Shakespeare. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\" and Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\", \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"Othello\", which featured a Moorish Othello as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan England at the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nIbn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (\"Philosophus Autodidactus\") as a response to al-Ghazali's \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\", and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a response to Ibn Tufail's \"Philosophus Autodidactus\". Both of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" and Kamil in \"Theologus Autodidactus\") who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in \"Theologus Autodidactus\", developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.\n\n\"Theologus Autodidactus\" deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection, and the afterlife. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology, astronomy, cosmology and geology known in his time. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain Islamic religious teachings in terms of science and philosophy through the use of fiction.\n\nA Latin translation of Ibn Tufail's work, \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger, followed by an English translation by Simon Ockley in 1708, as well as German and Dutch translations. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write \"Robinson Crusoe\", a candidate for the title of \"first novel in English\". \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" also inspired Robert Boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, \"The Aspiring Naturalist\". The story also anticipated Rousseau's \"\" in some ways, and is also similar to Mowgli's story in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" as well as Tarzan's story, in that a baby is abandoned but taken care of and fed by a mother wolf.\n\nAmong other innovations in Arabic literature was Ibn Khaldun's perspective on chronicling past events—by fully rejecting supernatural explanations, Khaldun essentially invented the scientific or sociological approach to history.\n\nFerdowsi's \"Shahnameh\", the national epic of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history. It is the longest epic poem ever written.\n\nFrom Persian culture the book which would, eventually, become the most famous in the west is the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\". The Rubáiyát is a collection of poems by the Persian mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyám (1048–1122). \"Rubaiyat\" means \"quatrains\": verses of four lines.\n\n\"Amir Arsalan\" was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as \"The Heroic Legend of Arslan\".\n\nExamples of early Persian proto-science fiction include Al-Farabi's \"Opinions of the residents of a splendid city\" about a utopian society, Al-Qazwini's futuristic tale of \"Awaj bin Anfaq\" about a man who travelled to Earth from a distant planet, and elements such as the flying carpet.\n\nThe two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and prose. Of the two, divan poetry was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, it should be noted that, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in divan poetry). Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of \"sec\"' (سجع, also transliterated as \"seci\"), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic \"saj'\" and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme.\n\nMedieval Jewish fiction often drew on ancient Jewish legends, and was written in a variety of languages including Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic. Liturgical Jewish poetry in Hebrew flourished in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries with the writings of Yose ben Yose, Yanai, and Eleazar Kalir Later Jewish poets in Spain, Provencal, and Italy wrote both religious and secular poems in Hebrew; particularly prominent poets were the Spanish Jewish poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi. In addition to poetry and fiction, medieval Jewish literature also includes philosophical literature, , ethical (musar) literature, legal (halakhic) literature, and commentaries on the Bible.\n\nEarly Medieval (Gupta period) literature in India sees the flowering of Sanskrit drama, classical Sanskrit poetry and the compilation of the Puranas. Sanskrit declines in the early 2nd millennium, late works such as the \"Kathasaritsagara\" dating to the 11th century, to the benefit of literature composed in Middle Indic vernaculars such as Old Bengali, Old Hindi.\n\nLyric poetry advanced far more in China than in Europe prior to 1000, as multiple new forms developed in the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties: perhaps the greatest poets of this era in Chinese literature were Li Bai and Du Fu.\n\nPrinting began in Tang Dynasty China. A copy of the \"Diamond Sutra\", a key Buddhist text, found sealed in a cave in China in the early 20th century, is the oldest known dated printed book, with a printed date of 868. The method used was block printing.\n\nThe scientist, statesman, and general Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) was the author of the \"Dream Pool Essays\" (1088), a large book of scientific literature that included the oldest description of the magnetized compass. During the Song Dynasty, there was also the enormous historical work of the \"Zizhi Tongjian\", compiled into 294 volumes of 3 million written Chinese characters by the year 1084 AD.\n\nThe true vernacular novel was developed in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD). Some authors feel that China originated the novel form with the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" by Luo Guanzhong (in the 14th century), although others feel that this epic is distinct from the novel in key ways. Fictional novels published during the Ming period include the Water Margin and the Journey to the West, which represent two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.\n\nClassical Japanese literature generally refers to literature produced during the Heian Period, what some would consider a golden era of art and literature. \"The Tale of Genji\" (early 11th century) by Murasaki Shikibu is considered the pre-eminent masterpiece of Heian fiction and an early example of a work of fiction in the form of a novel. It is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, the first romance novel, or the first novel to still be considered a classic.\n\nOther important works of this period include the \"Kokin Wakashū\" (905), a waka-poetry anthology, and \"The Pillow Book\" (990s), the latter written by Murasaki Shikibu's contemporary and rival, Sei Shōnagon, as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the Emperor's court. The \"iroha\" poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese syllabary, was also written during the early part of this period.\n\nThe 10th-century Japanese narrative, \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\", can be considered an early example of proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan. She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration depicts a disc-shaped flying object similar to a flying saucer.\n\nIn this time the imperial court patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Editing anthologies of poetry was a national pastime. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style.\n\nHad nothing occurred to change literature in the 15th century but the Renaissance, the break with medieval approaches would have been clear enough. The 15th century, however, also brought Johann Gutenberg and his invention of the printing press, an innovation (for Europe, at least) that would change literature forever. Texts were no longer precious and expensive to produce—they could be cheaply and rapidly put into the marketplace. Literacy went from the prized possession of the select few to a much broader section of the population (though by no means universal). As a result, much about literature in Europe was radically altered in the two centuries following Gutenberg's unveiling of the printing press in 1455.\n\nWilliam Caxton was the first English printer and published English language texts including \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (a collection of oral tales of the Arthurian Knights which is a forerunner of the novel) and Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\". These are an indication of future directions in literature. With the arrival of the printing press a process begins in which folk yarns and legends are collected within a frame story and then mass published.\n\nIn the Renaissance, the focus on learning for learning's sake causes an outpouring of literature. Petrarch popularized the sonnet as a poetic form; Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\" made romance acceptable in prose as well as poetry; François Rabelais rejuvenates satire with \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\"; Michel de Montaigne single-handedly invented the essay and used it to catalog his life and ideas. Perhaps the most controversial and important work of the time period was a treatise printed in Nuremberg, entitled \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\": in it, the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus removed the Earth from its privileged position in the universe, which had far-reaching effects, not only in science, but in literature and its approach to humanity, hierarchy, and truth.\n\nA new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding which began with the European invasion of the New World in 1492 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present day.\n\nThe form of writing now commonplace across the world—the novel—originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next century. Before the modern novel became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when \"novelty\" began to appear in the style of the epic poem.\n\nPlays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe's stages in the early modern period. William Shakespeare is the most notable of the early modern playwrights, but numerous others made important contributions, including Molière, Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson. From the 16th to the 18th century Commedia dell'arte performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dell'arte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the improvisation were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of jesters and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (\"en travesti\") but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe epic Elizabethan poem \"The Faerie Queene\" by Edmund Spenser was published, in its first part, in 1590 and then in completed form in 1597. \"The Fairie Queen\" marks the transitional period in which \"novelty\" begins to enter into the narrative in the sense of overturning and playing with the flow of events. Theatrical forms known in Spenser's time such as the Masque and the Mummers' Play are incorporated into the poem in ways which \"twist tradition\" and turn it to political propaganda in the service of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe earliest work considered an opera in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597. It is \"Dafne\", (now lost) written by Jacopo Peri for an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the \"Camerata\".\n\n17th century is considered as the greatest era of Spanish and French literature where it is called Siglo de Oro and Grand Siècle respectively. The most famous authors beside playwrights include Jean de La Fontaine and Charles Perrault known primarily for their fables.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\" has been called \"the first novel\" by many literary scholars (or the first of the modern European novels). It was published in two parts. The first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615. It might be viewed as a parody of \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (and other examples of the chivalric romance), in which case the novel form would be the direct result of poking fun at a collection of heroic folk legends. This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the past. It's worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the printing press. Without the invention of mass-produced copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text.\n\nThe new style in English poetry during the 17th century was that of the metaphysical movement. The metaphysical poets were John Donne, George Herbert, Andrew Marvell and others. Metaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of intellectual investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poems. The metaphysical poets were clearly trying to \"understand\" the world around them and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.\n\nIn the middle of the century the king of England was overthrown and a republic declared. In the new regime (which lasted from 1649 to 1653) the arts suffered. In England and the rest of the British Isles Oliver Cromwell's rule temporarily banned all theatre, festivals, jesters, mummers plays and frivolities. The ban was lifted when the monarchy was restored with Charles II. The Drury Lane theatre was favorite of King Charles.\n\nIn contrast to the metaphysical poets was John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", an epic religious poem in blank verse. Milton had been Oliver Cromwell's chief propagandist and suffered when the Restoration came. \"Paradise Lost\" is one of the highest developments of the epic form in poetry immediately preceding the era of the modern prose novel.\n\nAn allegorical novel, \"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come\" was published by John Bunyan in 1678.\n\nOther early novelists include Daniel Defoe (born 1660) and Jonathan Swift (born 1667).\n\nThis is the Age of Enlightenment and its most important authors are Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and Adam Smith. The second half of the century sees the beginnings of Romanticism with Goethe.\n\nIn Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel.\n\nIn Germany, the \"Sturm und Drang\" period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the century. The conservative \"Biedermeier\" style conflicts with the radical \"Vormärz\" in the turbulent period separating the end of the Napoleonic wars from the Revolutions of 1848.\n\nIn Denmark, the early 19th century Golden Age produced prolific literary authors such as Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nIn the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the \"Belle Époque\", with its \"Fin de siècle\" retrospectively appeared as a \"golden age\" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nThe main periods of 20th century literature are captured in the bipartite division, Modernist literature and Postmodern literature, flowering from roughly 1900 to 1940 and 1945 to 1980 respectively, divided, as a rule of thumb, by World War II.\n\nPopular literature develops its own genres such as fantasy and science fiction. Ignored by mainstream literary criticism, these genres develop their own establishments and critical awards, such as the \"Nebula Award\" (since 1965), the \"British Fantasy Award\" (since 1971) or the \"Mythopoeic Awards\" (since 1971).\n\nRelated to other forms of literary history, the history of the book is a field of interdisciplinary enquiry drawing on the methods of bibliography, cultural history, literary criticism, and media theory. Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.\n\nAmong the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.\n\n\n"}

The programme was shown every week on CBBC from 27 September 2001 and 20 December 2001 and starred all seven members of the band as fictionalized versions of themselves. The series also featured former \"Brady Bunch\" actor Barry Williams as Dean Strickland, S Club 7's manager.\n\nFollowing the pattern of the previous series of the show, the show was renamed \"S Club 7 in Hollywood\" for American audiences. It aired on the renamed ABC Family network from 29 September 2001 to 26 January 2002.\n\n\nIn the first episode of the series, the group decide to give themselves 24 hours to get themselves a new manager. The group come across Dean Strickland and he adopts the seven as their new manager. Shortly into the series, the group find themselves without a record deal and so they have to search for a deal, or else they'll disband. Luckily, the group find a record company willing to sign them. Unlike \"Miami 7\" and \"L.A. 7\", which portrays the S Club 7 as struggling just to make known of their existence, \"Hollywood 7\" portrays the group's experiencing what they've been hoping for since they came to the States: having an agent, getting a record deal, becoming publicized, etc. They film their first music video, become a support act for a Latin heart-throb, and even have their first concert. At the end of the series, the group have to move back to England to record their album and start internationally promoting S Club 7, just as they're starting to become fully assimilated into American life.\n\nThe series also saw, mirroring real life, a relationship between Hannah and Paul develop. In the fifth episode of the series, they share a kiss which sends shock waves throughout the band.\n\n\"Hollywood 7\" was released on PAL video on 29 April 2002. Unlike previous releases, it is only available in a \"Complete Boxset\" containing all thirteen episodes. The series was never released in America on NTSC VHS, nor was it ever released on DVD in United States or the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

{"id": "1881556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881556", "title": "Item number", "text": "Item number\n\nIn South Asian cinema, an item number or item song is a musical number inserted into a film that does not have any relevance to the plot. The term is commonly used within Indian (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu) and Nepali films to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie. The main aim of an item number is to entertain movie-goers and to lend support to the marketability of the film by being featured in trailers. They are favoured by filmmakers as they afford the opportunity pick potential hit songs from the stocks, since they do not add to the continuity of the plot. It is thus a vehicle for commercial success which ensures repeat viewing.\n\nA female actor, singer, or dancer, especially someone who is poised to become a star, who appears in an item number is known as an item girl (there are item boys as well). However, second generation South Asian females are more commonly featured in item numbers than males. Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors. Sometimes, established female and male actors will appear in item numbers (a phenomenon billed as a \"special appearance\" by that actor).\n\nAlthough the origin of the term \"item number\" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women. This is because \"item\" in Mumbai film slang is used by Indian men to objectify women. The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics. The item number would feature an item girl who appeared in the film as a dancer, usually in a bar or nightclub, and was only in the film for the duration of that song.\n\nUp to the 1970s, Bollywood often relied on a female \"vamp\" character – usually playing the role of a cabaret dancer, \"tawaif\"/prostitute/courtesan, or male gangster's moll – to provide musical entertainment deemed more risqué. While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics. The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers. The trend was started by Cuckoo in films like \"Awaara\" (1951), \"Aan\" (1952) and \"Shabistan\" (1951).\nItem numbers had been featured in Bollywood from as early as the 30s. Azoorie in the 1930s often performed item numbers; Cuckoo was the next popular item dancer in the late 40s. Her banner year was 1949 when she was featured in over 17 films performing dances. Actress and classical dancer Vyjayanthimala was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film Bahar (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as \"Devdas\" (1955), \"Amrapali\" (1966), \"Madhumati\" (1958), \"Sadhna\" (1958), Sunghursh (1968) etc. \n\nIn the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Burmese-Anglo Helen as a chorus girl. In time Helen would come to be the most popular vamp of the late-50s, 60s and 70s, having had performed in scores of item numbers including such popular songs as \"Mera Naam Chin-Chin Choo\" from the film \"Howrah Bridge\" (1958), \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" from \"Caravan\" (1971), \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" from \"Sholay\" (1975) and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from \"Don \" (1978)The song's tune was also used in Don't Phunk With My Heart, \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" from Teesri Manzil and \"Aa Jaane Jaan\". In films like \"Gunga Jumna\" and \"Zindagi\" the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like \"Tora man bada paapi\" and \"Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje\". A \"desi\" bar number, \"Mungra Mungra\" from \"Inkaar\" was also immensely popular. In addition to her skillful dancing, her anglicised looks too helped further the vamp image. Helen's dominance pushed other vying item number dancers like Madhumati, Bela Bose, Laxmi Chhaya, Jeevankala, Aruna, Sheela R. and Sujata Bakshi into the background and less prestigious and low budget b-movies. \n\nIn the early part of the 1970s actresses Jayshree T., Bindu, Aruna Irani and Padma Khanna entered into what was Helen's monopoly. Another noted feature of this era was the \"tribal and \"banjara\"\" item numbers such as the one in the Dharmendra, Zeenat Aman and Rex Harrison starer \"Shalimar\". Such songs provided the necessary settings for the lead couple's love to bloom.\n\nAround the 1980s the vamp and the heroine merged into one figure and the lead actress had begun to perform the bolder numbers. The craze for \"tribal and \"banjara\"\" item numbers were soon gave way to slick choreography. In the late 1990s, with the proliferation of film songs based television shows, film producers had come to realise that an exceptional way to entice audiences into theaters was by spending excessively on the visualization of songs. Hence regardless of the theme and plot, an elaborate song and dance routine involving spectacularly lavish sets, costumes, special effects, extras and dancers would invariably be featured in a film. It was asserted that this contributed highly to the film's \"repeat value\".\n\nMadhuri Dixit is often considered to be the pioneer of the modern trend. In the late 1980s, the song \"Ek Do Teen\" was added to the movie \"Tezaab\" as an afterthought, but it transformed Dixit and made her a superstar. Her partnership with choreographer Saroj Khan has resulted in numerous hits including the controversial \"Choli ke peeche kya hai\" and \"Dhak Dhak\" (\"Beta\"). Soon after the release of the film \"Khalnayak\", there were press reports stating that people were seeing the film again and again but only for the song \"Choli ke peeche kya hai\" that featured Dixit.\n\nAlthough there have been many songs that fit the descriptions of item numbers in the early and mid-1990s, the term itself was coined when Shilpa Shetty danced for \"Main Aai Hoon UP Bihar Lootne\" in the movie \"Shool\". This is perhaps the first time the media actually referred to Shetty as an \"item girl\" and the scene as an \"item number\".\n\nSince 2000, many top Bollywood stars now do item numbers, and many new women entering Bollywood find item numbers a more amenable shortcut to success, as opposed to more traditional roles with no guarantee of eventual stardom. Former item girls in pop songs outside films, Rakhi Sawant and Meghna Naidu, for example, are now in demand and very popular. Today, they are even being given lead roles in commercially successful movies. As of 2007, Mallika Sherawat had become the most expensive item girl, charging Rs.15 million (roughly US$375,000) for the song \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" in \"Aap Ka Suroor - The Real Love Story\". Another example is actress Urmila Matondkar, one of the most successful item girls during that time. She was featured in \"Chamma Chamma\" in the 1998 film \"China Gate\". Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film musical, \"Moulin Rouge!\" used a westernized version of this song.\n\nMalaika Arora and Yana Gupta are \"official\" item number dancers and have said in interviews that they don't want to act in movies since they already earn more than enough money just by doing one item number as opposed to full-on roles.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan became the first \"item boy\" with his performance in \"Rakht\"; Shahrukh Khan performed an item number of sorts during the opening credits of \"Kaal\" but later had an item number in a truer sense of the word with \"Dard-e-Disco\" in \"Om Shanti Om\", where he was shot in a more typical \"item girl\" manner, with Khan wearing minimal clothing (though this number did have a connection, albeit tenuous, with the plot of the film). In \"Krazzy 4\", Hrithik Roshan has an item number during the end credits. Ranbir Kapoor made his debut in an item number in \"Chillar Party\" (2011); drawing inspiration from Rishi Kapoor's Qawwali song \"Parda\" from \"Amar Akbar Anthony\". In 2005 and 2006 actress Bipasha Basu gave blockbuster hit numbers like No Entry and Beedi Jalaile.\n\nIn the 2007 Telugu film \"Desamuduru\", the song \"Attaantode Ittaantode\" featuring Allu Arjun and Rambha became a chartbuster. In the 2007 film \"Om Shanti Om\", the song \"Deewangi Deewangi\" had guest appearances by over 30 Bollywood stars. In 2008, the makers of \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" featured Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Priety Zinta, and Rani Mukerji playing five leading ladies opposite Shahrukh Khan in the song \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\".\n\nIn 2010, Katrina Kaif featured in \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" from \"Tees Maar Khan\", and Malaika Arora featured in \"Munni Badnaam Hui\" from \"Dabangg\". Parallels were drawn between Katrina and Malaika, as well as between the item numbers, in what was popularly known as the \"Munni vs Sheila\" debate. The songs became so popular, that, soon, more films began incorporating item numbers, and with more top stars now wanting to do them.\n\nIn 2012, Katrina Kaif again featured in an item number \"Chikni Chameli\" sung by Shreya Ghoshal which became a huge hit. In 2013, Deepika Padukone had some success item dancing, performing songs like \"Party On My Mind\" and \"Lovely\". Priyanka Chopra did many songs such as \"Babli Badamash\", \"Pinky\", and an appearance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela song \"Ram Chahe Leela\", of which became a blockbuster upon release. Mahi Gill, Sonakshi Sinha, Hina Khan, and Jacqueline Fernandez made their debut with \"Don't Touch My Body\", \"Thank God It's Friday\", \"Roshni Jawani\" and \"Jadu Ki Jappi\" respectively.\n\nSunny Leone performed her first item dance with \"Shootout At Wadala\" from the 2013 movie \"Laila\", followed up with \"Baby Doll\" from Ragini MMS 2. Varun Dhawan made his debut with \"Palat Tera Hero Idhar Hai\" from the movie Main Tera Hero.\n\nIn 2017, Amanda Rosario featured in the hit item number \"Sarkar\" sung by Rani Hazarika from the movie Udanchhoo.\n\nItem numbers have been criticized for their gratuitous objectification of women. Item numbers have also been imitated in Mumbai's bar dancers. In respect of the ban on bar dancers in Mumbai, it has even been argued that the morality of bar dancer's imitation of item numbers cannot be questioned without questioning the morality of screening of item numbers in a film in public theatres. It has also been argued that the two are equally amoral as both objectify women for commercial gain, with likely negative effects on the male population.\n\nIn 1993, the Bollywood action thriller \"Khalnayak\" was instantly controversial for its item numbers and risqué song lyrics. While the lyrics of \"Choli Ke Peechhe?\" (\"What's behind the blouse?\") were considered vulgar by some, others defended the song on the ground that it was based on folk traditions. The song eventually set off protests all over the country and a potential ban on the song was debated in the Indian Parliament. The anger and commotion, however, only helped the song and the film become more popular, as many went to the movie theater out of curiosity, to watch Madhuri Dixit perform the song.\n\nRecently, the Central Board of Film Certification issued a resolution declaring that item numbers will now be rated as adult content and will be banned from being shown on television channels.\n\n"}

It is the only native horse breed from Honshu, the principal island of Japan. Like most other Japanese native breeds, it is critically endangered.\n\nJapanese native horses are thought to derive from stock brought at several different times from various parts of the Asian mainland; the first such importations took place by the sixth century at the latest. Horses were used for farming – as pack-animals although not for draught power; until the advent of firearms in the later sixteenth century, they were much used for warfare. The horses were not large: remains of some 130 horses have been excavated from battlefields dating to the Kamakura period (1185–1333 AD); they ranged from in withers height.\n\nThe Kiso breed originates from the Kiso Valley and the Kiso Sanmyaku mountain range, in Nagano Prefecture, and the Higashimino region of Gifu Prefecture, in central Honshu. During the Meiji era (1868–1912) it was severely affected by the breeding programme of the Imperial Japanese Army, which wanted taller horses and ordered that all stallions of the breed should be gelded, and that only imported stallions be used to cover Kiso mares. After the Second World War few pure-bred Kiso horses remained. A single stallion, dedicated to a religious shrine, had escaped castration. His son Daisan-haruyama was born in 1951 and is the foundation stallion of the present-day breed.\n\nIn 1899 there were 6823 Kiso horses. Between 1965 and 1976 breed numbers fell from 510 to 32. Registration of the breed began in that year, under the Kiso Pony Conservation Group, which was formed in 1969, and numbers have since slowly recovered. In 2013 the total population was estimated at 150. As a result of this population bottleneck, the effective population size – which has been calculated to be 45.8 – is much lower than the census population.\n\nFour distinct sub-populations within the Kiso breed were identified in 2012.\n\nThe Kiso Uma no Sato, or \"Kiso horse village\", at Kaita Kogen below Mount Kiso Ontake, is a centre for the breeding and conservation of the Kiso breed.\n\nThe Kiso is a small horse, but mid-sized in relation to other Japanese native breeds. Research published in 2011 found an average height of , an average thoracic circumference (girth) of and a cannon bone circumference of . There was little sexual dimorphism: while males were marginally larger than mares, the difference was not significant. The size of the breed has decreased since 1948; this may be due either to inbreeding or to lessening influence of the foreign stallions used before the War.\n\nThe distribution of coat colours in Kiso horses has changed substantially since 1953: in 2011, approximately 93% of those studied were bay or dark bay, and the remainder either chestnut or buckskin dun; in 1953, bay and dark bay made up less than 60%, and there were also small numbers of black, grey and palomino horses. All registered stallions in 2011 were bay. About 66% of the horses studied had a dorsal stripe.\n"}

Its circular shape means that it does not sail well against the current, as it tends to spin, but makes it safe, sturdy and easy to construct. A kuphar is propelled by rowing or poling.\n\nThe word \"kuphar\" is derived from the Arabic word \"\"quffa\" (قفة), meaning a basket woven from reeds and leaves. The boat visually resembles a basket and is used for a similar purpose: transporting fruits, vegetables, and other goods. The Arabic word in turn originated from the Akkadian word \"quppu\"\", meaning basket.\n\nReliefs depicting kuphars have been found in Assyrian ruins dating to the reigns of Kings Ashurnasirpal II (883 to 859 BCE), Sennacherib (705 to 681 BCE), and Ashurbanipal (668 to 627 BCE), who reigned during the 9th, 8th, and 7th centuries BCE, respectively. A translation of a tablet found by an amateur historian places the kuphar's origin even further in the past, in the Old Babylonian period (c.1830–1531 BCE), although this translation is disputed.\nKuphars were described by Greek historian Herodotus, who visited Babylon around 450 BCE:\n\nFive thousand Greek talents would be 143 tons (130 tonnes). This is likely an exaggeration, although carvings of large kuphars carrying cut stones have been found in Assyrian ruins. These large kuphars were propelled by four rowers and relied partially on inflated hide sacks attached port and starboard to stay afloat. More reliable and recent analyses have determined that the largest ancient kuphar measured 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter and could transport up to 16 tons.\n\nThere were two major forms of construction used — hides stretched over a framework, as described by Herodotus, and woven bundles of reeds or basketry, waterproofed with bitumen. Boats of this sort were still used in modern times, being described by British ethnographer James Hornell in \"The Coracles of the Tigris and Euphrates\" (1938).\n\nA Babylonian cuneiform tablet on display at the British Museum suggests that Noah's Ark may have been a large kuphar. This tablet was translated by professor Irving Finkel and found to contain an ancient flood narrative that may have inspired the story of Noah's Ark. Following his translation, professor Finkel organized the construction of a large vessel of this kind, though he claimed that his 35 tonne ship was a scaled-down version of the full-sized ark. Finkel attempted to launch his \"ark\" in Kerala, India, in 2014, but was unsuccessful. He attributed the failed launch of his double-decker vessel to the low quality of bitumen available in the area.\n\nThe tablet describes the flood myth of Atrahasis, a Babylonian hero who built an ark to shelter life from a flood of a divine origin that is thought to have started as a river flood. This ark was, according to the legend described on the tablet, a large kuphar, with either one or two decks, and a total deck area of 14,400 cubits (3600 m). Noah's Ark is traditionally described as having a similar deck plan and a nearly identical deck area of 15,000 cubits (a difference of 4%). This has led Finkel to conclude that \"the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.\"\n\nSome evidence has been found of Neo-Assyrian legends depicting infants being cast adrift in kuphars on the river, similar to how baby Moses was cast adrift in a basket in the Book of Exodus. This has led some scholars to conclude that the basket that Moses was set adrift in on the Nile may have in fact been a kuphar.\n\nKuphars remained in widespread use as water taxis, lighters, fishing boats, and ferries in early 20th century Iraq, especially around Baghdad. These vessels are typically 4.5–10 feet (1.4–3 meters) wide at the opening and have drafts of 2.5–4 feet (0.8–1.2 meters) and freeboards of 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) fully loaded. They typically transport four to five people although they can carry up to 20. Larger kuphars can transport four to five tons, equivalent to three horses, several people, and other assorted cargo. The largest one measured in the 20th century had an opening 16.4 feet (5.0 m) in diameter, although due to the tumblehome nature of the kuphar's hull, its diameter overall was .\nKuphar use declined following the development of the automobile and the widespread construction of roads and bridges across modern Iraq. However, they could still be seen around Iraq until the 1970s.\nModern kuphars are made of woven bundles of reeds waterproofed with bitumen, as in ancient times. James Hornell described them thus:\nTennyson referenced the boats in his 1827 poem \"Persia\",\n\nThe kuphar's similarity to other circular boats has been noted by many authors. This is not a coincidence: Hornell, Marie-Christine De Graeve, and other ethnographers and anthropologists believe that the kuphar is the common ancestor of the coracles that are widely used across Eurasia, particularly in the British Isles and South and Southeast Asia. However, the similar Irish currach was independently developed by the ancient Celts.\n\n"}

Madhavan and produced by D. Ramanaidu. The film script was written by Thuraiyur K. Moorthi, with music by M. S. Viswanathan. The film stars Baby Rani, Major Sundararajan, R. S. Manohar, S. V. Ramadoss and Padmini playing lead, with S. A. Ashokan S. V. Sahasranamam, Thengai Srinivasan and T. K. Bhagavathi in supporting roles. The film \"Kuzhanthaikkaga\" was a remake of the Telugu super hit film \"Papa Kosam\". The film was remade in Hindi as \"Nanha Farista\" and in Malayalam as \"Omanakkunju\".\n\nA great train robbery takes place near Chennai and three robbers Jambu (Major Sundararajan), a Hindu, Joseph (R. S. Manohar) a Christian and Naseer (S. V. Ramadoss) a Muslim steal the jewels of the passengers at gunpoint. They continue stealing from various shops and hotels; their atrocities become the talk of the city. The three enter a rich man Prabhakar's (Krishna) house, kill everybody and steal the money. They see a young and loving child Geetha (Baby Rani) there and Jambu starts to like her. The other two do not show any affection, but Jambu decides to bring her along with him. The Police arrive but by then the three have escaped with the child. The police find that all the robberies and the killings were carried out by the same set of robbers and announce a reward of Rs.10,000 to anyone who can provide a clue to catch them.\n\nAt their hideout, Jambu gets attached to the child, whilst the other two believe the child has come to kill them. But the child, through her loving attitude and respect for their religions, makes the other two also like her. Now, all three believe that the child is God like and give her all the affection they can. Their problem begins when the child does not eat and demands the aaya (maid) to feed her. They try, but the child cries for Aaya Gowri (Padmini). Left with no choice, Jambu travels to bring her. A Police Inspector (S. A. Ashokan) is investigating the case and enquires to Gowri about why she, who usually spent every night with the child, left the child alone that specific night. They suspect that she was hand-in-glove with the robbers and keep her in their custody. Jambu comes to know Gowri's address from the two fellow passengers. He meets Gowri's mother as her brother Manickam, convinces everyone that he is their close relative including the police officers and then takes Gowri with him forcefully, jumps off the train and escapes from the police.\n\nGowri is happy to see the child, but is shaken about being with the robbers who killed her master. She takes care of the child and also cooks and attends to them. She tries to kill them by mixing poison with milk, but they find that out and beat her. She then plans to split them and escape with the child. She tries entice them and Joseph and Naseer fall for it. But Jambu understands her game and puts sense into the other two. Her plan fails again. The three decide that Gowri should be out of the life of the child. So they demand her to behave in a manner that the child shall hate her. She does not agree because she has brought up the child. Jambu gets more attached to the child and it is mutual. He starts believing that the child will live without Gowri and decides to kill her. Gowri overhears this and escapes with the child. However, they soon find out and chase her. The child starts shouting and to make her silent, Gowri shuts her mouth which leads to her wheezing and a heart problem. They catch them and she asks for their help to bring Dr. Ramanathan (T. K. Bhagavathi), who knows the child's health condition. Joseph goes in the disguise of sardar and visits Ramanathan who is at a wedding and convinces him to come with him. The police, who were at the marriage venue find it fishy and follow their car. The police try to shoot and stop them, but Joseph somehow escapes with the doctor.\n\nJoseph and the doctor reach their hideout and Ramanathan understands the dire situation. He attends to the child and stops treating her saying that the child will die anyway. The three beat him, but he refuses to treat the child and says that they will become the reason for the death of the child. The three get emotionally disturbed and beg for his help. He puts up a demand that he will attend to the child only if they agree to surrender to the police for their crimes. The three express their fear of losing the love of the child if they surrender. For this, Ramanathan assures that he will fight for them in the court and also ensure that the child comes and meets them every day. The three agree to surrender and Ramanathan attends to the child. Naseer goes to the city to get medicine. The shopkeeper informs the police and they arrive to catch him, but he manages to escape. Ramanathan treats the child and the three pray for her recovery. Finally, the child recovers and asks for the three uncles instead of Gowri. The three get attached to the child and decide to leave all their wealth behind and move away with her. They get surrounded by a large number of police. The three attack the police courageously. Ramanathan and Gowri manage to escape with the child. Joseph is injured and when they realise that the child has been taken away, they decide to escape somewhere in order to get her back. They manage to escape and hide and police are unable to trace them. Ramanathan convinces the police about the love the three have for the child. The police assure that the child can meet them in jail and also not to shoot them when they surrender. Ramanathan now asks the child to speak in the mike and the child calls for the three uncles. They hear her and surrender to the police. Ramanathan assures to take care of the child and bring her to meet them regularly. The three are arrested by the police and the child follows calling them out.\n\n\n\nThe film become a trend setter for best songs at the national level for Tamil film songs. Though a remake, the film was highly appreciated in Tamil also and ran for over 100 days in addition to earning two national awards.\n\nMusic was by M. S. Viswanathan and lyrics were by Kannadasan. The playback singers consist of T. M. Soundararajan, Sirkazhi Govindarajan, P. B. Srinivas, Tharapuram Soundararajan, A. Veeramani and P. Suseela.\nMusic was by Kalyanji-Anandji and lyrics were by Sahir Ludhianvi. The playback singers consist of Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey, Kishore Kumar, Mahendra Kapoor and Manhar Udhas.\nThe film was first made in Telugu as \"Papa Kosam\"(1968), in Hindi as \"Nannha Farishta\"(1969) and in Malayalam as \"Omanakkunju\". In Hindi, Padmini enacted in the same role. Popular Telugu hero Krishna acted in a guest role in the film.\n\nThe film won the First ever Lyrics Writer of the Best Film Song on National Integration for Kavingnar Kannadasan song \"Devan Vanthan Devan Vanthan Kuzhanthai Vadivilae\". Baby Rani won the National Film Award for Best Child Artist of the year at the National Award for the Tamil version, though she acted even in the Telugu version released in the same year.

She often teamed up with her illustrator husband, Hugh Gray Lieber, to produce works.\n\nLieber was one of four children of Clara and Abraham Rosenberg. Her brothers were Denver publisher Joseph Rosenberg, psychiatrist Aaron Rosanoff, and chemist Martin André Rosanoff. Aaron and Martin changed their names to sound more Russian, less Jewish. Lieber moved to the US with her family in 1891. She received her BA from Barnard College in 1908, her MA from Columbia University in 1911, and her PhD from Clark University in 1914. She married Hugh Gray Lieber in 1926.\n\nAfter teaching at Wells College and the Connecticut College for Women, she joined the mathematics department at Long Island University (LIU) in 1934, became department chair in 1945, and was made a full professor in 1947; she was at LIU and the Galois Institute of Mathematics and Art in Brooklyn, New York until her retirement in 1954. Over her career she published some 17 books, which were written in a unique, free-verse style and illustrated with whimsical line drawings by her husband. Her highly accessible writings were praised by no less than Albert Einstein, C. J. Keyser, E. T. Bell, and S. I. Hayakawa. Concerning her book, \"The Education of T. C. MITS\", Dorothy Canfield Fisher said:\n\n\"This is quite different from any other book you ever bought... full of mathematics and full of humor... also full of a deep, healing philosophy of life, reassuring, strengthening, [and] humane...\" \n\nAlthough Lieber retired from Long Island University in 1954, she continued to write and publish into the 1960s.\n\nFew details of Lillian Lieber's life and career have survived, even at Long Island University. She died in Queens, New York just weeks shy of her 100th birthday. She came from a well-educated Jewish family. Details can be found in the out of print book \"Yesterday\" that was written by her cousin Miriam Shomer Zunser in the 1930s.\n\nIn addition to enlivening her books with illustrations by her husband, Hugh Gray Lieber (who was head of the Department of Fine Arts at Long Island University), Lillian often chose an unusual scheme of typography which is self-explained in this example from her Preface to \"The Education of T. C. MITS\":\n\nThis is not intended to be<br>free verse.<br>Writing each phrase on a separate line<br>facilitates rapid reading,<br>and everyone<br>is in a hurry<br>nowadays.\n\nT.C. MITS was an acronym for \"The Celebrated Man In The Street,\" a character who, like George Gamow's Mr. Tompkins, served as a device for bringing concepts in higher mathematics and physics to the general public. The MITS character was central to Lieber's populist approach to education, and she often laced her expositions with passages extolling the virtues of the democratic system.\n\nIn her book, \"The Einstein Theory of Relativity\", Lillian Lieber stated her views on the inclusion of mathematics in books intended for \"the celebrated man [or woman] in the streets:\"\n\n\"...just enough mathematics to HELP and NOT to HINDER the lay reader... Many 'popular' discussions of Relativity without any math at all have been written, but we doubt whether even the best of these can possibly give to a novice an adequate idea of what it is all about... On the other hand, there are many [books on relativity] that are accessible to experts only.\"\n\nThe Cavendish Press in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has adopted Lillian's rule of thumb with some elaboration.\n\nAlthough her works were broadly influential (including a special paperback edition of \"The Education of T. C. MITS\" that was circulated to American servicemen during World War II), they remained out of print for decades. Starting in 2007, publisher Paul Dry has reissued \"The Education of T.C. MITS\", \"Infinity\", and \"The Einstein Theory of Relativity\".\n\n\n"}

Variously called in English a miner's apron, a miner's after-apron, breech leather or miner's leather apron, it was a leather apron that served to keep the seat of the trousers from wearing out when working or moving around the mine (\"Fahrung\") as well as keeping out the cold and moisture when sitting. It also provided protection especially when entering inclined mineshafts. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a sort of kidney belt. The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the body belt. In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 \"Gesäßleder für den Bergbau (Arschleder)\".\n\nThe mining apron was introduced to German mining regions in the 15th century from the Slovakian mining area around Schemnitz (Banská Štiavnica). Early illustrations of it are found on the title page of the \"Little Mining Book\" (\"Bergbüchlein\") by Ulrich Rülein von Calw (1505) and on the miner's altar of St. Anne's Church in Annaberg (1521). Georgius Agricola wrote in this book \"De re metallica\" (1556):\n\nPermission to wear the miner's apron was only granted to miners and mining officials. Analogous to the hammer and chisel, it represented a unifying symbol of miners' status. Later, it was also worn outside work in decorative styles as part of the miner's uniform (\"Berghabit\") or parade uniform (\"Paradeuniform\") for miners' parades (\"Bergparaden\"). In events connected with mining customs, this device is also used for the so-called \"leather jump\" (\"Ledersprung\"), a form of miners' initiation ceremony in Austria.\n\nThe apron of the miner is incorporated into the design of the wooden smoking figurines and nutcrackers made in the Ore Mountains. It has also made its way into the mining songs. Thus we read in the last stanza of the version of the mine foremen's song (\"Steigerlied\") sung in the Ruhr and Saar: \n\nIn stunt kite flying the leather apron is used especially in power kiting or kite surfing using powered kites. The pilot sits on a leather apron that protects the seat of his trousers and is hauled by the kite over rough ground (e.g., pastureland).\n\n\n\n"}

They acted as a form of cooperative, using their influence to assure their economic survival and obtain commissions. In 1901, the association split again when some dissatisfied members formed the group Phalanx. Another split occurred in 1913, with the founding of the \"New Munich Secession\".\n\nBy the end of the Nineteenth Century, more artists lived in Munich than lived in Vienna and Berlin put together. However, the art community there was dominated by the conservative attitudes of the Munich Artists' Association and its supporters in the government. These attitudes found expression in the official \"mission statements\", written by the so-called \"Prince of Painters\" (Malerfürst) Franz von Lenbach. Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent Luitpold of Bavaria founded the \"Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur Förderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in München\", an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional history painting in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the Academy of Fine Arts, but was firmly opposed to impressionism, expressionism, symbolism and other contemporary trends in the art world.\n\nAnother factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the Glaspalast, organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.\n\nTo address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public.\n\nIn this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.\n\nOn April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the \"Association of Visual Artists of Munich\". Bruno Piglhein was elected the first President and Paul Hoecker became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: \"Munich Secession\".\n\nFinancial support initially came from three sources: Georg Hirth, a writer and journalist who coined the word \"secession\" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the Art-Nouveau magazine \"Jugend\" ; Georg von Vollmar, editor of the Democratic Socialist party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies.\n\nThat same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the \"\", composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The Vienna Secession followed five years later, and the Berlin Secession was established in 1898.\n\nAt first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 Gold Marks, if the group would move there permanently. Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's \"National Exhibition Building\" (now known as \"ULAP\") early in 1893.\n\nBaurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of Prinzregentenstraße and Pilotystraße. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists.\n\nThe success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the Königsplatz (now the Staatliche Antikensammlungen) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.\n\nIn 1933, the National Socialist party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as Gleichschaltung (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered \"degenerate\" were not allowed to paint. In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the \"Kulturellen Säuberung\" (cultural cleansing) process.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1946, the \"\" and the \"Neue Münchner Künstlergenossenschaft\" (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the \"Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler\" (Federal Association of Visual Artists).\n\nIn 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the \"Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession\" was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the \"Secessionsgalerie\" and promote exhibitions.\n\n\n"}

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother.\n\nVan Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel \"City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the \"Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After Van Sant sent copies of his script to Reeves and then Reeves showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.\n\n\"My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of \"The New York Times\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over $6.4 million in North America, which was above its estimated budget of $2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics.\n\n\"My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among queer audiences. Notably for its then-taboo subject matter and avant-garde style.\n\nMike, a street hustler, is standing alone on a deserted stretch of highway. He starts talking to himself and notices that the road looks \"like someone’s face, like a fucked-up face.\" He experiences a narcoleptic episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as he replays home movies of his childhood in his mind.\n\nLater, after being fellated by a client in Seattle, Mike returns to his favorite spots to pick up potential clients. He is picked up by a wealthy older woman who takes him to her mansion where he meets two fellow hustlers also hired by the woman. One of them is Scott Favor, Mike's best friend, and the other is Gary. While preparing to have sex with the woman, Mike experiences another narcoleptic fit and awakens the next day with Scott in Portland, Oregon.\n\nMike and Scott are soon reunited with Bob Pigeon, a middle-aged mentor to a gang of street kids and hustlers who live in an abandoned apartment building. Scott, the son of the mayor of Portland, admits to Bob in private that when he turns 21, he will inherit his father's fortune and retire from street hustling. Mike yearns to find his mother, and he and Scott leave Portland for Idaho to visit Mike's older brother Richard, who lives in a run-down trailer. Along this journey Mike confesses that he is in love with Scott, who gently reminds Mike he only has sex with men for money and that he does not believe two men can love each other. Richard tries to tell Mike who his real father is, but Mike says that he knows it is Richard. Richard tells Mike that their mother works as a hotel maid; when Mike and Scott visit the hotel, they find she has gone to Italy in search of her own family. At the hotel, they meet Hans, the man who drove them to Portland. Mike and Scott prostitute themselves to Hans, and the three sleep together.\n\nWith the money they received from Hans, Mike and Scott travel to Italy. They find the country farmhouse where Mike's mother worked as a maid and as an English tutor. The young woman, Carmella, who lives there, tells Mike that his mother returned to the United States months ago. Carmella and Scott fall in love and return to the U.S., leaving Mike to return home on his own, brokenhearted. Scott's father dies, and Scott inherits his fortune.\n\nBack in Portland, Bob and his gang confront a newly reformed Scott at a fashionable restaurant, but he rejects them. That night Bob has a fatal heart attack. The next day the hustlers hold a rowdy funeral for Bob, while in the same cemetery, a few yards away, Scott attends a solemn funeral for his father. Mike is back on the deserted stretch of the Idaho highway. After his falling into another narcoleptic stupor, two strangers pull up in a truck, take his backpack and shoes, and drive away. Moments later, an unidentified figure pulls up in a car, picks the unconscious Mike up, places him in the vehicle and drives away.\n\nThe origins of \"My Own Private Idaho\" came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, \"City of Night\", which featured characters who were street hustlers who did not admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay was written in the 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing \"Mala Noche\", Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become \"My Own Private Idaho\". Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.\n\nEarly drafts of the screenplay were set on Hollywood Boulevard, not Portland, with working titles such as \"Blue Funk\" and \"Minions of the Moon\". Reading Rechy's novel had convinced Van Sant to change the setting to Portland. The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first was called \"Modern Days\" and it recounted Mike's story; a second one updated the \"Henry IV\" plays with Scott's story. Van Sant realized that he could blend the two stories together in the manner of the \"cut up\" technique used by writer William S. Burroughs. In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sant's mind after watching Orson Welles' \"Chimes at Midnight\". The director remembers, \"I thought that the \"Henry IV\" plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys\". Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled the character of Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up becoming a literal restructuring of the \"Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always looked like he was about to fall asleep. The film's title is derived from the song \"Private Idaho\" by the B-52's that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.\n\nVan Sant showed the script to an executive at 20th Century Fox who liked Shakespeare. Eventually, he toned down the Shakespeare and made the language more modern. Van Sant was also working on a short story called \"My Own Private Idaho\" which he intended to film. It was 25 pages long and was about two Latino characters on the streets of Portland who go in search of their parents and travel to a town in Spain. One of them falls in love with a girl and leaves the other behind. Van Sant had another script called \"The Boys of Storytown\", which had the Mike and Scott characters and Mike had narcolepsy. The characters of Hans and Bob were also present. Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt that the script was not finished. While editing \"Drugstore Cowboy\", Van Sant combined the scripts for \"Modern Days\" and \"Storytown\" with the \"Idaho\" short story.\n\nInitially, no studio would finance the film because of its potentially controversial and off-beat subject matter. After \"Drugstore Cowboy\" received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who was going to play Scott.\nVan Sant faced the problem of casting the two central roles. He decided to send the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, figuring that their agents would reject the script. Reeves' agent was amenable to the project, but Phoenix's agent would not even show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant got the idea for Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's \"I Love You to Death\" and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's \"Parenthood\". After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed to play the role of Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing. Van Sant got an offer of $2 million from an outside investor but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make \"Dogfight\", the investor and his money disappeared. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, New Line Cinema was in the process of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a US$2.5 million budget. In an interview in March 2012, Kiefer Sutherland said that he declined the offer by Gus Van Sant to star in the lead role because he wanted to go skiing, a decision he has said he regrets.\n\nPrincipal photography took place from November to December 1990, primarily in Portland, Seattle and Rome. Scenes of the Idaho road depicted in the film were shot near Maupin, Oregon on Oregon Route 216. Phoenix arrived in Portland two weeks before principal photography was to begin in order to do research and Van Sant remembered, \"He seemed to be changing into this character\". One of the film's directors of photography Eric Alan Edwards recalled that the actor looked like a street kid\", and \"in a very raw way he wore that role. I've never seen anybody so intent on living his role\". Several cast and crew members, including Michael Parker, Phoenix, Reeves and Flea lived together in a house in Portland during filming. A couple of times a week they would play music together. Due to the low budget, a typical day of shooting started at 6 am and ended at 11 pm.\n\nThe film was not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. The camp fire scene was originally a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes his love for Scott so that it was more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, \"I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would never do that on film. We did a little of it in \"Idaho\" and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again\".\n\nEric Edwards shot the time-lapse photography shots on his own. They were not in the script and the film's producer was worried that he was using up too much film. Van Sant originally had the screen go black when Mike passed out but was not satisfied with this approach. He used Edwards' footage as a way of \"an altered sense of time\" from Mike's perspective. Some executives at New Line were not in favor of the Shakespeare scenes and wanted Van Sant to cut them all out. However, foreign distributors wanted as much Shakespeare in the film as possible.\n\nThe film's score was composed by pedal steel guitarist Bill Stafford, he recorded various arrangements for the film including instrumental adaptations of \"Home on the Range\" and \"America the Beautiful\". Stafford won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Film Music in 1992 for his score. Other original and selected songs from various artists were also featured in the film, including:\n\n\"My Own Private Idaho\" was first premiered at the 48th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 1991. It also received screenings at the 17th Deauville Film Festival, 16th Toronto International Film Festival and the 29th New York Film Festival. The film was released in limited theaters in the United States on September 29, 1991. It grossed US$6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of $2.5 million.\n\nVan Sant's film achieved critical acclaim. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"The achievement of this film is that it wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does. There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass.\"\nIn his review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Peter Travers wrote, \"Van Sant's cleareyed, unsentimental approach to a plot that pivots on betrayal and death is reflected in magnetic performances from Reeves and Phoenix.\" Vincent Canby, in his \"New York Times\" review, praised the lead actors: \"The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure. Mr. Phoenix (\"Dogfight\") and Mr. Reeves (of the two \"Bill and Ted\" comedies) are very fine in what may be the two best roles they'll find in years. Roles of this density, for young actors, do not come by that often\".\nIn his review for \"Newsweek\", David Ansen praised Phoenix's performance: \"The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film an \"A−\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"When Van Sant shows us speeded-up images of clouds rolling past wheat fields, the familiar device transcends cliche, because it's tied to the way that Mike, in his benumbed isolation, experiences his own life – as a running piece of surrealism. The sheer, expressive beauty of those images haunted me for days.\" J. Hoberman, in his review for \"The Village Voice\", wrote, \"While Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role, Reeves stands, or occasionally struts, uneasily beside his, unable to project even the self-mocking wit of Matt Dillon's star turn in \"Drugstore Cowboy\".\" Hal Hinson from \"The Washington Post\" wrote \"Gus Van Sant's sensibility is wholly original, wholly fresh. My Own Private Idaho adds a new ingredient: a kind of boho sweetness. I loved it.\"\n\nHowever, \"USA Today\" gave \"My Own Private Idaho\" two and half stars out of four, criticizing Van Sant's film for being \"nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private\".\n\"Time\" magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, \"What plot it has is borrowed, improbably, from \"Henry IV\", and whenever anyone manages to speak an entire paragraph, it is usually a Shakespearean paraphrase. But this is a desperate imposition on an essentially inert film.\"\nIn his review for \"The New Yorker\", Terrence Rafferty wrote, \"Van Sant has stranded the actor in a movie full of flat characters and bad ideas, but Phoenix walks through the picture, down the road after road after road, as if he were surrounded by glorious phantoms.\"\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A tantalizing glimpse of a talented director and his stars all at the top of their respective games, Gus Van Sant's loose reworking of Henry IV is smart, sad and audacious.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"My Own Private Idaho\" received the Showtime International Critics Award at the 1991 Toronto Film Festival. River Phoenix received the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. The actor said, in regards to winning, \"I don't want more awards. Venice is the most progressive festival. Anything else would be a token\". Phoenix then went on to receive Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. With 6 nominations at the 7th Independent Spirit Awards, it tied with \"Hangin' with the Homeboys\" for the most nominations during that ceremony. Winning 3, it tied with \"Rambling Rose\" for the most awards.\n\nIn 2005, the film was remastered by The Criterion Collection and released on a two-disc DVD set. The second disc features new interviews, outtakes and more information about the movie. This DVD set is accompanied by an illustrated 64-page-booklet featuring previously published articles and interviews with cast and crew and new essays by JT LeRoy and Amy Taubin, a 1991 article by Lance Loud and reprinted interviews with Van Sant, River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the DVD a \"B+\" rating and wrote, \"While you may enjoy watching \"My Own Private Idaho\", whether you choose to view this two-disc Criterion edition in its entirety depends on how much you enjoy watching people talking about \"My Own Private Idaho\"\", and concluded, \"But with all the various interpretations and influences, this is definitely a film worth talking about\".\n\nIn 2015 The Criterion Collection released the film in Blu-ray, based on a restored 4K digital transfer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39213378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39213378", "title": "Panchronic phonology", "text": "Panchronic phonology\n\nPanchronic phonology is an approach to historical phonology. Its aim is to formulate generalizations about sound changes that are independent of any particular language or language group.\n\nThe term 'panchronic' as applied to linguistics goes back at least to Saussure, who uses it to refer to the most general principles, independently of concrete facts. The panchronic program in phonology, however, is associated with the work of André-Georges Haudricourt, especially his seminal articles of 1940 and 1973, and the preliminary synthesis published with Claude Hagège in 1978.\n\nBeyond case studies, one of the goals of comparative linguistics is to assemble data that lead to an inventory of the common types of sound change and to an improved understanding of the conditions under which they occur. Panchronic Phonology aims to achieve this: it attempts to formulate generalizations about sound change that are independent of any particular language or language group. Haudricourt (1973) labels such an approach Panchronic Phonology. Panchronic laws are obtained by induction from a typological survey of precise diachronic events whose analysis brings out their common conditions of appearance. In turn, they can be used to shed light on individual historical situations. \n\nPanchronic Phonology is a research program, not a full-fledged, fully realized model of language change. It has been pointed out that the book \"La Phonologie panchronique\", co-authored by Hagège and Haudricourt, only scratches the surface of the many topics that it aims to treat.\n\nIn practice, the panchronic program requires the compilation of as many attested cases of sound changes as possible, with detailed information on the state of the linguistic system where it took place. The study of sound changes in progress is another important source of information about the mechanisms of sound change; particular attention is paid to unstable states, and to the phonetic analysis of synchronic variation. One of the aims of the panchronic approach in phonology is to link up findings about synchronic variation and findings about long-term historical change.\n\n\nThe Panchronic program in phonology is a development from structural approaches to diachrony. Structural approaches to diachrony study the way in which phonological systems respond to the causes of change. A major source of change is the constant competition between the tendency towards phonological integration and the tendency towards phonetic simplicity. Phonological economy tends to fill structural gaps in phonological systems, and phonetic economy tends to create phonological gaps. Out of the pool of potential changes, the actual direction of evolution observed in a given language depends in part on the state of its phonological system, e.g. – again taking nasality as an example – which nasal phonemes it possesses (among consonants and vowels), which phonotactic constraints they are subject to, and what functional load they have in the system.\n\nMartinet expressed a skeptical view on the possibility of establishing panchronic laws of evolution, considering that the factors at play in linguistic change are of such complexity that no amount of detail can ever be sufficient to arrive at truly panchronic generalizations. He nonetheless considers the search for panchronic generalizations useful as a research tool: \"Contrary to some other functionalists, I am not tempted to posit panchronic laws of phonological evolution. But looking for general laws may lead to what I would call the positing of useful hypotheses.\" Martinet takes the example of the following generalization, which he rephrases from Haudricourt's findings: \"The articulation of a phoneme is only apt to get weaker when and if it stands in opposition to another phoneme sharing the same features, but distinct from it on account of a more energetic or a more complex articulation.\" Martinet concludes: \"I still would prefer calling this a working hypothesis rather than a panchronic law, because I am convinced we shall one day come across a language where the weakening of consonants will be found to result from some unforeseen complex of factors.\" (ibid.)\n\nWhile the term \"panchronic\" is not widely used today, the aim to formulate generalizations about sound change that are independent of any particular language or language group is common to many historical linguists. Labov's generalization that \"In chain shifts, peripheral vowels become more open and nonperipheral vowels become less open\" (1994: 601) can be considered as a panchronic statement. Several of the generalizations about nasal states and nasal processes proposed by Hyman likewise aim to explain synchronic states in terms of the processes that lead up to them, and to arrive at general laws of sound change.\n\nThe program of Panchronic Phonology is very close to that of Evolutionary Phonology, although with some interesting differences. Evolutionary Phonology (as proposed by Juliette Blevins), building on work by John Ohala, considers phonetic variation as the primary source of phonological change. This emphasis on the phonetic bases of change encourages a continuous dialogue between experimental phonetics and historical phonology. Even if every scholars agree that there exist competing phonetic tendencies, according to Labov (1994: 601) they do not have explanatory or predictive power when it comes to individual cases. In Panchronic Phonology, not all sound changes are straightforwardly related to phonetic tendencies, and hypothesized universals of language change based on phonetic properties are considered to seldom stand close scrutiny. According to some authors, the existence of a pool of phonetic variation is only part of the thoroughly complex story of diachronic sound change.\n\n\n"}

As an increasing proportion of the world’s information output shifts from analog to digital form, it is necessary to develop new strategies to preserve this information for the long-term.

Preservation metadata is sometimes considered a subset of technical or administrative metadata.\n\nPreservation metadata stores technical details on the format, structure and use of the digital content, the history of all actions performed on the resource including changes and decisions, the authenticity information such as technical features or custody history, and the responsibilities and rights information applicable to preservation actions.\n\nPreservation metadata is access-centered and should accomplish four themes: include details about files and instructions for use; document all updates or actions that have occurred to an object; show provenance and demonstrate current and future custody; list details on the individual(s) who are responsible for the preservation of the object.\n\nPreservation metadata often includes the following information:\n\n\nDigital materials require constant maintenance and migration to new formats as technology changes. In order to survive into the future, digital objects need preservation metadata that can exist independently from the systems which were used to create them. Without preservation metadata, digital material will be lost. “\"While a print book with a broken spine can be easily re-bound, a digital object that has become corrupted or obsolete is often impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to repair\"”.

{"id": "184798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184798", "title": "Requiem", "text": "Requiem\n\nA Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \"Missa pro defunctis\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \"Missa defunctorum\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is usually, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.\n\nMusical settings of the propers of the Requiem Mass are also called Requiems, and the term has subsequently been applied to other musical compositions associated with death, dying, and mourning, even when they lack religious or liturgical relevance.\n\nThe term is also used for similar ceremonies outside the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism and in certain Lutheran churches. A comparable service, with a wholly different ritual form and texts, exists in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as in the Methodist Church.\n\nThe Mass and its settings draw their name from the introit of the liturgy, which begins with the words \"Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine\" – \"Grant them eternal rest, O Lord\". (\"Requiem\" is the accusative singular form of the Latin noun \"requies\", \"rest, repose\".) The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 employs this phrase as the first entrance antiphon among the formulas for Masses for the dead, and it remains in use to this day.\n\nIn earlier forms of the Roman Rite, some of which are still in use, a Requiem Mass differs in several ways from the usual Mass in that form. Some parts that were of relatively recent origin, including some that have been excluded in the 1970 revision, are omitted. Examples are the psalm \"Iudica\" at the start of Mass, the prayer said by the priest before reading the Gospel (or the blessing of the deacon, if a deacon reads it), and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving Communion. Other omissions include the use of incense at the Introit and the Gospel, the kiss of peace, lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the Gospel, and blessings. There is no Gloria in excelsis Deo and no recitation of the Creed; the Alleluia chant before the Gospel is replaced by a Tract, as in Lent; and the \"Agnus Dei\" is altered. \"Ite missa est\" is replaced with \"Requiescant in pace\" (May they rest in peace); the \"Deo gratias\" response is replaced with \"Amen\". Black is the obligatory liturgical colour of the vestments in the earlier forms, while the later form allows a choice between black and violet, and in some countries, such as England and Wales, white. The sequence Dies irae, recited or sung between the Tract and the Gospel, is an obligatory part of the Requiem Mass before the Novus Ordo changes. As its opening words \"Dies irae\" (\"day of wrath\") indicate, this poetic composition speaks of the Day of Judgment in fearsome terms; it then appeals to Jesus for mercy. In the pre-Novus Ordo form, commemorations (i.e., collect, secret, and postcommunion of either lower-ranking liturgical feasts that occur on the same day or votive/seasonal commemorations) are absent from the liturgy; as a result, it is standard practice for a separate, smaller Requiem Missal containing only the rubrics and various Mass formularies for Masses for the dead to be used, rather than the full Missal containing texts that will never be used at Requiems.\n\nIn the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the Roman Catholic Church following the Novus Ordo Second Vatican Council, there was a significant shift in the funeral rites used by the Church. The emphasis on sorrow and grief was to be replaced by one which also includes the whole community's worship of God and in which the deceased is entrusted to God's love, based on trust in the salvific value of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe term \"Requiem Mass\" was often replaced by the term \"Mass of the Resurrection\" or Mass of Christian Burial, although the former was never official terminology. In the official English ritual, \"Order of Christian Funerals\", published by the Roman Catholic Bishops of England and Wales in 1990, the title is given as \"Funeral Mass\". Requiem Mass remains a suitable title for other Masses for the dead and for the Funeral Mass itself, (as the proper antiphons remain in force, Introit -\"Eternal rest grant...\"/\"Requiem æternam dona eis Domine\", Offertory: \"Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful departed...\"/\"Domine Iesu Christe, Rex gloriæ, libera animas...\", Communion:\"Let perpetual light shine...\"/\"Lux æterna luceat eis, Domine...\"), although the propers are more honored in the breach than in the observance. In line with this shift, the use of black vestments was made optional by the second Vatican Council (and had mostly disappeared by the late 20th century, at least in the United States, although their use is seeing a resurgence), with the preference of many being for white, (the use of which is an indult for some countries, not part of the universal rubrics) the color of joy associated with Easter, or purple, for a muted version of mourning. The texts used for the service offered a similar change, with more options for the readings, some of which reinforce an overall theme of the promise of eternal life made by Jesus.\n\"Requiem\" is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral, or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the Roman Catholic Mass. Among the earliest examples of this type are the German settings composed in the 17th century by Heinrich Schütz and Michael Praetorius, whose works are Lutheran adaptations of the Roman Catholic requiem, and which provided inspiration for the mighty \"German Requiem\" by Brahms.\n\nSuch works include:\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the requiem is the fullest form of memorial service (, Slavonic: \"Оpеlо\"). The normal memorial service is a greatly abbreviated form of Matins, but the Requiem contains all of the psalms, readings, and hymns normally found in the All-Night Vigil (which combines the Canonical Hours of Vespers, Matins and First Hour), providing a complete set of propers for the departed. The full requiem will last around three-and-a-half hours. In this format it more clearly represents the original concept of \"parastas\", which means literally, \"standing throughout (the night).\" Often, there will be a Divine Liturgy celebrated the next morning with further propers for the departed.\n\nBecause of their great length, a full Requiem is rarely served. However, at least in the Russian liturgical tradition, a Requiem will often be served on the eve before the Glorification (canonization) of a saint, in a special service known as the \"Last \"Panikhida\"\".\n\nThe \"Book of Common Prayer\" contained no Requiem Mass, but instead a service named \"The Order for the Burial of the Dead\". Since the liturgical reform movement, provision has been made for a Eucharist to be celebrated at a funeral in various BCPs used in the 33 Provinces of the Anglican Communion. Prior to these additions, Anglo-Catholics or High Church Anglicans often incorporate parts of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass as part of a funeral service—typically passages from the Ordinary of the Mass. Within this service are several texts with rubrics stating that they shall be said or sung by the priest or clerks. The first few of these texts are found at the beginning of the service, while the rest are meant to occur during the actual burial of the body into the grave. These texts are typically dividing into seven, and collectively known as \"funeral sentences\". Composers who have set the Anglican burial service to music include William Croft, Thomas Morley, Thomas Tomkins, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell. The text of these seven sentences, from the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\", is as follows:\n\nThe Requiem Mass is notable for the large number of musical compositions that it has inspired, including settings by Mozart (though uncompleted), Verdi, Berlioz, Dvořák, Fauré, Duruflé, and others. Originally, such compositions were meant to be performed in liturgical service, with monophonic chant. Eventually, the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own, and the compositions of composers such as Verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works.\n\nMany of the texts in the Requiem Mass have been set to music, including:\n\nFor many centuries the texts of the requiem were sung to Gregorian melodies. The Requiem by Johannes Ockeghem, written sometime in the latter half of the 15th century, is the earliest surviving polyphonic setting. There was a setting by the elder composer Dufay, possibly earlier, which is now lost: Ockeghem's may have been modelled on it. Many early compositions reflect the varied texts that were in use in different liturgies around Europe before the Council of Trent standardised texts used in liturgies. The requiem of Brumel, circa 1500, is the first to include the \"Dies Iræ\". In the early polyphonic settings of the Requiem, there is considerable textural contrast within the compositions themselves: simple chordal or fauxbourdon-like passages are contrasted with other sections of contrapuntal complexity, such as in the Offertory of Ockeghem's Requiem.\n\nIn the 16th century, more and more composers set the Requiem mass. In contrast to practice in setting the Mass Ordinary, many of these settings used a cantus-firmus technique, something which had become quite archaic by mid-century. In addition, these settings used less textural contrast than the early settings by Ockeghem and Brumel, although the vocal scoring was often richer, for example in the six-voice Requiem by Jean Richafort which he wrote for the death of Josquin des Prez. Other composers before 1550 include Pedro de Escobar, Antoine de Févin, Cristóbal Morales, and Pierre de La Rue; that by La Rue is probably the second oldest, after Ockeghem's.\nOver 2,000 Requiem compositions have been composed to the present day. Typically the Renaissance settings, especially those not written on the Iberian Peninsula, may be performed \"a cappella\" (i.e. without necessary accompanying instrumental parts), whereas beginning around 1600 composers more often preferred to use instruments to accompany a choir, and also include vocal soloists. There is great variation between compositions in how much of liturgical text is set to music.\n\nMost composers omit sections of the liturgical prescription, most frequently the Gradual and the Tract. Fauré omits the \"Dies iræ\", while the very same text had often been set by French composers in previous centuries as a stand-alone work.\n\nSometimes composers divide an item of the liturgical text into two or more movements; because of the length of its text, the \"Dies iræ\" is the most frequently divided section of the text (as with Mozart, for instance). The \"Introit\" and \"Kyrie\", being immediately adjacent in the actual Roman Catholic liturgy, are often composed as one movement.\n\nMusico-thematic relationships among movements within a Requiem can be found as well.\n\nBeginning in the 18th century and continuing through the 19th, many composers wrote what are effectively concert works, which by virtue of employing forces too large, or lasting such a considerable duration, prevent them being readily used in an ordinary funeral service; the requiems of Gossec, Berlioz, Verdi, and Dvořák are essentially dramatic concert oratorios. A counter-reaction to this tendency came from the Cecilian movement, which recommended restrained accompaniment for liturgical music, and frowned upon the use of operatic vocal soloists.\n\nMany composers have composed Requiems. Some of the most notable include the following (in chronological order):\n\nIn the 20th century the requiem evolved in several new directions. The genre of War Requiem is perhaps the most notable, which comprise compositions dedicated to the memory of people killed in wartime. These often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature; for example, the \"War Requiem\" of Benjamin Britten juxtaposes the Latin text with the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Krzysztof Penderecki's \"Polish Requiem\" includes a traditional Polish hymn within the sequence, and Robert Steadman's \"Mass in Black\" intersperses environmental poetry and prophecies of Nostradamus. Holocaust Requiem may be regarded as a specific subset of this type. The \"Requiem Ebraico\" (Hebrew Requiem) (1945) by Austrian-American composer Eric Zeisl, a setting of Psalm 92 dedicated to the memory of the composer's father \"and the other countless victims of the Jewish tragedy in Europe\", is considered the first major work of Holocaust commemoration. John Foulds's \"A World Requiem\" was written in the aftermath of the First World War and initiated the Royal British Legion's annual festival of remembrance. Recent requiem works by Taiwanese composers Tyzen Hsiao and Ko Fan-long follow in this tradition, honouring victims of the February 28 Incident and subsequent White Terror.\n\nThe 20th century saw the development of the secular Requiem, written for public performance without specific religious observance, such as Max Reger's \"Requiem\" (1915), the setting of a German poem titled Requiem and dedicated to victims of World War I, and Frederick Delius's \"Requiem\", completed in 1916 and dedicated to \"the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war\",; Paul Hindemith's \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd: A Requiem for Those We Love\", commissioned in 1945 (premiered 1946) after the passing of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and based on Walt Whitman's elegy written after the passing of Abraham Lincoln; and Dmitry Kabalevsky's \"Requiem\" (Op. 72; 1962), a setting of a poem written by Robert Rozhdestvensky especially for the composition.\n\nHerbert Howells's unaccompanied \"Requiem\" uses Psalm 23 (\"The Lord is my shepherd\"), Psalm 121 (\"I will lift up mine eyes\"), \"Salvator mundi\" (\"O Saviour of the world\" in English), \"Requiem aeternam\" (two different settings), and \"I heard a voice from heaven\". John Rutter combines in his Requiem (1985) some of the parts of the Latin Requiem with two complete psalms, Psalm 130 \"Out of the deep\" and his earlier composition \"The Lord is my Shepherd\", and juxtaposes more biblical verses within the Latin movements. \n\nSome composers have written purely instrumental works bearing the title of \"Requiem\", as famously exemplified by Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem\". Hans Werner Henze's \"Das Floß der Medusa\", written in 1968 as a requiem for Che Guevara, is properly speaking an oratorio; Henze's Requiem is instrumental but retains the traditional Latin titles for the movements. Igor Stravinsky's \"Requiem Canticles\" mixes instrumental movements with segments of the \"Introit\", \"Dies irae\", \"Pie Jesu\" and \"Libera me\". Christopher Wood’s \"Requiem\" (premiered in 2012 under the direction of Paul Brough at St John's, Smith Square) was inspired by the public reaction to the death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and returns to a more traditional form, setting virtually the complete Latin text from the Liber Usualis. In February 2013, an Arab Spring-inspired 'Requiem' by composer Rami Khalife was premiered by the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra and The Leipzig Radio Choir, to great critical acclaim.\n\n\n"}

These Christians known as Syrian Malabar Nasranis, trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. They still follow a very old naming convention, which is entirely different from other races and religions.\n\nTheir names are both biblical and inherited and are passed on from one generation to the next. The male names are patronymic and the female names are matronymic. Usually a person’s name will include the names of their parents and grand parents or that of a very close blood relative. At the same time, these names will not have names of saints or of great religious personalities or of political leaders or of foreign names. Family names are also included. Unlike Indian Christians of other denominations, foreign family names are absolutely irrelevant for Saint Thomas Christians as they embraced Christianity long before the arrival of European missionaries in India . So a Nasrani can easily be identified by name, from among other Christians. Even today, this pattern of giving name is visible in almost all Syrian Christian denominations.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Portuguese in May 1498, Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala were known to belong to the \"Margam\", a word when translated is ‘The Way’.\n\nIn 1599, Catholic Archbishop Alexio-de-Menezes called a synod at Udayamperoor, in which Christians in and near the kingdom of Cochin attended. Here he decreed that St. Thomas Christians should abandon their ancient naming conventions. They were specifically told not to use the name \"Easow\" because it was holy. But, the Saint Thomas Christians ignored this command and had continued with their ancient customs. Even today they do follow this method of naming. Even the Nasranis that did convert to Catholicism (Syrian Catholics) still use the \"old margam\" names. The Latin names are shunned\n\nDuring the 20th century some names were created by joining two or more syllables. For example, Abey (AB), Aji (AG), Bibi (BB), Biji (BG), Jessy (JC) and so on. Today, several Syrian Christians name their children by Indian names like Deepak, Rahul, Neethu, Asha etc. But by the 21st century more biblical names began to reappear. Thus names like, Isaac, Joshua, David, Saul, Ezekiel, Timothy, appeared on the scene. Generally they still follow the system detailed below.\n\nA name will include the baptismal name (generally the person is known by that name ) and the name of the father. The practice of appending the first name of father to the child's name instead of family name is also followed by Hindus of South India. Examples are given below.\n\nTheir names traditionally have a threefold structure.\nThe first two are usually abbreviated to initials.\n\nAnother form is that the name will include the baptismal name (generally the person is called by that name) and the name of his father. The practice of appending the first name of father to the child's name instead of family name is also followed by Hindus of South India. Examples are given below.\n\nAs an example, the name, Thomas Mathew is similar to \"Shimon bar Jona\". which means \"Shimon son of Jona\". In the same way, Thomas Mathew means \"Thomas\" son of \"Mathew\". Thomas Mathew is to be addressed as Thomas and not by his father’s name.\n\nAnother form of name is Nikhil Thomas Mathew where Nikhil is a name chosen by the parents and they usually call him by that name, Thomas is the biblical and baptismal name and Mathew is his father's name.\n\nTheir bishop receives a new name on consecration. This also has a threefold structure.\n\nAs an example, the name, Rachel Mathew, means Rachel daughter of Mathew. After marriage, father’s name is replaced by the husband’s name. Rachel Mathew is to be addressed as Rachel and not by her father’s name.\n\nAnother naming pattern is Anita Rachel Mathew where Anita is a formal given name chosen by the parents, Rachel is the biblical and baptismal name and Mathew is father's name. The given first names can be of any origin and many Syrian Christians give Indian names like Neethu, Deepa etc. to their children.\n\nWhen initials are used, abbreviations of the family name or house name (name of the plot where the parents of the child live at the time of birth) and the father’s name are given before the given name. For example, the name P.M. Thomas means Palakkappilly (family name), Mathew’s (father’s name) son, Thomas (given name). His sister’s name will be P.M. Rachel.\n\nWhen family name or house name need to be used, it comes first followed by the given name. As an example, T.M. Thomas is, THEETAKATTIL Thomas Mathew or THEETAKATTIL T.M.Thomas.\n\nHypocoristic (Pet names) are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations. In more formal situations, the given name is to be used instead. This alludes to the fact that using a person's pet name betokens familiarity.\nPet names for Syrian Christians can be Hindu, Assyrian, Persian or Biblical in origin.\n\nMale names are patronymic.\n\nFemale names are matronymic.\n\nThe last name (father’s name) changes with each generation. The family name would also change if members who move out of their consanguineal family homes with the changing ownership of property upon the death of the patriarch decides to adopt a new name. However, several families claim that they are ancient and their family names have remained unchanged for centuries.\n\nThe Syrian Christians who have migrated to Western nations tend to choose surnames which can either be the family name or the father's name will be used as a surname.\n\nThe mother tongue of Nasranis is Malayalam. So the names given in the following lists are in phonetic spelling. But the first one, given under ‘’Other names,’’ shows how that name is usually written in English. The two lists include the names of a few common names that are in use, and they are not comprehensive. To know the correct pronunciation of these names, see Malayalam script or Tiberian vocalization.\n\nAll the above names are sometimes expanded by adding koch, kunju, kutty and mol before or after each name.\n\nNames are sometimes selected from the Malayalam language, and are used as pet names, like \n\n"}

{"id": "52481745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52481745", "title": "Transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria", "text": "Transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. According to the expert Nelly Ognyanova, lack of transparency in media ownership is one of the major problem in the media system in Bulgaria.\nIn Bulgaria there are specific provisions concerning print, electronic media and broadcast media. The relevant law, in particular the \"Law on Radio and Television and the Law on Mandatory Deposition of Press and Other Works\", requires the submission of data identifying the actual owners of electronic and print media and online registers are available to the public. Also, a law imposing restrictions on offshore companies to acquire shares and assets in different fields including the media sector, entered into force in 2014. In addition, under Bulgarian law, media are obliged to provide information about ownership upon request in conformity with the provisions set forth in the \"Law on Access to Public Information\". Despite the existence of these legal transparency obligations, there are several problems concerning, on one side the application of the rules, on the other, the requirements themselves, which are not enough effective in ensuring the disclosure of the actual owners. Also, legal requirements are constantly circumvented and sanctions usually not applied. Moreover, according to experts, the law should not be limited to obligations concerning the ownership, but expand its scope to examine the origin of funding of media outlets as well.\nOverall, despite recent legislative changes, some loopholes remain, allowing non-transparency as regards to media ownership and funding and making possible to circumvent the law and conceal who the true owners of the media are. According to expert Ognyanova, there are several ways of circumventing the legal requirements: one example is the case of Krasikir Gergov, a former agent of the Communist-era State Security services and owner of advertising agencies that, while acting in the guise of a “consultant”, actually had a share of the ownership and a contract allowing him to exercise control over the newsroom of a media outlet in Bulgaria. According to Professor Georgi Lozanov, a former member of the Council for Electronic Media, the introduction of the Access to Information Law could help in making more transparent the media sector, in particular media ownership and sources of funds which are largely opaque in Bulgaria. \"There is no transparency of media capital whatsoever and one never knows what the real situation is [...]. The introduction of the Access to Information Act [...] represented an attempt at bringing the media to supply information about the sources and funds. Because, if you set up a media outlet and sell a product which is directly related to freedom of speech, it is normal to be able to track the business from the very beginning, thai is, to track the genealogy of the message in the business sense\", remarked Professor Lozanov. \n\nIn Bulgaria media organisations are required to report ownership information to a media authority under the \"Mandatory Deposition of Print and Other Materials Act\" (MDPOMA), in force since January 2001 and amended in 2010. The law covers only the print media and provides that information on ownership should be reported to the Ministry of Culture which has the responsibility to collect and publish online data on ownership submitted by print media. The law does not require the disclosure of the size of shareholding but includes the disclosure of the names of people holding shares on behalf of another (beneficial ownership) through brokerage and provides a definition of \"ultimate owner\"\n\nAlso, under the MDPOMA law, newspapers and magazines are obliged to disclose their ownership data directly to the public through the publication of this information on the first issue of each newspaper each calendar year and every time there is a change in ownership or control of the media organisation.\n\nOverall, existing obligations under MDPOMA does not, on its own, allow to know the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media operating in Bulgaria because the size of shareholding is not made public. This information can only be obtained by cross-referencing the data provided under MDPOMA with those available in the Company Register, a public register containing ownership information on all the registered companies in the country.\n\nAnother weakness in the transparency system of print media concerns the lack of guarantees for disclosing equity that secure media financially and by which ownership is acquired. Besides criticism regarding legal provisions themselves, the implementation is another matter. Indeed, a further critical point concerns the effectiveness of the disclosure regime, with particular regard with the functioning of the sanctions system required by the law. As a matter of fact, according to public records consulted by Access-Info Europe, in the past few years there have not been cases of sanctions applied despite the fact that there have been evidence of cases of non-disclosure. This situation led to an article in the magazine \"Capital Weekly\" on January 2012 that revealed that many authorities in Bulgaria are not familiar with their obligations under the law. A study conducted in 2014 shows that a series of important ownership changes in the Bulgarian media system that occurred in that year had not been recorded as it should have been done. There are also journalistic investigations corroborating the fact that publishers of print media fail to comply with their duty to submit the required data and no fine have been imposed to sanction this.\n\nThe broadcast media are covered by the \"Radio and Television Act\" (RTA), adopted in 2008 and amended in 2010 and 2012. The law provides that broadcast media should present ownership data to the Electronic Media Council which has the responsibility to maintain public registers containing, among others, the data on ownership collected by the Council. In particular, the law provides the disclosure of data on natural or legal persons exerting control over the management structure of the media concerned. The law defines \"control over the media services provider\" when a person controls, also by means of connected persons, more than 50% of the voters, or could directly or indirectly appoint more than 50% of the managing body of the media services provider, or could exert a significant influence on the decision-making process. Also, according to the RTA, interests held by owners (for instance, as shareholder or partner) in other media organisations have to be made public. Ownership information collected in the Register can be accessed online.\n\nThe major weak point of the disclosure regime for broadcast media concerns the fact that the obligation to make public the size of beneficial owners through brokerage is non-existent, even if, at the moment, brokerage is not a common practice in ownership media patterns in Bulgaria.\n\nThe law regulates the disclosure of ownership information for media organisations regularly registered as companies is the Company Register Act adopted in 2006 and in force since January 2008. As not all media are registered companies, as a matter of fact this law does not cover all media outlets operating in Bulgaria. For the media companies covered by the scope of this law, information have to be made to the Company Register, which is a public register. Information to be disclosed under this law includes: names of directors, names of shareholders (comprising beneficial shareholders through brokerage), members of management and supervisory boards, size of shareholdings, management details, the outcome of the company decision-making process, financial reports, constitutive acts, etc. Information on those with indirect control is also made public. This information is recorded electronically and available to the public online via the company register website maintained by the Registry Agency. Even if not all media operating in Bulgaria are covered by the scope of this provisions, overall, the information to be disclosed in the Company Register is quite comprehensive and is usually sufficient to ascertain the owners of the media registered as companies.\n\nThe Bulgarian law on Access to Public Information sets forth some general requirements concerning transparency regarding management and ownership of the media. According to the law, citizens and legal persons are entitled to access information regarding:\n\n"}
