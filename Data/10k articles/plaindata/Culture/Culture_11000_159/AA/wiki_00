{"id": "1335047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335047", "title": "Aerial perspective", "text": "Aerial perspective\n\nAerial perspective or atmospheric perspective refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).\n\nAerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by polymaths such as Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the Pompeian Styles, dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.\n\nThe major component affecting the appearance of objects during daylight is scattering of light, called skylight, into the line of sight of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see haze). Scattering adds the sky light as a veiling luminance onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short wavelength than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see Rayleigh scattering for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the moon is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of self-luminous objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.\n\nThe ability of a person with normal visual acuity to see fine details is determined by his or her contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal of the smallest contrast for which a person can see a sine-wave grating. A person's contrast sensitivity function is contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of visual angle. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.\n\nThe high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details. Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as blurring an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.\n\nIn art, especially painting, \"aerial perspective\" refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.\n\n"}

Created in Paris on 21 July 1883 under the name \"Alliance française pour la propagation de la langue nationale dans les colonies et à l'étranger\" (French alliance for the propagation of the national language in the colonies and abroad) — now known simply as \"Alliance Française\" — its primary concern is teaching French as a second language and is headquartered in Paris. In 2014, the \"Alliance\" has 850 centers in 137 countries, on each inhabited continent.\n\nThe \"Alliance\" was created in Paris on 21 July 1883 by a group including the scientist Louis Pasteur, the diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, the writers Jules Verne and Ernest Renan, and the publisher Armand Colin.\n\nIt finances most of its activities from the fees it receives from its courses and from rental of its installations. The French government also provides a subsidy covering approximately five percent of its budget (nearly 665,000 € in 2003)\n\nMore than 440,000 students learn French at one of the centres run by the \"Alliance\", whose network of schools includes:\n\nThe organizations outside Paris are local, independently run franchises. Each has a committee and a president. The \"Alliance Française\" brand is owned by the Paris centre. In many countries, the \"Alliance Française\" of Paris is represented by a \"Délégué général\". The French Government also runs 150 separate French Cultural Institutes that exist to promote French language and culture.\n\nIn 2005, along with the Società Dante Alighieri, the British Council, the Goethe-Institut, the Instituto Cervantes, and the Instituto Camões, the Alliance française was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for outstanding achievements in communications and the humanities.\n\n\n\nThe Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France is a Higher Private Education Institute. It is an association from the law 1901.\nLocated in the heart of the capital, the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France is a genuine international meeting point where more than 11,000 students from 160 different countries come every year to learn French. It is also the oldest one since the school offers courses in Paris since 1894.\n\nThe 110 faculty teachers at the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France are all certified in teaching French as a foreign language.\n\nUntil 2007, the year of creation of the Alliance Française Foundation, the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France was called \"the Paris Alliance Française\".\n\nIt was divided into three branches: the International Relations (DRI), the School of Paris, and the Department of Human and Financial Resources (DRHF). In 2007, the DRI has become the Alliance Française Foundation, while the School and the DRHF became the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France.\n\nThree conventions are now governing the relations between the Foundation and the Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France:\n\nThe Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France works with Alliances Françaises from around the world, ministries, public bodies, and also large companies, supporting them in their desire to improve their command of the language in a professional environment.\n\nIt is also a training center for French language teachers. Each year, nearly 2,300 teachers across the world are trained on site or remotely, initial or continuing training.\n\nIt delivers specific diplomas for French teachers such as the 'DAEFLE' (Diplôme d'Aptitude à l'Enseignement du Français Langue Étrangère), created with the 'CNED' (National Center for Distance Education) or the 'DPAFP – FLE' (Diplôme Professionnel de l'Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France en Français Langue Étrangère), which you obtain in five months after an initial training on site.\n\nIt also offers summer teaching courses for French teachers wishing to deepen and improve their knowledge.\nThe Alliance Française Paris Ile-de-France has been awarded the FLE Quality Label, achieving top marks for each of the criteria studied by the auditors: welcome, quality of teaching, premises, school management.\n\nIt is also co-founder of ALTE (Association of Language Testers in Europe), an association that includes some of the most prestigious European institutions in the field of evaluation in foreign language.\n\nSince 2010, it is the provider of the 'OFII' (French Office for Immigration and Integration) for language training of the signatories of the Contract Integration living in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49877", "title": "Areca nut", "text": "Areca nut\n\nThe areca nut ( or ) is the fruit of the areca palm (\"Areca catechu\"), which grows in much of the tropical Pacific (Melanesia and Micronesia), Southeast and South Asia, and parts of east Africa. It is commonly referred to as betel nut so it is easily confused with betel (\"Piper betle\") leaves that are often used to wrap it (\"paan\"). The term \"areca\" originated from the Kannada word \"adike\" (ಅಡಿಕೆ) and dates from the 16th century, when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from Kerala to Europe. Consumption has many harmful effects on health and is carcinogenic to humans. Various compounds present in the nut, including arecoline (the primary psychoactive ingredient which is similar to nicotine), contribute to histologic changes in the oral mucosa. It is known to be a major risk factor for cancers (squamous cell carcinoma) of the mouth and esophagus. As with chewing tobacco, its use is discouraged by preventive efforts. Consumption by hundreds of millions of people worldwide – mainly with southern and eastern Asian origins – has been described as a \"neglected global public health emergency\".\n\nThe areca nut is not a true nut, but rather a fruit categorized as a berry. It is commercially available in dried, cured, and fresh forms. When the husk of the fresh fruit is green, the nut inside is soft enough to be cut with a typical knife. In the ripe fruit, the husk becomes yellow or orange, and as it dries, the fruit inside hardens to a wood-like consistency. At that stage, the areca nut can only be sliced using a special scissors-like cutter.\n\nUsually for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a betel leaf along with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and may include clove, cardamom, catechu (\"kattha\"), or other spices for extra flavouring. Betel leaf has a fresh, peppery taste, but it can also be bitter to varying degrees depending on the variety.\n\nAreca nuts are chewed with betel leaf for their effects as a mild stimulant, causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person.\n\nThe areca nut contains the tannins arecatannin and gallic acid; a fixed oil gum; a little terpineol; lignin; various saline substances; and three main alkaloids—arecoline, arecaidine, and guvacine—all of which have vasoconstricting properties. The betel leaf chewed along with the nut contains eugenol, another vasoconstrictor. Tobacco leaf is often added to the mixture, thereby adding the effect of nicotine.\n\nIn parts of India, Sri Lanka, and southern China, areca nuts are not only chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used in the preparation of Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines. Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some dentifrices. Other traditional uses include the removal of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a decoction, or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids. According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against bad breath. Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with \"Uncaria gambir\" during his visit to China in the 1830s. After chewing a betelnut, the red residue is generally spat out and is considered an eyesore. This has led many places to ban chewing this nut. \n\nChewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf is a tradition, custom, or ritual which dates back thousands of years in much of the geographical areas from South Asia eastward to the Pacific. It constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many Asian and Oceanic countries, including Pakistan, the Maldives, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar), China, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Palau, Yap, Guam, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. How or when the areca nut and the betel leaf were first combined into one psychoactive drug is not known. Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines suggests they have been used in tandem for at least 4000 years.\n\nIn Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase \"matters of betel and areca\" (\"chuyện trầu cau\") is synonymous with marriage. The tradition of chewing areca nuts starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. The folk tale explaining the origin of this Vietnamese tradition is a good illustration of the belief that the combination of areca nut and the betel leaf is ideal to the point they are practically inseparable, like an idealized married couple.\n\nMalay culture and tradition hold betel nut and leaves in high esteem. Traditionally, guests who visit a Malay house are presented with a tray of areca nuts and betel leaves, in much the same way as drinks are offered to guests in many cultures around the world. There is even a Malay proverb about the betel nut, \"bagaikan pinang dibelah dua\", loosely translated \"like a betel nut cut in two\", referring to the similarity of two persons such as twins or siblings, because the two halves of the cut betel nut are very similar to each other.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the chewing of betel and areca nut dates back to the pre-Vedic period Harappan empire. Formerly, in both India and Sri Lanka, it was a custom of the royalty to chew areca nut with betel leaf. Kings had special attendants whose duty it was to carry a box with all the necessary ingredients for a good chewing session. There was also a custom for lovers to chew areca nut and betel leaf together, because of its breath-freshening and relaxant properties. A sexual symbolism thus became attached to the chewing of the nut and the leaf. The areca nut represented the male principle, and the betel leaf the female principle. Considered an auspicious ingredient in Hinduism and some schools of Buddhism, the areca nut is still used along with betel leaf in religious ceremonies, and also while honoring individuals in much of southern Asia.\n\nIn Assam, it is a tradition to offer \"pan-tamul\" (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests, after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called \"bota\". Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol. A tradition from Upper Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the \"husori\" players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.\n\nSpanish mariner Álvaro de Mendaña reported observing Solomon Islanders chewing the nut and the leaf with caustic lime, and the manner in which the habit stained their mouths red. He noted the friendly and genial chief Malope, on Santa Isabel Island, would offer him the combination as a token of friendship every time they met.\n\nIn Bhutan, the areca nut is called \"doma\". The raw areca nut, which is soft and moist, is very potent and when chewed can cause palpitation and vasoconstriction. This form is eaten in the lower regions of Bhutan and in North Bengal, where the nut is cut into half and put into a local \"paan\" leaf with a generous amount of lime. In the rest of Bhutan the raw nut, with the husk on, is fermented such that the husk rots and is easy to extract. The fermented doma has a putrid odour, which can be smelled from miles. Traditionally, this fragrant nut is cut in half and placed on top of a cone made of local betel leaf, which has a dash of lime put into it. \"Myth has it that the inhabitants of Bhutan traditionally known as Monyul, the land of Monpas where Buddhism did not reach lived on raw flesh, drank blood, and chewed bones. After the arrival of Guru Rinpoche in the 8th century, he stopped the people from eating flesh and drinking blood and created a substitute which is betel leaf, lime and areca nut. Today, chewing doma has become a custom. Doma is served after meals, during rituals and ceremonies. It is offered to friends and is chewed at work places by all sections of the society and has become an essential part of Bhutanese life and culture.\"\n\nThe addition of tobacco leaf to the chewing mixture is a relatively recent innovation, as tobacco was not introduced from the American continent until the colonial era.\n\nHabitual chewers of betel leaf and areca nut have a greatly increased risk of developing a range of serious diseases, including cancers of the mouth and esophagus. It has many systemic effects (see box).\n\nChewing areca nut alone has been linked to oral submucosal fibrosis. According to Medline Plus, \"Long-term use [of betel-areca preparations] has been associated with oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF), pre-cancerous oral lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Acute effects of betel chewing include asthma exacerbation, hypertension, and tachycardia. There may additionally be a higher risk of cancers of the liver, mouth, esophagus, stomach, prostate, cervix, and lung with regular betel use. Other effects can include altered blood sugar levels, which may in turn increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\"\n\nUse of areca nut has been associated with deterioration of psychosis in people with preexisting psychiatric disorders. Areca nut consumption is also tied to chronic kidney disease in men.\n\nIn 2003 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, found sufficient evidence that the habit of chewing betel quid, with or without tobacco, causes cancer in humans. Support for this conclusion is provided by a recent study which found that \"paan\", even without concurrent tobacco use, is a risk factor for oral cancer. In October, 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at IARC to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including areca nut, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. They confirmed there is sufficient evidence that areca nut, with or without tobacco, can cause cancer.\n\nThe harm caused by consumption of betel quid or areca nut by hundreds of millions of people worldwide (mainly with southern and eastern Asian origins and connections) has been characterized as a \"neglected global public health emergency\".\n\nChewing \"paan\" (and/or other areca nut and betel leaf formulations) during pregnancy significantly increases adverse outcomes for the baby. The habit is associated with higher incidences of preterm birth and low birth weight and height. Biologically, these effects may be a consequence of the arecoline that is found in areca nuts. The habit also exposes the fetus to various other toxic components linked to cancer.\n\nIn India (the largest consumer of areca nut) and Pakistan, the preparation of nut with or without betel leaf is commonly referred to as \"paan\". It is available practically everywhere and is sold in ready-to-chew pouches called \"pan masala\" or \"supari\", as a mixture of many flavours whose primary base is areca nut crushed into small pieces. Poor people, who may eat only every other day, use it to stave off hunger pangs. \"Pan masala\" with a small quantity of tobacco is called \"gutka\". The easily discarded, small plastic \"supari\" or \"gutka\" pouches are an ubiquitous pollutant of the South Asian environment. Some of the liquid in the mouth is usually disposed of by spitting, producing bright red spots wherever the expectorate lands.\nIn the Maldives, areca nut chewing is very popular, but spitting is frowned upon and regarded as an unrefined, repulsive way of chewing. Usually, people prefer to chew thin slices of the dry nut, which is sometimes roasted. \"Kili\", a mixture of areca nut, betel, cloves, cardamom and sugar is sold in small home-made paper pouches. Old people who have lost their teeth keep \"chewing\" by pounding the mixture of areca nut and betel with a small mortar and pestle.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, fresh areca nut, betel leaf or 'fruit leaf' (\"daka\" in PNG) and lime are sold on street corners. In these countries, dried or flavoured areca nut is not popular. Betelnuts there are referred to in Tok Pisin as buai. There has recently been a controversial ban on selling and chewing betelnut in public places Port Moresby. Because of this, many people have tried to smuggle betelnut into Port Moresby. Notably, there was a raid in Hanuabada in May 2015 where several bags of betelnut were confiscated, the total value of the confiscated nuts exceeding $180,000 USD. Areca nut chewing has recently been introduced into Vanuatu, where it is growing in popularity, especially in the northern islands of the country.\nIn Guam and the neighboring Northern Mariana Islands, betel and areca nut chewing is a social pastime as a means to extend friendship, and can be found in many, if not most, large gatherings as part of the food display.\n\nIn Palau, betel nut is chewed with lime, piper leaf and nowadays, with the addition of tobacco. Older and younger generations alike enjoy the use of betel nut, which is readily available at stores and markets. Unlike in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where the inner areca nut is used, in Palau, the areca nut's skin is chewed along with lime, leaf and tobacco and the juice is not swallowed but spat out.\n\nIn Taiwan, bags of 20 to 40 areca nuts are purchased fresh daily by a large number of consumers. To meet the steady year-round demand, two kinds of betel-nut shops sell betel and nuts, as well as cigarettes and drinks, including beer: Small mom and pop shops, often poorly maintained and with unassuming façades, and shops which will often consist of nothing more than a single, free-standing room, or booth. The latter is usually elevated one meter above the street, and measures less than 3 by 2 m. Large picture windows comprise two or more of the walls, allowing those who pass by a complete view of the interior. The interior is often painted brightly. Within such a shop, a sexily dressed young woman, a \"betel nut beauty\", can be seen preparing betel and areca nuts. Shops are often identified by multicoloured (commonly green) fluorescent tubes or neon lights that frame the windows or that are arranged radially above a store. Customers stop on the side of the road and wait for the girls to bring their betel and areca nut to their vehicles. The habit of chewing betel nut is often associated with blue-collar labor industries such a long-haul transportation, construction, or fishing. Workers in these labor-intensive industries use betel nut for its stimulating effect, but it also becomes a tool for socializing with coworkers. For example, studies have shown chewing betel nut is prevalent among taxi, bus and truck drivers, who rely on the stimulating effect of betel nut to cope with long work hours. For these reasons, oral cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death in professions with high betel nut-chewing rates.\n\nIn Hainan and Hunan Province, China, where Xiangtan is a center of use and processing, a wide range of old and young people consume areca nut daily. Most, though, consume the dried variety of the nut by itself, without the betel leaves. Some people also consume the areca nut in its raw, fresh form with or without the betel leaves. Betel nuts are sold mostly by old women walking around trying to sell it, but the dried version can be found in most shops which sell tea, alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nIn Thailand, the consumption of areca nut has declined gradually in the last decades. The younger generation rarely chews the substance, especially in the cities. Most of the present-day consumption is confined to older generations, mostly people above 50. Even so, small trays of betel leaves and sliced tender areca nut are sold in markets and used as offerings in Buddhist shrines.\n\nIn Australia, the sale of areca nut is prohibited. \n\nIn the Philippines, chewing the areca nut and betel leaf was a very widespread tradition in the past. Now, though, this tradition is almost dead among the urban people in the cities and big towns, and has largely been replaced by gum and tobacco. Nowadays, older people are the only ones chewing betel nuts. But in rural areas, betel nut-chewing is very much alive.\n\nIn the United States, areca nut is not a controlled or specially taxed substance and may be found in some Asian grocery stores. However, importation of areca nut in a form other than whole or carved kernels of nuts can be stopped at the discretion of US Customs officers on the grounds of food, agricultural, or medicinal drug violations. Such actions by Customs are very rare.\nIn the United Kingdom, areca nut is readily available in Asian grocery stores and even in shredded forms from the World Food aisles of larger Tesco supermarkets.\n\nPossession of betel nut or leaf is banned in the UAE and is a punishable offense.\n\nPlaces such as Guwahati (গুৱাহাটী) in Assam (অসম), Penang in Malaysia, Ko Mak (เกาะหมาก) in Thailand and Fua Mulaku in Maldives have been named after the areca nut.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "255591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255591", "title": "Autodidacticism", "text": "Autodidacticism\n\nAutodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education (also self-learning and self-teaching) is education without the guidance of masters (such as teachers and professors) or institutions (such as schools). Generally, an autodidact is an individual who chooses the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time. An autodidact may or may not have formal education, and their study may be either a complement or an alternative to it. Many notable contributions have been made by autodidacts.\n\nThe term has its roots in the Ancient Greek words (, ) and (, ). The related term \"didacticism\" defines an artistic philosophy of education.\n\nVarious terms are used to describe self-education. One such is \"heutagogy\", coined in 2000 by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon of Southern Cross University in Australia; others are \"self-directed learning\" and \"self-determined learning\". In the heutagogy paradigm, a learner should be at the centre of their own learning.\n\nAutodidacticism is sometimes a complement of modern education. As a complement to education, students would be encouraged to do more independent work. The Industrial Revolution created a new situation for self-directed learners.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, only a small minority of people received an advanced academic education. As stated by Joseph Whitworth in his influential report on industry dated from 1853, literacy rates were higher in the United States. However, even in the U.S., most children were not completing high school. High school education was necessary to become a teacher. In modern times, a larger percentage of those completing high school also attended college, usually to pursue a professional degree, such as law or medicine, or a divinity degree.\n\nFor many professions or for personal knowledge, however, formal education is not so necessary today due to the easier availability of free information on the Internet. Whereas in the past, one of the main benefits of going to college was to gain access to their superior libraries, today access to facts and books is available online. Financial analyst and author Peter Schiff, for one, says, \"Never before in history has it been so easy to be self-educated\".\n\nCollegiate teaching was based on the classics (Latin, philosophy, ancient history, theology) until the early nineteenth century. There were few if any institutions of higher learning offering studies in engineering or science before 1800. Institutions such as the Royal Society did much to promote scientific learning, including public lectures. In England, there were also itinerant lecturers offering their service, typically for a fee.\n\nPrior to the nineteenth century, there were many important inventors working as millwrights or mechanics who had typically received an elementary education and served an apprenticeship. Mechanics, instrument makers and surveyors had various mathematics training. James Watt was a surveyor and instrument maker and is described as being \"largely self-educated\". Watt, like some other autodidacts of the time, became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Lunar Society. In the eighteenth century these societies often gave public lectures and were instrumental in teaching chemistry and other sciences with industrial applications which were neglected by traditional universities. Academies also arose to provide scientific and technical training.\n\nYears of schooling in the United States began to increase sharply in the early twentieth century. This phenomenon was seemingly related to increasing mechanization displacing child labor. The automated glass bottle-making machine is said to have done more for education than child labor laws because boys were no longer needed to assist. However, the number of boys employed in this particular industry was not that large; it was mechanization in several sectors of industry that displaced child labor toward education. For males in the U.S. born 1886–90, years of school averaged 7.86, while for those born in 1926–30, years of school averaged 11.46.\n\nOne of the most recent trends in education is that the classroom environment should cater towards students' individual needs, goals, and interests. This model adopts the idea of inquiry-based learning where students are presented with scenarios to identify their own research, questions and knowledge regarding the area. As a form of discovery learning, students in today's classrooms are being provided with more opportunity to \"experience and interact\" with knowledge, which has its roots in autodidacticism.\n\nSuccessful self-teaching requires self-discipline and reflective capability. Some research suggests that being able to regulate one's own learning is something that must be modeled to students, for it is not a natural human tendency in the population at large. To interact with the environment, a framework has been identified to determine the components of any learning system: a reward function, incremental action value functions and action selection methods. Rewards work best in motivating learning when they are specifically chosen on an individual student basis. New knowledge must be incorporated into previously existing information as its value is to be assessed. Ultimately, these scaffolding techniques, as described by Vygotsky (1978) and problem solving methods are a result of dynamic decision making.\n\nThe secular and modern societies gave foundations for a new system of education and a new kind of autodidacts. While the number of schools and students raised from one century to the other, so did the number of autodidacts. The industrial revolution produced new educational tools used in schools, universities and outside academic circles to create a post-modern era that gave birth to the World Wide Web and encyclopaedic data banks such as Wikipedia. As this concept becomes more widespread and popular, web locations like Udacity and Khan Academy are developed as learning centers for many people to actively and freely learn together. The Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE) is also formed to publicize and provide guidance or support for self-directed education.\n\nThe first philosophical claim supporting an autodidactic program to the study of nature and God was in the philosophical novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (Alive Son of the Vigilant), whose titular hero is considered the archetypal autodidact. The story is a medieval autodidactic utopia, a philosophical treatise in a literary form, which was written by the Andalusian philosopher Ibn Tufail in the 1160s in Marrakesh. It is a story about a feral boy, an autodidact prodigy who masters nature through instruments and reason, discovers laws of nature by practical exploration and experiments, and gains \"summum bonum\" through a mystical mediation and communion with God. The hero rises from his initial state of \"tabula rasa\" to a mystical or direct experience of God after passing through the necessary natural experiences. The focal point of the story is that human reason, unaided by society and its conventions or by religion, can achieve scientific knowledge, preparing the way to the mystical or highest form of human knowledge.\n\nCommonly translated as \"The Self-Taught Philosopher\" or \"The Improvement of Human Reason\", Ibn-Tufayl's story Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan inspired debates about autodidacticism in a range of historical fields from classical Islamic philosophy through Renaissance humanism and the European Enlightenment. In his book \"Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: a Cross-Cultural History of Autodidacticism,\" Avner Ben-Zaken showed how the text traveled from late medieval Andalusia to early modern Europe and demonstrated the intricate ways in which autodidacticism was contested in and adapted to diverse cultural settings.\n\nIn the story of African American self-education, Heather Andrea Williams presents a historical account to examine African American's relationship to literacy during slavery, the Civil War and the first decades of freedom. Many of the personal accounts tell of individuals who have had to teach themselves due to racial discrimination in education.\n\nThe working-class protagonist of Jack London's \"Martin Eden\" (1909) embarks on a path of self-learning to win the affections of Ruth, a member of cultured society. By the end of the novel, Eden has surpassed the intellect of the bourgeois class, leading him to a state of indifference and ultimately suicide.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre's \"Nausea\" (1938) depicts, as a secondary character, an autodidact.\n\nComic-book superhero Batman is frequently depicted as an autodidactic polymath who has acquired a vast range of skills over the years either by various trainers or having trained himself, and his expertise in various disciplines is virtually unmatched in the DC comics universe.\n\nIn \"The Ignorant Schoolmaster\" (1987), Jacques Rancière describes the emancipatory education of Joseph Jacotot, a post-Revolutionary philosopher of education who discovered that he could teach things he did not know. The book is both a history and a contemporary intervention in the philosophy and politics of education, through the concept of autodidacticism; Rancière chronicles Jacotot's \"adventures\", but he articulates Jacotot's theory of \"emancipation\" and \"stultification\" in the present tense.\n\nThe 1997 drama film \"Good Will Hunting\" follows the story of autodidact Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon. Hunting demonstrates his breadth and depth of knowledge throughout the film but especially to his therapist and in a heated discussion in a Harvard bar.\n\nOne of the main characters in \"The Elegance of the Hedgehog\" (2006), by Muriel Barbery, is an autodidact. The story is told from the viewpoint of Renee, a middle-aged autodidact concierge in a Paris upscale apartment house and Paloma, a 12-year-old daughter of one of the tenants who is unhappy with her life. These two people find they have much in common when they both befriend a new tenant, Mr. Ozu, and their lives change forever.\n\nIn the Hindu epic, the \"Mahabharata\", \"Ekalavya\" is depicted as a tribal boy who was denied education in the science of arms from royal teachers from the house of Kuru. Ekalavya went to the forest, where he taught himself archery in front of an image of the Kuru teacher, Drona, that he had built for himself. Later, when the royal family found that Ekalavya had practiced with the image of Drona as his teacher, Drona asked for Ekalavya's thumb as part of his tuition. Ekalavya complied with Drona's request, thus ending his martial career.\n\nIn \"Suits\", the protagonist (Mike Ross) possesses a highly competent knowledge of the law despite not receiving any formal education in any law school. His knowledge is attributable to both his affinity for reading (autodidacticism), in addition to his \"eidetic memory\".\n\nDr. Spencer Reid in \"Criminal Minds\", played by Matthew Gray Gubler, is an autodidact with an eidetic memory.\n\nMany successful and influential architects, such as Mies Van Der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, Violet-Le-Duc, and Tadao Ando were self-taught.\n\nThere are very few countries allowing autodidacticism in architecture today. The practice of architecture or the use of the title \"architect\", are now protected in most countries.\n\nSelf-taught architects have generally studied and qualified in other fields such as engineering or arts and crafts. Jean Prouvé was first a structural engineer. Le Corbusier had an academic qualification in decorative arts. Tadao Ando started his career as a draftsman, and Eileen Gray studied fine arts.\n\nWhen a political state starts to implement restrictions on the profession, there are issues related to the rights of established self-taught architects. In most countries the legislation includes a grandfather clause, authorising established self-taught architects to continue practicing. In the UK, the legislation, allowed self-trained architects with 2 years of experience to register. In France, it allowed self-trained architects with 5 years of experience to register. In Belgium, the law allowed experienced self-trained architects in practice to register. In Italy, it allowed self-trained architects with 10 years of experience to register. In The Netherlands, the \"wet op de architectentitel van 7 juli 1987\" along with additional procedures, allowed architects with 10 years of experience and architects aged 40 years old or over, with 5 years of experience, to access the register.\n\nHowever, other sovereign states chose to omit such a clause, and many established and competent practitioners were stripped of their professional rights. In the Republic of Ireland, a group named \"Architects' Alliance of Ireland\" is defending the interests of long-established self-trained architects who were recently deprived from their rights to practice as per Part 3 of the Irish Building Control Act 2007.\n\nTheoretical research such as \"Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment\" or older studies like \"Vers une Architecture\" from Le Corbusier describe the practice of architecture as an environment changing with new technologies, sciences, and legislation. All architects must be autodidacts to keep up to date with new standards, regulations, or methods.\n\nSelf-taught architects like Eileen Gray, Luis Barragán, and many others, created a system where working is also learning, where self-education is associated with creativity and productivity within a working environment.\n\nWhile he was primarily interested in naval architecture, William Francis Gibbs learned his profession through his own study of battleships and ocean liners. Through his life he could be seen examining and changing the designs of ships that were already built, that is, until he started his firm Gibbs and Cox.\n\nThe role of self-directed learning continues to be investigated in learning approaches, along with other important goals of education, such as content knowledge, epistemic practices and collaboration. As colleges and universities offer distance learning degree programs and secondary schools provide cyber school options for K-12 students, technology provides numerous resources that enable individuals to have a self-directed learning experience. Several studies show these programs function most effectively when the \"teacher\" or facilitator is a full owner of virtual space to encourage a broad range of experiences to come together in an online format. This allows self-directed learning to encompass both a chosen path of information inquiry, self-regulation methods and reflective discussion among experts as well as novices in a given area. Furthermore, massive open online courses (MOOCs) make autodidacticism easier and thus more common.\n\nA 2016 Stack Overflow poll reported that due to the rise of autodidacticism, 69.1% of software developers appear to be self-taught.\n\n"}
{"id": "2646107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2646107", "title": "Baetylus", "text": "Baetylus\n\nBaetylus (also Baetyl, Bethel, or Betyl, from Semitic \"bet el\" \"house of god\") is a word denoting sacred stones that were supposedly endowed with life. According to ancient sources, these objects of worship were meteorites, which were dedicated to the gods or revered as symbols of the gods themselves. A baetyl is also mentioned in the Bible at Bethel in the Book of Genesis in the story of Jacob's Ladder.\n\nIn the Phoenician mythology related by Sanchuniathon, one of the sons of Uranus was named \"Baetylus\". The worship of baetyls was widespread in the Phoenician colonies, including Carthage, even after the adoption of Christianity, and was denounced by Augustine of Hippo.\n\nIn ancient Greek religion and mythology, the term was specially applied to the Omphalos, the stone supposed to have been swallowed by Cronus (who feared misfortune from his own children) in mistake for his infant son Zeus, for whom it had been substituted by Gaea. This stone was carefully preserved at Delphi, anointed with oil every day and on festive occasions covered with raw wool.\n\nIn Rome, there was the stone effigy of Cybele, called \"Mater Idaea Deum\", that had been ceremoniously brought from Pessinus in Asia Minor in 204 BC. Another conical meteorite was enshrined in the Elagabalium to personify the Syrian deity Elagabalus.\n\nIn some cases an attempt was made to give a more regular form to the original shapeless stone: thus Apollo Agyieus was represented by a conical pillar with a pointed end, Zeus Meilichius in the form of a pyramid. Other famous baetylic idols were those in the temples of Zeus Casius at Seleucia Pieria, and of Zeus Teleios at Tegea. Even in the declining years of paganism, these idols still retained their significance, as is shown by the attacks upon them by ecclesiastical writers.\n\nA similar practice survives today with the Kaaba's Black Stone, which was worshiped by pre-Islamic polytheists. \n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart makes his own fake driver's license. He rents a car with it and takes Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson on a road trip to Knoxville, Tennessee. In Knoxville, however, the car is destroyed, and they are stranded without any money or transportation. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate.\n\nThe episode was written by Richard Appel, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. The idea of a road trip was \"so exciting\" that the writers immediately knew they wanted to write it. The episode features cultural references to the 1991 film \"Naked Lunch\", American singer Andy Williams, and \"Look\" magazine. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics; \"Central Michigan Life\" named it the eighth-best episode of the series. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 7.2, and was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nPrincipal Skinner sends the students of Springfield Elementary on a \"go to work with your parents day\". Bart is forced to go to the DMV with his aunts Patty and Selma, and Lisa goes to the nuclear power plant with Homer. At the DMV, Bart makes himself a fake driver's license, which he, Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse use to rent a car.\n\nThe boys tell their parents they are going to attend the National Grammar Rodeo in Canada, but secretly take the rented car for a road trip to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In Knoxville, however, they discover that the fair was held fourteen years earlier. The boys' car soon gets destroyed, and they are left stranded.\n\nBart places a collect call to Lisa, who has spent the entire spring break with Homer at work, to ask her for advice. Lisa obtains Homer's promise that he will not get upset and she reveals Bart's predicament. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate and Bart as the courier.\n\nThe episode was written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a \"go to work with your parents day\" and Bart getting a driver's license. The \"go to work with your parents day\" idea appealed to Appel because it was something he \"lost the right\" to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he \"didn't have to do anything\" at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.\n\nThe writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought, \"What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?\" and came up with the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of \"The Simpsons\" at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was \"so exciting\" that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a \"funny unlikely place\". Oakley's show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done \"too often\" and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.\n\nThe episode was directed by Swinton O. Scott III. It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, \"The Simpsons\" was using traditional animation without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above. The car was difficult to animate because it had to \"look real\" and not \"boxy like a truck\". The car was based on a 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges. \"The Simpsons\" animator David Silverman said that the episode was \"probably the most difficult one\" Scott had to direct on the show.\n\nBart and his friends use Bart's fake license to see the R-rated 1991 film \"Naked Lunch\", an adaptation of William Burroughs's novel dealing with heroin addiction, homosexuality, and hallucinogens. While leaving the theater after viewing the film, Nelson Muntz remarks, \"I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.\" The boys also see an Andy Williams concert in Branson, Missouri, and the marquee advertising it outside reads \"Wow, he's still got it – \"Look\" magazine\", with \"Look\" having been out of business for 25 years when the episode first aired. On the road, the boys pick up a hitchhiker, who is based on the hitchhiker in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" horror film series. Principal Skinner books a vacation with AmeriWestica, a parody of America West Airlines.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Bart on the Road\" finished 63rd in the ratings for the week of March 25 to March 31, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.2. The episode was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Cops\", \"Party of Five\", \"Martin\", and \"Melrose Place\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it \"contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average.\" Dave Foster of DVD Times said that \"Bart on the Road\" is an episode which is built upon a \"frankly ludicrous\" idea which if the writers were to \"stumble upon\" now, \"we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup a great deal of consideration both on and off the screen.\" He thought the story was \"partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of.\" Foster thinks, \"what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he \"loves\" the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, \"and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me.\" Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: \"Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.\" Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of \"Central Michigan Life\" named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it \"outstanding\" and summarizing his review with: \"\"Bart on the Road\" is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable.\"\n\n"}

It premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in November 2011 and centres around John, a gay man who feels torn after meeting and falling in love with a woman.\n\nJohn has identified as \"gay\" his entire life and has been in a relationship with his boyfriend \"M\" for the last 7 years, with whom he shares an apartment and a family life. After the couple decide to take a break, John meets a woman named \"W\" on his daily commute. He is surprised to find himself developing a physical attraction to her and decides to lose his heterosexual virginity and have sex with a woman for the first time. After identifying as a gay man for many years, John discovers that he enjoys sex with women. He now feels torn between his longtime boyfriend and his new female lover, as the newly discovered joys of vaginal sex cause his sexual identity as a gay man to be thrown into confusion. As \"W\" teaches John the ins-and-outs of heterosexual intercourse, the relationship becomes more serious and they began to consider getting married and having children together. Eventually, he confesses that he has slept with a woman, causing his boyfriend to be offended by the infidelity and disgusted that John has been cheating with a woman. John tells M that he loves him, but that sex is better with W (\"her vagina is amazing\") and that she's a more fitting partner for him (\"She's better than you\"). The play's final scene, which is meant to be reminiscent of a cock fight, features John's boyfriend and John's girlfriend fighting over who will have him.\n\nThe play premiered at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on November 13, 2011.\n\nA production of the play was also put on at the Duke On 42nd Street, in New York City, in 2012.\n\nThe first major revival in the UK was commissioned by Chichester Festival Theatre in 2018 and played in the Minerva Theatre, directed by Kate Hewitt.\n\nMichael Billington of \"The Guardian\" gave the play 3 stars out of 5, praising the play as a \"sharp, witty study\" that was less about \"tortured bisexuality\" and more about the \"paralysing indecision that stems from not knowing who one really is.\" However, he notes that the play lacks social detail and character depth.\n\nAlison Croggon, writing in \"The Guardian\", gave the play 4 stars out of 5, described \"Cock\" as a story of a gay man's discovery of \"the unexpected pleasures of Cunt.\" She criticizes the play's \"uncomfortable subtext of misogyny\" and describes the plot as \"farcical\".\n\nIn \"The Village Voice\", Alexis Solokis describes the play as a \"visceral, funny, anguished\" production that \"pits boy against girl, cock against cunt.\" She likens the final dinner scene to a gladiator's ring or a boxing round that ends up being \"less a battle of the sexes than a battle of sexual orientation.\"\n\nWriting for the \"Sydney Arts Guide\", Richard Cotter described the play as a \"robust, ribald and bollocking production\" about a gay man who becomes \"cock shocked and cunt struck\" due to a \"newfound fondness for vaginal sex and a future view of breeding fecundity\". He praised Bartlett's \"crisp script\" which he felt perfectly describes the sexual confusion of a \"man child who has his cock and wants to eat it too.\" Cotter notes the sizzling tension between the female lover and the cuckolded boyfriend, which leads to the play's \"shattering climax\".\n\n\"Gay City News\" credited the play for \"tackling thorny issues rarely seen on stage\". Instead of the standard coming out narrative of the supposedly straight man \"succumbing to the power of cock, there's a supposedly gay guy with a boyfriend falling for pussy\", a theme that is handled by Bartlett's script with \"sensitivity and acerbic wit.\" The play is critiqued as \"gimmicky\", but the \"surprisingly steamy\" and \"brilliantly staged\" sex scene is praised for eliciting nervous laughter and shocked reactions in the audience.\n\nThe \"Lifestyle Hub\" described the play as \"a gay man's hilarious journey to heterosexual orgasm\" that explores the \"complexities of homosexuality.\" The play's \"honest\" and \"straightforward\" exploration of bisexuality shows that \"Gay or not, people fall in love to those who can give us happiness.\" By presenting the story of a \"bisexual gay\" man who develops an attraction to the opposite sex, the play demonstrates the truth that \"for some gays, they yearn for that happiness with other people regardless if they have vagina or... cock.\"\n\nThe play was banned in the local authority of Sotira, Cyprus for its gay content.\n"}

Set mainly in Paris in 1920, it is based on a possible real-life affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nStravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" has its Paris premiere on 29 May 1913. Coco is mesmerised by the power of Igor's composition, but the audience is scandalised by its discordant, rhythmic music and Nijinsky's primitive choreography.\n\nCoco finally meets Igor seven years later, at a dinner hosted by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. Igor has been forced to flee Russia – with his wife and four children – following the Russian Revolution. Coco invites him to bring his family to stay with her at her villa in Garches – 'Bel Respiro'.\n\n\"Couturière\" and composer soon begin an affair. Both experience a surge of creativity; while Coco creates Chanel No. 5 (with perfumer Ernest Beaux), Igor's compositions display a new, liberated style. But Igor's wife, Katerina, becomes ill with consumption and an unbearable tension takes hold of 'Bel Respiro' and its occupants.\n\nThe piano keyboard operates as a framework for the novel. There are eighty-eight chapters, corresponding to the number of keys on a piano.\n\n\nGreenhalgh adapted his novel for the 2009 film \"Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky\", directed by Jan Kounen and starring Anna Mouglalis and Mads Mikkelsen. The film was selected to occupy the prestigious closing slot at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 24 May 2009.\nThe riotous premiere of \"The Rite of Spring\" at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913 is legendary (see: The Rite of Spring#Premiere).\n\nIn the spring of 1920, Chanel was introduced to Stravinsky by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. During the summer, Chanel discovered that the Stravinsky family was seeking a place to live. She invited them to \"Bel Respiro\" until they could find a more suitable residence (they arrived in the second week of September and stayed until May 1921). Chanel also guaranteed the 1920 Ballets Russes production of \"The Rite of Spring\" against financial loss with an anonymous gift to Diaghilev, said to be 300,000 francs.\n\nThe personal relationships depicted in the novel are largely fictionalised. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer who had several affairs, including one with Chanel. Whereas Stravinsky never publicly referred to this alleged affair, Chanel spoke about it at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946 (the conversation was published thirty years later as \"l'Allure de Chanel\"). The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed both by Stravinsky's second wife, Vera, and by his close musical collaborator, Robert Craft. The Chanel fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.\n\n\n\"Coco and Igor\" has been translated into several languages, including:\n"}

{"id": "379754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379754", "title": "Culture of Gibraltar", "text": "Culture of Gibraltar\n\nThe culture of Gibraltar reflects Gibraltarians' diverse origins. While there are Spanish and British influences, a result of the territory's status as a British overseas territory and its proximity to Spain, the ethnic origins of most Gibraltarians are a mix of Andalusian Spaniards, Genoese, Maltese, Portuguese and British. The main religion is Christianity, the majority group being the Roman Catholic Church, then the Church of England. There is a long established Sephardic Jewish community, a number of Hindu Indians and a Moroccan Muslim population. Gibraltarians of Genoese origin came to The Rock in the 18th century, with the Maltese and Portuguese following in the 19th century, coming to work and trade in the British military base. Spanish Andalusian origins are the result of generations of intermarriage with inhabitants of surrounding towns.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the whole civilian population of The Rock was evacuated, in the interests of the British military, which decreed that \"the fortress comes first\". They were moved to the UK, particularly to Fulham and Kensington in London and Ballymena in Northern Ireland, as well as Jamaica and Madeira. This served to strengthen a Gibraltarian, as opposed to simply British, identity, and after the war, there was a successful campaign for repatriation.\n\nGibraltarians have historically been proud of their British heritage, and unlike the inhabitants of other territories, sought to strengthen, rather than loosen their ties with the UK and the British Crown, seeing themselves as \"more British than the British\". This sense of being British was particularly strong when the frontier with Spain was closed in 1969, and all communications links were severed. Until 16 December 2006, the only flights from Gibraltar Airport, were those to the UK. To some in Britain itself, this sense of \"pantomime Britishness\" is often looked upon with a mixture of incomprehension and ridicule. The fact that they are largely of Mediterranean appearance and speak an Andalusian Spanish variant, known as \"Llanito\" gives Gibraltarians a strong resemblance to Andalusian Spaniards, despite the Gibraltarian's distinct cultural heritage and identity.\n\nMost Gibraltarians are Roman Catholic, with the Diocese of Gibraltar being directly responsible to the Vatican. The Rock also forms part of the Church of England diocese covering mainland Europe, with a \"Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe\". There is also a Methodist Church and St Andrew's Church (part of the Church of Scotland).\n\nThere is a small (800 members) but very influential Jewish minority, active in business and politics, and five synagogues. Most Moroccans are Muslim, and there is a large mosque at Europa Point, the Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque, paid for by Saudi Arabia. Most Indians are Hindu, with their own local temple.\n\nAdditionally there are two very active congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses sharing the same Kingdom Hall; one has meetings in English and the other in Spanish.\n\nHistorically, cultural ties with Spain have been strong; a variant of Andalusian Spanish, \"Llanito\", being the vernacular language of the territory. Intermarriage between Gibraltarians and Spaniards resulted in many people having relatives on the other side of the frontier, known in Spanish as \"La Verja\" or 'the fence'. These people were badly affected by the closure of the frontier in 1969, which even saw telephone links severed, so that the only way that families could communicate was to shout across the border gates. Others took the more cumbersome and costly route of travelling first from Gibraltar to Tangiers by ferry and then taking another ferry to Algeciras, before taking a final coach to La Línea de la Concepción. A journey that would take half a day, when the end destination would have been within walking distance under normal circumstances.\n\nSince the frontier with Spain was reopened, ties with the hinterland, known as the \"Campo de Gibraltar\", have increased, with many buying property in places like La Línea de la Concepción, Sotogrande and further afield like the Costa del Sol, where prices are considerably lower. On the weekends, many flock across the frontier, with livelier nightclubs and bars than in Gibraltar. Younger Gibraltarians have considerable exposure to popular culture from Spain, and even \"vice versa\", the pop group \"Taxi\" having found success on the Spanish charts, virtually all of its songs being in Spanish. In addition, Gibraltarians of all ages are often avid supporters of Spanish football teams like FC Barcelona and Real Madrid C.F. as well as English teams such as Manchester United F.C. and Arsenal F.C..\n\nHowever, the Gibraltar Football Association's application for membership of UEFA, which would enable it to participate in the European Football Championships and the Football World Cup, has met with strong opposition from the Royal Spanish Football Federation. This is seen as yet another attempt to deny the existence of Gibraltar internationally.\n\nWhile Gibraltarians have multiple identities, seeing themselves to varying degrees as Gibraltarian, British and European, they do not generally identify with the Spanish state. While some in Britain's Foreign Office would like to see this closening of ties result in an 'osmosis' between The Rock and the \"Campo de Gibraltar\", there is no prospect of Gibraltarians accepting absorption into Spain. A trip across the frontier, even to La Línea, is still described as \"going to Spain\".\n\nBritish influence remains strong. Spanish may be widely spoken, but it is mainly used as a vernacular language, English being the only official language used in government, commerce, education and the media. Gibraltarians going on to higher education attend university in the UK and not in Spain. Many university graduates remain in the UK to pursue careers there. After the Second World War, most evacuees were repatriated, but some stayed on, while many also moved to the UK, thereby increasing family ties with the \"mother country\". While television from Spain is easily received and widely watched, the availability of British television via satellite, particularly Sky and the BBC, means that Gibraltarians are as familiar with British news and popular culture as people in the UK itself.\n\nMany Gibraltarians have names that reflect their mixed British and Mediterranean heritage usually with British first names like Keith, Kyle, Nigel, James, John, Marie, Natalie, Samantha, etc. with surnames originating from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. Surnames in Gibraltar include those originating from:\n\nE.g. Alecio, Bossano, Bottaro, Canessa, Cavilla, Culatto, Danino, Devincenzi, Felice, Ferrary, Ferro, Galliano, Imossi, Isola, Lavarello, Licudi, Massetti, Montegriffo, Olivero, Parody, Passano, Pitaluga, Pitto, Pizzarello, Povedano, Ramo, Risso, Sciacaluga, Stagnetto\nE.g.

Corby, Crisp, Feetham, Finlayson, Francis, Hook, Holmes, Jones, Randall, Richardson, Tewkesbury, Neish, McKnight\n\nE.g. Fitzgerald, Byrne, McCarthy\n\nWhile many outsiders use the terms 'Gibraltarians', 'people of Gibraltar' and 'residents of Gibraltar' interchangeably, strictly speaking, 'Gibraltarian' should be used only to describe those British citizens registered as having Gibraltarian status.\n\nThe UK originally regarded Gibraltarians as \"British Overseas Territories citizens\" (BOTC). In 1981 Gibraltarians successfully campaigned against this classification under the British Nationality Act, which would have deprived them of the right of abode in the UK, along with other colonial subjects. This was partly due to Gibraltar's status as part of the then European Community (now European Union). As a result, the Gibraltarians acquired the right to register as full British citizens.\n\nBritish passports issued in Gibraltar differ from those issued in the UK, in that they feature on the cover the word \"Gibraltar\" underneath \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". Whereas UK-issued passports state that \"Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of Her Majesty the Queen to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance\", Gibraltar-issued passports state that it is \"the Governor of Gibraltar\" who requests and requires this.\n\nIn 2004 an electoral register taken for the purposes of elections for the European Parliament showed that there were only 95 persons with the status of BOTC. Spain opposed the enfranchisement of the Gibraltarians in EU elections on the basis of the misconception that Gibraltarians were not full British citizens, but Commonwealth citizens, despite Commonwealth citizens living in the UK having always been able to vote in European elections.\n\nThere is a sizeable British expatriate minority, classified as 'Other British' and sometimes referred to by the native Gibraltarians rather pejoratively as \"guiris\". Historically, many came with the British military or as civil servants, with many marrying locals, and registering as Gibraltarians themselves, although any British citizen resident on The Rock for at least six months may vote. With the decline of the military presence, and the introduction of self-government, most from the UK instead come to work in the offshore finance sector. Many affluent people from the UK and elsewhere are classed as \"High Net Worth Individuals\", who receive tax concessions in return for buying property and residing locally for at least part of the year. More recently, many futures traders have come to the Rock, since the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) switched to electronic trading in 1999, thereby reducing the need to be in London. Some in Gibraltar have criticised the current government's policy, on the grounds that too much is being done to develop luxury properties for 'High Net Worth Individuals', and not enough to develop property for local people, a common complaint in many other small offshore jurisdictions. However, this should not be construed as hostility to British people or expatriates.\n\nFollowing the closure of the frontier, Gibraltar could no longer rely on Spanish workers commuting from the Campo, resulting in a labour shortage. Gibraltar instead looked to Morocco, with many workers coming over by ferry and staying in government hostels. Although they paid income tax and social insurance, they were denied the right to either permanent residence or citizenship, only having renewable work permits. This policy has prompted criticism from human rights groups in the UK, who describe living and working conditions for Moroccans in Gibraltar as degrading.\n\nMost Indians in Gibraltar are in business, many of the shops on the Rock's Main Street being Indian-owned. Initially not able to obtain citizenship, an increasing number have done so.\n\nThe Ministry for Sport, headed by the Hon Edwin Reyes, Minister for Sport and Culture, is responsible for sports policy matters and the provision of support to educational establishments and the governing bodies of sport in Gibraltar.\nUnder the chairmanship of the Minister, a Gibraltar Sports Advisory Council has been set up to advise the Government of Gibraltar on all matters relating to sport.\n\nThe Government recognizes the benefits derived from participation in sports and recreational activities. Importance is given to the availability of suitable facilities for the practice of sport. There are a large number of Sports facilities in Gibraltar, of varying standards. These provide opportunities for residents and visitors alike to enjoy sport as a recreation and for the serious sports enthusiasts to improve standards and participate in local and International events.\n\nThere are, at the moment, eighteen Gibraltar Sports Associations that have gained official recognition from their respective International Governing Bodies. Others, including the Gibraltar National Olympic Committee, have submitted applications for recognition which are being considered.\n\nIn late 1999 a Sports Development Unit was set up to assist Gibraltar governing bodies of sport and Educational establishments to improve standards.\n\nGibraltar's resident population is active in sport and standards are, by and large, rather high, in relation to Gibraltar's population. Participation in officially recognised or other sports events, abroad or in Gibraltar, is welcomed by Gibraltar sports persons.\n\nGibraltar's sports facilities are also being used by foreign sports persons for 'warm-weather' training. This practice is being encouraged and more and better facilities are projected in order to improve the product for locals and visitors alike.\n\nThe GFA was formed as the Gibraltar Civilian Football Association in 1895, changing to its current name in later years. It is one of the oldest football associations in the world.\n\nThe GFA was formed as an increasing number of football clubs were coming into existence in Gibraltar, and the association was designed to bring some form of organisation to the game there. Between the association's formation and 1907 the only football competition in Gibraltar was the Merchant's Cup. However, in 1907 the GFA established a league to complement the existing cup competition.\n\nBy 1901, the GFA had established a representative \"national\" team, competing against military teams. This representative team continued to play down the years, their highlight probably being a draw against Real Madrid in 1949.\n\nThe GFA affiliated with The Football Association in 1909, but is currently trying to become a full member of UEFA so that its national team can compete in the European Football Championship and the Football World Cup.\n\nThe Gibraltar Football League was established by the Gibraltar Football Association (GFA) in 1905. It originally contained eight member clubs, but it has grown over the years.\n\nIn 1909 the league grew to two divisions, and it currently has three divisions which clubs can be promoted and relegated between at the end of each season.\n\nCricket has been played in Gibraltar by British servicemen since the late 18th century. A cricket ground is known to have existed north of the Rock of Gibraltar in 1800. Civilians were playing the game as well as servicemen by 1822.\n\nThe Gibraltar Cricket Club was formed in 1883, and formed the backbone of civilian cricket until well into the 20th Century.\n\nIn 1890, a ship carrying the Australian cricket team on the way to a tour of England, docked in Gibraltar Harbour after a collision with two other ships. The Australians played a game against a Gibraltar Garrison team. The local side were dismissed for just 25, and the Australians won the game, scoring 150/8.\n\nGibraltar first participated in the ICC Trophy in 1982, and have played every tournament since, with the exception of the 2005 tournament, for which they failed to qualify. They have also competed in the European Championship on every occasion since it began in 1996.\n\nCampo Gibraltar Rugby Union Football Club plays all its games in nearby Spain.\n\nGibraltar has a small but thriving pop/rock scene. Its best-known band internationally is Melon Diesel (1995–2003), which gained considerable fame in both Spain and Latin America.\n\nGibraltarian cuisine has evolved over the past two centuries as a unique blend of various dishes, of which calentita is the most iconic.\n\n"}
{"id": "12331566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12331566", "title": "De se", "text": "De se\n\nA sentence such as: \"Peter thinks that he is pale\" where the pronoun \"he\" is meant to refer to Peter is ambiguous in a way not captured by the / distinction. Such a sentence could report that Peter has the following thought: \"I am pale\". Or Peter could have the following thought: \"he is pale\", where it so happens that the pronoun \"he\" refers to Peter, but Peter is unaware of it. The first meaning expresses a belief , while the second does not.\n\nThis notion is now thoroughly discussed in the philosophical literature, but especially in the theoretical linguistic literature, the latter because some linguistic phenomena clearly are sensitive to this notion.\n\nDavid Lewis's 1979 article \"Attitudes De Dicto and De Se\" gave full birth to the topic, and his expression of it draws heavily on his distinctive theory of possible worlds.\n\nBut modern discussions on this topic originate with Hector-Neri Casteñeda's discovery of what he called quasi indexicals (or “quasi-indicatorsl”): according to Casteñeda, the speaker of the sentence “Mary believes that she herself is the winner” uses the quasi-indicator “she herself” (often written “she∗”) to express Mary’s first-person reference to herself (i.e., to Mary). That sentence would be the speaker’s way of depicting the proposition that Mary would unambiguously express in the first person by “I am the winner”.\n\nA clearer case can be illustrated simply. Imagine the following scenario:\n\nPeter, who is running for office, is drunk. He is watching an interview of a candidate on TV, not realizing that this candidate is himself. Liking what he hears, he says: \"I hope this candidate gets elected.\" Having witnessed this, one can truthfully report Peter's hopes by uttering: \"Peter hopes that he will get elected\", where \"he\" refers to Peter, since \"this candidate\" indeed refers to Peter. However, one could not report Peter's hopes by saying: \"Peter hopes to get elected\". This last sentence is only appropriate if Peter had a hope, that is a hope in the first person as if he had said \"I hope I get elected\", which is not the case here.\n\nThe study of the notion of belief \"de se\" thus includes that of quasi-indexicals, the linguistic theory of logophoricity and logophoric pronouns, and the linguistic and literary theory of free indirect speech.\n\n"}
{"id": "1157613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1157613", "title": "Edmund Kemper", "text": "Edmund Kemper\n\nEdmund Emil Kemper III (born December 18, 1948) is an American serial killer who murdered ten people, including his paternal grandparents and mother. He regularly engaged in necrophilia. He is noted for his large size, at , and for his genius level IQ of 145.\n\nBorn in California, Kemper had a disturbed childhood. He moved to Montana with his abusive mother at a young age before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic by court psychiatrists and sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a criminally insane juvenile.\n\nReleased at the age of 21 after convincing psychiatrists he was rehabilitated, Kemper was regarded as non-threatening by his victims. He targeted young female hitchhikers during his killing spree, luring them into his vehicle and driving them to secluded areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered and violated. Kemper then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities.\n\nFound sane and guilty at his trial in 1973, he requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was suspended in California at the time, and he instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility. He has waived his right to a parole hearing several times and has said he is \"happy\" in prison.\n\nEdmund Emil Kemper III was born in Burbank, California on December 18, 1948. He was the middle child and only son born to Clarnell Elizabeth Kemper (née Stage, 1921–1973) and Edmund Emil Kemper II (1919–1985). \nEdmund II was a World War II veteran who, after the war, tested nuclear weapons in the Pacific Proving Grounds before returning to California, where he worked as an electrician. Clarnell often complained about Edmund II's \"menial\" electrician job, and he later said \"suicide missions in wartime and the atomic bomb testings were nothing compared to living with her\" and that Clarnell affected him \"more than three hundred and ninety-six days and nights of fighting on the front did.\"\n\nWeighing as a newborn, Kemper was already a head taller than his peers by the age of four. He was also intelligent but exhibited behavior such as cruelty to animals: at the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive; once it died, he dug it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike. Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family about killing the cat. At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him, and kept pieces of it in his closet until his mother found them.\n\nKemper had a dark fantasy life: he performed rituals with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he did not try to kiss his teacher, he replied: \"If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first.\" He also recalled that as a young boy he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. He stated in later interviews that some of his favorite games to play as a child were \"Gas Chamber\" and \"Electric Chair\", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.\n\nKemper had a close relationship with his father and was devastated when his parents separated in 1957, causing him to be raised by Clarnell in Helena, Montana. He had a severely dysfunctional relationship with his mother: a neurotic, domineering alcoholic who would frequently belittle, humiliate and abuse him. Clarnell often made her son sleep in a locked basement because she feared that he would harm his sisters, regularly mocked him for his large size—he stood at by the age of 15—and derided him as \"a real weirdo.\" She also refused to coddle him for fear that she would \"turn him gay,\" and told the young Kemper that he reminded her of his father and that no woman would ever love him. Kemper later described her as a \"sick angry woman,\" and it has been postulated that she suffered from borderline personality disorder.\n\nAt the age of 15, Kemper ran away from home in an attempt to reconcile with his father in Van Nuys, California. Once there, he learned that his father had remarried and had a stepson. Kemper stayed with his father for a short while until the elder Kemper sent him to live with his paternal grandparents, who lived on a ranch in the mountains of North Fork. Kemper hated living in North Fork; he described his grandfather as \"senile,\" and said that his grandmother \"was constantly emasculating me and my grandfather.\"\n\nOn August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), was sitting at the kitchen table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed a rifle that his grandfather had given him for hunting. He then returned to the kitchen and fatally shot his grandmother in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts mention that she also suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.\n\nWhen questioned by authorities, Kemper said that he \"just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma,\" and that he killed his grandfather so that he would not have to find out that his wife was dead. Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote that with these murders, \"In his way, [Kemper] had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother.\" Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic before sending him to the criminally insane unit of the Atascadero State Hospital.\n\nAt Atascadero, California Youth Authority psychiatrists and social workers strongly disagreed with the court psychiatrists' diagnosis. Their reports stated that Kemper showed \"no flight of ideas, no interference with thought, no expression of delusions or hallucinations, and no evidence of bizarre thinking,\" and recorded that he had an IQ of 136. He was re-diagnosed and stated as having a \"personality trait disturbance, passive-aggressive type.\" Later on in his time at Atascadero, Kemper tested higher at an IQ of 145.\n\nKemper endeared himself to his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to administer psychiatric tests to other inmates. One of his psychiatrists later stated: \"He was a very good worker and this is not typical of a sociopath. He really took pride in his work.\" Kemper also became a member of the Jaycees while in Atascadero and stated that he developed \"some new tests and some new scales on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,\" specifically an \"Overt Hostility Scale,\" during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists. After his second arrest, Kemper stated that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, and admitted that he learned a lot from the sex offenders to whom he administered tests; for example, they told him it was best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses.\n\nOn December 18, 1969, his 21st birthday, Kemper was released on parole from Atascadero. Against the recommendations of psychiatrists at the hospital, he was released into the care of Clarnell—who had remarried and taken the surname Strandberg, then divorced again—at 609 A Ord Street, Aptos, California, a short drive from where she worked as an administrative assistant at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Kemper later demonstrated further to his psychiatrists that he was rehabilitated, and on November 29, 1972, his juvenile records were permanently expunged. The last report from his probation psychiatrists read:\n\nWhile staying with his mother, Kemper attended community college in accordance with his parole requirements and had hoped he would become a police officer, but was rejected because of his size—at the time of his release from Atascadero, Kemper stood tall—which led to his nickname \"Big Ed\". Kemper maintained relationships with Santa Cruz police officers despite his rejection to join the force and became a self-described \"friendly nuisance\" at a bar called the Jury Room, which was a popular hangout for local law enforcement officers. He worked a series of menial jobs before securing employment with the State of California Highway Department (now known as the California Department of Transportation). During this time, his relationship with Clarnell remained toxic and hostile, with mother and son having frequent arguments which their neighbors often overheard. Kemper later described the arguments he had with his mother around this time, stating:\n\nWhen he had saved enough money, Kemper moved out to live with a friend in Alameda. Here he still complained of being unable to get away from his mother, as she regularly phoned him and paid him surprise visits. He often had financial difficulties, which resulted in him frequently returning to his mother's apartment in Aptos.\n\nThe same year he began working for the Highway Department, Kemper began dating a 16-year-old Turlock High School student to whom he would later become engaged. Also during this year, he was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle that he had recently purchased. His arm was badly injured, and he received a $15,000 settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car's driver. While driving around in the 1969 Ford Galaxie he bought with his settlement money, he noticed a large number of young women hitchhiking, and began storing plastic bags, knives, blankets, and handcuffs in his car. He then began picking up girls and peacefully letting them go—according to Kemper, he picked up around 150 hitchhikers, any of whom would have been suitable—before he felt homicidal sexual urges, which he called his \"little zapples,\" and began acting on them.\n\nBetween May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper embarked on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders of his mother and her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would decapitate them, perform irrumatio on their severed heads, have sexual intercourse with their corpses, and then dismember them. During this 11-month spree, he killed five college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often go hunting for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university where she worked. He recalled: \"She would say, 'You're just like your father. You don't deserve to get to know them'.\" Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target, his mother, and that the humiliating acts he committed on his mother's corpse support this hypothesis.\n\nOn May 7, 1972, Kemper was driving in Berkeley when he picked up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was familiar with from his work at the Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero to not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, then stabbed and strangled Pesce to death before killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he \"brushed the back of [his] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [him]\" before adding that \"[he] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that\" after grazing her breast, despite murdering her minutes later.\n\nKemper put both of the women's bodies in the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and returned to his apartment. He was stopped on the way by a police officer for having a broken taillight but the officer did not detect the corpses in the car. Kemper's roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took photographs of, and had sexual intercourse with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of Pesce's remains or a trace of Luchessa.\n\nOn the evening of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to hitchhike to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, pulling a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside—Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint—where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her. He subsequently packed her body into the trunk of his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, \"admiring [his] catch like a fisherman,\" and returned to his apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sexual intercourse with the corpse before dismembering and disposing of the remains in a similar manner as his previous two victims. Koo's mother called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information, but did not receive any responses regarding her daughter's location or status.\n\nOn January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had moved back in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann \"Cindy\" Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a .22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body in the trunk of his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother left for work the next morning, he had sexual intercourse with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub.\n\nKemper kept Schall's severed head for several days, regularly engaging in irrumatio with it, before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother \"always wanted people to look up to her.\" He discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all but Schall's head and right hand were discovered and \"pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.\" Police and a pathologist determined that she had been hacked to death, then cut into pieces with a power saw.\n\nOn February 5, 1973, after a heated argument with his mother, Kemper left his house in search of possible victims. With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only get into cars with University stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at UCSC. He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen \"Allison\" Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which reassured Liu to also enter. He then fatally shot Thorpe and Liu with his .22 caliber pistol and wrapped their bodies in blankets.\n\nKemper again brought his victims back to his mother's house, this time beheading them in his car and carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sexual intercourse with. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week later, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in an interview as to why he removed his victims' heads before performing sexual acts on the bodies, he explained: \"The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off ... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head.\"\n\nOn April 20, 1973, after coming home from a party, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg awakened her son with her arrival. While sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, \"I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now.\" Kemper replied \"No, good night!\" He then waited for her to fall asleep and returned to bludgeon her with a claw hammer then slit her throat with a knife. He subsequently decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; Kemper stated that he \"put [her head] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour ... threw darts at it,\" and ultimately, \"smashed her face in.\" He also cut out her tongue and larynx and put them in the garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. \"That seemed appropriate,\" Kemper later said, \"as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years.\"\n\nKemper then had sexual intercourse with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor \"Sally\" Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, Kemper strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body. He subsequently put her corpse in a closet, obscured any outward signs of a disturbance and left a note to the police reading:\n\nKemper left the scene, driving nonstop to Pueblo, Colorado. After not hearing any news on the radio about the murders of his mother and Hallett when he arrived in Pueblo, he found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he personally knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited for the police to arrive and take him into custody, where he also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked why he turned himself in, Kemper said: \"The original purpose was gone ... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time ... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said to hell with it and called it all off.\"\n\nKemper was indicted on eight counts of first-degree murder on May 7, 1973. He was assigned the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson. Due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit suicide in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.\n\nThree court-appointed psychiatrists found Kemper to be legally sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis that he was once psychotic. Fort also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that he sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed the prospect of the infamy associated with being labeled a murderer. Kemper later recanted the confession of cannibalism.\n\nCalifornia used the M'Naghten standard which held that for a defendant to \"establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\" Kemper appeared to know that the nature of his acts was wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the women because he wanted them \"for myself, like possessions,\" and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind. He said two beings inhabited his body and that when the killer personality took over it was \"kind of like blacking out.\"\n\nOn November 8, 1973, the six-man, six-woman jury convened for five hours before declaring Kemper sane and guilty on all counts. He asked for the death penalty, requesting \"death by torture.\" However, with a moratorium placed on capital punishment by the Supreme Court at that time, he instead received seven years to life for each count, with these terms to be served concurrently, and was sentenced to the California Medical Facility.\n\nIn the California Medical Facility, Kemper was incarcerated in the same prison block as other notorious criminals such as Herbert Mullin and Charles Manson. Kemper showed particular disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders at the same time in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as \"just a cold-blooded killer ... killing everybody he saw for no good reason.\" Kemper manipulated and physically intimidated Mullin, who, at , was more than a foot shorter than he. Kemper stated that \"[Mullin] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment.\"\n\n, Kemper remains among the general population in prison and is considered a model prisoner. He is in charge of scheduling other inmates' appointments with psychiatrists and is an accomplished craftsman of ceramic cups. He is also a prolific reader of books on tape for the blind; a 1987 \"Los Angeles Times\" article stated that at the time he was the coordinator of the prison's program and had personally spent over 5,000 hours narrating books with several hundred completed recordings to his name.\nWhile imprisoned, Kemper has participated in a number of interviews, including a segment in the 1982 documentary \"The Killing of America\", as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary \"Murder: No Apparent Motive\". His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers. FBI profiler John E. Douglas described Kemper as \"among the brightest prison inmates\" he ever interviewed and capable of \"rare insight for a violent criminal.\" Kemper is forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has stated that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; at the end of his \"Murder: No Apparent Motive\" interview, he said: \"There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime.

He was denied parole that year, as well as at hearings in 1980, 1981 and 1982. He subsequently waived his right to a hearing in 1985. He was denied parole at his 1988 hearing, where he said \"society is not ready in any shape of form for me. I can't blame them for that.\" He was denied parole again in 1991, and in 1994. He then waived his right to a hearing in 1997, and in 2002. He attended the next hearing, in 2007, where he was again denied parole. Prosecutor Ariadne Symons said: \"We don't care how much of a model prisoner he is because of the enormity of his crimes.\" Kemper waived his right to a hearing again in 2012. In 2016, attorney Scott Currey, who represented Kemper at his 2007 hearing, relayed to the media that Kemper believes no one is ever going to grant him parole and that he is \"happy going about his life in prison.\" Kemper was denied parole in July 2017 and is next eligible in 2024.\n\n\n\n"}

Specifically, the eye–hand span is typically measured from the location of central visual input, and stretches between the syllable or chord currently being typed or performed, and the lateral location of the simultaneous fixation. This distance may be measured either in units of linear measurement or in characters or other \"bits\" of data. Some authors refer to the eye–hand span as the \"perceptual span\" for the visual information perceivable around the region of center of vision used in reading, and in some cases including peripheral input. The eye–hand span is analogous to the eye–voice span in reading language aloud and in singing.\n\n"}

{"id": "101196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101196", "title": "Gaeltacht", "text": "Gaeltacht\n\nIn Ireland, the term \"Gaeltacht\" refers individually to any, or collectively to all, of the districts where the government recognises that the Irish language is the predominant vernacular, or language of the home.\n\nThe Gaeltacht districts were first officially recognised during the 1920s in the early years of the Irish Free State, following the Gaelic Revival, as part of a government policy aimed at restoring the Irish language.\n\nIt is now recognised that the Gaeltacht is threatened by serious language decline. Research published in 2015 showed that of the 155 electoral divisions in the Gaeltacht, only 21 are communities where Irish is spoken on a daily basis by two-thirds or more of the population. Two-thirds is regarded by some academics as a tipping point for language survival.\n\nIn 1926 the official Gaeltacht was designated as a result of the report of the first Gaeltacht Commission \"Coimisiún na Gaeltachta\". The exact boundaries were not defined. The quota at the time for classification as Gaeltacht was 25%+ of the population to be Irish-speaking, although in many cases Gaeltacht status was accorded to areas that were linguistically weaker than this. The Irish Free State recognised that there were predominately Irish-speaking or semi-Irish-speaking districts in 15 of its 26 counties.\n\nIn the 1950s another Gaeltacht Commission concluded that the Gaeltacht boundaries were ill-defined. It recommended that Gaeltacht status be based solely on the strength of language use in an area. In the 1950s, Gaeltacht districts were initially defined precisely and excluded many areas in which the number of Irish speakers had declined. Gaeltacht areas were recognised in seven of the state's 26 counties (nominally Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry, and Waterford).\n\nThe Gaeltacht boundaries have not officially been altered since then, apart from minor changes:\n\nA study in 2005 by \"An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta\" (The Educational Council for Gaeltacht and Irish-Medium Schools, which was established in 2002 under the Education Act 1998) said that Gaeltacht schools were facing a crisis. It forecast that, without support, few of them would be teaching in Irish in 20 years' time. This would threaten the future of the Gaeltacht. Parents felt that the educational system did not support their efforts to pass on Irish as a living language to their children. The study added that a significant number of Gaeltacht schools had switched to teaching in English, and others were wavering.\n\nIn 2002 the third \"Coimisiún na Gaeltachta\" stated in its report that the erosion of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht was now such that it was only a matter of time before the Gaeltacht disappeared. In some areas, Irish had already ceased to be a community language. Even in the strongest Gaeltacht areas, current patterns of bilingualism were leading to the dominance of English. Policies implemented by the State and voluntary groups were having no effect.\n\nThe report recommended that a new language reinforcement strategy was required, one that had the confidence of the community itself. The Commission recommended, among many other things, that the boundaries of the official Gaeltacht should be redrawn. It also recommended a comprehensive linguistic study to assess the vitality of the Irish language in the remaining Gaeltacht districts.\n\nThe study was undertaken by \"Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge\" (part of the National University of Ireland, Galway). On 1 November 2007 \"Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht\" (\"A Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Usage of Irish in the Gaeltacht\") was published.\n\nConcerning Gaeltacht boundaries, it suggested creating three linguistic zones within the Gaeltacht region:\n\n\nThe report suggested that Category A districts should be the State's priority in providing services through Irish and development schemes. It also said that Category C areas that showed a further decline in the use of Irish should lose their Gaeltacht status.\n\nThe 2006 Census data shows that of the 95,000 people living within the official Gaeltacht, approximately 17,000 belonged to Category A areas, 10,000 to Category B, and 17,000 to Category C, leaving about 50,000 in Gaeltacht areas that did not meet the minimum criteria. In response to this situation, the government introduced the Gaeltacht Bill 2012. Its stated aim was to provide for a new definition of boundaries based on language criteria, but it was criticised for doing the opposite of this.\n\nCritics drew attention to Section 7 of the Bill, which stated that all areas \"currently within the Gaeltacht\" would maintain their current Gaeltacht status, regardless of whether Irish was used. This status could only be revoked if the area failed to prepare a language plan (with no necessary relationship to the documented number of speakers). The Bill was also criticised for placing all responsibility for the maintenance of Irish on voluntary organisations, with no increase in government resources.\n\nThe annual report in 2012 by the Language Commissioner for Irish reinforced these criticisms by emphasising the failure of the State to provide Irish-language services to Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and elsewhere. The report said that Irish in the Gaeltacht was now at its most fragile and that the State could not expect that Irish would survive as a community language if the State kept forcing the use of English on Gaeltacht communities.\n\nA report published in 2015, \"Nuashonrú ar an Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: 2006–2011\", said that on present indicators, Irish will cease to be used as a community language in the Gaeltacht within ten years. This finding has not been universally accepted. \n\nThe Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the leadership of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is responsible for the overall Irish Government policy with respect to the Gaeltacht, and supervises the work of the \"Údarás na Gaeltachta\" and other bodies. \"RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta\" is the \"Raidió Teilifís Éireann\" (RTÉ) radio station serving the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers generally. TG4 is the television station which is focused on promoting the Irish language and is based in the County Galway Gaeltacht.\n\nIn March 2005, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Éamon Ó Cuív announced that the government of Ireland would begin listing only the Irish language versions of place names in the Gaeltachtaí as the official names, stripping the official Ordnance Survey of their English equivalents, to bring them up to date with road signs in the Gaeltacht, which have been in Irish only since 1970. This was done under a Placenames Order made under the Official Languages Act.\n\nAt the time of the 2006 census of the Republic of Ireland, the population of the Gaeltacht was 91,862, approximately 2.1% of the state's 4,239,848 people, with major concentrations of Irish speakers located in the western counties of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, and Kerry. There were smaller concentrations in the counties of Cork and Waterford in the south and Meath in the east. The most recent census of 2016 however shows that the population of the Gaeltacht was 96,090. This shows a rise of 4.5% from 2006.\nThe Gaeltacht districts have historically suffered from mass migration. Being at the edge of the island they always had fewer railways and roads, and poorer land to farm. Other influences have been the arrival of non-Irish speaking families, the marginal role of the Irish language in the education system and general pressure from the English-speaking community. There is no evidence that periods of relative prosperity have materially improved the situation of the language.\n\nThe Donegal (or Tyrconnell) Gaeltacht ( or \"Gaeltacht Thír Chonaill\") has a population of 24,744 (Census 2011) and represents 25% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Donegal Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 26% of total Gaeltacht land area. The three parishes of the Rosses, Gweedore and Cloughaneely constitute the main centre of population of the Donegal Gaeltacht. There are over 17,132 Irish speakers, 14,500 in areas where it is spoken by 30–100% of the population and 2,500 in areas where it is spoken by less than 30%. In 2006 there were 2,436 people employed in a full-time capacity in Údarás na Gaeltachta client companies in the Donegal Gaeltacht. This region is particularly popular with students of the Ulster dialect; each year thousands of students visit the area from Northern Ireland. Donegal is unique in the Gaeltacht regions, as its accent and dialect is unmistakably northern in character. The language has many similarities with Scottish Gaelic, which are not evident in other Irish dialects.\n\nGweedore in County Donegal is the largest Gaeltacht parish in Ireland, which is home to regional studios of \"RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta\". It has produced well-known traditional musicians, including the bands Altan and Clannad, as well as the artist Enya. All three have recorded music in Irish.\n\nThe Galway County () and Galway City () Gaeltachtaí have a combined population of 48,907 and represent 47% of total Gaeltacht population. The Galway Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 26% of total Gaeltacht land area.\n\nThere is also a third-level constituent college of NUIG called Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in An Cheathrú Rua and Carna. The national Irish-language radio station Raidió na Gaeltachta is located in Casla, \"Tuairisc\" online newspaper in Bearna, and national TV station TG4 in Baile na hAbhann. Galway city is home to the Irish language theatre Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe.\n\nThe Kerry Gaeltacht () consists of two areas – the western half of Gaeltacht Corca Dhuibhne (\"Dingle Peninsula\") and central and western parts of Iveragh Peninsula (\"Uíbh Ráthach\"). The largest settlement in Corca Dhuibhne is Dingle and the largest in Iveragh Peninsula is Ballinskelligs. The Kerry Gaeltacht has a population of 8,729 (6,185 Irish speakers) and represents 9% of total Gaeltacht population. The Kerry Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 9% of the total Gaeltacht area.\n\nThe Mayo Gaeltacht () as of 2011 has a total population of 10,886 and represents 11.5% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Mayo Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 19% of the total Gaeltacht land area and comprises three distinct areas – Erris, Achill Island and Toormakeady. There are 6,667 Irish speakers, with 4,000 living in areas where the language is spoken by 30–100% of the population and 2,500 living in areas where it is spoken by less than 30%.\n\nThe Cork Gaeltacht () consists of two areas – Muskerry and Cape Clear Island. The Muskerry Gaeltacht has a population of 3,895 people (2,951 Irish speakers) and represents 4% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Cork Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 6% of the total Gaeltacht area. The largest Muskerry settlements are the villages of Baile Mhic Íre (Ballymakeera), Baile Bhuirne (Ballyvourney) and Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh (Ballingeary).Cill na Martra (Kilnamartyra)\n\nThe Waterford Gaeltacht (Gaeltacht na nDéise, ) is ten kilometres (six miles) west of Dungarvan. It embraces the parishes of Rinn Ua gCuanach (Ring) and An Sean Phobal (Old Parish). The Waterford Gaeltacht has a population of 1,784 people (1,271 Irish speakers) and represents 2% of total Gaeltacht population.\n\nAll education in Gaeltacht na nDéise is carried out through the medium of Irish. There are two Pre-schools, two Primary level national schools, one Secondary School, Meánscoil San Nioclás and Coláiste na Rinne, a private boarding school and summer college. Gaeltacht na nDéise was one of the few Gaeltacht areas in which the percentage of daily Irish speakers increased in the recent updated comprehensive linguistic survey of the Gaeltacht.\n\nThe Meath Gaeltacht () is the smallest Gaeltacht area and consists of the two villages of Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib. Navan, from Baile Ghib, is the main urban centre within the region, with a population of more than 20,000. The Meath Gaeltacht has a population of 1,771 and represents 2% of the total Gaeltacht population. The Meath Gaeltacht encompasses a geographical area of . This represents 1% of the total Gaeltacht land area.\n\nThe Meath Gaeltacht has a history quite different from that of the country's other Irish speaking regions. The two Gaeltachtaí of Baile Ghib and Ráth Cairn are resettled communities. The Ráth Cairn Gaeltacht was founded in 1935 when 41 families from Connemara in West Galway were resettled on land previously acquired by the Irish Land Commission. Each was given to farm. Baile Ghib (formerly Gibbstown) was settled in the same way in 1937, along with Baile Ailin (formerly Allenstown). In the early years a large percentage of the population returned to Galway or emigrated, but enough Irish speakers remained to ensure that Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghib were awarded Gaeltacht status in 1967. The original aim of spreading the Irish language into the local community met with no success, and the colonists had to become bilingual.\n\nIn 2001, the British government ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, giving it a status comparable to that of the Welsh language or Scottish Gaelic. This included undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters. Compliance with the state's obligations is assessed periodically by a Committee of Experts of the Council of Europe.\n\nThe Gaeltacht Quarter, Belfast (\"An Cheathrú Ghaeltachta\") is an area in Belfast where the Irish language is actively promoted. It is situated mainly along the Falls Road and has Gaelscoileanna (Irish-medium primary schools), a Gaelcholáiste (Irish-medium secondary school) and Naíonraí (crèches), together with a restaurant and agencies where Irish is used and Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich, a cultural centre which also houses Raidió Fáilte (Northern Ireland's only full-time Irish-language radio station). This has grown from the Shaw's Road urban Gaeltacht in the southwest of Belfast. St. Mary's University College Belfast, also situated on the Falls Road, is the only teaching college with a dedicated Irish Medium Unit. It is also home to \"An t-Aisionad\" (resource centre) which translates literature into Irish and publishes it for use in schools and other organisations in Ireland.\n\nAn area in southern County Londonderry centred on Slaghtneill (\"Sleacht Néill\") and Carntogher (\"Carn Tóchair\"), which had gone from being 50% Irish-speaking in 1901 to having only a few speakers by the end of the century, has seen a language revival since the setting up of a naíscoil in 1993 and a gaelscoil in 1994. In 2008 two local organisations launched a \"strategy for the rebirth of the Gaeltacht\", based on Irish-medium primary and secondary education. Speaking at the launch, Éamon Ó Cuív, the Republic's Minister for the Gaeltacht, said that the area was \"an example to other areas all over Ireland which are working to reestablish Irish as a community language\".\n\nDublin and its suburbs are reported to be the site of the largest number of daily Irish speakers, with 14,229 persons speaking Irish daily, representing 18 percent of all daily speakers. In a survey of a small sample of adults who had grown up in Dublin and had completed full-time education, 54% of respondents reported some fluency in Irish, ranging from being able to make small talk to complete fluency. Only 19% of speakers spoke Irish three or more times per week, with a plurality (43%) speaking Irish less than once a fortnight.\n\nParts of County Clare were recognised as Gaeltacht areas following recommendations made by Coimisiún na Gaeltachta 1925. This was enacted by law under the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts 1929-2001. There were Irish speakers west of Ennis in Kilmihil, Kilrush, Doonbeg, Doolin, Ennistimon, Carrigaholt, Lisdoonvarna and Ballyvaughan.\n\nStatutory Rules and Orders 1933 No. 85 Vocational Education (Gaeltacht) Area 1933 was made under section 103 of the Vocational Education Act 1930 and sets outs the names of District Electoral Divisions in Ennis, Ennistymon, Kilrush and Miltown Malbay that form part of the Gaeltacht in the Administrative County of Clare. This Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 85 of 1933) appears to be still on the statute books.\n\nIn West Clare a group called Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir (The Clare Irish Language Speaking Development Committee) aims to have the area recognised once more as a Gaeltacht. It has been claimed that native speakers who received grants under Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, a scheme first established by the State in 1933 to encourage the use of Irish in Gaeltacht regions, still live in the county and speak the language daily. It has also been claimed that there are up to 170 people in County Clare who are daily speakers of Irish. The committee aims to develop local networks amongst Irish speakers in County Clare and elsewhere until such time as recognition is obtained.\n\nOn Bank Holiday Monday, 6th August 2018, \"Club Leabhar Chill Mhíchíl 2018 - Kilmihil Irish Language Book Club\" was established during Kilmihil Festival of Fun to perfect the use of the Irsh Language through Irish language books and bilingual books and An tAifreann mass leaflets.\n\nIn December 2017, Coiste Forbartha Gaeltachta Chontae an Chláir published its sixth annual edition of \"In Ard an Tráthnóna Siar\" [2012-2017], the Kilmihil-based Irish language journal devoted to the restoration of traditional Irish in West Clare. \n\nOn Census night 2016, there were up to 300 daily Irish speakers in County Clare. \n\nIn December 2016, the language committee published its first cárta Nóllag / Christmas Card and its first innovative calendar title Féilire na nGael 2017 and its third information stand to commemorate the decline of Clare Irish. The committee published an illustrative guide to Cúirt an Mheán Oíche and a sunburst and sword of light crest to remind people of the Easter Rising 1916 throughout Ireland including West Clare. The committee also secured the publication of Leabhar na Beatha in Kilmihil from 2016 to 2018. \n\nThe objective of Gaeltacht Chontae an Chláir under the leadership of Seosamh Mac Ionnrachtaigh is to preserve what's left of Clare Irish up to the current date and to encourage self-contained local language development networks independent of each other to take more to street Irish and Irish in the home and its steady development and progress at community level without State intervention except where deemed appropriate. Language planning measures are in train but the resurgence of Clare Irish will be a difficult path without individual effort at all age groups across Clare. \n\nThe Irish Language Grant Scheme promotes public interest in the language, an appreciation of the language and practice of the language. The scheme improves the standard of written Irish and revitalises Irish in the county.\n\nThe leading traditional Irish language dictionary on spoken native Irish is Impreasin na Gaeilge A-H and Impreasin na Gaeilge I - Z or Impressions of the Irish Language by Seosamh Mac Ionnrachtaigh from Kilrush West Clare.\n\nThe Permanent North American Gaeltacht is an area near Erinsville, Ontario in Canada. It has no permanent residents but serves as a resource centre for Irish speakers throughout North America. It was officially opened in 2007.\n\nIrish colleges are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses, students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. There are a number of different Irish colleges for students to choose from throughout the country. Many of the colleges while providing a number of activities and events for young people through the Irish language will be known for or specialise in a specific category. For example, Coláiste Lurgan is commonly known for its promotion of the Irish language through music, Coláiste Aodáin for water sports and team games, and others for GAA sports.\n\nAs with the conventional schools, the Department of Education sets out requirements for class sizes and qualifications required by teachers. Some courses are college based and others provide for residence with host families in Gaeltacht areas, such as Ros Muc in Galway, Ráth Cairn in County Meath, and Teileann and Rann na Feirste in County Donegal, with instruction given by a \"bean an tí\", or Irish-speaking landlady.\nPopular Irish colleges/Gaeltachts include: Lurgan, Spleodar, Colaiste Sheosaimh and Uisce. Most Irish language summer colleges for teenagers in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by CONCOS, who are based in Leitir Móir.\n\n\n"}

The hem resembles a handkerchief that is held by the centre so that its corners hang down as points.\n\nHandkerchief hems have been used in women's tops and skirt hems for centuries in many cultures, to add a flattering drape, especially over the hips. They can be seen in women's clothing in art from Ancient Greece, and appeared in Parisian fashions in the 1910s-1920s, such as the dresses of designer Madeleine Vionnet. Jean Patou followed Vionnet's lead, using the handkerchief hem to transition hemlines away from the shorter Flapper styles he had helped popularize, and towards the longer lengths that were fashionable during the 1930s.\n\nIn the simplest design, a square of fabric is cut with an opening in the middle for the waistband. When the skirt is put on, the four corners hang down as points. More panels of material can be used to increase the number of corners, or points, along the hem.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, handkerchief hems returned as a trend in women's clothing. Since the design involves pleats that drape, the effect is achieved with lightweight, flowing fabrics. In 2003, the trend was evident in bohemian styles such as designs by American clothing label Free People. In 2004, handkerchief hems were modelled at Milan fashion shows.\n\n"}

It is a thick porridge made from \"korkot\" (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich meat, usually chicken or lamb. Herbs were substituted for meat in \"harissa\" when Armenian religious days required fasting and penance. The extremely long cooking process is an essential part of the \"harissa\" tradition. Like other ritual dishes, the time taken for preparation is part of its cherished value.\n\nHarissa came from the word Harees () is derived from the verb () which means to mash or to squash.\nThe dish has been passed on since ancient times. Stories differ as to the origins of the dish. According to Armenian lore, the patron saint of Armenia, Gregory the Illuminator, was offering a meal of love and charity to the poor. There weren't enough sheep to feed the crowds so wheat was added to the cooking pots. They noticed that the wheat was sticking to the bottom of the cauldrons. Saint Gregory advised, \"\"Harekh!\" Stir it!\" Thus, the name of the dish, \"harissa\", came from the saint's own words. \"Harissa\" has been offered as a charity meal ever since. The dish is traditionally served on Easter day. It is still prepared by many Armenians around the world and is also considered the national dish of Armenia.\n\nHarissa is known for helping the Armenians of Musa Ler to survive during the resistance of 1915.\n\nHarissa is also very common in Lebanese villages, across its different ethnic communities, where it is usually cooked on religious occasions in a big pot in a village gathering. Additionally, Harissa is used by the Assyrians as a dish on \"Eeda Zoora,\" Christmas, and \"Eeda Gura,\" Easter. Harissa is very similar to a popular dish among Arab countries of the Persian Gulf known as harees which is made of meat and finely ground wheat.\n\nHarise is also a common dish in Iraqi cuisine.\n\nHarissa is very famous in Kashmir in India and it is prepared during winter.\n\nIt is similar to kashkeg, a kind of homogeneous porridge made of previously stewed and boned chicken or lamb and coarsely ground soaked wheat (typically shelled wheat).\n"}

Thai clothes can be classified according to six distinct periods of history; beginning with the 11th Buddhist century. Previously, traditional Thai clothes were worn daily; however, they are now only worn on auspicious functions such as Thai traditional marriage ceremonies.\n\nDvaravati began in Buddhist century 11-16. During this period the north city Dvaravati ruled the country. The style was influenced by the Indian style that used colored stones as accessories. Men's clothes during that time the pants were similar to Indian loincloths with a silk top or no top. Accessories were golden necklaces and metal belts. On women's clothes the tops were usually one cloth brace on the shoulder or tightly wrapped around the breasts with a long skirt from waist to ankle. Accessories were similar to those of the men.\n\nLopburi started at the end of Buddhist century 16-19. This period was ruled by the Lopburi. Fashion was influenced by the Khmer. Men's clothes were short \"sarong\"s worn tight around the waist about knee length with a metal belt. Women's clothes were sometimes without top or a cloth wrapping the breasts, with a short sarong. Both ends of the sarong came together in the front to look like a stripe.\n\nSukhothai became the fashion in Buddhist century 19-20. The city of Sukhothai united the cities which were ruled by different kings. Men's clothing was a simple full sleeved top with a long \"V\" shape neck and a cloth brace on their shoulders. The loincloth was made of silk with a big metal or golden belt. Women's clothing was a long silk sarong with flowers painted on it. The top normally is a full sleeved silk cloth. Married women wore one cloth wrapped around the breasts made of silk or other fabric.\n\nAyutthaya was the style during the end of Buddhist century 19-21. Ayutthaya was the capital for 417 years, the longest period since Thailand was under one king. Many styles followed the period of Ayutthaya but they changed frequently, under the influence of many countries and are not considered traditional.\n\nHistorically, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called \"chong kraben\". Men wore their \"chong kraben\" to cover the waist to halfway down the thigh, while women covered the waist to well below the knee. Bare chests and bare feet were accepted as part of the Thai formal dress code, and is observed in murals, illustrated manuscripts, and early photographs up to the middle of the 1800s. In the royal court, royalty and nobility men are wearing lomphok, a tall pointed hat, made of white cloth wrapped around a bamboo frame, and Khrui, a light outer garment worn as a gown or robe in certain ceremonial settings. Traditional Thai attire has changed significantly throughout the Rattanakosin period.\n\nEarly Rattanakosin central Thai dressed as same as Ayutthaya period, however, after the Second Fall of Ayutthaya and repeated Burmese invasions, central Thai women began cutting their hair in a crew-cut short style, which remained the national hairstyle until the 1900s. Prior to the 20th century, the primary markers that distinguished class in Thai clothing were the use of cotton and silk cloths with printed or woven motifs, but both commoners and royals alike wore wrapped, not stitched clothing. \n\nFrom the 1860s onward, Thai royals \"selectively adopted Victorian corporeal and sartorial etiquette to fashion modern personas that were publicized domestically and internationally by means of mechanically reproduced images.\" Stitched clothing, including court attire and ceremonial uniforms, were invented during the reign of King Chulalongkorn. Western forms of dress became popular among urbanites in Bangkok during this time period.\nDuring the early 1900s, King Vajiravudh launched a campaign to encourage Thai women to wear long hair instead of traditional short hair, and to wear \"pha sinh\" (ผ้าซิ่น), a tubular skirt, instead of the \"chong kraben\" (โจงกระเบน), a cloth wrap.\n\nOn 15 January 1941, Plaek Pibulsonggram issued a Thai cultural mandate to modernize and westernize Thai dress, by deeming long-practiced customs of wearing underpants, wearing no shirt, or wearing a wraparound cloth, as forms of inappropriate public attire.\n\nThe formal Thai costume, known in Thai as (, literally \"Thai dress of royal endorsement\"), includes several sets of dress, designed as the Thai national costume in formal occasions. Although described and intended for use as national costume, they are of relatively modern origins, having been conceived in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}

This film was the first animation project produced by now-defunct anime distributor A.D. Vision. It had premiered at the 2004 Comic-Con convention. The film was released on DVD October 9, 2004, and had been aired on A.D. Vision's Anime Network. This film has not been rated. A Blu-ray Disc edition of the film was released by AEsir Holdings and Section23 Films on September 20, 2011.\n\nThe movie begins in 15th century Sweden. Hope, the beautiful and innocent daughter of Matthias (a skilled mercenary who is in actuality Lucifer himself), is accused of being the devil's consort. Hope is sentenced by the town priest to be burned at the stake. Matthias, through a proxy, offers her life if she surrenders herself to him and joins him in Hell. At first she agrees to his terms, but Matthias's plan to corrupt her is soon met with unanticipated resistance, as Hope rejects his scheme and eventually finds herself transformed into the powerful warrior Lady Death, who challenges Lucifer for control of Hell itself.\n\nMany of the events from the comics are altered in the animated film. Instead of summoning a demon with whom she bargains for her life, Hope's spell summons a pair of flying demons that carry her physically to Hell (restoring her badly burned body in the process), dropping her in the court of her father, who intends for her to join him by his side. When she refuses, he casts her out, only for her to side with the master blacksmith Cremator, an escaped slave of his, and to lead an army of hellspawn creatures against him. In this continuity, her curse is to be trapped in Hell for as long as one of Lucifer's allies remains alive. Unlike in the comic, Lady Death is presented as more of a heroine whose goal isn't to destroy all life on earth, but to liberate Hell from Lucifer's tyranny.\n\nThe castle of Matthias is based on Duurstede Castle.\n\n\nGeneral reception has mostly been negative. Mike Dungan of Mania.com (then known as AnimeOnDvd.com) gave the film a C. Dungan states that the script limits the appeal of the movie. However, the animation and acting were fine in that this was a good first effort for ADV.\n\n"}

Many of these phytochemicals have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total.\n\nThese phytochemicals are divided into (1) primary metabolites such as sugars and fats, which are found in all plants; and (2) secondary metabolites – compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function. For example, some secondary metabolites are toxins used to deter predation and others are pheromones used to attract insects for pollination. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are inulin from the roots of dahlias, quinine from the cinchona, morphine and codeine from the poppy, and digoxin from the foxglove.\n\nChemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side effects.\n\nIn Europe, apothecaries stocked herbal ingredients for their medicines. In the Latin names for plants created by Linnaeus, the word \"officinalis\" indicates that a plant was used in this way. For example, the marsh mallow has the classification \"Althaea officinalis\", as it was traditionally used as an emollient to soothe ulcers. Ayurvedic medicine, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are other examples of medical practices that incorporate medical uses of plants. Pharmacognosy is the branch of modern medicine about medicines from plant sources. Plants included here are those that have been or are being used medicinally, in at least one such medicinal tradition.\n\nModern medicine now tends to use the active ingredients of plants rather than the whole plants. The phytochemicals may be synthesized, compounded or otherwise transformed to make pharmaceuticals. Examples of such derivatives include digoxin, from digitalis; capsaicine, from chili; and aspirin, which is chemically related to the salicylic acid found in white willow. The opium poppy continues to be a major industrial source of opiates, including morphine. Few traditional remedies, however, have translated into modern drugs, although there is continuing research into the efficacy and possible adaptation of traditional herbal treatments.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father was recognized for his distinguished service in the Civil War and support for the presidency helped to establish her political conviction. After the war, the family left for Chicago where her father opened and managed a steel rolling mill and the family joined the Methodist Church. The changes led her mother to become an invalid, no longer able to care for the family, and McDowell became responsible for her five brothers.\n\nIn the family’s first few years in Chicago, McDowell was involved in various relief efforts and religious involvement. During the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, McDowell and her father worked to help refugees by transporting people and their belongings to the makeshift camp away from the fire. When aid was received from Ohio, McDowell took the lead in the relief effort and was later recognized by President Rutherford B. Hayes for her service. She later organized religious classes for young people that attracted prominent figures in the temperance movement, students from Northwestern University, and residents of Chicago.\n\nMcDowell first began work for Frances Williard, founder of the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement, where she met Elizabeth Harrison. With Harrison's support, McDowell started teaching kindergarten classes at the Hull House and helped to organize the women’s club under Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Star.\n\nIn 1893, The University of Chicago was in its second year of existence and wanted to start an initiative to become involved in the city and looked to the Settlement movement to do so. Working with the university’s Christian Union, Jane Addams, and Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, the university established the University of Chicago Settlement House in the Stock Yard District on January 1, 1894 at 4688 South Gross Avenue. Under Addams’ recommendation, they hired McDowell to head a larger Back of the Yards settlement house. Under her leadership, McDowell worked with residents of the stockyard to improve their neighborhood though education of politic rights and civic consciousness. A major initiative she headed early on was the establishment of civic clubs for both men and women.\n\nIn 1894, McDowell opened the University of Chicago Settlement House to alleviate the crowded, unsanitary housing immigrant families often faced. There, she organized classes, provided kindergarten education and accesses to vocational schools, bathing facilities, concerts, lectures, and clubs.\n\nShe lobbied the U.S. government to establish the Women’s Bureau to study living and working conditions of women and children.\n\n"}

Inaugurated in 2011, it is the first major literary festival in the southern Caribbean and largest literary festival in the Anglophone Caribbean. A registered non-profit company, the festival has as its title sponsor the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC). Other sponsors and partners include First Citizens Bank, One Caribbean Media (OCM), who sponsor the associated OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature, CODE (sponsors of the Burt Award), and the Commonwealth Foundation.\n\nThe NGC Bocas Lit Fest also works in collaboration with other international festivals and initiatives, and has hosted events showcasing Caribbean writing talent in New York, at the Brooklyn Book Fair, the Harlem Book Fair and elsewhere in the US. In 2012, Bocas partnered with the Edinburgh World Writers Conference (EWWC) as part of a lineup of 14 countries delivering a multinational series of talks marking the 50th anniversary of the five-day meeting of \"an impressive, sensational and sometimes scandalous group of writers\" at the first Edinburgh International Festival of Music and Drama. The Bocas Lit Fest was described by Claire Armitstead of \"The Guardian\" as \"expansive in its cultural reach, reflecting a region that has responded to its own colonisation over the centuries by seeding its people to every continent\".\n\nThe Bocas Lit Fest organising team comprises Marina Salandy-Brown, founder and director; programme director Nicholas Laughlin, editor of the \"Caribbean Review of Books\" and of \"Caribbean Beat\"; Funso Aiyejina, prize-winning author and dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Education at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine; Marjorie Thorpe, former professor of literature at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, independent bookseller Joan Dayal of Paper Based Bookshop; Danielle Delon, editor of \"The Letters of Margaret Mann\"; local businesswoman Lucita Esau; and Patrice Matthews, a marketing and media professional.\n\nThe festival's name derives from the Spanish word for mouth, \"boca\" – the organ of speech and song and storytelling – while also referencing the Bocas del Dragón (the Dragon's Mouths), which are the narrow straits off Trinidad’s north-west peninsula that connect the Gulf of Paria to the Caribbean Sea. For centuries, the Bocas were the gateways connecting Trinidad to the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe festival's strapline is: \"Celebrating books, writers, and writing from the Caribbean and the rest of the world\".\n\nThe main venues are the National Library (NALIS) and the Old Fire Station, in downtown Port of Spain, with satellite evening events at venues around the city.\n\nThere is also a full programme of activities for young readers, sponsored by KFC, and in the run-up to the festival storytelling events take place in Tobago, Couva, Chaguanas, San Fernando, Point Fortin, Mayaro and Arima.\n\nThe Bocas Lit Fest was held for the first time in 2011 – from Thursday, 28 April to Sunday, 1 May – including readings, panel discussions, workshops, film screenings and art exhibitions. Attracting 3,500 attendances over the four days. the festival reflected its founder's aims \"to promote literature and publishing in Trinidad and Tobago and the need for Caribbean writing to be celebrated everywhere\".\n\nThe scores of writers taking part in the 2012 festival, both locally based and from abroad, included Fred D'Aguiar, Earl Lovelace, Vahni Capildeo, Chika Unigwe, Monique Roffey, Kenneth Ramchand, Mervyn Morris, Achy Obejas, Rabindranath Maharaj, George Lamming, professor of genetics Steve Jones, Merle Hodge, Rahul Bhattacharya, and Michael Anthony. The festival featured readings, discussions, performances, workshops, screenings of films based on Caribbean writing and music.\n\nIn 2013, the South+Central NGC Bocas Lit Fest, scheduled to take place annually in November, was inaugurated. In November 2014, NGC Bocas Lit Fest South was hosted by Southern Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA) in San Fernando, birthplace of the writer Sam Selvon, and the festival commemorated the 20th anniversary of his death.\n\nIn 2014, \"Festival Radio\" was inaugurated, to \"bring the festival experience to listeners around the globe\", as well as attracting \"a lot of attention on social media, spurred on in part by the active new media presence of the festival itself\".\n\nIn February 2017 the Bocas Lit Fest was named as one of \"the world’s very best literary events\" in a list of \"20 Best Literary Festivals Around the World That You Should Attend\" chosen by Penguin Random House - The Writers' Academy, alongside other prestigious festivals including Hay, Edinburgh and Jaipur. \n\nAnother accolade, from Jonathan Ford of the \"Financial Times\" in May 2017, noted: \"In the seven years since Bocas launched, Caribbean writers have been heaped with international accolades — the 2015 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, four Forward Prizes for Poetry between 2014 and 2016, and a slew of National Book Awards. Virtually all the writers honoured — including Marlon James, Kei Miller and Vahni Capildeo — were first recognised at this extraordinary little festival in the tropics, a place that is only far away to those who refuse to read.\"\n\nThe centrepiece of the NGC Bocas Lit Fest festival is the announcement at an award ceremony of the overall winner of the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature. Entries for the prize are in the categories of fiction, non-fiction and poetry for a book by a Caribbean writer published in the previous year, with the overall winner being chosen by a panel of judges from the three genre winners. The winners have been: in 2011, Derek Walcott's poetry collection \"White Egrets\", in 2012 Earl Lovelace's novel \"Is Just a Movie\", in 2013 Monique Roffey's novel \"Archipelago\", in 2014 Robert Antoni's novel \"As Flies to Whatless Boys\", in 2015 Vladimir Lucien's \"Sounding Ground\" (poetry), in 2016 Olive Senior's \"The Pain Tree\" (fiction), and in 2017 Kei Miller's \"Augustown\" (fiction).\n\nThe Emerging Caribbean Writers Prize, formerly known as the Hollick Arvon Caribbean Writers Prize, is jointly administered by the Bocas Lit Fest and the creative writing organisation Arvon, and is an award that allows an emerging Caribbean writer living and working in the Caribbean to devote time to developing or finishing a literary work in-progress, with support from an established writer as mentor. Sponsored by the Hollick Family Charitable Trust for a period of three years (2013–15), and announced at the Bocas Lit Fest in 2012 by Sue Woodford-Hollick, the prize was awarded to writers in three literary genres over consecutive years: fiction in 2013; non-fiction in 2014; and poetry in 2015. The first winner in 2013, for fiction, was Barbara Jenkins of Trinidad & Tobago. The winner in 2014, for non-fiction, was Jamaican Diana McCaulay. In 2015, the prize was awarded to poet Danielle Boodoo-Fortuné.\n\nThe Henry Swanzy Award for Distinguished Service to Caribbean Letters (named after the influential producer of the BBC radio programme \"Caribbean Voices\" that ran from 1943 to 1958) was inaugurated at the 2013 NGC Bocas Lit Fest, as an \"annual lifetime achievement award to recognise service to Caribbean literature by editors, publishers, critics, broadcasters, and others\". In 2013 the award was made to John La Rose (posthumously) and Sarah White of New Beacon Books. In 2014, the award was jointly won by Professors Kenneth Ramchand and Gordon Rohlehr. The 2015 recipient was Margaret Busby. The 2016 award went to Jeremy Poynting of Peepal Tree Press. In 2017 the award went to Paperbased Book Store owner Joan Dayal.\n\nThe Bocas Lit Fest additionally administers the Burt Award sponsored by CODE (Canadian Organization for Development Through Education) for Caribbean authors of literature for young adults, launched in 2013.\n\nThe first-place winner in 2014 was A-dZiko Gegele, in second place was Joanne Hillhouse and in third place Colleen Smith-Dennis. In 2015, first prize went to Imam Baksh. In second place was Diana McCaulay and third was Lynn Joseph. The 2016 prize winner was debut novelist Tamika Gibson, with Florenz Webbe Maxwell of Bermuda second, and Danielle Y. C. McClean in third place. The 2017 winner was Viviana Prado-Núñez (Puerto Rico/USA), with Kevin Jared Hosein (Trinidad & Tobago) as runner-up, and Lisa Allen-Agostini (Trinidad & Tobago) in third place.\n\nLaunched in 2012 was the Caribbean Literature Action Group (CALAG), a new partnership between the NGC Bocas Lit Fest, the British Council, and Commonwealth Writers, aimed at supporting the development of Caribbean writing and publishing.

While indigenous artists embrace contemporary Western art media, their arts also include pre-Columbian art forms. Indian art of aboriginal origin includes ceramics, baskets, weaving and threading, feather art and leather work. Indian art of a hybrid nature includes the embroideries, lace, woodcarving and different metal products. Paraguay is particularly known for its indigenous featherwork and basket weaving.\n\nThe handmade products of Paraguay are of a great variety and comprise ceramic articles, as well as embroideries and sewn articles, as well as wood, baskets, leather work and silver work. Pre-Columbian ceramics made in the Paraguayan territory were rustic and made from terracotta clay. They were painted in red, and occasionally in black and white. The clay used to be worked by hand. Some tribes incised their pottery with decorations before firing.\n\nThe Spanish, especially the Jesuits, influenced the technical level of production and the finishing of the native ceramics. These had been characterized by extreme simplicity and production of functional goods. The Jesuits taught the Indian population in the missions.\n\nCeramic products produced today by some Indian groups include jars, flower vases, and some without specific shapes, as well as water vases. Among those, the pottery most widely sold today due to its beauty and quality comes from Tobaty and Ita.\n\nBaskets are woven from the fibers of canes. Paraguayan Indians weave open baskets, baskets with handles, hand fans, shades, place mats, and especially \"piri\", the typical Paraguayan hat of the country men. Leather products, such as bags, hats, sacks, etc. have their main centers in Limpio and Luque, where also centers for production of beautiful baskets. Materials for wickerwork include indigenous bromeliads including tacuarembó and caraguatá, as well as pindo palm leaves.\n\nThe rich Indian basket production of Paraguay is dividing by plantations. For example, in some communities where the main crop is cassava, baskets are solid with great storage capacity. The \"ajaka mbya\" basket is an average of 35 centimeters diameter with rigid supports that can to hold the heavy weight of the cassavas.\n\nThe \"ajak\" is a basket made by weaving \"tacuarembo\" and dark \"guembepi\", making braided figures as well as geometric ones, in accordance with the Guaraní concept of beauty. The baskets associated with the production of corn are smaller and lighter and are constructed from pindo palm tree leaves.\n\nCeramics are an ancient art form in Paraguay, and ancient ceramics have been preserved through the centuries. Ceramics range from the utilitarian—cooking vessels, water jugs—to the sacred, such as funerary urns.\n\nA precolumbian art form, featherwork provides distinctive personal adornment. Brilliantly colored feathers are fashioned into anklets, bracelets, collars, headdresses, and even entire cloaks. Guaraní medicine men used to wear full feather cloaks. The Guaraní create feather headdresses called \"jeguaka\" worn during ceremonial occasions.\n\nIndian embroidery, weaving, and other textile art are an important source of income for the domestic economy. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Indians used a horizontal piece of material to make hammocks with cotton threads, as well as the baskets and bags to transport food and nets for fishing and hunting.\n\nLater on they also knitted ponchos and other clothing items. As with ceramics, the Jesuits also introduced new techniques in this area, using the vertical frame to make the threads. Tribal artisans began producing sheets, towels, blankets, table clothes and other articles, as well as the special hammocks, which were knitted and still are with cotton threads and ornaments on the sides.\n\nNew technical resources brought by the Spanish inspired the typical cotton dresses, the ones called \"ao poi\", made with a fine thread, and the \"povyi\", a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful \"ñanduti\", which means \"spider web\" in Guaraní language and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made.\n\nThe most coveted textiles are the Ñandutí embroideries made in the cities of Guarambaré and Itauguá. Woven ponchos, known for their beauty and quality, are made by the ethnic groups Lengua, Maskoy, Nivaclé, and Wichí from the Gran Chaco. They use sheep wool tinted in red and the ones called of 60 lists, made in Pirayú and Yataity, in the Guairá Department.\n\nAncient indigenous peoples of Paraguay carved petroglyphs into stone, particularly in the hills of Amambay Department.\n\nWood is carved into ceremonial masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as \"apyká\", and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies. Gourds are also carves with images.\n\nThe Chamacoco ethnic group, from the Alto Paraguay Department, used dresses during their annual ritual called \"Debylyby.\" These are knitted of special fibers. Associated masks are carved from the karaguata tree and adorned with feathers from Chaco birds.\n\nThe Chamacocos used a \"pupo\", a protective vest made of karaguata. The \"pupo\" is knitted when the fibers are wet; these become rigid when dry and can serve as armor. They protected the wearer from the arrows of the enemies.\n\nThe weaving of Karaguata is an important element of the Indian art. It is an expression of the Indian people of the Gran Chaco. The bags of Karaguata are some of the most common applications of fiber twining. Collector's bags are mainly used by women, who carry them on their backs and have a form of a large half moon. Hunting bags are smaller, rectangular, carried by men on their shoulders.\n\nThe Pai Tavytera from Eastern Paraguay and Brazil are known for their necklaces made from carved wood and colorful seeds of different fruits. They use \"urucú\", a red dye made from \"Bixa orellana\" for body painting. Personal adornment is made from feathers, such as those of the toucan, and cotton. Labrets are made from resin. Men typically weave baskets, while women make ceramics. They are also being consulted in interpreting ancient rock art in Amambay.\n\nThe Toba tribe makes textiles from colorful wool threads, as well as the traditional bags, \"piri\" hats and carandilla leaf baskets.\nThe Mbayá Indians have a special ability in making baskets of natural \"tacuara\", that are decorated with drawings of \"Guembepi\" and animals of the zone, as well as their necklaces and wood carving.\n\nThe \"ayoreos bagas\" are one of the coveted Indian handiwork. These bags are made with karaguata fibers and exemplify rustic Indian beauty in its conception. The adherence to traditional aesthetics makes them extremely attractive. The Ayoreo also make dishes and spoons of Palo Santo wood and feather art.\n\nThe members of the Maka tribe are excellent weavers. Their traditional blankets, belts, and other elements are knitted with colorful threads.\n\nAva Guaraní are highly skilled at making baskets and hammocks. They use karaguata fibers, as well as guembepi for baskets that represent a novelty in the Indian work of the country.\n\nThe art produced by these two ways of living, nomadic and sedentary, reflect the difference of each one. The communities based in the recollection system are nomads. Therefore, their lifestyle allows for a more flexible and open culture, with many adaptations. In the other extreme, the Guaraní agricultural society is very attached to the land and its natural cycles, and naturally presents a conservative tendency, which can be closed to innovations. They distinguish their own from the other's property and have ongoing issues about the need to absorb or reject the foreign influences.\n\nDespite the differences in these societies and the special characteristics of each one, scholars say that it is possible to establish some shared elements in all Indian communities who live or have lived in Paraguay. Indian art – through its symbols and the free exercise of tribal languages – is one of the most important manifestations of indigenous culture in Paraguay.\n\nBoth the collectors and the agricultural societies have as a social nucleus, a mythical body-ritual, from where they can articulate and develop political power, in the judicial order, free time, beauty, and religion.\n\nThe mythical axis mundi-ritual, in essence the Indian cosmology, is composed of communal ceremonies. These are the moments when the community, through songs, dances and rites, show their identity. Indian art finds its first fundamental origins in those ceremonies and in the human body–its principal support. Feathers use in ornamentation, tattoos, and body paintings in the case of the Chaco Indians and the feather art among the Guaraní constitute basic elements of the Indian art in Paraguay.\n\nA number of museums are dedicated to showcased indigenous Paraguayan art. These include the Guido Boggiani Museum in San Lorenzo and in Asunción, the Andrés Barbero Ethnographic Museum, the Museum of Indigenous Art, and the Museo del Barro (Museum of Mud).\n\n\n\n"}

Plotkin built an auditorium with a revolving stage and forty rustic cabins and incorporated as the Pine Brook Country Club in 1930. Plotkin's dream was to market the rural lakeside club as a summer resort for people to stay and enjoy theatrical productions. The Club remained in existence until major fighting broke out in Europe in the mid-1940s and was reorganized as a private lake association in 1944. \n\nPine Brook is best known for having been the 1936 summer rehearsal headquarters of the most important experiment in the history of American theatre.The Group Theatre (New York) was formed in New York City in 1931 by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg and was made up of actors, directors, playwrights and producers. During this summer the artists \"s[a]ng for their supper\" while taking classes, attempting to reorganize their structure, and beginning rehearsals on \"Johnny Johnston\", their next Broadway production.\n\nIncluding and in addition to the Group Theatre, some of the artists who are known to have spent the summer at Pine Brook at one time or another were: Stella Adler, Leonard Bernstein, Marc Blitzstein, Roman Bohnen, Phoebe Brand, Morris Carnovsky, Carol Channing, Montgomery Clift, Lee J.

It was here that Green and Weill wrote the screenplay and music for the controversial Broadway play Johnny Johnson (musical), which was titled after the most frequently occurring name on the American casualty list of World War I. It was also during this time that Lotte Lenya had her first American love affair with Paul Green. \n\nIn 1944 Pine Brook went into receivership and was sold, reorganized and chartered as the Pinewood Lake Association, a private lake association.\n"}

Rambhadracharya is a spontaneous poet and writer in Sanskrit, Hindi, Awadhi, Maithili, and several other languages. He has authored more than 100 books and 50 papers, including four epic poems, a Hindi commentary on Tulsidas' \"Ramcharitmanas\", a Sanskrit commentary in verse on the Ashtadhyayi, and Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi scriptures. He is regarded as one of the greatest authorities on Tulsidas in India, and is the editor of a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas.\n\nMany Sanskrit and Hindi authors have critiqued and reviewed the works and the literary style of Rambhadracharya, prominent among them being Kalika Prasad Shukla, Rewa Prasad Dwivedi, Devarshi Kala Nath Shastry and Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra. In his conversations and speeches, Rambhadracharya often employs extemporaneously composed verses in \"Upajāti\" metre and the \"Daṇḍaka\" style with long adjectives. In his poems, the three classical styles of \"Pāñcālī\", \"Vaidarbhī\" and \"Lāṭī\" are dominant. Some distinguishing features of his Sanskrit poetry include use of rhyme (\"Antyānuprāsa\"), employment of a variety of metres including many Prakrit and Hindi metres, new usages, and the \"Gīti\" style. Rambhadracharya is credited with reviving the letter-poem (\"Patrakāvya\") genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years. His Sanskrit commentaries have a broad coverage with theories supported by evidence, novel interpretations, elaborate derivations, and an independent style with quotes from the works of Tulsidas accompanied by Sanskrit poetic translations. His Hindi lyrical works follow the Bhojpuri tradition with emphasis on both the aesthetics and emotion. Optimism, devotion to motherland, and patriotism are some more features of his works which are seen in several poems and plays.\n\nRewa Prasad Dwivedi writes in his Sanskrit poem dedicated to Rambhadracharya that he is an encyclopedia of learning whose literature is like numerous Narmada rivers flowing out simultaneously, and in whose literary works Shiva and Parvati delight while performing Tandava and Lasya.\n\nDevarshi Kala Nath Shastry writes in his review of Rambhadracharya's works that Rambhadracharya is an accomplished and eloquent poet who is the foremost among scholars and is also well-versed in all scriptures. Shastry writes that among Sanskrit poets, only Śrīharṣa (poet of \"Naiṣadhīyacaritam\") has been described as having such wonderful command over Sanskrit as Rambhadracharya has.\n\nShastry writes that Rambhadracharya even talks in extemporaneously composed poetry with Sanskrit scholars, usually in the \"Upajāti\" metre. Rambhadracharya uses with great effect the \"Daṇḍaka\" style with Sanskrit adjectives in his speeches. Shastry recounts a use of a long sentence in the \"Daṇḍaka\" style at a speech in Jaipur in July 2003 by Rambhadracharya, in which one sentence with multiple adjectives lasted around seven minutes and was \"replete with poetic beauty\".\n\nShastry says that rhyme (\"Antyānuprāsa\") is a distinguishing feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, which is most evident in the poetic work \"Ājādacandraśekharacaritam\" on the life of Chandrashekhar Azad. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda, various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya.\n\nDinkar notes that in the poems of Rambhadracharya, the three poetical styles of \"Pāñcālī\" (secondary figurative sense with short and sweet-sounding compounds), \"Vaidarbhī\" (with compounds and soft contexts and without many figures of speech) and \"Lāṭī\" (with precise contexts and without many figures of speech) are dominant.\n\nThe principal Rasa (emotion or mood) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam is the \"Vīra Rasa\" (the emotion of heroism). Like the previously composed Mahākāvyas, Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam has all the eight Rasas as enunciated by Bharata Muni. These Rasas are – \"Śringāra\" (eros and beauty), \"Vīra\" (heroism or bravery), \"Hāsya\" (mirth), \"Raudra\" (fury), \"Karuṇa\" (compassion), \"Bībhatsa\" (disgust), \"Bhayānaka\" (horror), \"Adbhuta\" (amazement). Apart from this Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam also has the ninth \"Rasa\" as propounded by Mammaṭa – the \"Śānta\" Rasa (calmness), and the three new Rasas as – \"Bhakti\" (devotion), \"Vatsala\" (parental love) and \"Preyas\" (love). The principle Rasas in the \"Ashtavakra (epic)\" are the \"Vīra\" and the \"Karuṇa\". Like the 10th canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmacaritamānasa, twelve verses in the seventeenth canto (17.42–17.53) of Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam have all the twelve Rasas used in the same context. While the pure Śṛngāra Rasa is the dominant Rasa in \"Bhṛṅgadūtam\", \"Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī\" is a work primarily of Vātsalya Rasa mixed with Śṛngāra Rasa. \"Rāghavagītaguñjana\" and \"Bhaktigītasudhā\" are works full of the Bhakti Rasa.\n\nShastry critiqued the work \"Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam\" in the January 2003 issue of the Sanskrit monthly \"Bhāratī\". Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of language which has not been seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father, Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri. The 20th canto has 63 Sanskrit verses (20.1–20.63) composed in Prakrit metres, namely Kirīṭa (Meduradanta, a type of Sapādikā), Ghanākṣarī, Duramilā (Dvimilā, a type of Sapādikā), Mattagajendra (a type of Sapādikā), Śaṭpada and Harigītaka. The language of the verses in Sanskrit, but the metres and the prosody rules follow Prakrit prosody. An example is the following verse (20.13) in the Ghanākṣarī metre, which consists of 32 syllables in every foot.\n\nDevanagari<br>\nअशरणशरण प्रणतभयदरण \nधरणिभरहरण धरणितनयावरण \nजनसुखकरण तरणिकुलभरण \nकमलमृदुचरण द्विजाङ्गनासमुद्धरण । \nत्रिभुवनभरण दनुजकुलमरण \nनिशितशरशरण दलितदशमुखरण \nभृगुभवचातकनवीनजलधर राम \nविहर मनसि सह सीतया जनाभरण ॥ \n\nIAST<br>\naśaraṇaśaraṇa praṇatabhayadaraṇa \ndharaṇibharaharaṇa dharaṇitanayāvaraṇa \njanasukhakaraṇa taraṇikulabharaṇa \nkamalamṛducaraṇa dvijāṅganāsamuddharaṇa । \ntribhuvanabharaṇa danujakulamaraṇa \nniśitaśaraśaraṇa dalitadaśamukharaṇa \nbhṛgubhavacātakanavīnajaladhara rāma \nvihara manasi saha sītayā janābharaṇa ॥ \n\nDr. Brajesh Dikshit, Sanskrit scholar from Jabalpur, says that \"Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam\" combines the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics - it has two leading characters like in Bhāravi's \"Kirātārjunīyam\", the poetic excellence and variety of prosodic metres is like in Śrīharṣa's \"Naiṣadhīyacaritam\", while the length and extent of the work is like the \"Śiśupālavadham\" of Māgha.\n\nAbhiraj Rajendra Mishra, former Vice-Chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University wrote in the introduction to Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam that the epic nourishes the tradition of Ṛṣis, and with this composition the contemporary Sanskrit literature has been blessed.\n\nDr. Shivram Sharma, Sanskrit scholar from Varanasi, writes in his review of \"Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam\" on the eleven Upanishads that it is replete with novel thoughts and Sanskrit derivations, and that Rambhadracharya has shown Rama as the \"Pratipādya\" of the all Upanishads by the wonderful dexterity of \"Vyutpatti\"s of Sanskrit words. Sharma adds that the style of interspersed Sanskrit translations of the works of Tulsidas further enhances the literary merit of the work. Dr. Vishnu Dutt Rakesh, Hindi professor and author from Haridwar, says that the \"Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam\" on Bhagavad Gita has the broadest coverage of all Sanskrit commentaries on Gita with \"convincing discussion, propounding of theories with evidence, contradiction of others, creative genius and an independent style of composition\". Dikshit says that the \"Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam\" on the Prasthānatrayī is formidable and adorns the Ramananda tradition with greatness. He adds that the \"Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam\" on Narada Bhakti Sutra and Śrīrāmastavarājastotram are successful in establishing the five \"Prasthāna\"s in place of the three \"Prasthāna\"s of Prasthānatrayī. Dr. Ram Chandra Prasad, author of bilingual English and Hindi commentaries on the Ramcharitmanas, says that the \"Mahavīrī\" commentary is \"adorned with erudition\" and considers it to be \"the best exposition of Hanuman Chalisa.\"\n\nKalika Prasad Shukla was one of the examiners of the PhD dissertation of Rambhadracharya (then known as Giridhar Mishra) in 1981. After examining his Sanskrit thesis titled \"Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe Apāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ\" (\"Deliberation on the non-Paninian usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana\"), he wrote a Sanskrit verse–\n\nDevanagari<br>\nशोधप्रबन्धपरिशीलनतः समन्तात् \nसञ्जायते मतमिदं मम युक्तियुक्तम् । \nशोधप्रबन्धमकरन्दमधुव्रतोऽयं \nविद्वद्विमृग्यविरुदं लभतामिदानीम् ॥ \n\nIAST<br>\nśodhaprabandhapariśīlanataḥ samantāt \nsañjāyate matamidaṃ mama yuktiyuktam । \nśodhaprabandhamakarandamadhuvrato'yaṃ \nvidvadvimṛgyavirudaṃ labhatāmidānīm ॥ \n\nKalanath Shastry also critiqued the work \"Bhṛṅgadūtam\", about which he says that it has many new usages (\"Prayoga\"s) not seen earlier in Sanskrit poetry. As per Shastry, new dimensions in Sanskrit literature are seen in the play \"Śrīrāghavābhyudayam\" where there are songs in the \"Gīti\" style, and Gītarāmāyaṇam which is an epic poem in the \"Gīti\" style of Gītagovindam by Jayadeva. Dikshit writes that \"Kubjāpatram\" is a revival of the letter-poem (\"Patrakāvya\") genre in Sanskrit after 2000 years, and is the first work in Sanskrit literature whose lead character is disabled.\n\nDikshit is of the view that the eight \"Utprekṣā\" figures of speech in \"Śrīrāghavabhāvadarśanam\" have excelled the \"Utprekṣā\" style of the poet Karṇapūra, while the erudition and poetic skill displayed in \"Śrīsarayūlaharī\" makes the reader forget the \"Gaṅgālaharī\" of Paṇḍitarāja Jagannātha. He holds the work Arundhatī to be an eminent epic in Khariboli Hindi after the Kāmāyanī of Jaishankar Prasad. He observes that while Kāmāyanī goes from creation to optimism to pessimism and ends with indifference, Arundhatī is optimistic from beginning to end and establishes the virtues of Hinduism as enshrined in the Ramayana. About the lyrical Hindi works \"Rāghavagītaguñjana\" and \"Bhaktigītasudhā\", Dikshit says that the works are steeped in Bhakti Rasa and are reminiscent of the works of Tulsidas, Surdas and Mirabai. On \"Bhaktigītasudhā\", Shraddha Gupta writes that the work follows the Bhojpuri tradition where the sentimental and artistic aspects are both developed.\n\nDikshit says that the nationalistic play \"Śrīrāghavābhyudayam\" establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work \"Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī\" saying that it represents all the six \"Sampradāya\"s of Indian literature (\"Rīti\", \"Rasa\", \"Alaṅkāra\", \"Dhvani\", \"Vakrokti\" and \"Aucitya\"), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of \"Ritikavya\" poets like Raskhan, Keshavdas, Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the Śṛngāra Rasa, \"Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī\" is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.\n"}
{"id": "1179329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1179329", "title": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "text": "Richard Parkes Bonington\n\nRichard Parkes Bonington (25 October 1802 – 23 September 1828) was an English Romantic landscape painter, who moved to France at the age of 14 and can also be considered as a French artist, and an intermediary bringing aspects of English style to France. Becoming, after his very early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical cabinet paintings in a freely-handled version of the troubadour style.\n\nRichard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of Arnold, four miles from Nottingham. His father also known as Richard was successively a gaoler, a drawing master and lace-maker, and his mother a teacher. Bonington learned watercolour painting from his father and exhibited paintings at the Liverpool Academy at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1817, Bonington's family moved to Calais, France, where his father had set up a lace factory. At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter François Louis Thomas Francia, who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of Thomas Girtin, taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with Eugène Delacroix. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the Louvre. In 1820, he started attending the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros.\n\nIt was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1822. He also began to work in oils and lithography, illustrating Baron Taylor's \"Voyages pittoresques dans l'ancienne France\" and his own architectural series \"Restes et Fragmens\". In 1824, he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon along with John Constable and Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding, and spent most of the year painting coastal views in Dunkirk.\n\nIn 1825 he met Delacroix on a visit with Alexandre-Marie Colin to London, and they sketched together there, and shared a studio for some months in Paris on their return; Delacroix influenced him in turning to historical painting. He also developed a technique mixing watercolour with gouache and gum, achieving an effect close to oil painting. In 1826 he visited northern Italy, staying in Venice for a month, and London again in 1827–8. In late 1828 his tuberculosis worsened and his parents sent him back to London for treatment. Bonington died of tuberculosis on 23 September 1828 at 29 Tottenham Street in London, aged 25.\n\nDelacroix paid tribute to Bonington's work in a letter to Théophile Thoré in 1861. It reads, in part:\nWhen I met him for the first time, I too was very young and was making studies in the Louvre: this was around 1816 or 1817... Already in this genre (watercolor), which was an English novelty at that time, he had an astonishing ability... To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington's pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in watercolours, makes his works a type of diamond which flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject and any imitation.\n\nTo Laurence Binyon however, \"Bonington's extraordinary technical gift was also his enemy. There is none of the interest of struggle in his painting.\"\n\nBonington had a number of close followers, such as Roqueplan and Isabey in France, and Thomas Shotter Boys, James Holland, William Callow and John Scarlett Davis in England. In addition, there were many copies and forgeries of his work made in the period immediately after his death.\n\nA statue to him was erected outside the Nottingham School of Art by Watson Fothergill, and a theatre and primary school in his home town of Arnold are named after him. In addition, the house in which he was born (79 High Street, Arnold) is now named ‘Bonington House’ and is Grade II listed. The Wallace Collection has an especially large group of 35 works, representing both his landscapes and history paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27578", "title": "Survey sampling", "text": "Survey sampling\n\nIn statistics, survey sampling describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population to conduct a survey. \nThe term \"survey\" may refer to many different types or techniques of observation. In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people. Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of survey data collection. The purpose of sampling is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take to survey the entire target population. A survey that measures the entire target population is called a census.\n\nSurvey samples can be broadly divided into two types: probability samples and non-probability samples. Probability-based samples implement a sampling plan with specified probabilities (perhaps adapted probabilities specified by an adaptive procedure). Probability-based sampling allows design-based inference about the target population. The inferences are based on a known objective probability distribution that was specified in the study protocol. Inferences from probability-based surveys may still suffer from many types of bias.\n\nSurveys that are not based on probability sampling have greater difficulty measuring their bias or sampling error. Surveys based on non-probability samples often fail to represent the people in the target population.\n\nIn academic and government survey research, probability sampling is a standard procedure. In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget's \"List of Standards for Statistical Surveys\" states that federally funded surveys must be performed:\n\nselecting samples using generally accepted statistical methods (e.g., probabilistic methods that can provide estimates of sampling error). Any use of nonprobability sampling methods (e.g., cut-off or model-based samples) must be justified statistically and be able to measure estimation error.\n\nBesides, random sampling and design-based inference are supplemented by other statistical methods, such as model-assisted sampling and model-based sampling.\n\nFor example, many surveys have substantial amounts of nonresponse. Even though the units are initially chosen with known probabilities, the nonresponse mechanisms are unknown. For surveys with substantial nonresponse, statisticians have proposed statistical models, with which data sets are analyzed.\n\nIssues related to survey sampling are discussed in several sources including Salant and Dillman (1994).\n\nIn a probability sample (also called \"scientific\" or \"random\" sample) each member of the target population has a known and non-zero probability of inclusion in the sample. A survey based on a probability sample can in theory produce statistical measurements of the target population that are: \nA probability-based survey sample is created by constructing a list of the target population, called the sampling frame, a randomized process for selecting units from the sample frame, called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to enable them complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode. For some target populations this process may be easy, for example, sampling the employees of a company by using payroll list. However, in large, disorganized populations simply constructing a suitable sample frame is often a complex and expensive task.\n\nCommon methods of conducting a probability sample of the household population in the United States are Area Probability Sampling, Random Digit Dial telephone sampling, and more recently, Address-Based Sampling.\n\nWithin probability sampling, there are specialized techniques such as stratified sampling and cluster sampling that improve the precision or efficiency of the sampling process without altering the fundamental principles of probability sampling.\n\nStratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded. Then methods such as simple random sampling or systematic sampling can be applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.\n\nBias in surveys is undesirable, but often unavoidable. The major types of bias that may occur in the sampling process are:\n\nMany surveys are not based on probability samples, but rather on finding a suitable collection of respondents to complete the survey. Some common examples of non-probability sampling are:\n\nIn non-probability samples the relationship between the target population and the survey sample is immeasurable and potential bias is unknowable. Sophisticated users of non-probability survey samples tend to view the survey as an experimental condition, rather than a tool for population measurement, and examine the results for internally consistent relationships.\n\n\nIn statistics, survey sampling describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population to conduct a survey. The term \"survey\" may refer to many different types or techniques of observation. In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people. Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of survey data collection. The purpose of sampling is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take.\n\nSurvey samples can be broadly divided into two types: probability samples and non-probability samples. Probability-based samples implement a sampling plan with specified probabilities (perhaps adapted probabilities specified by an adaptive procedure). Probability-based sampling allows design-based inference about the target population. The inferences are based on a known objective probability distribution that was specified in the study protocol. Inferences from probability-based surveys may still suffer from many types of bias.\n\nSurveys that are not based on probability sampling have greater difficulty measuring their bias or sampling error.[citation needed] Surveys based on non-probability samples often fail to represent the people in the target population.[1]\n\nIn academic and government survey research, probability sampling is a standard procedure. In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget's \"List of Standards for Statistical Surveys\" states that federally funded surveys must be performed:\n\nselecting samples using generally accepted statistical methods (e.g., probabilistic methods that can provide estimates of sampling error). Any use of nonprobability sampling methods (e.g., cut-off or model-based samples) must be justified statistically and be able to measure estimation error.[2]\n\nBesides, random sampling and design-based inference are supplemented by other statistical methods, such as model-assisted sampling and model-based sampling.[3][4]\n\nFor example, many surveys have substantial amounts of nonresponse. Even though the units are initially chosen with known probabilities, the nonresponse mechanisms are unknown. For surveys with substantial nonresponse, statisticians have proposed statistical models, with which data sets are analyzed.\n\nIssues related to survey sampling are discussed in several sources including Salant and Dillman (1994).[5]\n\nThe textbook by Groves et alia provides an overview of survey methodology, including recent literature on questionnaire development (informed by cognitive psychology) : \n\nThe other books focus on the statistical theory of survey sampling and require some knowledge of basic statistics, as discussed in the following textbooks:\nThe elementary book by Scheaffer et alia uses quadratic equations from high-school algebra: \nMore mathematical statistics is required for Lohr, for Särndal et alia, and for Cochran (classic):\n\nThe historically important books by Deming and Kish remain valuable for insights for social scientists (particularly about the U.S. census and the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan): \n\n"}

They are man-made analogues of natural ion channels, and are thus also known as artificial ion channels. Compared to biological channels, they usually allow fluxes of similar magnitude but are \n\nSynthetic channels, like natural channels, are usually characterized by a combination of single-molecule (e.g., voltage-clamp of planar bilayers) and ensemble techniques (flux in vesicles). The study of synthetic ion channels can potentially lead to new single-molecule sensing technologies as well as new therapeutics.\n\nWhile semi-synthetic ion channels, often based on modified peptidic channels like gramicidin, had been prepared since the 1970s, the first attempt to prepare a synthetic ion channel was made in 1982 using a substituted β-cyclodextrin.\n\nInspired by gramicidin, this molecule was designed to be a barrel-shaped entity spanning a single leaflet of a bilayer membrane, becoming \"active\" only when two molecules in opposite leaflets come together in an end-to-end fashion. While the compound does induce ion-fluxes in vesicles, the data does not unambiguously show \"channel\" formation (as opposed to other transport mechanisms; see Mechanism).\n\nNa transport by such channels was first reported by two groups of investigators in 1989–1990.\n\nWith the adoption of voltage clamp technique to synthetic channel research in the early 1990s, researchers were able to observe quantized electrical activities from synthetic molecules, often considered the signature evidence for ion channels. This led to a sustained increase in research activity over the next two decades. In 2009, over 25 peer-reviewed papers were published on the topic, and a series of comprehensive reviews are available.\n\nPassive transport of ions across a membrane can take place by three main mechanisms: by ferrying, through defects in a disrupted membrane, or through a defined trajectory; these corresponds to \"ionophore\", \"detergent\", and \"ion channel\" transporters. While synthetic ion channel research attempts to prepare compounds that show conductance \"via\" a defined path, the elucidation of mechanism is difficult and seldom unambiguous. The two main methods of characterization both have their drawbacks, and as a consequence, often function is defined but mechanism presumed.\nOne line of evidence for ion transport comes from macroscopic examination of statistical ensembles. All these techniques use intact vesicles with an entrapped volume, with ion channel activities reported by different spectroscopic methods.\n\nIn a typical case, a dye is entrapped within the population of vesicles. This dye is selected to be respond colorimetrically or fluorometrically to the presence of an ion; this ion is typically absent from the inside of the vesicle but present in the outside. Without an ion transporter, the lipid bilayer as a kinetic barrier to block ion flux, and the dye remains \"dark\" indefinitely.\n\nAs an ion transporter allows ions on the outside to diffuse in, its addition will affect the color/fluorescence property of the dye. By macroscopically monitoring the dye's properties over time, and controlling outside factors, the ability of a compound to act as an ion transporter can be measured.\n\nObserving ion transport, however, does not pin down ion channel as the mechanism. Any class of transporter can lead to the same observation, and additional corroborating evidence is usually required. Sophisticated experiments intended to probe selectivity, gating, and other channel parameters have been developed over the past two decades and recently summarized.\n\nAn alternative to the ensemble-based method described above is the voltage-clamp experiment. In a voltage-clamp experiment, two compartments of electrolyte are divided by an aperture, usually between 5-250 micrometres in diameter. A lipid bilayer is painted across this aperture, thus electrically separating the compartments; the molecular nature can be ascertained by measuring its capacitance.\n\nUpon the addition of an (ideal) ion channel, a defined path between the two compartments is formed. Through this pore, ions flow down the potential and electrochemical gradient rapidly (>10/second), the maximum flux limited by the geometry and dimensions of the pore. At some later instant the pore may close or collapse, whereupon the current returns to zero. This open-state current, originating and amplified from a single-molecule event, is typically on the order of pA to nA, with time-resolution of approx. millisecond. Ideal or close-to-ideal events is termed \"square-tops\" in the literature, and have been considered as signature for a channel-based mechanism.\n\nIt is notable that the events observed at this scale are truly stochastic - that is, they are the result of random molecular collision and conformation changes. As the membrane area is much larger than that of a pore, multiple copies may open and close independently of one another, giving rise to the staircase like appearance (Panel C in figure); these ideal events are often modelled as Markov processes.\n\nBy using the \"activity grid notation\", synthetic ion channels studied with the voltage-clamp method during the period 1982-2010 have been critically reviewed. While the ideal traces are most frequently analyzed and reported in the literature, many records are decidedly non-ideal, with a subset was shown to be fractal. Developing methods for analyzing these non-ideal traces and clarifying their relationship to transport mechanism is an area of contemporary research.\nA diverse and large pool of synthetic molecules have been reported to act as ion transporters in lipid membranes. A selection is described here to demonstrate the breadth of feasible \"structures\" and attainable \"functions\". Comprehensive reviews for the literature up to 2010 are available in a tripartite series.\n\nMost (but not all; see minimalist channels) synthetic channels have chemical structures substantially larger than typical small molecules (molecular weights ~1-5kDa). This originates from the need to be amphiphilic, that is, have both sufficient hydrophobic portions to allow partitioning into lipid bilayer, as well as polar or charged \"headgroups\" to assert a defined orientation and geometry with respect to the membrane.\n\nIon channels containing calixarenes of ring size 3 and 4 have both been reported. For calix[4]arene, two conformations are accessible, and examples of both \"1,3-alt\" and \"cone\" conformation have been developed.\n\nThe first synthetic ion channel was constructed by partial substitution on the primary rim of β-cyclodextrin. Other substituted β-cyclodextrins have since been reported, including thiol-modified cyclodextrins, an anion-selective oligobutylene channel, and various poly-ethyleneoxide linked starburst oligomers. Structure-activity relationships for a large suite of cyclodextrin \"half-channels\" prepared by \"click\"-chemistry has been recently reported.\n\nAlternating D/L peptide macrocycles are known to self-aggregate into nanotubes, and the resulting nanotubes have been shown to act as ion channels in lipid membranes.\n\nOther architectures use peptide helices as a scaffold to attach other functionalities, such as crown ethers of different sizes. The property of these peptide-crown channels depend strongly on the identity of the capping end-groups.\n\nSemi-synthetic bio-hybrid channels constructed by modifications of natural ion channels had been constructed. Leveraging modern synthetic organic chemistry, these allows pinpoint modifications of existing structures to either elucidate their transport mechanisms or to graft on new functionalities.\n\nGramicidin and alamethicin had been popular starting points for selective modifications. The above diagram illustrates one example, where a crown-ether was fixed across the mouth of the ion-passing portal. This channel shows discrete conductance but different ion selectivity than wild type gramicidin in voltage-clamp experiments.\n\nWhile modification of large protein channels using mutagenesis are generally considered out of the scope of \"synthetic\" channels, the demarcation is not sharp, as supramolecular or covalent bonding of cyclodextrins to alpha-hemolysin demonstrates.\n\nAn ion channel can be characterized by its \"opening characteristics\", \"ion selectivity\", and \"control of flux\" (gating). Many synthetic ion channels show unique properties in one or more of these aspects.\n\nAn \"ion-channel forming\" molecule can often show multiple types of conductance activities in planar bilayer membranes. Each of these modes of action can be characterized by their\n\n\nThese \"events\" are not necessarily uniform throughout their durations, and as a result a variety of shapes of conducting traces are possible.\n\nThe majority of synthetic ion channels follow an Eisenman I sequence (Cs > Rb > K > Na » Li) in their selectivity for alkali metal cations, suggesting that the origin of the selectivity is governed by the difference in energy required to remove water from a fully hydrated cation. A few synthetic channels show other patterns of ion selectivity, and only a single instance in which a synthetic channel following the opposite selectivity sequence (Eisenman XI; Cs < Rb < K < Na « Li) had been reported.\n\nMost synthetic channels are Ohmic in conductance, that is, the current passed (both individually and as an ensemble) is proportional to the potential across the membrane. Some rare channels, however, show current-voltage characteristics that is non-linear. Specifically, two different types of non-Ohmic conductance are known: \n\nThe former requires asymmetry with respect to the mid-plane of the lipid bilayer, and is realized often by introducing an overall molecular dipole. The latter, demonstrated in natural channels such as alamethicin, is rarely encountered in synthetic ion channels. They may be related to lipid ion channels, but to date their mechanism remains elusive.\n\nCertain synthetic ion channels have conductances that can be modulated by additional of external chemicals. Both up-modulation (channels are turned on by ligand) and down-modulation (channels are turned off by ligands) are known: different mechanisms, including formation of supramolecular aggregates, as well as inter- and intramolecular blockage.\n\nRegulatory elements that responds to other signals are known; examples include photomodulated conductances as well as \"thermal switches\" constructed by isomerization of the carbamate group. To date, no mechanosensitive synthetic ion channels have been reported.\n"}

The inscription, dated possibly to 702 AH (corresponds to 1303 CE), constituted the earliest evidence of Jawi writing in the Malay world of Southeast Asia, and was one of the oldest testimony to the advent of Islam as a state religion in the region. It contains the proclamation issued by a ruler of Terengganu known as \"Seri Paduka Tuan\", urging his subjects to extend and uphold Islam and providing 10 basic Sharia laws for their guidance.\n\nThe stone was found half-submerged by a bank of Tersat river in Kuala Berang, Hulu Terengganu, in 1887 CE after the floods had receded. A Terengganuan nobleman, Pengiran Anum Engku Abdul Kadir bin Engku Besar and his tin-prospector friend, Saiyed Husin Ghulam Al Bukhari came across the stone and brought it on a raft to Kuala Terengganu where it was presented to Sultan Zainal Abidin III, and placed atop of Bukit Puteri ('Princess hill').\n\nIn 2009, a meeting of the UNESCO's International Advisory Committee (IAC) held in Barbados, included the Inscribed Stone of Terengganu in a heritage list of Memory of the World Programme, making it the fourth heritage recognition accorded to Malaysia after the \"Hikayat Hang Tuah\", \"Sejarah Melayu\", and the correspondence of Sultan Abdul Hamid in 2001.\n\nWith the advent of Islam into Southeast Asia in the 10th or 11th century, a life based on the teachings of Quran and the Hadith became widespread and together with this, the use of the Arabic script. Over the time, the script was modified and adapted to suit the spoken Classical Malay language, and thus Jawi script was created. This development heralded a new age of literacy, when converts to the new faith gradually replaced the previous Indian-derived scripts with Jawi, in expressing their new belief.\n\nAs a testimony to the spread of Islam that originated from the Middle East, the artefact offers more than just a glimpse of the life of the people of the era. It also depicted the growing Islamic culture subsumed under a set of religious laws. A concomitant feature of this historic movement was the growth of maritime trade that centred around Kuala Berang, the place where the stone was discovered. The inscribed stone alludes to regional trade that flourished in the course of Islamisation, with its trading pattern and movement of peoples during that time.\n\nWhile the Islamisation of Terengganu was pursued effectively with the rise of the new way of thinking, it did not completely put an end to the old way of life. The inscribed stone still contained a number of Sanskrit terms, a memorial to Southeast Asia’s Hindu past.\n\nThe inscribed stone was first discovered by villagers at a steep sloping riverbank of Tersat river, Kampung Buluh, Kuala Berang, Hulu Terengganu in 1887, and was later brought to a nearby surau, known as Surau Tok Rashid. From there, the stone was further moved to Surau Kampung Buluh. In 1902, a Terengganuan nobleman, Pengiran Anum Engku Abdul Kadir bin Engku Besar and his Tin-prospector friend, Syed Husin bin Ghulam Al-Bokhari, came to Kampung Buluh. While they were at Surau Kampung Buluh to perform the Zuhr prayer, they noticed a stone with inscriptions used as a pedestal by the villagers, to step onto before entering the main prayer hall. After the prayer, they requested Penghulu Ali and his villagers to carry the stone on a raft to be brought to the capital, Kuala Terengganu. When it reached Kuala Terengganu, the stone was presented to Sultan Zainal Abidin III who ordered it to be placed atop of Bukit Puteri ('princess hill'), near to the royal palace.\n\nThe stone remained on top of the hill for 20 years, until July 1922, when the Deputy British adviser of Terengganu, Major H.S Peterson asked a Japanese photographer, N. Suzuki, to take images of the inscription and send them to C.O Bledgen to be analyzed. In 1923, British adviser to Terengganu, J.L Humphreys acquired approval from the Government of Terengganu to lend the stone to Raffles Museum, Singapore. The stone remained in Singapore for 37 years until 1960, when it was relocated to the National Museum of Malaysia.\n\nThe State Government of Terengganu have been lobbying for the repatriation of the Inscribed Stone to its home state since 1979. On 12 February 1987, the Terengganu officially wrote to the administration of the National Museum, seeking permission to relocate the Inscribed Stone to their State Museum. Only in 1991, the Federal Cabinet granted approval to the request and the Inscribed Stone was returned to Terengganu. It is now displayed at the Terengganu State Museum.\n\nThe inscription is dated, however due to damage on the lower left edge of the stone, where the year of the inscription is mentioned in the 11th lines, the date is incomplete and can be variously read as ranging from 702 to 789 A.H. (1303 to 1387 CE). C.O. Blagden, who first deciphered the inscription, presented many possible dates that range from February – March 1303 CE to February 1387 CE. He doubted that the earlier date Rajab, 702 AH or 1303 CE would be correct, and concluded that on general grounds he was inclined to lean towards the latest possible date.\n\nThis dating was challenged by Syed Muhammad Naguib al-Attas, who argued that the earlier date is the correct one through an variety of logical, mathematical, linguistic, cultural, philosophical and mystical arguments, and by attempting to reconstruct the lost part of the inscription. In his speech published by the National Museum of Malaysia, Naguib stated that the correct date of the inscription is Friday, 4th of Rajab, 702 A.H., that corresponds to Friday, 22 February 1303 CE. His assertion is based on the following explanation.\n\nThe year 702 AH began on 26 August 1303 CE. The day on which the Christian calendar began for that Islamic calendar was a Monday (i.e. 1 January 1303 CE was a Monday, and 237 days had elapsed in the Christian year when the Islamic year began on the 1st of Muharram (i.e. 26 August 1302 CE). Rajab is the 7th month of the Islamic calendar, and since the year 702 AH began in August 1302 CE, it therefore occurred in the month of February 1303 CE, which Christian year began on a Tuesday. Bearing in mind that the Christian year began on a Tuesday, it is found that only the 4th day of Rajab, which was the 181st day of the Islamic year 702, agrees with our computation of the date. Moreover, the 4th of Rajab confirms our computation because it was a Friday of Rajab, as mentioned in the inscription.\n\nThe stone is 89 cm in height, 53 cm in width at the top, and weight 214.8 kg. All of its four facades have inscriptions written from right to left. The inscription is in Classical Malay written in the Jawi script, with dots for most of the Arabic-derived letters ( ب ، ت ، ج ، ش ، ق ، ن ، ي ) and native Jawi letters ( چ ، ݢ ، ڠ ، ڤ ), being not visible, except for the letters ( ڽ ، ض ، ف ).\n\nThe spelling system of the Inscribed Stone of Terengganu has similarities with modern Jawi spelling system in a number of areas:\n\n"}

While all of the films finds three of the four men on a mission to find their missing friend, the first two films focus on the events following a night of debauchery before a party in Las Vegas and Bangkok; whereas the third and final film involves a road trip and a kidnapping in lieu of a bachelor party. Each film in the series focuses on how the friends try to deal with the aftermath of their antics while they are being humiliated and occasionally physically beaten up at each turn.\n\n\"The Hangover\" tells the story of Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, and Alan Garner, who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate the impending marriage of their friend, Doug Billings. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan have no memory of the previous night's events and must find Doug before the wedding can take place.\n\nScreenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote the script after hearing how a friend of executive producer Chris Bender went missing following his bachelor party in Las Vegas. After Lucas and Moore sold it to Warner Bros. for $2 million, director Todd Phillips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson. Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days.\n\nIn \"The Hangover Part II\", Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the previous film's bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. However, things do not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night. Once again someone is lost, this time Stu's future brother-in-law, and Phil, Stu, and Alan search for him in Bangkok.\n\nWarner Bros. hired Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong to write a sequel to \"The Hangover\" after a trailer brought down the house at ShoWest in April 2009, two months before the film was released. The principal actors were cast in March 2010 to reprise their roles from the first film.

{"id": "30018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30018", "title": "Turkic languages", "text": "Turkic languages\n\nThe Turkic languages are a language family of at least thirty-five documented languages, spoken by the Turkic peoples of Eurasia from Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and West Asia all the way to North Asia (particularly in Siberia) and East Asia. The Turkic languages originated in a region of East Asia spanning Western China to Mongolia, where Proto-Turkic is thought to have been spoken, according to one estimate, around 2,500 years ago, from where they expanded to Central Asia and farther west during the first millennium.\n\nTurkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 170 million people, and the total number of Turkic speakers, including second language speakers, is over 200 million. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish, spoken mainly in Anatolia and the Balkans; its native speakers account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.\n\nCharacteristic features of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, and lack of grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Balkan Gagauz Turkish, and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: Oghur, the only surviving member of which is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.\n\nTurkic languages show some similarities with the Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, and Japonic languages. These similarities led some linguists to propose an Altaic language family, though this proposal is not widely accepted. Apparent similarities with the Uralic languages family even caused these families to be regarded as one for a long time under the hypothesis of Ural-Altaic languages. However, there has not been sufficient evidence to conclude the existence of either of these macrofamilies, the shared characteristics between the languages being attributed presently to extensive prehistoric language contact.\n\nTurkic languages are null-subject languages, have vowel harmony, extensive agglutination by means of suffixes and postpositions, and lack of grammatical articles, noun classes, and grammatical gender. Subject–object–verb word order is universal within the family. The root of a word is basically of one, two or three consonants.\n\nThe geographical distribution of Turkic-speaking peoples across Eurasia ranges from the North-East of Siberia to Turkey in the West, since the Ottoman era (see picture in the box on the right above).\n\nExtensive contact took place between Proto-Turks and Proto-Mongols approximately during the first millennium BC; the shared cultural tradition between the two Eurasian nomadic groups is called the \"Turco-Mongol\" tradition. The two groups shared a religion, Tengrism, and there exists a multitude of evident loanwords between Turkic languages and Mongolic languages. Although the loans were bidirectional, today Turkic loanwords constitute the largest foreign component in Mongolian vocabulary. The most famous of these loanwords include \"lion\" (Turkish: \"aslan\" or \"arslan\"; Mongolian: \"arslan\"), \"gold\" (Turkish: \"altın\"; Mongolian: \"altan\" or \"alt\"), and \"iron\" (Turkish: \"demir\"; Mongolian: \"tömör\").\n\nSome lexical and extensive typological similarities between Turkic and the nearby Tungusic and Mongolic families, as well as the Korean and Japonic families (all formerly widely considered to be part of the so-called Altaic language family) has in more recent years been instead attributed to prehistoric contact amongst the group, sometimes referred to as the Northeast Asian sprachbund. A more recent (circa first millennium BCE) contact between \"core Altaic\" (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic) is distinguished from this, due to the existence of definitive common words that appear to have been mostly borrowed from Turkic into Mongolic, and later from Mongolic into Tungusic, as Turkic borrowings into Mongolic significantly outnumber Mongolic borrowings into Turkic, and Turkic and Tungusic do not share any words that do not also exist in Mongolic.\n\nAlexander Vovin (2004, 2010) notes that Old Turkic had borrowed some words from the Ruan-ruan language (the language of the Rouran Khaganate), which Vovin considers to be an extinct non-Altaic language that is not related to any modern-day language.\n\nThe first established records of the Turkic languages are the eighth century AD Orkhon inscriptions by the Göktürks, recording the Old Turkic language, which were discovered in 1889 in the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia. The \"Compendium of the Turkic Dialects\" (\"Divânü Lügati't-Türk\"), written during the 11th century AD by Kaşgarlı Mahmud of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, constitutes an early linguistic treatment of the family. The \"Compendium\" is the first comprehensive dictionary of the Turkic languages and also includes the first known map of the Turkic speakers' geographical distribution. It mainly pertains to the Southwestern branch of the family.\n\nThe Codex Cumanicus (12th–13th centuries AD) concerning the Northwestern branch is another early linguistic manual, between the Kipchak language and Latin, used by the Catholic missionaries sent to the Western Cumans inhabiting a region corresponding to present-day Hungary and Romania. The earliest records of the language spoken by Volga Bulgars, the parent to today's Chuvash language, are dated to the 13th–14th centuries AD.\n\nWith the Turkic expansion during the Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries AD), Turkic languages, in the course of just a few centuries, spread across Central Asia, from Siberia to the Mediterranean. Various terminologies from the Turkic languages have passed into Persian, Hindustani, Russian, Chinese, and to a lesser extent, Arabic.\n\nFor centuries, the Turkic-speaking peoples have migrated extensively and intermingled continuously, and their languages have been influenced mutually and through contact with the surrounding languages, especially the Iranian, Slavic, and Mongolic languages.\n\nThis has obscured the historical developments within each language and/or language group, and as a result, there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages. The modern genetic classification schemes for Turkic are still largely indebted to Samoilovich (1922).\n\nThe Turkic languages may be divided into six branches:\n\nIn this classification, Oghur Turkic is also referred to as Lir-Turkic, and the other branches are subsumed under the title of Shaz-Turkic or Common Turkic. It is not clear when these two major types of Turkic can be assumed to have actually diverged.\n\nWith less certainty, the Southwestern, Northwestern, Southeastern and Oghur groups may further be summarized as West Turkic, the Northeastern, Kyrgyz-Kipchak and Arghu (Khalaj) groups as East Turkic.\n\nGeographically and linguistically, the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages, while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages.\n\nHruschka, et al. (2014) use computational phylogenetic methods to calculate a tree of Turkic based on phonological sound changes.\n\nThe following isoglosses are traditionally used in the classification of the Turkic languages:\nAdditional isoglosses include:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>In the standard Istanbul dialect of Turkish, the \"ğ\" in \"dağ\" and \"dağlı\" is not realized as a consonant, but as a slight lengthening of the preceding vowel.\n\nThe following table is based upon the classification scheme presented by Lars Johanson (1998)\n\nThe following is a brief comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Turkic language family (about 60 words).\n\nEmpty cells do not necessarily imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row or that a loanword is used in its place.\n\nAlso, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the \"Common meaning\" given is only approximate. In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for \"fire\" is the Persian-derived \"ateş\", whereas the native \"od\" is dead). Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.\n\nAn endangered language, or moribund language, is a language that is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a \"dead language\".\n\n15 Turkic languages exist in endangered languages in Russia:\n\n\nIn Qinghai (Amdo), the Salar language has a heavy Chinese and Tibetan influence. Although of Turkic origin, major linguistic structures have been absorbed from Chinese. Around 20% of the vocabulary is of Chinese origin, and 10% is also of Tibetan origin. Yet the official Communist Chinese government policy deliberately covers up these influences in academic and linguistics studies, trying to emphasize the Turkic element and completely ignoring the Chinese in the Salar language. The Salar language has taken loans and influence from neighboring varieties of Chinese. It is neighboring variants of Chinese which have loaned words to the Salar language. In Qinghai, many Salar men speak both the Qinghai dialect of Chinese and Salar. Rural Salars can speak Salar fluently while urban Salars often assimilate into the Chinese speaking Hui population.\n\nEthnologue and ISO list an Iranian language \"Khalaj\" with the same population, but Glottolog states it does not exist. The Khalaj speak their Turkic language and Persian, and the supposed Iranian language of the Khalaj is spurious.\nKhorasani Turkic (Khorasani Turkic: \"خراسان تركچىسى\", Pronunciation: ; ) is an Oghuz Turkic language spoken in northern North Khorasan Province and Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran. Nearly all Khorasani Turkic speakers are also bilingual in Persian.\n\nMany Turkic languages have gone extinct in Afghanistan.\nIn 1980, Saddam Hussein's government adopted a policy of assimilation of its minorities. Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to Arabize the region. Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the Ba'th regime recognised that the city of Kirkuk was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation. Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.\n\nSeveral presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: \"identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]\". In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that \"this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk\".\n\nAs primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as \"Arabs\" in order to avoid discrimination. Thus, ethnic cleansing was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk. Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies; school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes. Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the principal, the vice-principal does not have quite the decision-making authority that the principal carries. Although they still carry nearly the same authority among students, vice-principals do not have the same power on the board. Experience as an assistant principal is often a prerequisite for advancement to a principalship.\n\nAssistant principals aid the principal in the overall administration of the school. Some assistant principals hold this position for several years to prepare for advancement to principal jobs; others are career assistant principals. They are primarily responsible for scheduling student classes, ordering textbooks and supplies, and coordinating transportation, custodial, cafeteria, and other support services. They usually handle student discipline and attendance problems, social and recreational programs, and health and safety matters. They also may counsel students on personal, educational, or vocational matters. With the advent of site-based management, assistant principals are playing a greater role in ensuring the academic success of students by helping to develop new curricula, evaluating teachers, and dealing with school-community relations—responsibilities previously assumed solely by the principal. The number of assistant principals that a school employs may vary, depending on the number of students.\n\nMost schools require elementary, middle, and high school principals to have a master’s degree in education administration or leadership. Most principals also have experience as teachers. Master's degrees in educational administration are offered at a number of universities around the United States including the University of North Texas, Ball State University, Drexel University, Ashland University, Northeastern University, and the University of Scranton.\n\nIn American schools, it is often his or her duty to handle matters such as student discipline, parent conference meetings, asset inventory and ordering, school improvement planning, bus and lunch supervision, and teacher observations. Additionally, assistant principals frequently serve as testing coordinators, training staff on procedures related to standardized assessment, as well as accounting for testing materials. In addition to these duties, assistant principals are instructional leaders.\n\nMost importantly however, in the event that something happens to the principal, such as an extended leave of absence, the assistant principal would act as the interim principal. Because of this, many see this position as a stepping-stone to the larger role of principal and is often used as such. In most schools, the vice principal forgoes all teaching duties in order to address broader educational issues.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most secondary schools have Assistant Principals (or traditionally known as Assistant Head Teachers), with the Vice-Principals (or traditionally known as Deputy Head Teachers) managing them. Their duties vary from school to school; however, usually Assistant Principals and Vice-Principals support school initiatives in maintaining standards, behavior, Key Stages 3–5, teaching and exam timetabling, inclusion, the curriculum and student learning, and overall accountability in the school. They can also carry out performance appraisals and teacher observations. Furthermore, principals/head teachers/headmasters/headmistresses are beginning to have more autonomy on how they will structure their school's senior leadership team and what each member's role will be. These additional roles that are found in English secondary schools can lead to senior leadership/administrative teams to be as large as 8–12 people, depending on the school's size and its demographics (e.g., Head Teacher, 2–4 Deputy Head Teachers, 3–8 Assistant Head Teachers). In contrast to the US, most Assistant Head Teachers and Deputy Head Teachers teach 1–2 courses on top of their administrative duties.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51475842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51475842", "title": "WonHwaDo", "text": "WonHwaDo\n\nWon Hwa Do(원화도) is a traditional Korean martial art, founded in 1972 by Bong-Ki Han. The name in Korean (Hangul) means \"The Way of Circular Harmony\" (Won = Circle, Hwa = Harmony, Do = Way). The basis of the art lies in circular movement by effectively utilizing full 360° rotations of the human body motion. This helps in conserving energy and reducing the risk of injury on the practitioner's joints often caused by use of linear force and impact. Won Hwa Do is often compared to hapkido and Taekkyeon which are also national martial arts of Korea. Although similar in several aspects, Won Hwa Do's Ha-Dan/Sang-Dan Hoe-Jeon-Gong-Bang (하단/상단 회전공방) techniques are a unique trademark which is not shared by the other Korean martial arts. Ha-Dan Hoe-Jeon- Gong-Bang has the practitioner rotating arms in a forward motion and Sang-Dan has them rotating it in a backward motion. These two form the bases of strikes, throws, blocks, counters, submissions and kicks in its diverse self-defense system and are the most fundamental and basic practice of Won Hwa Do.\nThe uniform pattern is also unique in that it contains diamond shaped patterns with green and maroon lines painted or sewn across it. Its belt system does not follow the traditional Japanese black belt curriculum and its forms (kata) are quite short in comparison to karate, taekwondo and hapkido. Won Hwa Do is a very unorthodox martial art as demonstrated by its breaking away from these norms but takes pride in having its own unique standard.\n\nFounded in 1972 by Bong-Ki Han Won Hwa Do's origins lie in traditional Korean prayer and dance. The prayer-like movements are known as Bison(비손) which has the practitioner moving his hands in a circular path against one another as if turning a wheel. This idea represents the rotating of Yin Yang within a person's mind and body thereby bringing peace and harmony to him/her. Won Hwa Do at one point had a team that performed Won Hwa Do dance alongside the Famous Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of South Korea.\n\nHan was a monk in a temple for a short while. It is assumed that his lifestyle from these times were a deep influence on how he chose to create Won Hwa Do's techniques.\nIk-Hun Cho assisted Bong-Ki Han in the early days using experiences from his days as a master of other Korean martial arts. Many old photographs show the two of them travelling around Korea spreading WonHwaDo.\n\nBong-Ki Han and his main disciples established and built the Central Training center (Chilwon dojang) in 1994. There he held many workshops, seminars and even 100 day training camps. 100 day training camps were a common tradition for those training to attain the rank of Maroon Belt (Instructor) and beyond.\nIn 1998 The World Won Hwa Do Festival was held in which people from all over the Asia and Europe participated. A follow up festival was held in the following year of 1999. It was from this Festival that Han sent European masters to back pioneer WonHwaDo in their homeland countries. Chilwon in Masan, GyeongSangDo Province was a forested area of the countryside of South Korea that Won Hwa Do used for all of its major events and training workshops. However, in 2004 the Chilwon dojang would close its doors and the WWF(World Won Hwa Do Federation) would move its headquarters to Seoul.\n\nIn 2003 The World Won Hwa Do Federation(세계원화도연맹) was officially recognized and supported by the Korean Government as a national Martial Art.\nWon Hwa Do during this time became well established in European countries such as Germany, Slovakia, Lithuania and the United Kingdom.\nWon Hwa Do also began to grow steadily in Japan as well during this period.\nIn the year 2004, Jeon Ju(전주) Won Hwa Do training center was established by Ryu Jae Nam(류재남).\nAfter Bong-Ki Han's died in 2010 he left leadership of the World Won Hwa Do Federation to his son and other leaders.\nShortly following his passing the Seoul Headquarters closed down and the training center in Jeon Ju became the WWF Headquarters.\nSince Bong-Ki Han]s passing Ik-Hun Cho is the only person to attain the rank of Great Grand Master(Gold stripe). He helped develop, pioneer and create the many techniques of Won Hwa Do's diverse GongBang(공방) system.\n\nJapan's Won Hwa Do headquarters are in Okayama prefecture but dojangs also exist in several locations across the country such as Nagoya and Osaka. Across Europe, several countries remain active albeit in a much smaller capacity than the early years of 2000. Austria, Germany, Slovakia, England, Lithuania are among the few countries that still teach and practice Won Hwa Do. In order to help accelerate the growth of Wonhwado internationally, Bong-Ki Han sent his disciples and students abroad to learn English whilst pioneering the art in those countries. Germany, Slovakia and England are a direct by-product of this time. Germany currently has 3 different dojangs with the headquarters being in Leipzig.\nCircular motion to harmonise with the Universe, Heaven, People, Nature. The concept is based around the idea that all straight lines are destined to begin and end whilst circular force and motion naturally flows without ceasing.\n\nWon Hwa Do is considered to be a diverse and versatile martial art. For example, it employs grappling techniques for throwing and locking submissions but also has striking with punches and kicks. However, all of these diverse techniques still revolve around the fundamental principles of circular motion. Won Hwa Do has a term for its techniques known as 'Gongbang'(공방). The Hangul (Korean characters) for Gong(공) means offense whilst the Hangul for Bang(방) means defense. Won Hwa Do teaches to practice offense and defense simultaneously in one movement through the use of circular motion.\nAlthough seemingly peaceful, meditative and harmless in appearance the force from the circular Hadan (forward circular) strike carries a formidable impact on the target. The force comes from the theory of infusing pushing and pulling into one circular strike as if striking with a ball and chain flail weapon swinging at the end of a handle. Cho Ik Hun teaches that force and technique in the Hadan strike comes not from observation and talent but pure and patient practice of the basic Hadan circular movement for many years. He also emphasizes the importance of breathing and core hip strength in mastering the technique.\n\nWon Hwa Do has 40 Basic Forms, \n\nThe first set are separated into 4 directions forward, left, back and right. The second set of 20 forms consist of diagonal directions of movement.\nJeong-Myeon-Gong-Bang(정면공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \n\nPyeong-Woe-Gong-Bang(평외공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nHu-Myeon-Gong-Bang(후면공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \nPyeong-Nae-Gong-Bang(평내공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \n\nCheuk-Woe-Gong-Bang(측외공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nCheuk-Nae-Gong-Bang(측내공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nCheuk-waeGong-Bang (주외공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nJu-Nae-GongBang (주내공방) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nEach form also has various striking, kicking, throwing, submission and locking techniques using the footwork, direction and movements based on the form.\n\nWon Hwa Do has a different belt system to other martial arts like judo, karate, taekwondo and hapkido. For example, usually in traditional martial arts like Karate the black belt is the symbol of an instructor or high level practitioner. However, in Won Hwa Do a person of high rank and skill wears a maroon-colored belt.\nThe reason behind Won Hwa Do's choice of colors is that Karate's black system was rooted in Japan's martial arts history whereas Won Hwa Do chooses to base its system on Korea's Joseon Dynasty era. For example, common folk wore plain white Han boks (Korean traditional clothing) whilst captains and commanders of the military wore blue and red. Generals and Politicians would often wear purple or maroon-colored Han boks with blue, green and golden patterns.\n\nAlthough depending on the country system varies, the system displayed above is the general standard.\n\nHan and Cho prefer being called by the title of simply 'Grand Master' or Teacher (seonsaengnim, 선생님) as they deem 'Great Grand Master' too long-winded.\n\nAfter the death of Bong-Ki Han, Ik-Hun Cho is the only one to hold the rank of Maroon (purple) gold Grandmaster belt.\n"}
