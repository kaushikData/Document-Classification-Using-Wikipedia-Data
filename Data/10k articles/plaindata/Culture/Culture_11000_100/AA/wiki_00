{"id": "156541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156541", "title": "A-side and B-side", "text": "A-side and B-side\n\nThe terms A-side and B-side refer to the two sides of 78, 45, and 33 1/3 rpm phonograph records, or cassettes, whether singles, extended plays (EPs), or long-playing (LP) records. The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a \"hit\" record. The B-side (or \"flip-side\") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer Phil Spector was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.\n\nMusic recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as CDs and digital downloads, which do not have \"sides\", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for \"bonus\" track.\n\nThe first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on cylinder records, which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound. Early shellac disc records records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910). Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by Columbia Records in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.\n\nThere were no record charts until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when top 40 radio overtook full-service network radio). In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the \"side\" did not convey anything about the content of the record.\n\nIn June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern 33 1/3 rpm long-playing (LP) microgroove vinyl record for commercial sales, and its rival RCA Victor, responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases. The term \"single\" came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s. At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side. (All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the \"A\" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.) Under this random system, many artists had so-called \"double-sided hits\", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in \"Billboard\", \"Cashbox\", or other magazines), or would be featured on jukeboxes in public places.\n\nAs time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed. By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales. It was not until 1968, for instance, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom. In the late 1960s stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s. The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority. However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.\n\nBy the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare. Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed. In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the \"plug side\" on both sides of the disc.\n\nWith the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of cassette and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful. At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette maxi-singles, containing more than two songs, became more popular. Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction. However, the term \"B-side\" is still used to refer to the \"bonus\" tracks or \"coupling\" tracks on a CD single.\n\nWith the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term \"B-side\" is now less commonly used. Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as \"unreleased\", \"bonus\", \"non-album\", \"rare\", \"outtakes\" or \"exclusive\" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.\n\nB-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra \"value for money\". There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, a cappella, live, acoustic, remixed version or in another language), or, in a concept record, a song that does not fit into the story line.\n\nAdditionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release. Examples of this include Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\", the Isley Brothers' \"Shout\", and a number of records by James Brown, including \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and \"Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud\". Typically, \"part one\" would be the chart hit, while \"part two\" would be a continuation of the same performance. A notable example of a non-R&B hit with two parts was the single release of Don McLean's \"American Pie\". With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned. Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides\n\nSince both sides of a single received equal royalties, some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists. This became known as the \"flipside racket\". Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of pirate radio stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.\n\nOccasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song. This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead. Some examples include \"I Will Survive\" by Gloria Gaynor (originally the B-side of \"Substitute\"), \"I'll Be Around\" by the Spinners (originally the B-side of \"How Could I Let You Get Away\") and \"Maggie May\" by Rod Stewart (originally the B-side of \"Reason to Believe\").\n\nThe song \"How Soon Is Now?\" by the Smiths started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of \"William, It Was Really Nothing\" but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did Oasis's \"Acquiesce\", which originally appeared as a B-side to \"Some Might Say\" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming compilation album, \"Stop the Clocks\". Feeder in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides \"Just a Day\" from \"Seven Days in the Sun\", and \"Shatter\" from \"Tumble and Fall\" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No. 12 and No. 11 in the UK. In 1986, the first single from XTC's record \"Skylarking\", \"Grass\", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, \"Dear God\" – so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song (\"Mermaid Smiled\") removed and \"Dear God\" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.\n\nOn many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether. These were often made for the jukebox, as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another. For example, in 1981 Kraftwerk released their new single \"Computer Love\" coupled with the B-side \"The Model\", from their 1978 LP \"The Man-Machine\". With synthpop increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed. In early 1982 \"The Model\" reached number one.\n\nA \"double A-side\" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single. The double A-sided single was invented in December 1965 by the Beatles for their single of \"We Can Work It Out\" and \"Day Tripper\", where both were designated A-sides. They continued to use the format for the release of the singles \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Yellow Submarine\" in 1966, followed by \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" / \"Penny Lane\" in 1967, and \"Something\" / \"Come Together\" in 1969. Other groups followed suit, notably the Rolling Stones in early 1967 with \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" / \"Ruby Tuesday\" as a double-A single.\n\nA double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits. Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, the Beach Boys, Brenda Lee, and Pat Boone, routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides. The charts below tally the instances for artist's singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release. For instance \"Hound Dog,\" the B-side of \"Don't Be Cruel\" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though \"Hound Dog\" was indeed not an A-side when released in 1956. Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' \"Day Tripper\"/\"We Can Work It Out\") listed the single with both songs as the A-side. Also, for Cliff Richard's 1962 \"The Next Time\"/\"Bachelor Boy\", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with \"Bachelor Boy\" pressed as the B-side.\n\nIn the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\"/\"Girls' School\", which sold over two million copies. It was also the UK Christmas No. 1 that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being Queen's 1991 re-release of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\". Nirvana released \"All Apologies\" and \"Rape Me\" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart, and the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nQueen released their first double-A single, \"Killer Queen\"/\"Flick of the Wrist\", in 1974. \"Killer Queen\" became a hit, while \"Flick of the Wrist\" was all but ignored for lack of promotion. Three years later, they released \"We Are the Champions\" with \"We Will Rock You\" as a B-side. Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side. In 1978 they released \"Fat Bottomed Girls\"/\"Bicycle Race\" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.\n\nOccasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market. During the late 1970s, for example, Dolly Parton released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including \"Two Doors Down\"/\"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right\" and \"Baby I'm Burning\"/\"I Really Got the Feeling\". In 1978, the Bee Gees also used this method when they released \"Too Much Heaven\" for the pop market and the flip side, \"Rest Your Love on Me\", which was aimed toward country stations.\n\nMany artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular. Examples of this include Oasis's \"Little by Little\"/\"She Is Love\" (2002), Bloc Party's \"So Here We Are\"/\"Positive Tension\" (2005) and Gorillaz's \"El Mañana\"/\"Kids with Guns\" (2006).\n\nArtists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side charted in the US Hot 100, according to \"Billboard\":\n\n\nArtists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side reached the Billboard Top 40, according to \"Billboard\":\n\nOn vinyl, double A-sided singles had one song on either side of the record, while double B-sides contained two songs on the same side (on the B-side, making three songs in all). When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was \"maxi single\", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats. These would not quite qualify as EPs – as that is generally four songs on a 45.\n\nGenesis's 1978 7-inch single \"Many Too Many\" featured two B-sides, \"The Day the Light Went Out\" and \"Vancouver\", both of them being outtakes from the \"...And Then There Were Three...\" album. There was no 12-inch equivalent. The band released two 7in singles with three tracks apiece, \"Spot the Pigeon\" and \"3X3\" (aka \"Paperlate\"), which were explicitly marked as EPs. \"Spot the Pigeon\" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side. The B-side, \"Inside and Out\", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.\n\nPaul McCartney's 1980 single \"Coming Up\" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of \"Coming Up\" and a studio instrumental called \"Lunchbox/Odd Sox\".\n\nIron Maiden's 1980 7-inch single \"Sanctuary\" was a rerecording of a song that had been given to the \"Metal For Muthas\" compilation the previous year. The recording was made during the \"Iron Maiden\" sessions but was left off the UK album and then put out as a single. To make up for this for fans who had specifically bought \"Metal for Muthas\" for the track, the \"Sanctuary\" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks. \"Drifter\" and \"I've Got The Fire\" (Montrose cover). A studio recording of \"Drifter\" (with Adrian Smith instead of Dennis Stratton) would appear on their next album \"Killers\", and a studio version of \"I've Got The Fire\" with Bruce Dickinson appeared on the B-side of \"Flight of Icarus\" a few years later. At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of \"I've Got The Fire\" with Paul Di'Anno on vocals.\n\nThe singles from U2's album \"The Joshua Tree\" were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33 rpm. Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45.\n\nThe B-52's UK 7-inch single of \"Love Shack\" was released with live versions of \"Planet Claire\" and \"Rock Lobster\" on the B-side, the B-side playing at 33 1/3rpm. The follow-up \"Roam\" followed suit, including live versions of \"Whammy Kiss\" and \"Dance This Mess Around\" on the B-side playing at 33 1/3rpm.\n\nThe Rolling Stones released \"Brown Sugar\" from their album \"Sticky Fingers\" in May 1971. While the American single featured only \"Bitch\" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of \"Let It Rock\", the Chuck Berry classic, recorded at the University of Leeds during the 1971 tour of the UK.\n\nThe concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:\n\nThe term \"b/w\", an abbreviation of \"backed with\" is often used to introduce the B-side of a record. The term \"c/w\", for \"coupled with\", is used similarly.\n\n"}
{"id": "16695961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16695961", "title": "Aetheric Mechanics", "text": "Aetheric Mechanics\n\nAetheric Mechanics is a graphic novella created by Eagle Award-winning writer Warren Ellis. It is 48 pages long, illustrated in black and white by Gianluca Pagliarini, and was published by Avatar Press in October 2008.\n\n\"Aetheric Mechanics\" is set in an alternate history March 1907, where steampunk technology is advanced far beyond the technology of the modern real world, including two-way television communications, air- and spacecraft powered by reactionless drives, and large combat mecha. The British Empire (which in this setting, includes realms on other planets) is engaged in a war against Ruritania. The war is not going favourably for Britain; however, the British government is covering up just how badly the war is going, including the fact that Ruritania is preparing an invasion of Britain.\n\nDr. Robert Watcham, a captain and doctor in the British army on the French front, returns to London at the start of the story after his tour of duty is over. His friend, roommate, and colleague, Sax Raker, is the greatest detective in London, and one of the finest minds in Britain, with Watcham having written a number of exploits about him for the popular press. At the time of Watcham's return, Raker has been commissioned by Inspector Jarratt of Scotland Yard to investigate another case. A number of observers witnessed a spectral figure, flickering in and out of existence, murdering an engineer specialising in aetheric mechanics outside of the Royal Society, with several others having gone missing.\n\nInvestigating outside the Society, Raker notices traces of mud beneath the victim, then is drawn to a figure standing in the crowd. Raker reveals it to be none other than his persistent rival, Inanna Meyer, whom Watcham (in a period of narration) notes that Raker is obsessed with but is unable to face that fact. Originally surmising that Inanna was hired by the Ruritanian government to destabilise Britain's vital science and engineering community, she reveals that she is now working for the British government: Raker's brother, Dunmow, recruited her into the British Secret Service, and she was also investigating the murder.\n\nWith that piece of information, Raker is able to solve the case, deducing that the mud near the victim came from the River Fleet. He therefore surmises that a villain has been kidnapping scientists to create some type of weapon directly beneath London, and the murder was done to silence a failed kidnapping. Raker, Watcham, and Inanna head into the River Fleet's underground channel as the Ruritanian aeroplanes begin a heavy fire-bombing of London in preparation for their final assault on Britain.\n\nBeneath London, they indeed find a large colony of kidnapped scientists, now escaping from the Ruritanian bombing. The \"man who wasn't there\" is also found, and identifies himself as Jonathan Vogel. Vogel explains that he is actually from the future, and that the reason he is fading in and out if existence is due to an accident he experienced. Vogel was a scientist working on an addition to the Large Hadron Collider which would have enabled ansible-like communication with a space probe being sent to Pluto using a quantum string. However, the \"other\" end of the string became loose, fixing onto 1905 – the year the special relativity was proposed by Albert Einstein, thus eliminating the theory of aether that had been held before. Vogel was sent back through time, along with his personal handheld computer – containing, among other things, the stories of Sherlock Holmes and Sexton Blake, \"The Prisoner of Zenda\", and a number of old movies and Japanese anime.\n\nVogel explains that, to 'bridge' between the two realities, the stories contained in his handheld were merged with the real-world 1905, creating the world of \"Aetheric Mechanics\" – and that neither Sax, nor Watcham, nor Inanna, nor Ruritania were real. Vogel states that the flickering is him being stranded between two worlds, and he has constructed a computer which, within a few hours, will finish its calculation to repair the damage caused to time, allowing Vogel to return home by destroying the fictional world he created.\n\nSeeing that as a chance to prevent Britain's destruction by Ruritania, Inanna and Watcham agree to let Vogel continue. They do not notice that Raker is horrified and outraged at the thought of not existing. Raker removes his pistol and shoots Vogel in the chest, killing him. He explains that he has finally realised the one thing he can't do: bear to think of a world where Inanna doesn't exist. Leaving Inanna and Watcham dumbstruck behind him, Raker races back through the tunnels below London, promising that using his intellect, he will still manage to find a way to prevent Britain from losing the war.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "643440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=643440", "title": "Botfly", "text": "Botfly\n\nBotflies, also known as warble flies, heel flies and gadflies, are a family of flies technically known as Oestridae. Their larvae are internal parasites of mammals, some species growing in the host's flesh and others within the gut. The \"Dermatobia hominis\" is the only species of botfly known to parasitize humans routinely, though other species of flies cause myiasis in humans.\n\nA botfly, also written bot fly, bott fly or bot-fly in various combinations, is any fly in the family Oestridae. Their lifecycles vary greatly according to species, but the larvae of all species are internal parasites of mammals. Largely according to species, they also are known variously as warble flies, heel flies, and gadflies. The larvae of some species grow in the flesh of their hosts, while others grow within the hosts' alimentary tracts.\n\nThe word \"bot\" in this sense means a maggot. A warble is a skin lump or callus such as might be caused by an ill-fitting harness, or by the presence of a warble fly maggot under the skin. \nThe human botfly, \"Dermatobia hominis\", is the only species of botfly whose larvae ordinarily parasitise humans, though flies in some other families episodically cause human myiasis and are sometimes more harmful.\n\nThe bot fly will hijack a mosquito to inject the host with the eggs.\n\nThe Oestridae now are generally defined as including the former families Oestridae, Cuterebridae, Gasterophilidae, and Hypodermatidae as subfamilies.\n\nThe Oestridae, in turn, are a family within the superfamily Oestroidea, together with the families Calliphoridae, Rhinophoridae, Sarcophagidae, and Tachinidae.\n\nOf families of flies causing myiasis, the Oestridae include the highest proportion of species whose larvae live as obligate parasites within the bodies of mammals. Roughly 150 species are known worldwide. Most other species of flies implicated in myiasis are members of related families, such as blowflies and screwworm flies in the Calliphoridae.\n\nBotflies deposit eggs on a host, or sometimes use an intermediate vector such as the common housefly, mosquitoes, and, in the case of \"Dermatobia hominis\", a species of tick. They are common in Belize. The smaller fly is firmly held by the botfly female and rotated to a position where the botfly attaches some 30 eggs to the body under the wings. Larvae from these eggs, stimulated by the warmth and proximity of a large mammal host, drop onto its skin and burrow underneath. Intermediate vectors are often used, since a number of animal hosts recognise the approach of a botfly and flee.\n\nEggs are deposited on animal skin directly, or the larvae hatch and drop from the eggs attached to the intermediate vector: the body heat of the host animal induces hatching upon contact or immediate proximity. Some forms of botfly also occur in the digestive tract after ingestion by licking.\nMyiasis can be caused by larvae burrowing into the skin (or tissue lining) of the host animal. Mature larvae drop from the host and complete the pupal stage in soil. They do not kill the host animal, thus they are true parasites.\n\nThe equine botflies present seasonal difficulties to equestrian caretakers, as they lay eggs on the insides of horses' front legs, on the cannon bone and knees and sometimes on the throat or nose, depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the laying season (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth and from there to the intestines, where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at the site. Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and tendons are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sandpaper and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10–12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats itself. Botflies can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including dichlorvos, ivermectin and trichlorfon.\n\nIn cattle, the lesions caused by these flies can become infected by \"Mannheimia granulomatis\", a bacterium that causes lechiguana, characterized by rapid-growing, hard lumps beneath the skin of the animal. Without antibiotics, an affected animal will die within three to 11 months.\n\n\"Dermatobia hominis\", the human botfly, occasionally uses humans to host its larvae. The larva, because of its spines, can pose an extremely painful subepidermal condition. The fastest way to remove a botfly is by putting a generous amount of iodine in the hole. The botfly will react instantly by poking out of the hole. Another removal method is to use the tree sap of the \"matatorsalo\", found in Costa Rica, which is reputed to kill the larva, yet leave its body in the skin. Additionally, one can attempt to seal the breathing hole of the larva with nail polish or petroleum jelly; after a day, with a clinical professional, the breathing hole is enlarged and the larva is removed with forceps. Squeezing the larvae out is not recommended, as it can cause the larvae to rupture; their bodily fluids have been known to cause severe anaphylactic shock. Use of adhesive tape can work, but carries additional risk of infection because portions of the larva's breathing tube can be broken off by the tape and make the remainder of the body difficult to remove.\n\nIn cold climates supporting reindeer or caribou-reliant populations, large quantities of \"Hypoderma tarandi\" (caribou warble fly) maggots are available to human populations during the butchery of animals.\n\nThe sixth episode of season one of the television series \"Beyond Survival\" entitled \"The Inuit – Survivors of the Future\" features survival expert Les Stroud and two Inuit guides hunting caribou on the northern coast of Baffin Island near Pond Inlet, Nunavut, Canada. Upon skinning and butchering of one of the animals, numerous larvae (presumably \"Hypoderma tarandi\", although not explicitly stated) are apparent on the inside of the caribou pelt. Stroud and his two Inuit guides eat (albeit somewhat reluctantly) one larva each, with Stroud commenting that the larva \"tastes like milk\" and was historically commonly consumed by the Inuit people.\n\nCopious art dating back to the Pleistocene in Europe confirms their consumption in premodern times, as well.\n\n\n"}

By some estimates, approximately 10 million US workers are creative professionals; depending upon the depth and breadth of the definition, this estimate may be doubled.\n\nAlthough creative professionals have been a part of the workforce for more than 500 years, several events during the past decade have altered industry and public perception of these workers.\n\nThe change in status began in the late 1990s when demand for creative workers was high due to the internet boom. Creative workers found that their talents in graphic and interactive design were valuable, and so, the workers began to develop independent cultures in select cities throughout the world, notably San Francisco, New York City and Boston. Some smaller cities, such as Austin and Portland also became centers where creative people found abundant opportunity. This trend has been documented in author Richard Florida's book, The Creative Class.\n\nAs the creative workforce has evolved in the post-dot.com era, creative workers have continued to flourish. Daniel H. Pink's book \"A Whole New Mind\" describes the transition in American business from information age to conceptual age. Pink describes information-era jobs as expendable and exportable, and offers that the MFA may yield more value for newer American workers than the MBA might generate in today's economy.\n\nThe Creative Professional, by Howard Blumenthal, describes the phenomenon from yet another perspective: that of the individual worker now emerging as a serious business professional with specific skills on par with lawyers, accountants, doctors, and other workers who are perceived to be within a special class. The book describes the unique business and career issues for the individual creative worker.\n\nTo date, most of the information about this growing phenomenon exists in book form. Many of the ideas and mechanisms are related to changes in copyright law, as described by Lawrence Lessig and Creative Commons.\n\nUniversity education for creative professionals is often presented under older definitions of music, art, and related disciplines, but the processes related to creative thought, particularly as they apply to work, are found in books about cognitive psychology. Author and cognitive thinking researcher Howard Gardner has defined a variety of intelligences related to creative workers. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has described the process of creative work effectively in several books, including Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. Professors in Business have also started to explore the success factors for creative professionals including Harvard Business School Professor Teresa Amabile who has studied and published research on creative professionals like author John Irving among others.\n\nCorporate research and the development of products and services specifically for creative professionals has started to crop up as companies hire increasing numbers of creative professionals to compete on innovation. Recent changes to corporate slogans are indicative of the trend. In 2003, GE's slogan changed from \"We Bring Good Things To Life\" to \"Imagination at Work\" and Hewlett Packard adopted the slogan \"Invent.\"\n\nCreativity, such as poetic creativity, has been an area of fascination for many ancient traditions. For example, Nasadiya Sukta the Hindu creation hymn states \"Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought, but who really knows how creation happened?\".\n\n"}

{"id": "40405533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40405533", "title": "Der Busant", "text": "Der Busant\n\nDer Busant, also known as Der Bussard (both German names for the Common Buzzard), is a Middle High German verse narrative, containing 1074 lines of rhyming couplets. The story tells of a love affair between the Princess of France and the Prince of England, who elope but are separated after a buzzard steals one of the princess's rings. After more than a year of separation, with the prince having gone mad and living as a wild man, they are reunited.\n\nKnown from a single fifteenth-century manuscript and three fragments, \"Der Busant\" emerged from a thematic tradition of wild men, thieving birds, and adventures of separated lovers. It is close to several other contemporary stories, such that a common origin has been hypothesised. The work has been described as a novel-like example of the \"Märe\" style of poetry. Cultural impact of the poem is visible in several surviving tapestries, as well as a possible influence in William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nThe Princess of France is engaged to the King of Morocco in an unwanted political marriage. To rescue her, the Prince of England (then studying in Paris) disguises himself, sneaks into the castle, and finds her. The two then elope. While she is sleeping in a forest, he admires two of her rings. Suddenly, a buzzard flies by and steals one of them. The prince follows the bird but gets lost in the woods and loses his mind from grief.\n\nThe prince lives for a year as a wild man. In the meantime, the princess has taken refuge in a mill and makes a living sewing, waiting all the time for her lover's return. She is taken in, unrecognized, by the prince's uncle (a duke) and aunt, who had become interested in the origin of the fine needlework and, after taking one look at the princess, recognizes her nobility. One day the duke is out hunting and captures the wild prince, whom he takes back to the castle and attempts for six weeks to cure.\n\nWhen the prince is about to prove his noble upbringing during a hunt for falcons, he captures a buzzard and to everyone's surprise bites its head off. When he explains his actions, he recounts his story, and the princess is able to recognise him. The two then live happily ever after.\n\nThe poem survives in its entirety in one fifteenth-century manuscript, and there are three additional fragments. The manuscript is preserved in the State and University Library of Bremen, MS B.42, which, according to Hans-Friedrich Rosenfeld, is \"poorly and randomly corrected\" (\"schlecht und willkürlich korrigiert\"). The three fragments are in State Archive of the Russian Federation, cod. 1432; Baden State Library cod. St. Georg 86; and in the private collection of August Closs, formerly owned by Baden State Library.\n\nSandra Linden, following Rosenfeld and Reinhold Köhler, dates the work to the early fourteenth century. The manuscript contains 172 double-sided sheets of cotton paper; a copy of the work of the thirteenth-century Swabian poet Freidank takes up most of the first half of the manuscript. Each page contains 24 lines; initials such as chapter titles and initial capitals are in red. The manuscript is bound with two parchment deeds serving as covers (one of them dated to 1403; the heavily damaged other, a deed of sale pertaining to a house in Basel, is older); the deeds prove that the manuscript was bound and held for a long time in Switzerland.\n\nMeyer and Mooyer, who published the contents of the manuscript in 1833, comment that the copier and compiler seemed to have organized his materials haphazardly and all-too freely (even carelessly) adapted spelling to his own taste; a sixteenth-century editor corrected many errors in the manuscript's margins. Still, many lines appear to be missing and others make little sense. The manuscript was long thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the city library of Bremen. How it got there from Switzerland is unknown. A page is retained in the fragment of a collection c. 1380, written on paper in the Alsace and edited by Robert Priebsch; the fragment was in the collection of August Closs, which was bequeathed to the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies. Modern scholars of the poem cite it from Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen's \"Hundert altdeutsche Erzählungen\" (1850; republished 1961); a new edition was announced as part of a project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, \"Edition und Kommentierung der deutschen Versnovellistik des 13. und 14. Jahrhunderts\".\n\nCentral to the plot of the poem is the theme of the buzzard (or other bird of prey) who swoops down from the skies to steal a lady's ring, prompting her knight to go and find the ring again. The lovers are thus separated for a while, and the knight is given the opportunity for adventure before they are reunited. A popular theme in literature probably deriving from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" material, it first appears in Western literature in \"Guillaume d'Angleterre\" and is in use still, as evidenced in Peter Bichsel's \"Der Busant\" (1998), a story also involving loss of identity. This theme is to be distinguished from what folklorist Gordon Hall Gerould called \"the motive of the man tried by fate\", since the main character in such stories (Gerould categorizes them as following the Saint Eustace motif) experiences separation from society for different (usually religious) reasons.\n\nAmong contemporary texts, \"Der Busant\" shares the theme of a treasure being stolen by a bird with several other works. This includes \"L'Escoufle\" by Jean Renart (twelfth or thirteenth century), a chivalric romance 1902 lines long in which a kite performs the same action, as well as the Italian \"La storia di Ottinello e Giulia\", the French \"La belle histoire d'amour de Pierre de Provence et de la belle Maguelonne, fille du roi de Naples\", and a story from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", \"Tale of Kamar al-Zaman\". Paul Meyer compared \"Der Busant\" and \"L'Escoufle\" and suggests that the two were derived from a single source, yet to be found; the comparison was first made by Köhler, and according to Rosenfeld, later cited by Linden, that original is a French text. Ph. Aug. Becker, however, in a 1937 review of a study of Renart, denies such a source text and claims the theme as Renart's own invention. According to Rosenfeld, style and individual motifs suggest that the fourteenth-century original of the poem was influenced by Konrad von Würzburg (he singles out his \"Partonopier\"); the elopement is, he says, influenced by Rudolf von Ems's \"Wilhelm von Orlens\", and the depiction of the Prince's madness by Hartmann von Aue's \"Iwein\".\n\nThe general theme of a man becoming wild, evident in the Prince's transformations, is likewise an old one: it dates back to the eleventh century, with twelfth-century figures such as Merlin, Tristan, Renaud de Montauban, and Orson also undergoing such a temporary transformation.\n\nThe prince's descent into madness is conventional in many ways. Typical for this kind of narrative poem, according to Linden, is the opposition between culture and nature, and the prince's madness follows a conventional plot: he moves away from culture and into the moral and physical wilderness (\"Gewilde\") of the forest, where chaos reigns; as he does so, he loses, one by one, the qualities which characterize him as a human of high birth—by scratching and hitting himself he destroys his beauty, he tears his clothes off, and finally he begins walking on all fours. He shares this particular development toward insanity with such characters as Ywain and Lancelot. According to John Twyning, this descent into madness in \"Der Busant\" inspired the plot in which four lovers are lost in the woods in William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"; he describes the latter as an intended \"riff\" on the German poem.\n\nThe poem used to be considered a novel-like example of the \"Märe\" (), which is a German style of narrative poem, typically between 150 and 2000 lines, usually dealing with profane matters such as love; some critics discern three different types—farcical, courtly, and didactic. \"Der Busant\" partakes of the French tradition of \"Die schöne Magelone\" (), but also shows affinity with the work of Konrad von Würzburg and the \"Iwein\".\n\nNumerous depictions of the poem were produced, including a long piece of tapestry with fragments now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Museum für Angewandte Kunst in Cologne, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, and in Paris. The Metropolitan piece shows the Prince of England as a wild man, whilst the Princess of France, mounted on her palfrey, finds refuge with a poor man. According to Jennifer Eileen Floyd, the existence of such tapestries is evidence of a bourgeois market for hangings and tapestries that depicted, amongst other things, the hunt; such hangings were not only within the reach of nobles, but also rich merchants and gentry.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42848258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42848258", "title": "Diversity of tactics", "text": "Diversity of tactics\n\nDiversity of tactics is a phenomenon wherein a social movement makes periodic use of force for disruptive or defensive purposes, stepping beyond the limits of nonviolence, but also stopping short of total militarization. It also refers to the theory which asserts this to be the most effective strategy of civil disobedience for social change. Diversity of tactics may promote nonviolent tactics, or armed resistance, or a range of methods in between, depending on the level of repression the political movement is facing. It sometimes claims to advocate for \"forms of resistance that maximize respect for life\".\n\nThe first clear articulation of diversity of tactics appears to have emerged from Malcolm X and other radical leaders in the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s. Shortly after Malcolm announced his departure from the Nation of Islam, he gave a speech entitled \"The Black Revolution\" where he promoted solidarity between those who practiced armed resistance against racism, and those who practiced nonviolence. He stated:\n\nIn March 1964, Gloria Richardson, leader of the Cambridge Maryland chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), took Malcolm X up on his offer to join forces with civil rights organizations. Richardson (who’d recently been honored on stage at the March on Washington) told \"The Baltimore Afro-American\" that \"Malcolm is being very practical…The federal government has moved into conflict situations only when matters approach the level of insurrection. Self-defense may force Washington to intervene sooner.\"\n\nIn the same year, Howard Zinn (then on SNCC’s Board of Advisers) published his essay \"The Limits of Nonviolence,\" in the influential civil rights journal \"Freedomways\". In the article, the historian concluded that nonviolent direct action would not be sufficient to break Jim Crow in the South. In his 1965 book, \"SNCC: The New Abolitionists\", Zinn explained the philosophy that dominated the movement:\n\nIn 1968, Zinn elaborated further on tactical diversity with his book \"Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order\". The text was published in response to liberal Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, who’d recently written (in his book \"Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience\") that he supported Gandhian forms of direct action, but not tactics that involved resisting arrest; Fortas also rejected campaigns involving the strategic violation of normally just laws, or the destruction of another party’s property, or the injury to an oppressive party, including in direct self-defense (All of these tactics were becoming widespread in the Civil Rights Movement, Black Power movement and in the campaign against the Vietnam War).\n\nZinn produced an extended rebuttal to Fortas’ position; Regarding resisting arrest and judgment, Zinn countered that Gandhi had accepted the bad influence of Plato, who in his \"Crito\" dialogue, portrayed Socrates as cheerfully accepting his death sentence on the grounds that the citizen is obligated to abide by the final decision of the government, which is like a master to the people. Zinn points out that these are \"the arguments of the Legalist, of the statist, not the libertarian,\" and notes that Plato disdained democracy. In the face of Plato’s concern that sustained defiance of the law could topple the foundations of government, Zinn argues: \"When unjust decisions become the rule, then the government and its officials should be toppled.\"\n\nOn the breaking of normally just laws and conventions for the purpose of protest, Zinn notes that some of society’s worst problems—\"like hunger, or poor housing, or lack of medical care\"—are not the result of discrete laws, but of system-wide conditions; therefore targets cannot always be precise: \"Our most deep-rooted troubles are not represented by specific laws, but are so woven into the American society that the only way to get at them is to attack the fabric at any vulnerable point.\"\n\nZinn rejects the liberal’s \"easy and righteous dismissal of violence,\" noting that Henry Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of John Brown. Zinn acknowledges that \"nonviolence is more desirable than violence as a means\" but also posits that:\n\nIn particular, Zinn rejects moralizing over property destruction as historically ignorant and ethically shortsighted. He contends that in response to the massive violence of the state, the smashing of windows is a mercifully restrained disruption:\n\nZinn then addresses the claim that violence does irreparable harm to a movement’s cause, countering that history repeatedly shows both the limitations of nonviolence and the efficacy of combative means: \"Not until Negro demonstrations resulted in violence did the national government begin to work seriously on civil rights,\" the historian notes, using the Birmingham riot of 1963 as an example. Peaceful methods \"were enough to raise the issue, but not to resolve it.\"\n\nAt the same time, Zinn proposes \"a moral code on violence in civil disobedience,\" which would \"consider whether the disorder or violence is controlled or indiscriminate…\" This would engender a partially violent, yet predominantly non-lethal insurrection, which would be preferable to the alternative of a fully militarized, bloody civil war. Ultimately, Zinn comes down squarely for diversity of tactics:\n\n\"Disobedience and Democracy\" sold over 70,000 copies (making it Zinn’s most popular book prior to \"A People’s History of the United States\") and served as \"the theoretical buttress to the many acts of civil disobedience committed during those years of the war in Vietnam.\"\n\nIn the years after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more orderly forms, and was increasingly dominated by the middle-class. When the anti-nuclear power movement made progress after the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island, a rigorously nonviolent strategy—promoted by Bill Moyer and the Movement for a New Society, and embodied in the Clamshell Alliance—was often credited for the advance, and these methods came to dominate the social justice community. This corresponded with the rise of a highly effective police strategy of crowd control called \"negotiated management.\" Many social scientists have noted the \"institutionalization of movements\" in this period.\n\nThese currents largely constrained disruptive protest until the 1999 demonstrations against the World Trade Organization. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists (some of them in a black bloc formation), nonviolent civil disobedience organized by various NGOs (including Public Citizen and Global Exchange) and the Seattle Direct Action Network (DAN), and a mass permitted march organized by the AFL-CIO.\n\nIn the lead up to the shutdown, local group Seattle Anarchist Response (SAR) had circulated Ward Churchill’s text \"Pacifism as Pathology\" freely among protesters. SAR actively promoted diversity of tactics among the rank-and-file of DAN and criticized NGO hegemony of the protests. They often found an enthusiastic response. One DAN organizer told \"The Seattle Weekly\" that \"I'm emerging with a less strong opinion of what is right and wrong, and using different tactics so long as they're used well. That's not where I was a year ago.\" The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from Peoples Global Action (a network co-founded by the Zapatistas) which supported diversity of tactics and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. Medea Benjamin told \"The New York Times\" that \"These anarchists should have been arrested,\" while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants. In response, a group of scholar-activists including Christian Parenti, Robin Hahnel, and George Katsiaficas signed an open letter denouncing the \"tide of reaction\" that the NGO sector was organizing against militant protesters. \"Those who belittle and distance themselves from the actions of ‘the Anarchists from Eugene’ have either ignored or simply did not realize the level of contributions anarchists—black-clad and otherwise—made towards bringing the November 30th Festival of Resistance into reality.\" They also asserted that the established left, by advocating violence against certain protesters in order to protect corporate property, was fostering \"an uncritical acceptance of the dominant value system of American consumer society: private property has a higher value than life.\" \n\nIn her own response to the controversy, Barbara Ehrenreich decried the NGO leaders as \"hypocrites,\" and wrote that nonviolent activists ought to be \"treating the young rock-throwers like sisters and brothers in the struggle.\" The author-activist also criticized the dominant nonviolent paradigm as \"absurdly ritualized,\" as well as elitist for presuming to reject any protester who hadn’t gone through nonviolence training \"for hours or even days.\" Ehrenreich concluded: \"The people at Direct Action Network, Global Exchange, and other groups were smart enough to comprehend the workings of the WTO, IMF, and World Bank. Now it's time for them to figure out how large numbers of people can protest the international capitalist cabal without getting clobbered—or trashed by their fellow demonstrators—in the process.\"\n\nThe solution to Ehrenreich’s impasse was the growing acceptance of diversity of tactics in the anti-globalization movement. The first major indication was in April 2000, when the NGO coalition involved in demonstrations against the World Bank in Washington DC resisted calls by the media to denounce protesters who did not practice strict nonviolence. Spokesperson Nadine Bloch told the press that: \"What there was among the protesters [in Seattle] was alternative tactics. Property destruction is something done to things, not to people. I don‘t think that property destruction in the context of [this Washington protest] would be something very constructive. But when we look at what happened in Seattle, we have to say that all of that contributed to the media coverage we got, including those who you might say pushed the envelope.\"\n\nIn the lead up to the protests for the 2001 Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) summit in Quebec City, a major direct action organization known as SalAMI suffered a mass defection due to its intolerance of diversity of tactics. Numerous participants (including Jaggi Singh) criticized SalAMI for its \"dogmatism on nonviolence\" as well as perceived hierarchies within the organization. Out of this schism emerged le Convergence des luttes Anti-Capitalistes (CLAC). CLAC's \"Basis of Unity\" stated: \"Respecting a diversity of tactics, the CLAC supports the use of a variety of creative initiatives, ranging from popular education to direct action.\" The anti-FTAA demonstrations were massive, involving sixty thousand people at its peak, and received largely positive media coverage, even as they included widespread clashes with police and destruction of government property. Cindy Milstein observed that CLACs success in Quebec City sprang from using a broad repertoire that encompassed community organizing, international outreach and forceful confrontation (CLAC continue to be active in Quebec to this day, and composed part of the radical flank of the successful tuition-freeze protests of 2012).\n\nPeoples Global Action solidified its support for diversity of tactics at this time by dropping the word \"non-violent\" from its hallmark on civil disobedience. They explained that:\n\nIn recent years, numerous academics have addressed diversity of tactics. Eminent sociologist Francis Fox Piven, in analyzing strategies of disruptive protest, wrote that:\n\nPiven’s findings affirm that of other social movement scholars, such as William Gamson and Pamela Oliver. Oliver wrote that, \"Today’s young people are generally taught a celebratory history of the civil rights movement…Our young are rarely taught about the riots, and even many academic sources on the Black movement ignore or downplay the riots. It seems as if those who are old enough to remember the riots are trying to forget them.\" Within the sociology field itself, however, positive results from the \"radical flank effect\" are widely acknowledged. The radical flank effect was first named by Herbert H. Haines in his book \"Black Radicalism and the Civil Rights Mainstream\", where he states that \"the turmoil which the militants created was indispensable to black progress and indeed, black radicalization had the net effect of enhancing the bargaining position of mainstream civil rights groups and hastening many of their goals…[this finding] has implications for any social movement which is composed of moderate and radical factions…\"\n\nIn recent years, academic historians have become more forthright about the role of force in the civil rights movement. Scholars such as Charles M. Payne, Akinyele Umoja, and Timothy Tyson explicated on the utility of militant activity (ranging from armed deterrence to mass rioting) in ending formal segregation in the United States. In his book \"I’ve Got the Light of Freedom\", Payne reflected on the way in which black militancy co-existed with nonviolent ideals:\n\nHistorian Robin Kelley has written that \"armed self-defense actually saved lives, reduced terrorist attacks on African American communities, and laid the foundation for unparalleled community solidarity.\" Although this scholarship has been highly acclaimed, virtually none of its findings have been used in the popular depictions of the movement thus far.\n\nIn the influential anti-capitalist text \"The Coming Insurrection\", the authors prescribe an armed resistance that nonetheless avoids militarization: \"Weapons are necessary: it’s a question of doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary…the prospect of Iraq-style urban guerilla warfare, dragging on with no possibility of taking the offensive, is more to be feared than to be desired. The militarization of civil war is the defeat of insurrection.\"\n\nNumerous commentators consider the Ferguson and Baltimore rioting associated with the Black Lives Matter movement to have been productive forms of protest. A member of the Missouri governor's \"Ferguson Commission\" told the Huffington Post that \"If not for the unrest, we wouldn’t have seen municipal court reform. It’s certainly a game-changer.\" Grassroots leaders of the movement have refused to condemn episodes of violent protest, and widely \"embrace a diversity of tactics.\" \n\nThe woman’s rights movement in Britain became increasingly militant in the years leading up to the passage of suffrage. The primary instigator of this tendency was Emmeline Pankhurst. Pankhurst’s organization, the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), began disrupting political meetings and practicing nonviolent civil disobedience in 1904. The mainstream media made a distinction between the legalist suffragists and the law-breaking \"suffragettes\"; Pankhurst and her followers nonetheless accepted the latter label.\n\nBeginning in 1908, WSPU engaged in violent protests: smashing windows, fighting police officers, and eventually committing non-lethal bombings. Pankhurst famously said that a \"broken pane of glass is the most valuable argument in modern politics,\" and considered suffragette struggle a form of \"civil war.\" When imprisoned, suffragettes often engaged in hunger-strikes, and were the first high-profile group to systematically engage in this tactic, preceding Mohandas Gandhi by a decade.\n\nHistorian Trevor Lloyd wrote that \"by [1913] the suffragettes were no longer looking for opportunities for martyrdom. They wanted to fight against society.\" These activities drove away some of their sympathizers, but Pankhurst was unwavering, stating that:\n\nAmerican feminist Alice Paul began her activism with WSPU in Britain and participated in destructive protests there, breaking over forty windows by her own account. Returning to the US, Paul began introducing some suffragette tactics to the feminist movement in her home country. Paul’s organization, the National Women’s Party, was predominantly nonviolent in its activities, but Paul worked in close solidarity with Emmeline Pankhurst until the passage of suffrage, and hosted appearances by Pankhurst in the US on multiple occasions. In 1912, Harriot Stanton Blanch changed the name of her organization from the Equality League to the Women’s Political Union in order to demonstrate solidarity with the now-violent WSPU. In the months prior to the Nineteenth Amendment’s passage, American suffragists experimented with more militant tactics, breaking a window in a struggle with a police officer in October 1918, and burning the president in effigy in front of the White House in February 1919. In May 1919, President Wilson called a special session of Congress for the suffrage amendment. It passed both houses the following month.\n\nThe civil rights movement was not consistently nonviolent in a Gandhian sense; even during the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955–1956, most activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., kept arms in their homes. Under the influence of pacifists Bayard Rustin and Glen Smiley, a stricter code of nonviolence took hold in the late 1950s. The period of 1957–1959 was a nadir for the movement: fewer schools were desegregated in the three years following the bus boycott than in the three years prior, and black voter registration and bus desegregation remained stagnant. Activism fell to one of its lowest points of the post-war era, as most African-Americans in the South were terrorized into submission by the Ku Klux Klan. In 1959, Robert F. Williams, president of the Monroe, North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, made national headlines when he told the press that his chapter was armed and prepared to \"meet violence with violence.\" North Carolina activists had been having successful armed stand-offs against the Klan for several months beforehand, including a Native American action at \"The Battle of Hayes Pond.\" Williams was suspended for his militancy by NAACP chairman Roy Wilkins, but his policy became nationally popular among the rank-and-file, and the NAACP delegate assembly passed a resolution stating that \"We do not deny, but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assaults.\" Williams continued to promote armed resistance with his publication \"The Crusader\" and eventually resumed leadership of the Monroe NAACP chapter.\n\nThe national student sit-in movement began with the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina several months later. Although initiated as a nonviolent campaign which would not respond to white violence, in some locations, including Portsmouth Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee, blacks forcefully defended themselves against assaults. Robert F. Williams led a successful sit-in campaign in Monroe where, he reported, no racists dared to attack his group because it was well-known his use of nonviolence was strictly conditional. In Jacksonville, Florida, the local NAACP made preparations to defend nonviolent activists by enlisting a local street gang to respond to any attacks. This led to a citywide clash covered nationally as \"Axe-handle Saturday\" where dozens of blacks and whites were injured in August 1960. Lunch counters were desegregated in Jacksonville and many other sites of protest in the following months. Doug McAdam cited \"Axe-handle Saturday\" as an example of the specter of violent crisis that loomed over lunch counter sit-ins generally, finding that the threat of escalating chaos pressured authorities to make concessions.\n\nThe Freedom Rides of 1961 were originally conceived as a Gandhian campaign. After four months without a decision on desegregated busing from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), James Forman, Executive Secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led a delegation of nonviolent picketers to Monroe to work with Robert F. Williams. (Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama, had already benefitted from the protection of an armed group led by Colonel Stone Johnson). The Monroe Freedom Riders were brutally assaulted while picketing city hall, but were rescued by Williams and his group, who proceeded to exchange gunfire with white supremacist civilians and police. Numerous Freedom Riders have expressed gratitude to Williams for saving their lives that day. The ICC decided in the Freedom Riders’ favor less than one month after the Monroe conflict. In 1962, Freedom Rider John Lowry publicly praised Williams and proclaimed that nonviolent action could not be successful without a \"threat of violence.\" Other civil rights figures who praised Robert F.

It combines several elements of the flag of Tibet, with slightly different artistry, and contains many Buddhist symbols. Its primary elements are the sun and moon above the Himalayas, which represent Tibet, often known as the \"Land Surrounded by Snow Mountains\". On the slopes of the mountains stand a pair of snow lions. Held between the two lions is the eight-spoked Dharmacakra, represent the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism. Inside the wheel, the three-colored swirling jewel represents the practices of the ten exalted virtues and the 16 humane modes of conduct. The inscription on the swirling banner below is as follows:\"bod gzhung dga' ldan pho brang phyogs las rnam rgyal\" (\"Tibetan Government, Ganden Palace, victorious in all directions\".) The Ganden Palace, located in Drepung monastery was the residence of the Dalai Lamas until the 5th Dalai Lama. After the 5th Dalai Lama had moved to the Potala in the mid 17th century the Tibetan Government created by him in 1642 became known as the \"Ganden Phodrang\" Government.\n\nIt is the official emblem of the Central Tibetan Administration government-in-exile headquartered in Dharamsala, India. Along with their flag, the emblem is considered a symbol of the Tibetan independence movement and is thus banned in the People's Republic of China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region, which corresponds to the former area of control of the Tibetan government at Lhasa, as well as other areas in greater Tibet. The emblem is often seen printed in black-and-white and crimson-and-white variants, which is characteristic of the colors commonly seen in Buddhist iconography and dress.\n\n"}

While domestic servants were common in family households, the custom reflected household task distribution and taught pupils about service from both ends of the relationship very much reminiscent of the relationship between squire and knight in the Middle Ages.\n\nUnder school rules, fagging might entail harsh discipline and corporal punishment when those were standard practices. Fagging was sometimes associated with sexual abuse by those older boys.\n\nThe practice of personal fagging faded away during the 1970s and 1980s, but to some degree has been maintained in former colonies or has been replaced by systems which require junior boys to perform tasks for the benefit of the general school community.\n\nFagging originated as a structure for maintaining order in boarding schools, when schoolmasters' authority was practically limited to the classroom. Dr. Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby from 1828 to 1841, defined fagging as the power given by the authorities of the school to the Sixth Form, to be exercised by them over younger boys. Senior pupils were given both power over and responsibility for the behaviour of younger boys, thus creating a progressive social structure in the house, while teaching both parties something of service, a concept particularly highly valued in Victorian education and society.\n\nFagging was a fully established system at St Paul's, Eton, and Winchester in the sixteenth century. During the nineteenth century, almost all British public schools had a fagging system, and the numerous new boarding schools founded for the children of the British Empire generally adopted the system as a natural reflection of society.\n\nFagging carried with it well-defined rights and duties on both sides. The senior, sometimes called the fag-master, was the protector of his fags and responsible for their happiness and good conduct. In case of any problem outside the classroom, such as bullying or injustice, a junior boy's recourse was to him, not to a form master or housemaster, and, except in the gravest cases, all incidents were dealt with by the fag-master on his own responsibility (perhaps in consultation with other fag-masters or prefects) and without reporting to masters.\n\nThe duties undertaken by fags, the time taken, and their general treatment varied widely. Each school had its own traditions. Until around 1900 a fag's duties might include such humble tasks as blacking boots, brushing clothes and cooking breakfasts, and there was no limit as to hours. Later, fagging was restricted to such light tasks as running errands, bringing tea to the fag-masters' study and fagging at cricket or football. At many schools, fag-masters were expected to reward their fags for their efforts at the end of term by giving a monetary 'fag tip'. The 1911 \"Britannica\" details an evolution of the role at Eton College.\n\nDuring the late twentieth century, fagging fell out of use, as attitudes to boarding education and child development changed. Despite the reluctance of senior boys who had served their time and expected to enjoy the benefits of the system, between the 1960s and 1980s first the duties became less onerous and then the system was abolished at most major public schools. It is now believed to be obsolete in Great Britain.\n\n\n\n"}

A lie is a statement that is known to be untrue and is used to mislead.

James got an F after his teacher pointed out why that statement was false. James did not know that sea otters were in fact mammals because he heard that sea otters were fish from his older brother John, a marine biologist.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, false statement is a crime similar to perjury.\n\nIn U.S. law, a \"false statement\" generally refers to United States federal false statements statute, contained in . Most commonly, prosecutors use this statute to reach cover-up crimes such as perjury, false declarations, and obstruction of justice and government fraud cases.

There are two main types of footstool, which can be loosely categorized into those designed for comfort and those designed for function.\n\nThis type of footstool is used to provide comfort to a person seated, for example, in a chair or sofa. It is typically a short, wide, four-legged stool. The top is upholstered and padded in a fabric or animal hide, such as leather. This type of footstool is also a type of ottoman. It allows the seated person to rest their feet upon it, supporting the legs at a mostly horizontal level, thus giving rise to the alternate term \"footrest\". High quality footstools are height–adjustable.\n\nThis type of footstool supports a person's (usually a child's) feet that do not reach the floor when seated. The footstool is placed under the feet of a sitting person so that the person's feet may rest comfortably on it. An example is the type of piano footstool used in conjunction with a piano bench. It is also used to make the blood circulation of the body flow more freely when sitting down.\n\nA barber chair and a shoeshiner have foot rests. An automobile typically has a \"dummy pedal\" that acts as a foot rest to discourage \"riding the clutch\" or \"riding the brake\". A foot peg is another type of foot rest usually on BMX bicycles, motorcycles, the Ford N-Series tractor, some kayaks, the Impossible wheel, and other transportation devices.\n\nFootstools have been known for many years, and have evolved throughout history. The footstool is attested in ancient Egypt, where it was utilized to ascend chairs perched high off the ground. It was also used to rest a person's feet when he or she was seated.\n\nIn the 18th century a low, long footstool called a fender stool was popular. It was placed in front of the fireplace, and long enough for all of the family members to place their feet and warm them up.\n\nFootstools where generally interchangeable in everyday life from the 17th through the early 19th century. In early American homes the footstool was very valuable, and took precious space although the living quarters were cramped.\n\nIn line with this, the exhibition 'A History of the World' at Mevagissey Museum showed an emigrant's footstool which was made by an emigrant from Cornwall in North America sometime around 1850's.\n\n"}

Specifically, British and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Hebrew language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when Hebrew was little understood outside practicing Jewish communities.\n\nThe 18th-century British academy was rife with pseudo-scholars, mystics, and \"enthusiasts\" interested in the Hebrew language for diverse and polemical reasons. The linguistic and historical advances brought by the discovery of Sanskrit, the putative deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics by some scholars, and archaeological insights into the ancient Near East, brought major sea-changes in the scholarly understanding of Biblical history. Interest in the Hebrew language intensified as debates raged about whether there was a historical flood of Noah, and whether Hebrew was the most ancient language in the world, taught by God to Adam. Historical linguistic scholarship led the way in these debates. Some Hebraists had posts in academies or churches, while others were strictly amateur.\n\nSome Hebraists proposed theories that the vowels in the text of the Hebrew Bible, superadded to the text by the scribal tradition, were a Jewish conspiracy to mask the true meaning of Scripture. As a result, a genre of Hebraic scholarship concentrated on running the words of the Biblical text together, removing the vowels, dissecting the words in different ways, and adding alternate vowels so as to give an alternate sense to the text.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15040", "title": "Ido language", "text": "Ido language\n\nIdo is a constructed language, derived from Reformed Esperanto, created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds. Ido was specifically designed to be grammatically, orthographically, and lexicographically regular, and above all easy to learn and use. In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed international auxiliary language. It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives, called Esperantidos.\n\nIdo was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto, a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication. The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word \"\", meaning \"offspring\", since the language is a \"descendant\" of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community, but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, Louis Couturat, it declined in popularity. There were two reasons for this: first, the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects; and second, a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.\n\nIdo uses the same 26 letters as the English (Latin) alphabet, with no diacritics. It draws its vocabulary from English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese, and is largely intelligible to those who have studied Esperanto.\n\nSeveral works of literature have been translated into Ido, including \"The Little Prince\" and the Gospel of Luke. As of the year 2000, there were approximately 100–200 Ido speakers in the world.\n\nThe idea of a universal second language is not new, and constructed languages are not a recent phenomenon. The first known constructed language was Lingua Ignota, created in the 12th century. But the idea did not catch on in large numbers until the language Volapük was created in 1879. Volapük was popular for some time and apparently had a few thousand users, but was later eclipsed by the popularity of Esperanto, which arose in 1887. Several other languages such as Latino sine Flexione and Idiom Neutral had also been put forward. It was during this time that French mathematician Louis Couturat formed the \"Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language\".\n\nThis delegation made a formal request to the International Association of Academies in Vienna to select and endorse an international language; the request was rejected in May 1907. The Delegation then met as a Committee in Paris in October 1907 to discuss the adoption of a standard international language. Among the languages considered was a new language anonymously submitted at the last moment (and therefore against the Committee rules) under the pen name \"Ido\". In the end the Committee, always without plenary sessions and consisting of only 12 members, concluded the last day with 4 votes for and 1 abstention. They concluded that no language was completely acceptable, but that Esperanto could be accepted \"on condition of several modifications to be realized by the permanent Commission in the direction defined by the conclusions of the Report of the Secretaries [Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau] and by the Ido project\".\n\nEsperanto's inventor, L. L. Zamenhof, having heard a number of complaints, had suggested in 1894 a proposal for a Reformed Esperanto with several changes that Ido adopted and made it closer to French: eliminating the accented letters and the accusative case, changing the plural to an Italianesque \"-i\", and replacing the table of correlatives with more Latinate words. However, the Esperanto community voted and rejected Reformed Esperanto, and likewise most rejected the recommendations of the 1907 Committee composed by 12 members. Zamenhof deferred to their judgment, although doubtful. Furthermore, controversy ensued when the \"Ido project\" was found to have been primarily devised by Louis de Beaufront, whom Zamenhof had chosen to represent Esperanto before the Committee, as the Committee's rules dictated that the creator of a submitted language could not defend it. The Committee's language was French and not everyone could speak in French. When the president of the Committee asked who was the author of Ido's project, Couturat, Beaufront and Leau answered that they were not. Beaufront was the person who presented Ido's project and gave a description as a better, richer version of Esperanto. Couturat, Leau, Beaufront and Jespersen were finally the only members who voted, all of them for Ido's project. A month later, Couturat accidentally put Jespersen in a copy of a letter in which he acknowledged that Beaufront was the author of the Ido project. Jespersen was angered by this and asked for a public confession, which was never forthcoming.\n\nIt is estimated that some 20% of Esperanto leaders and 3–4% of ordinary Esperantists defected to Ido, which from then on suffered constant modifications seeking to perfect it, but which ultimately had the effect of causing many Ido speakers to give up on trying to learn it. Although it fractured the Esperanto movement, the schism gave the remaining Esperantists the freedom to concentrate on using and promoting their language as it stood. At the same time, it gave the Idists freedom to continue working on their own language for several more years before actively promoting it. The \"Uniono di la Amiki di la Linguo Internaciona\" (\"Union of Friends of the International Language\") was established along with an Ido Academy to work out the details of the new language.\n\nCouturat, who was the leading proponent of Ido, was killed in an automobile accident in 1914. This, along with World War I, practically suspended the activities of the Ido Academy from 1914 to 1920. In 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, published his own planned language, Novial. His defection from the Ido movement set it back even further.\n\nThe language still has active speakers today, and the Internet has sparked a renewal of interest in the language in recent years. A sample of 24 Idists on the Yahoo! group \"Idolisto\" during November 2005 showed that 57% had begun their studies of the language during the preceding three years, 32% from the mid-1990s to 2002, and 8% had known the language from before.\n\nFew changes have been made to Ido since 1922.\n\nCamiel de Cock was named secretary of linguistic issues in 1990, succeeding Roger Moureaux. He resigned after the creation of a linguistic committee in 1991. De Cock was succeeded by Robert C. Carnaghan, who held the position from 1992 to 2008. No new words were adopted between 2001 and 2006. Following the 2008–2011 elections of ULI's direction committee, Gonçalo Neves replaced Carnaghan as secretary of linguistic issues in February 2008. Neves resigned in August 2008. A new linguistic committee was formed in 2010. In April 2010, Tiberio Madonna was appointed as secretary of linguistic issues, succeeding Neves. \nIn January 2011, ULI approved eight new words. This was the first addition of words in many years. As of April 2012, the secretary of linguistic issues remains Tiberio Madonna.\n\nIdo has five vowel phonemes. The vowels and are interchangeable depending on speaker preference, as are and . The combinations /au/ and /eu/ become diphthongs in word roots but not when adding affixes.\n\nAll polysyllabic words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable except for verb infinitives, which are stressed on the last syllableskolo, kafeo and lernas for \"school\", \"coffee\" and the present tense of \"to learn\", but irar, savar and drinkar for \"to go\", \"to know\" and \"to drink\". If an i or u precedes another vowel, the pair is considered part of the same syllable when applying the accent rulethus radio, familio and manuo for \"radio\", \"family\" and \"hand\", unless the two vowels are the only ones in the word, in which case the \"i\" or \"u\" is stressed: dio, frua for \"day\" and \"early\".\n\nIdo uses the same 26 letters as the English alphabet and ISO Basic Latin alphabet with three digraphs and no ligatures or diacritics. Where the table below lists two pronunciations, either is perfectly acceptable.\n\nThe digraphs are:\n\nEach word in the Ido vocabulary is built from a root word. A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain affixes between the root and the grammatical ending.\n\nSome of the grammatical endings are defined as follows:\n\nThese are the same as in Esperanto except for \"-i\", \"-ir\", \"-ar\", \"-or\" and \"-ez\". Esperanto marks noun plurals by an \"agglutinative\" ending \"-j\" (so plural nouns end in \"-oj\"), uses \"-i\" for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses \"-u\" for the imperative. Verbs in Ido, as in Esperanto, do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.\n\nIdo word order is generally the same as English (subject–verb–object), so the sentence \"Me havas la blua libro\" is the same as the English \"I have the blue book\", both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:\n\nIdo generally does not impose rules of grammatical agreement between grammatical categories within a sentence. For example, the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject. Nor must the adjectives be pluralized as well the nounsin Ido \"the large books\" would be \"la granda libri\" as opposed to the French \"les grands livres\" or the Esperanto \"la grandaj libroj\".\n\nNegation occurs in Ido by simply adding ne before a verb: Me ne havas libro means \"I do not have a book\". This as well does not vary, and thus the \"I do not\", \"He does not\", \"They do not\" before a verb are simply Me ne, Il ne, and Li ne. In the same way, past tense and future tense negatives are formed by ne before the conjugated verb. \"I will not go\" and \"I did not go\" become Me ne iros and Me ne iris respectively.\n\nYes/no questions are formed by the particle ka in front of the question. \"I have a book\" (me havas libro) becomes Ka me havas libro? (do I have a book?). Ka can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question, corresponding to the English \"is it?\" Ka Mark? can mean, \"Are you Mark?\", \"Is it Mark?\", \"Do you mean Mark?\" depending on the context.\n\nThe pronouns of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in \"i\". Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns \"mi\" and \"ni\" may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has \"me\" and \"ni\" instead. Ido also distinguishes between intimate (\"tu\") and formal (\"vu\") second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (\"vi\") not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun \"lu\" (it can mean \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\", depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (\"il\"), feminine (\"el\"), and neuter (\"ol\") third-person pronouns.\n\nIt should be noted that \"ol\", like English \"it\" and Esperanto \"ĝi\", is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used \"for entities whose sex is indeterminate: \"babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, [cattle], cats,\" etc.\"\n\n\"Lu\" is often mistakenly labeled an epicene pronoun, that is, one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings, but in fact, \"lu\" is more properly a \"pan-gender\" pronoun, as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects.

It aimed to build the relationship between government and fashion industry and represent the interests of London couturiers. The organisation continued after the war and sought to present itself as an alternative to the revived Paris couture industry.\n\nSome sources suggest Inc Soc was established by Harry Yoxall, managing editor of \"British Vogue\", and others indicate it was the idea of Sir Cecil Weir of the Board of Trade.\n\nErnestine Carter states that the IncSoc had its origins in 1941 with an export collection sent to South America by the British Colour Council, designed by Charles Creed (at Fortnum & Mason), Norman Hartnell, Edward Molyneux, Digby Morton, Peter Russell, Victor Stiebel (of Jacqmar) and Worth London. Along with Bianca Mosca and Hardy Amies, all would go on to be founder-members of the IncSoc the following year, except Creed, who was the first designer voted in as a member.\n\nIn March 1942, on the invitation of the Board of Trade, the members of Inc Soc – all of whom were used to custom-creating designs for customers – designed 34 utility clothing garments suitable for mass manufacture in order to demonstrate how high-fashion elegance could be achieved within the strict rationing restrictions. Known as the Couturier Scheme, the project had a very high profile in the press at the time with a fashion show held to launch the clothes. The prototype models were featured in \"Vogue\" magazine and donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum later that year.\n\nInc Soc had organised seasonal showings in each London couture house based on the Parisian couture system. After the war, Inc Soc coordinated spring and autumn collections in London with the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris to allow cash-rich overseas buyers to take in both cities' collections.\n\nIn 1949, members of Inc Soc showcased British fashion in the film \"Maytime in Mayfair\" in a sequence that showed models wearing an outfit by each of the ten member designers.\n\nIn July 1968, The Guardian reported that although associate membership for makers of hats, gloves, shoes and other accessories had been wound up, the society continued with Edward Rayne as chairman and Lady Hartwell (previously Lady Pamela Berry) as president.\n\nBy 1969, IncSoc was reported to be struggling due to high taxes and overheads and competition from London's booming ready-to-wear designers. Most had added ready-to-wear designs to shore up their businesses. In January that year the society – which had shrunk from 12 to seven members over the previous six years – announced it would no longer host a group fashion event for UK and international buyers. Instead, each designer would host an individual show. The organisation was still extant in 1974, but disbanded soon afterwards.\n\nThe founding members were nicknamed the \"Big Eight\" in the press of the time. By 1949 they had become the \"Big Ten\" or \"Top Ten of Fashion\". The fashion journalist Ernestine Carter recalled in 1974: \"At one point we called them the Top Ten, another the First Eleven, once the Baker's Dozen, then a Rowing Eight. Finally, we stopped giving them numbers at all.\" Each new member needed to receive the votes of at least two-thirds of the existing members. Normally, the designer had to have shown at least four collections before being considered for membership, although some later members achieved this faster, due to the strength of their work.\n\nListings show joining date, where known, and were originally published in an article in \"Costume\", the journal of the Costume Society, in 2001. The couture house of Rahvis is not included in that article, but was listed as among the members in the 1960s in UK and international newspaper reports. In 1974, Ernestine Carter put together a potted history of the Society with the assistance of Ann Ryan, who administrated the Society between 1956 and 1960. They noted that Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, and Rahvis were the last three remaining members of the Society, with the shoemaker Edward Rayne, 'though not defunct, in abeyance.'\n\n\nAccording to Carter and Ryan, the presidents of the society and their dates were:\n\n\nThe chairs were:\n\n"}

The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.\n\nA prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.\n\nAn encounter with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge appears to have spurred Edison to pursue the development of a motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in Kaust, Kentucky, Muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his zoopraxiscope, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. The Edison facility was very close by, and the lecture was possibly attended by both Edison and his company's official photographer, William Dickson. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's laboratory in West Orange; Muybridge later described how he proposed a collaboration to join his device with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the U.S. Patent Office announcing his plans to create a device that would do \"for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear\". It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: \"we may see & hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present\". In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots \"kineto-\" (\"movement\") and \"scopos\" (\"to view\").\n\nEdison assigned Dickson, one of his most talented employees, to the job of making the Kinetoscope a reality. Edison would take full credit for the invention, but the historiographical consensus is that the title of creator can hardly go to one man:\n\nWhile Edison seems to have conceived the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed the bulk of the experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.\nDickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting progress at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 of an inch wide, directly on to a cylinder (also referred to as a \"drum\"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as \"Monkeyshines, No. 1\", it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.\n\nThe project would soon head off in more productive directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, for which he departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a \"chronophotographic gun\"—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon his return to the United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device is often referred to as an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily \"freeze\" the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.\n\nThe question of when the Edison lab began working on a filmstrip device is a matter of historical debate. According to Dickson, in the summer of 1889, he began cutting the stiff celluloid sheets supplied by Carbutt into strips for use in such a prototype machine; in August, by his description, he attended a demonstration of George Eastman's new flexible film and was given a roll by an Eastman representative, which was immediately applied to experiments with the prototype. As described by historian Marta Braun, Eastman's product\n\nwas sufficiently strong, thin, and pliable to permit the intermittent movement of the film strip behind [a camera] lens at considerable speed and under great tension without tearing ... stimulat[ing] the almost immediate solution of the essential problems of cinematic invention.\nSome scholars—in particular, Gordon Hendricks, in \"The Edison Motion Picture Myth\" (1961)—have argued that the lab began working on a filmstrip machine much later and that Dickson and Edison misrepresented the date to establish priority for reasons of both patent protection and intellectual status. In any event, though film historian David Robinson claims that \"the cylinder experiments seem to have been carried on to the bitter end\" (meaning the final months of 1890), as far back as September 1889—while Edison was still in Europe, but corresponding regularly with Dickson—the lab definitely placed its first order with the Eastman company for roll film. Three more orders for roll film were placed over the next five months.\n\nOnly sporadic work was done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19 mm (3/4 inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter \"permitted a flash of light so brief that [each] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image.\" The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.\n\nOn May 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. The New York \"Sun\" described what the club women saw in the \"small pine box\" they encountered:\n\nIn the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect...\n\nThe man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as \"Dickson Greeting\". On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a \"Kinetographic Camera\", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an \"Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects\". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, \"I have been able to take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient.\" Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, \"Dickson Greeting\" and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film projection system that was apparently abandoned.\n\nIn the spring of the following year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of the mechanics of the viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8 inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 \"Phonogram\" of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.\n\nAs for the Kinetoscope itself, there is a significant disagreement over the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor Herman Casler described as \"authoritative\" by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, \"Just above the film...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening in the rim [rotates] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening in the top of the case.\" Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, \"between the lamp and film\". The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens. Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.\n\nOn February 21, 1893, a patent was issued for the system that governed the intermittent movement of film in the Kinetograph. However, Robinson (1997) misleadingly stated that \"patents for the Kinetograph camera and the Kinetoscope viewer were finally issued\" in early 1893 (p. 38). As explained by Braun (1992), \"except for the device used to stop and start the moving film, which was granted a patent in 1893, all the parts of the application describing the camera were ultimately disallowed because of previous inventors' claims\" (p. 191). Also, Hendricks (1961) described the outcome of the camera patent similarly to Braun (pp. 136–137). The facts in sum are: (a) a patent solely for the intermittent movement apparatus was issued in February 1893; (b) all the other elements of the original Kinetograph patent applications were successfully challenged; and (c) a patent, number 589,168, for a complete Kinetograph camera, one substantially different from that described in the original applications, was issued on August 31, 1897.\n\nThe escapement-based mechanism would be superseded within a few years by competing systems, in particular those based on the so-called Geneva drive or \"Maltese cross\" that would become the norm for both movie cameras and projectors. The exhibition device itself—which, despite erroneous accounts to the contrary, never employed intermittent film movement, only intermittent lighting or viewing—was finally awarded its patent, number 493,426, on March 14. The Kinetoscope was ready to be unveiled.\n\nThe premiere of the completed Kinetoscope was held not at the Chicago World's Fair, as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was \"Blacksmith Scene\" (aka \"Blacksmiths\"); directed by Dickson and shot by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, known as the Black Maria. Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never took place at the Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson's absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown. Robinson argues that \"[s]peculation that a single Kinetoscope reached the Fair seems to be conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London,\" which states, \"the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair.\" Hendricks, in contrast, refers to accounts in the \"Scientific American\" of July 21 and October 21, 1893, that constitute evidence no less \"conclusive\" that one Kinetoscope did make it to the fair. The weight of evidence supports Hendricks; as fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, \"Doubt has been cast on the reports of [the Kinetoscope's] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial\" (Appelbaum does err in claiming that the device was \"first shown at the Exposition\").\nWork proceeded, though slowly, on the Kinetoscope project. On October 6, a U.S. copyright was issued for a \"publication\" received by the Library of Congress consisting of \"Edison Kinetoscopic Records.\" It remains unclear what film was awarded this, the first motion picture copyright in North America. By the turn of the year, the Kinetoscope project would be reenergized. During the first week of January 1894, a five-second film starring an Edison technician was shot at the Black Maria; \"Fred Ott's Sneeze\", as it is now widely known, was made expressly to produce a sequence of images for an article in \"Harper's\" magazine. Never intended for exhibition, it would become one of the most famous Edison films and the first identifiable motion picture to receive a U.S. copyright. Three months later, the Kinetoscope's epochal moment arrived.\n\nOn April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: \"Barber Shop\", \"Bertoldi (mouth support)\" (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), \"Bertoldi (table contortion)\", \"Blacksmiths\", \"Roosters\" (some manner of cock fight), \"Highland Dance\", \"Horse Shoeing\", \"Sandow\" (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), \"Trapeze\", and \"Wrestling\". As historian Charles Musser describes, a \"profound transformation of American life and performance culture\" had begun.\n\nTwenty-five cents for no more than a few minutes of entertainment was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.\n\nOne of the new firms to enter the field was the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company; the firm's partners, brothers Otway and Grey Latham, Otway's friend Enoch Rector, and their employer, Samuel J. Tilden Jr., sought to combine the popularity of the Kinetoscope with that of prizefighting. This led to a series of significant developments in the motion picture field: The Kinetograph was then capable of shooting only a 50-foot-long negative (evidence suggests feet was the longest length actually used). At 16 frames per foot, this meant a maximum running time of 20 seconds at 40 frames per second (fps), the speed most frequently employed with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been used as far back as 1891, a film could run for almost 27 seconds. Hendricks identifies \"Sandow\" as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online catalog, where its duration is listed as 40 seconds. Even at the slowest of these rates, the running time would not have been enough to accommodate a satisfactory exchange of fisticuffs; 16 fps, as well, might have been thought to give too herky-jerky a visual effect for enjoyment of the sport. The Kinetograph and Kinetoscope were modified, possibly with Rector's assistance, so they could manage filmstrips three times longer than had previously been used.\n\nOn June 14, a match with abbreviated rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images or even more were shot at the rate of 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.\n\nJust three months after the commercial debut of the motion picture came the first recorded instance of motion picture censorship. The film in question showed a performance by the Spanish dancer Carmencita, a New York music hall star since the beginning of the decade. According to one description of her live act, she \"communicated an intense sexuality across the footlights that led male reporters to write long, exuberant columns about her performance\"—articles that would later be reproduced in the Edison film catalog. The Kinetoscope movie of her dance, shot at the Black Maria in mid-March 1894, was playing in the New Jersey resort town Asbury Park by summer. The town's founder, James A. Bradley, a real estate developer and leading member of the Methodist community, had recently been elected a state senator: \"The \"Newark Evening News\" of 17 July 1894 reported that [Senator] Bradley...was so shocked by the glimpse of Carmencita's ankles and lace that he complained to Mayor Ten Broeck. The showman was thereupon ordered to withdraw the offending film, which he replaced with \"Boxing Cats\".\" The following month, a San Francisco exhibitor was arrested for a Kinetoscope operation \"alleged to be indecent.\" The group whose disgruntlement occasioned the arrest was the Pacific Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose targets included \"illicit literature, obscene pictures and books, the sale of morphine, cocaine, opium, tobacco and liquors to minors, lottery tickets, etc.,\" and which proudly took credit for having \"caused 70 arrests and obtained 48 convictions\" in a recent two-month span.\n\nThe Kinetoscope was also gaining notice on the other side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was demonstrated at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the Lumière brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system. On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", for instance, claims that Edison \"apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright .\" As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison \"balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents\" and \"saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope.\" Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.\n\nThe Kinetophone (aka Phonokinetoscope) was an early attempt by Edison and Dickson to create a sound-film system. Reports suggest that in July 1893, a Kinetoscope accompanied by a cylinder phonograph had been presented at the Chicago World's Fair. The first known movie made as a test of the Kinetophone was shot at Edison's New Jersey studio in late 1894 or early 1895, which is now referred to as The Dickson Experimental Sound Film; this film, along with a short film from 1913 called Nursery Favorites and a 1912 demonstration film, are the only surviving movies with live-recorded sound made for the Kinetophone. In March 1895, Edison offered the device for sale; involving no technological innovations, it was a Kinetoscope whose modified cabinet included an accompanying cylinder phonograph. Kinetoscope owners were also offered kits with which to retrofit their equipment. The first Kinetophone exhibitions appear to have taken place in April. Though a Library of Congress educational website states, \"The picture and sound were made somewhat synchronous by connecting the two with a belt,\" this is incorrect. As historian David Robinson describes, \"The Kinetophone...made no attempt at synchronization. The viewer listened through tubes to a phonograph concealed in the cabinet and performing approximately appropriate music or other sound.\" Historian Douglas Gomery concurs, \"[Edison] did not try to synchronize sound and image.\" Leading production sound mixer Mark Ulano writes, \"[O]nly 45 Kinetophones were made. They did NOT play synchronously other than the phonograph turned on when viewing and off when stopped.\" Though the surviving Dickson test involves live-recorded sound, certainly most, and probably all, of the films marketed for the Kinetophone were shot as silents, predominantly march or dance subjects; exhibitors could then choose from a variety of musical cylinders offering a rhythmic match. For example, three different cylinders with orchestral performances were proposed as accompaniments for \"Carmencita\": \"Valse Santiago\", \"La Paloma\", and \"Alma-Danza Spagnola\".\n\nEven as Edison followed his dream of securing the Kinetoscope's popularity by adding sound to its allure, many in the field were beginning to suspect that film projection was the next step that should be pursued. When Norman Raff communicated his customers' interest in such a system to Edison, the great inventor summarily rejected the notion:\n\nNo, if we make this screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show machines and selling a lot of them at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\n\nUnder continuing pressure from Raff, Edison eventually conceded to investigate the possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move appears to have been one of the central factors leading to his break with Edison that occurred in spring 1895.\n\nOver the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new \"peep show\" device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.\n\nBy the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Photoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Jenkins . The rights to the system had been acquired by Charles and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.\nAs far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

It remains important in formal situations, such as an ambassador presenting his or her credentials (a letter of credence), and in certain business circles.\n\nIn general, a person would not interact socially with others unless they had been properly introduced, whether in person or by letter. A person of lower social status would request a patron of higher social status to write a letter of introduction to a third party, also of higher social status than the first person, but lower than the second person. It was important to observe the niceties of etiquette in requesting, writing and presenting such letters, in such matters as the quality of the paper used, and whether it would be delivered unsealed to allow the requesting party to read it. For example, it was best practice to deliver a letter of introduction to the intended recipient with a visiting card, to allow the recipient to reciprocate by calling upon the sender the next day.\n\nWhen Benjamin Franklin served as Ambassador to France (1776–1785) he was besieged by those traveling to America who desired letters of introduction.

It was an important social and legal structure in early Roman history.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of a gens was the \"nomen gentilicium\", or \"gentile name\". Every member of a gens, whether by birth or adoption, bore this name. All nomina were based on other nouns, such as personal names, occupations, physical characteristics or behaviors, or locations. Consequently, most of them ended with the adjectival termination \"-ius\" (\"-ia\" in the feminine form).\n\nNomina ending in \"-aius\", \"-eius\", \"-eus\", and \"-aeus\" are typical of Latin families. Faliscan gentes frequently had nomina ending in \"-ios\", while Samnite and other Oscan-speaking peoples of southern Italy had nomina ending in \"-iis\". Umbrian nomina typically end in \"-as\", \"-anas\", \"-enas\", or \"-inas\", while nomina ending in \"-arna\", \"-erna\", \"-ena\", \"-enna\", \"-ina\", or \"-inna\" are characteristic of Etruscan families.\n\nThe word \"gens\" is feminine, and the name of a gens was also feminine. Marcus Valerius Corvus was a member of \"gens Valeria\". \"Valerius\" was his nomen. His son's nomen would have been \"Valerius\", and his daughter's \"Valeria\". Male members of his gens were collectively called \"Valerii\", and female members \"Valeriae\". If a member of the gens were adopted into another family, he would assume the nomen of that gens, followed by the \"cognomen\" \"Valerianus\".\n\nIn the following list, \"I\" and \"J\" are treated as separate letters, as are \"U\" and \"V\". The letter \"K\" was rare in Latin, and the few nomina occasionally spelled with this letter were usually spelled with \"C\". No Roman gentes began with \"X\", and the letters \"Y\" and \"Z\" occurred only in names borrowed from Greek. The letter \"W\" did not exist in Classical Latin.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5516737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5516737", "title": "Magnanimity", "text": "Magnanimity\n\nMagnanimity (from Latin \"magnanimitās\", from \"magna\" \"big\" + \"animus\" \"soul, spirit\") is the virtue of being great of mind and heart. It encompasses, usually, a refusal to be petty, a willingness to face danger, and actions for noble purposes. Its antithesis is pusillanimity (Latin: \"pusillanimitās\"). Although the word magnanimity has a traditional connection to Aristotelian philosophy, it also has its own tradition in English which now causes some confusion. \n\nThe Latin word \"magnanimitās\" comes from the Greek word μεγαλοψυχία (\"megalopsychia\") which means \"greatness of soul.\" In the context of \"Nicomachean Ethics\" IV.3, Aristotle associates \"megalopsychia\" more with a sense of pride and self-worth rather than the modern sense of magnanimity. Aristotle writes (1123b1-2), \"Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much and deserves much\" (δοκεῖ δὴ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι ὁ μεγάλων αὑτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν). W.D. Ross translates Aristotle's statement ἔοικε μὲν οὖν ἡ μεγαλοψυχία οἷον κόσμος τις εἶναι τῶν ἀρετῶν· μείζους γὰρ αὐτὰς ποιεῖ, καὶ οὐ γίνεται ἄνευ ἐκείνων (1124a1-2) as the following: \"Pride [\"megalopsychia\"], then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them.\" The great-souled, Aristotle adds, are \"thought to have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred, but a bad memory for those which they have received [...] It is also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only with reluctance, but to render aid willingly; and to be dignified towards men of position and fortune, unassuming towards those of moderate station...\" (1124b25-26, H. Rackham's translation for Loeb Classical Library).\n\nNoah Webster of the American Language defines \"Magnanimity\" as such:\nMAGNANIMITY, n. [L. magnanimitas; magnus, great, and animus, mind.] Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.\nEdmund Spenser, in \"The Faerie Queene\", had each knight allegorically represent a virtue; Prince Arthur represented \"magnificence\", which is generally taken to mean Aristotelian magnificence. The uncompleted work does not include Prince Arthur's book, and the significance is not clear.\n\nDemocritus states that \"magnanimity consists in enduring tactlessness with mildness\".\n\nAs an adjective, the concept is expressed as \"magnanimous\", e.g. \"He is a magnanimous man.\" An example of referring to one as magnanimous can be seen in Hrólfs saga kraka where King Hrólfr Kraki changes the name of a court servant from Hott to Hjalti for his new-found strength and courage, after which Hjalti refuses to taunt or kill those who previously mocked him. Because of his noble actions, the king then bestows the title Magnanimous upon Hjalti.\n\nOne form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. For example, magnanimity has been codified between societies by the Geneva Conventions.\n\nMagnanimous relief efforts can serve to offset the collateral damage of war.\n\nC. S. Lewis, in his book \"The Abolition of Man\", refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man. Lewis asserts that, in his time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal and sublime -- that which is humbling as an objective reality -- had led to \"men without chests\".\n"}

Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203 (1948), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case related to the power of a state to use its tax-supported public school system to aid religious instruction. The case was a test of the separation of church and state with respect to education.\n\nThe case tested the principle of \"released time\", where public schools set aside class time for religious instruction. The Court struck down a Champaign, Illinois program as unconstitutional because of the public school system's involvement in the administration, organization and support of religious instruction classes. The Court noted that some 2,000 communities nationwide offered similar released time programs affecting 1.5 million students.\n\nThe case was brought by Vashti McCollum, the mother of a student enrolled in the Champaign public school district.\n\nIn 1940, interested members of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths formed an association named the Champaign Council on Religious Education. This association obtained permission from the Champaign Board of Education to offer voluntary religious education classes for public school students from grades four to nine. These weekly 30- and 45-minute classes were led by clergy and lay members of the association in public school classrooms during school hours.\n\nMcCollum, an atheist, objected to the religious classes, stating that her son James was ostracized for not attending them. After complaints to school officials to stop offering these classes went unheeded, McCollum sued the school board in July 1945, stating that the religious instruction in the public schools violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment—the principle of separation of church and state in the United States. McCollum also complained that the school district's religious education classes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The principal elements of the McCollum complaint were that:\n\n\nIn her suit, McCollum asked that the Board of Education be ordered to \"adopt and enforce rules and regulations prohibiting all instruction in and teaching of all religious education in all public schools in Champaign District Number 71, and in all public school houses and buildings in said district when occupied by public schools\".\n\nThe Circuit Court of Champaign County ruled in favor of the school district in January 1946, and upon appeal the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling.\n\nMcCollum appealed the case to the U. S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case, taking oral arguments in December 1947. A number of religious groups including the American Unitarian Association, the Synagogue Council of America, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and the Baptist Joint Committee of Religious Liberty filed briefs in support of McCollum’s position.\n\nOn March 8, 1948, the Court ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, ruling that the classes were unconstitutional.\n\nIn the majority opinion, written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that\n\nThe lone dissenting justice, Stanley Forman Reed, objected to the breadth of the majority's interpretation of the Establishment Clause and stated that an incidental support of religion should have been permissible with a more narrow reading of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling remanded the case to the Illinois high court for relief consistent with the federal ruling.\n\nThe high court revisited the issue of religious instruction in \"Zorach v. Clauson\" in 1952. The 6 to 3 ruling in the later case held that a New York program allowing religious education during the school day was permissible, because it did not use public school facilities or public funds.\n\n\n\n"}

Sociologically, both terms refer to a subculture of recreational drug users who engage in high-risk sexual activities under the influence of drugs within groups.\n\nThe term \"PnP\" is commonly used by gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in North America, while chemsex is more associated with the gay scene in Europe.\n\nThe drug of choice is typically methamphetamine, known as \"tina\" or \"T\", but other drugs are also used, such as mephedrone, GHB, GBL and alkyl nitrites (known as poppers).\n\nSome studies have found that people participating in such sex parties have a higher probability of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases by having unprotected anal sex with large numbers of sexual partners. For this reason, \"chemsex\" has been described as \"a public health priority\".\n\nMethamphetamine is often used recreationally for its effects as a potent aphrodisiac, euphoriant, and stimulant. It has been further described that \"an entire subculture known as party and play is based around methamphetamine use.\" Gay men belonging to this subculture will typically meet up through internet dating sites to have sex. On such sites, men often include notations such as \"chems\" or \"PNP\". Since stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine drastically delay the need for sleep, increase sexual arousal, and tend to inhibit ejaculation, PNP sexual encounters can continue for many hours. \n\nMethamphetamine taken in excess of amounts prescribed or recommended will prolong symptoms of intoxication for up to eight hours. In some cases, these sexual encounters will sometimes occur continuously for several days along with repeated methamphetamine use. The crash following the use of methamphetamine in this manner is very often severe, with marked hypersomnia.\n\nInternet posts by men seeking PNP experiences often resort to slang to identify what drug they are partying with.\n\nThese drugs tend to inhibit penile erection, a phenomenon known by the slang term \"crystal penis\" or \"pilly willy\". Consequently, many men who engage in PNP use erectile dysfunction drugs such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil.\n\nFor some PNP participants, substance use may facilitate a process of \"cognitive disengagement\" from the fears and stipulations associated with sex in the time of HIV/AIDS. Popular discourses of \"disinhibition\" provide a commonly accepted alibi for activities engaged in when under the influence of substances.\n\nThe same drug-induced loss of inhibitions makes PNP enthusiasts more vulnerable to more immediate threats, such as robbery, date rape, or assault, or murder, by someone whom they meet for sex. The term party and play - \"and pay\" has emerged as a warning that partying and playing leads to bareback sex which increases the chances of contracting HIV and may result in other consequences such as neurological damage and resistance to HIV drugs.\n\nMethamphetamine can cause sores and abrasions in the mouth which can turn typically low-HIV-risk sex acts such as oral sex into very-high-risk sexual activity.\n\nMen who PNP with methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine are twice as likely to have unprotected sex (meaning sex without using a condom), according to British research from 2006. The study also found that up to 20% of gay men from central London gyms had tried methamphetamine, the drug most associated with PNPing.\n\nSubcultures of psychoactive drug use have long existed within urban gay communities, since the disco era and before. These substances have been used for dancing, socializing, communal celebration and other purposes. The rise of online websites and hookup apps in the 1990s gave men new ways of cruising and meeting sexual partners, including the ability to arrange private sexual gatherings in their homes.\n\nFrom the early 2000s, historic venues of gay socialization such as bars, clubs, and dance events reduced in number in response to a range of factors, including gentrification, zoning laws, licensing restrictions, and the increased number of closeted or under the influence sexually labile men, and the increasing popularity of digital technologies for sexual and social purposes.\n\nIn this context, PNP emerged as an alternative form of sexualized partying that enabled participants to avoid the public scrutiny and potentially judgmental and anxiety provoking nature of the \"public space\". Newly popular drugs such as methamphetamine and GHB/GBL replaced dance drugs such as ecstasy within this context.\n\nWhile PNP sessions tend to be organized around sex, there is some evidence that they can serve a range of social purposes for their participants, including the opportunity to meet other gay men, become friends, and engage in erotic play and experimentation. In some instances, PNP sessions play a part in the formation of loose social networks that are valued and relied upon by participants. For other men, increasing reliance on hookup apps and websites to arrange sex may result in a sense of isolation that may exacerbate the risk of drug dependence, especially in the context of a lack of other venues for gay socializing and sexual community-formation.\n\nIt has been observed that reliable data and relevant research are generally lacking and this situation is generating a climate of moral panic. In an article published by \"The Guardian\", it has been argued that an exaggerated reporting might give the public a distorted impression of the magnitude of this phenomenon – and that can only increase the level of collective anxiety.\n\n\n"}

Because of the ties with futurism and utopian works, there is often overlap with these fields as well. The field also has spawned subfields, such as feminist science fiction studies. \n\nHowever, the field's roots go back much further, to the earliest commentators who studied representations of the sciences in the arts and literature, and explorations of utopian and social reform impulses in fantastic and visionary works of art and literature. \n\nModern science fiction criticism may have started with Dorothy Scarborough, who in 1917 included a chapter on \"Supernatural Science\" in her doctoral dissertation, published as \"The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction\". \n\nAs the pulp era progressed, shifting science fiction ever further into popular culture, groups of writers, editors, publishers, and fans (often scientists, academics, and scholars of other fields) systematically organized publishing enterprises, conferences, and other insignia of an academic discipline. Much discussion about science fiction took place in the letter columns of early SF magazines and fanzines, and the first book of commentary on science fiction in the US was Clyde F. Beck's \"Hammer and Tongs\", a chapbook of essays originally published in a fanzine. \n\nThe 1940s saw the appearance of three full-scale scholarly works that treated science fiction and its literary ancestors: Philip Babcock Gove's \"The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction\" (1941), J. O. Bailey's \"Pilgrims Through Space and Time\" (1948), and Marjorie Hope Nicholson's \"Voyages to the Moon\" (1949).\n\nPeter Nicholls credits Sam Moskowitz with teaching \"what was almost certainly the first sf course in the USA to be given through a college\": a non-credit course in \"Science Fiction Writing\" at City College of New York in 1953. The first regular, for-credit courses were taught by Mark Hillegas (at Colgate) and H. Bruce Franklin (at Stanford) in 1961. During the 1960s, more science fiction scholars began to move into the academy, founding academic journals devoted to the exploration of the literature and works of science fiction. The explosion of film studies and cultural studies more broadly granted the nascent discipline additional credibility, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, mainstream scholars such as Susan Sontag turned their critical attention to science fiction. \n\nIn 1982, James Gunn (now Emeritus Professor) established the Center for the Study of Science Fiction as a Kansas Board of Regents Center as a focus for the SF programs he offered at the University of Kansas, beginning in 1969. This was the first such SF organization at a major university.\n\nThe 1990s saw the first academic programs and degree-granting programs established, and the field shows continued steady growth, not surprisingly also at technology-oriented institutions.\n\n\nSocieties:\n\nGeneral journals:\n\nReview journals:\n\nConferences:\nSignificant scholarship awards:\n\n\nA number of significant research collections and archives in SF studies have been developed in the past three to four decades. These include academic collections at the University of Liverpool, the University of Kansas, the Toronto Public Library, and the University of California, Riverside (the Eaton collection). \n\n\"See\" Science fiction libraries and museums for a comprehensive list and description of relevant collections and research institutes. \n\n\n"}

It can be called \"cinema in silhouette\". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.\n\nThe art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.\n\nThe modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer Félicien Trewey in the 19th century. He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.\n\nSince shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the Far East. The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese shadow puppetry called Ombres Chinoises, which means \"Chinese shadows\". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in Europe in the 19th century.\n\nAlthough the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians. Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, Robinson Crusoe, The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more. In 1889, Trewey joined with Alexander Herrmann who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son Okito (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to \"his\" son Fu Manchu (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it. Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.\n\nOther magicians who used hand shadows in their act include David Devant, Edward Victor, and the duo Holden and Graham in which Holden was famous for his \"Monkey in the Belfry\" shadow.\n\nThe hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.\n\nThe light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, \"Modern Conjuring For Amateurs\", that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.\n\nAlbert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.\n\nThe performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.\n\nMovement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.\n\n\n"}

Studios, in collaboration with Saban Brands, which was later replaced by Hasbro. Based on the \"Power Rangers\" franchise by Haim Saban, it was mostly written by Kyle Higgins and Ryan Parrott through the ongoing comic series \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" and \"Go Go Power Rangers\" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original television series.\n\nOn December 2017, Boom! Studios announced \"Shattered Grid\" as a crossover event between \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" and \"Go Go Power Rangers\", which would feature teams from all eras.\n\nThe main story was mostly written by Kyle Higgins through \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", while Ryan Parrott has also written a tie-in story through \"Go Go Power Rangers\", featuring Lord Drakkon and the Ranger Slayer as exclusive characters.\n\nOn February 2018, an online advertisement promoting the comic was broadcast, featuring Jason David Frank in a voice-over narration.\n\nOn March 2018, a promotional short film titled \"Power Rangers: Shattered Grid - Dark Prelude\" was released online, starring Frank in the role of Lord Drakkon. The film was written and directed by Higgins and produced by Locomotion Pictures, RCA Film Productions and Saban Brands.\n\nIn an alternate universe, Tommy Oliver refused to join the Power Rangers and stayed loyal to Rita Repulsa, taking the name of \"Lord Drakkon\" after a former acolyte of Rita. Together, they conquered Earth and killed Zordon, Jason Scott, Billy Cranston, among others. At some point, Drakkon also killed Rita to form his own army, including Scorpina, Finster 5, and a brainwashed Kimberly Hart as the Ranger Slayer. To fight this treat, Zack Taylor and Trini Kwan founded \"The Coinless\", a resistance movement that opposes Drakkon's regime. Additionally, another Tommy and his fellow Rangers confronted him, destroying his Power Coin in the process. As they returned to their universe, Drakkon was wrongly transported with them. After his arrival, he was taken prisoner by Promethea agents.\n\nAfter Promethea held Drakkon in a special top secret containment area for an unknown amount of time, Saba appears to kill him for all of his horrible acts. But Saba fails, accidentally freeing Drakkon, who decapitates him and takes his headless sword body to open a portal and escape.\n\nArriving to the past, the Ranger Slayer joins forces with Rita Repulsa to power-up the Gravezord, so she could deliver the Chaos Crystal back to Lord Drakkon.\n\nA mysterious rift is investigated by the Time Force Rangers in the future and when they get close to it, the Time Force Megazord is ravaged and it becomes nearly inescapable for Jen Scotts but they travel to the past.\n\nGrace Sterling (Director of Promethea) is confronted by Jason and Tommy in the present due to her hiding Lord Drakkon without them knowing.\n\nDrakkon travels back to their dimension and deceives Ninjor, the creator of the Power Coins, into repairing his ranger powers. A thankful Drakkon captures Ninjor inside a magic bottle, intending to exploit his knowledge of the Morphin Grid for his own ends. The Rangers plan their recourse while in the Command Center, while Billy expresses his desire for Trini's help in making the Black Dragon work again in their desire to warn of Drakkon's possible return to the Coinless and to surround the Command Center with a barrier. Unbeknownst to the Rangers, Drakkon infiltrates the Command Center and steals back the Chaos Crystal.\n\nA downtime by Tommy and Kimberly to find peace during their first date is ruined near the end of it as Kim rebuffed Tommy's attempted kiss of her.\n\nFeeling terrible about this, Tommy was trailed by Kimberly as he left and when she caught up, Lord Drakkon appeared and stabbed Tommy though his back, zapping the energy from Tommy into the stolen Chaos Crystal.\n\nKim was joined by Jen in her fight against Drakkon but Drakkon escaped back to his world while Kimberly held a dying Tommy's body.\n\nThe Rangers (in the past) freed her from the mind control of the Slayer/Drakkon's mind control, revealing his true identity to this world's Matthew Cook (her late boyfriend).\n\nThe arrow she uses is generated by the Chaos Crystal versus a younger version of Tommy Oliver and this transfers memories about probable futures which includes his impending death by Drakkon.\n\nTommy's dream is confirmed by Zordon in the present leading the Rangers to place his body back in the alley. This is done for the police to locate his him.\n\nAt Tommy's funeral, the announcement of Jen being awake is made by Alpha. The other Rangers are warned by Jen (in the Command Center) of the timeline's fracturing at the hands of the Morphin Grid. Drakkon's status invading both worlds in a power gaining attempt is also announced.\n\nMost of the Samurai Rangers were taken and their morphers are stolen by Drakkon who uses Ninjor in his transfer of their energy and he evolves into his next form.\n\nThe Emissaries are contacted by Zordon in an attempt to convince the Morphin Masters to remove the power from Drakkon, but the plea is ignored, which denies that Drakkon's army and him are dangerous enough threats to the Grid. All possible versions of Tommy are murdered by Drakkon, but Dr K is failed to recruit and its discovered how to reverse the Dragon Cannons' effect.\n\nThe Ranger Slayer (now in the present) by Grace Sterling and the Prometha agency was taken asylum.\n\nThe Rangers use the Black Dragon and Time Force Technologies from the Command Center in an effort to contact Dr K and the RPM Rangers which leads them to see that Drakkon once again evolved and is now joined by the Psycho Rangers (the S.P.D A-Squad and Koragg the Knight Wolf join him as new allies)\n\nNinjor is rescued in the World of the Coinless and the revelation by him is said that Drakkon is conquering the Rangers in an attempt to get access to the Morphin Grid\n\nAll Rangers travel to the Moon (using Grace Sterling's space colony (which Karone recognizes as Terra Venture) ) to confront Drakkon's forces. This is done as Rita Repulsa is turned by Zordon to supress Drakkon's power. Finster 5 electrifies them which saves Drakkon who connects more morphin energy to himself in his bid to evolve into his final form.\n\nThe Rangers destroy Drakkon's tower on the Moon, which cuts off the Sentries' power causing a giant rift. \n\nIn his final form, Lord Drakkon enters the Morphin Grid, defeats the Emissaries and takes possession of the Heart of one of the Morphin Masters, destroying the multiverse and creating his own world where he is a hero.\n\nLuckily for Tommy, he had actually survived his death, with the Ranger Slayer's attack in the past overcharging him with Chaos Energy and pulling his spirit inside Drakkon, taunting him enough to loosen his hold on his power just enough to free him and the Emissaries and rescuing the Rangers. Together, they are able to finally pull the Heart from Drakkon, causing his world to collapse. Despite Tommy's attempt to help him, Drakkon refuses to be saved and stays in his collapsing world.\n\nWith the Heart of the Master secured, the Emissaries aid the Rangers in using it to repair the damage Drakkon caused, but they also tell them that it cannot be completely fixed.\n\nWhile the multiverse and the timestream were fixed, the exact level of repair is currently unknown. As well, the Terra Venture colony has been dislodged from time and space, casting Grace, her crew and the surviving Rangers into uncharted territory.\n\nBack in the past, Matthew is now fully aware of the Rangers' identity and insists Kimberly and the others to entrust their secret, but they refuse to answer, causing a permanent friction between them. In the meantime, Rita has a new plan to destroy the Rangers once and for all.\n\n\"Shattered Grid\" has been generally received mixed to positive critics, with most reviews praising it as the rightful event for \"Power Rangers\" on its 25th anniversary, as well as being a storyline targeted for an adult audience.\n\nThe web series \"Power Rangers Hyperforce\" features the \"Shattered Grid\" event on episodes 19 and 20, featuring Kyle Higgins and Jason David Frank. The two-part episode takes place between issues #25-26 of the 2016 \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" comic series.\n\nFor September 2018, the \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" creative team will be changed by writer Marguerite Bennett and artist Simone di Meo, introducing a new storyline titled \"Beyond the Grid\". Ryan Parrott will continue to write \"Go Go Power Rangers\".\n"}

With a membership numbering several hundred scholars, students, and readers from around the world, SLA sponsors an annual conference in a different North American location each summer. Its 28th such conference was held at the University of Maine, Orono, June 22–25, 2011. SLA is an affiliate of the American Literature Association, and the publications of SLA members are indexed by the Modern Language Association, American Humanities Index, Gale (publisher), and EBSCO Publishing. The president of the organization for 2011-12 is Dennis Gildea of Springfield College (Massachusetts).\n\nSLA was organized in 1983 at San Diego State University, by Lyle Olsen, a physical education professor and former minor league baseball player and college baseball coach; Alfred F. Boe, an English and comparative literature professor; and a number of their colleagues. The stated purpose of the organization was “to encourage, stimulate, and foster the alliance of sport with the humanities” \n\nThe organization’s first president was Ralph M. Grawunder, another physical education professor at SDSU. Other individuals crucially involved in the early development of the organization were Richard W. Wells, Virginia L. Evans, and Susan Bandy of San Diego State University; Thomas F. Scanlon of University of California, Riverside; Eric Solomon of San Francisco State University; Michael Oriard of Oregon State University; Elizabeth S. Bressan of the University of Oregon; Richard Keller of Emporia State University; Mary McElroy of Kansas State University; Richard Doxtator of the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point; Robert J. Higgs and Donald Johnson of East Tennessee State University; David Vanderwerken of Texas Christian University; Richard C. Crepeau of the University of Central Florida; and Christian L. Messenger of University of Illinois at Chicago Circle.\n\nThe SLA’s first annual conference met at the University of California, San Diego, in La Jolla, July 26–28, 1984. The program chair was Susan Bandy. In addition to 15 sessions of papers and panels, that conference featured special lectures in honor of three individuals who are leading figures in the area of sports literature: Mark Harris, author of \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" and other highly acclaimed baseball novels; Eleanor Metheny, influential physical educator and author who championed women’s equality in sports; and Robert J. Higgs, author of \"Laurel & Thorn: The Athlete in American Literature\", one of the pioneering studies in sport literature, and co-editor of \"The Sporting Spirit\", a popular sports literature anthology. Higgs, who would become one of the most prominent and influential members of SLA, was further honored by the organization with a publication of a festschrift, \"One for the Higger: Jack Higgs, A Man for All Seasons\", in 1994; and he was presented the organization’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.\n\nThe inaugural issue of the organization’s journal, \"Arete: The Journal of Sport Literature\", with Lyle Olsen as founding editor and Alfred Boe as associate editor, was the Fall 1983 number (published in 1984). Section editors of that first issue included: Boe (fiction), Scanlon (ancient sport literature), Bandy (journal survey), Bruce Weigl of Old Dominion University (poetry), Fred S. Moramarco of San Diego State University (book reviews), Tim Wulfemeyer of the University of Hawaii at Manoa (sports journalism), Walter Harrison of Colorado College (cinema), Laurel Dean of University of California, San Diego (student contributions), and James C. Hinkle of San Diego State University (copy editor). The editorial board consisted of Boe, Dean, Grawunder, Hinkle, Moramarco, and Oriard. Robert Hamblin of Southeast Missouri State University became poetry editor with the second issue of the journal in Spring 1984 and continued in that capacity until 2005.\n\nThe journal’s name was changed to \"Aethlon: The Journal of Sport Literature\" in 1988, and the following year the publication offices for the journal moved to East Tennessee State University when Olsen joined the faculty there, where he continued to provide leadership for SLA and \"Aethlon\" until his death in 2000. Don Johnson, professor of English at East Tennessee State University, served as the general editor of \"Aethlon\" from 1988 until 2005; Joyce Duncan, an instructor at ETSU, is the current editor, having assumed the position with the Fall 2005 issue. Duncan has also served as managing editor of SLA since 1993.\n\nThe SLA website was established by Tim Morris, professor of English at the University of Texas at Arlington. The website hosts a moderated email discussion list; posts book reviews, information on the annual conferences, and calls for papers for \"Aethlon: The Journal of Sport Literature\"; and archives “Sport and Society” columns by Richard C. Crepeau, a longtime SLA member, professor of history at the University of Central Florida, and one of the leading commentators on the role of sports in American society.

{"id": "811651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=811651", "title": "The Mysterious Island", "text": "The Mysterious Island\n\nThe Mysterious Island () is a novel by Jules Verne, published in 1874. The original edition, published by Hetzel, contains a number of illustrations by Jules Férat. The novel is a crossover sequel to Verne's famous \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"In Search of the Castaways\", though its themes are vastly different from those books. An early draft of the novel, initially rejected by Verne's publisher and wholly reconceived before publication, was titled \"Shipwrecked Family: Marooned With Uncle Robinson,\" seen as indicating the influence of the novels \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Swiss Family Robinson\". Verne developed a similar theme in his later novel, \"Godfrey Morgan\" (French: \"L'École des Robinsons\", 1882).\n\nThe plot focuses on the adventures of five Americans on an uncharted island in the South Pacific. During the American Civil War, five northern prisoners of war decide to escape, during the siege of Richmond, Virginia, by hijacking a balloon.\nThe escapees are Cyrus Smith, a railroad engineer in the Union army (named Cyrus Harding in Kingston's version); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short for Nebuchadnezzar); Bonadventure Pencroff, a sailor (who is addressed only by his surname; in Kingston's translation, he is named Pencroft); his protégé and adopted son Harbert Brown (called Herbert in some translations); and the journalist Gedéon Spilett (Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus' dog \"Top\".\n\nAfter flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown island, described as being located at , about east of New Zealand. They name it \"Lincoln Island\" in honor of their president, Abraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, nitroglycerin, iron, a simple electric telegraph, a home on a stony cliffside called \"Granite House\", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the \"Bonadventure\" (in honor of Pencroff, the driving force behind its construction). They also manage to figure out their geographical location.\nDuring their stay on the island, the group endures bad weather, and domesticates an orangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen \"deus ex machina\", responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a dugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.\n\nThe group finds a message in a bottle directing them to rescue a castaway on nearby Tabor Island, who is none other than Tom Ayrton (from \"In Search of the Castaways\"). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.\n\nAyrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island, and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists go to look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, but suffers from his injury, narrowly cheating death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton to have been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts malaria and is saved by a box of quinine sulphate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds.\n\nThe secret of the island is revealed when it is discovered to be Captain Nemo's hideout, and home port of the \"Nautilus\". Having escaped the Maelstrom at the end of \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\", the \"Nautilus\" sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man with a beard, Nemo returned the \"Nautilus\" to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an \"electric gun\". On his death bed Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a Raja of the then independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero Tippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failed Indian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to a desert island with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the \"Nautilus\" and adopted the new name of \"Captain Nemo\". Nemo also tells his life story to Cyrus Smith and his friends. Before he dies, he gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Afterwards, he dies, crying \"God and my country!\" (\"Independence!\", in Verne's original manuscript). The \"Nautilus\" is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.\n\nAfterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find themselves safe, but stranded on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship \"Duncan\", which had come to rescue Ayrton, but were redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to United States they form a new colony in Iowa with Nemo's gifts.\n\nIn the United States the first English printing began in \"Scribner's Monthly\", April 1874, as a serial. In September 1875 Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle published the first British edition of \"Mysterious Island\" in three volumes entitled \"Dropped from the Clouds\", \"The Abandoned\", and \"The Secret of the Island\" (195,000 words). In November, 1875 Scribner's published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator, W. H. G. Kingston, was a famous author of boys' adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator of \"Mysterious Island\" and his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from \"Smith\" to \"Harding\"; \"Smith\" is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers. This became the standard translation for more than a century.\n\nIn 1876 the Stephen W. White translation (175,000 words) appeared first in the columns of \"The Evening Telegraph\" of Philadelphia and subsequently as an Evening Telegraph Reprint Book. This translation is more faithful to the original story and restores the death scene of Captain Nemo, but there is still condensation and omission of some sections such as Verne's description of how a sawmill works. In the 20th century two more abridged translations appeared: the Fitzroy Edition (Associated Booksellers, 1959) abridged by I. O. Evans (90,000 words) and \"Mysterious Island\" (Bantam, 1970) abridged by Lowell Bair (90,000 words).\n\nExcept for the Complete and Unabridged Classics Series CL77 published in 1965 (Airmont Publishing Company, Inc), no other unabridged translations appeared until 2001 when the illustrated version of Sidney Kravitz appeared (Wesleyan University Press) almost simultaneously with the new translation of Jordan Stump published by Random House Modern Library (2001). Kravitz also translated \"Shipwrecked Family: Marooned With Uncle Robinson\", published by the North American Jules Verne Society and BearManor Fiction in 2011.\n\nThe 2003 English edition of \"Wrecked On A Reef\" (1869), a memoir by French shipwreck survivor François Édouard Raynal, has additional appendices by French scholar Dr Christiane Mortelier who presents a case for the influence of Raynal's book on Verne's \"The Mysterious Island\". The \"Grafton\" was wrecked near New Zealand on the Auckland Islands on 3 January 1864, where the crew of five survived for 19 months before obtaining rescue. \"Wrecked On A Reef\", Raynal's memoir of the incident, was very popular at the time of publication, being translated into multiple languages. According to Mortelier, Verne read Raynal's account and loosely based his novel on the true life story of \"Grafton\" shipwreck, survival, privation, and ultimate rescue.\n\nThe novel has been translated into Marathi by B. R. Bhagwat titled 'निर्जन बेटावरचे धाडसी वीर', which roughly translates as \"Brave fighters on a deserted island\", and has a cult following in Maharashtra. The novel has also been translated to Malayalam, as \"Nigoodadweep\", translated by Kesavan Nambisan, and into Bengali by Shamsuddin Nawab from Sheba Prokashoni in 1979 and entitled \"Rahosshor Dip\".\n\n\n\nThere is also some significance of an adaptation of Captain Nemo and the Mysterious Island in the first arc of the sixth season of Once Upon A Time.\n\n\n Stephen W.

{"id": "202349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202349", "title": "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe", "text": "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980, ) is the second book in the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" comedy science fiction \"trilogy\" by Douglas Adams, and is a sequel. It was originally published by Pan Books as a paperback. The book was inspired by the song \"Grand Hotel\" by British rock band Procol Harum. It takes its name from Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, one of the settings of the book.\n\n\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" begins just as \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" ended. Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, and Zaphod Beeblebrox have just left the planet Magrathea when they are attacked by a Vogon ship. They find they are unable to use the Improbability drive to escape, as Arthur has accidentally jammed the computer with a simple request for a cup of tea which proved a rather difficult problem. Luckily, an ancestor of Zaphod's, Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, saves them.\n\nZaphod and Marvin vanish, and reappear at the offices of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy editorial building on Ursa Minor Beta. They are looking for Zarniwoop, who has gone on an intergalactic cruise in his office via his virtual universe. Arthur, Trillian and Ford are unaware of any of this, knowing only that the computer has been shut down, and only having received a message from a stalling Nutrimatic that says \"Wait.\"\n\nWhen Zaphod and Marvin reach the fifteenth floor of the \"Guide\"'s office, half of the building is lifted off the ground by Frogstar Fighters. A mysterious man named Roosta brings Zaphod to Zarniwoop's office, where they wait until the building lands on Frogstar World B. Roosta gives Zaphod final instructions before he leaves: Go through the window on his way out, not the door. Zaphod then meets Gargravarr who informs Zaphod that he is to be sent through the Total Perspective Vortex, a torture device which can annihilate one's soul by showing them how small they are compared to the size of the Universe. However, when Zaphod enters it, the Vortex shows him that he is one of the most important things in the Universe. Zaphod escapes, and finds Zarniwoop in the first class cabin of a spaceliner in an abandoned spaceport.\n\nZarniwoop explains that the total Perspective Vortex has not malfunctioned—this is a virtual universe created by Zarniwoop for the sole benefit of Zaphod, making him the most important creature in this universe. It turns out that Zaphod had the shrunk \"Heart of Gold\" in his jacket pocket the whole time. It is reconstituted, and Zaphod is reunited with Trillian, Arthur and Ford. They escape from Zarniwoop by asking to be transported to the nearest restaurant. Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, is the nearest restaurant in space but not time. They are transported there \"five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years\" into the future. Marvin is left stranded here for this incredibly vast amount of time parking diners' spaceships while waiting for the humans to return. After the meal, Zaphod and Ford steal a spaceship, which turns out to be a stuntship belonging to the rock band Disaster Area, programmed to dive into a star to provide backing effects for a rock concert. There is a teleporter on the ship for which the guidance system was never built, as it was never intended to be used, and it also requires somebody to stay on the ship to operate it. Marvin is chosen to stay behind and teleport the others, who have no choice but to go wherever it takes them.\n\nZaphod and Trillian are returned to the \"Heart of Gold\", which is commandeered by Zarniwoop to complete his mission, to discover who really rules the Universe. As it turns out, the Ruler of the Universe is entirely sceptical that he holds this position, as he is entirely sceptical of everything, including whether his cat, The Lord, really exists, or whether there is even a universe at all outside of his small isolated home. While Zarniwoop attempts to impress upon the Ruler of the Universe the reality and the weight of his position, Trillian and Zaphod sneak out and fly the \"Heart of Gold\" away.\n\nThe teleporter has meanwhile sent Arthur and Ford to the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B, a colonial transport ship of fools - banished from their home planet by their intellectual superiors to colonize elsewhere - which crash-lands on prehistoric Earth. They assume (falsely, it turns out) that the bumbling travellers are the real ancestors of modern humans. Arthur attempts to determine the Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything by reaching into a Scrabble bag made from Ford's towel and pulling out letters randomly, hoping Deep Thought's computational matrix in Earth would have rubbed off on his subconscious. The letters spell \"What do you get when you multiply six by nine\" before running out, although the Neanderthals manage to spell \"forty-two\" with the tiles, implying that it is they, rather than the Golgafrinchans, who were intended to be part of Earth's computer matrix. After some brief contemplation, Ford and Arthur realise that this is, in fact, a detrimental \"cock-up\", and that the Earth will never produce the proper Question, thus destroying all hope of ever finding out what it is.\n\nAs Ford convinces Arthur that there is nothing that can be done to improve the inevitable history of the Earth, Arthur decides that he should make the best of his situation and settles for a life on prehistoric Earth. (It's also implied that the bumbling fools - banished from their home planet by their intellectual superiors and who end up crash-landing on pre-historic Earth - die out - and that the cave-men neanderthals encountered by Ford and Arthur are in fact the ancestors of Earth's humans).\n\nThere have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition, recorded in 1981 by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new unabridged edition of the audiobook.\n"}

{"id": "28648635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28648635", "title": "X-Men: First Class", "text": "X-Men: First Class\n\nX-Men: First Class (stylized onscreen as X: First Class) is a 2011 American superhero film, based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the \"X-Men\" film series. It is a prequel of the franchise and the first film of the X-Men prequel quadrilogy, the film was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer. The story is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses on the relationship between Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), and Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), and the origin of their groups—the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who is bent on world domination. The film co-stars Rose Byrne, January Jones, and Oliver Platt. The film also introduces new actors to the series including Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise (Beast and Mystique) that were already established in the original trilogy.\n\nProducer Lauren Shuler Donner first thought of a prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of \"X2\", and later producer Simon Kinberg suggested to 20th Century Fox an adaptation of the comic series \"\", though the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both \"X-Men\" and \"X2\", became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co-write \"First Class\" due to other projects. Matthew Vaughn, who was previously attached to both \"\" and \"Thor\", became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner Jane Goldman. \"First Class\" overtook a planned Magneto prequel that entered development hell and the Writer's Guild of America arbitration gave a story credit to \"Magneto\" writer Sheldon Turner.\n\n\"First Class\" entered production in August 2010, with principal photography concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, just a few weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved a challenge to the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.\n\n\"First Class\" was a box-office success, becoming the seventh highest-grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting, screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film's success spawned a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X-Men characters, with \"\" (2014), \"\" (2016), and the upcoming \"X-Men: Dark Phoenix\" (2019).\n\nIn 1944, in a Nazi death camp, Nazi scientist Klaus Schmidt witnesses a young Erik Lehnsherr bend a metal gate with his mind when he is separated from his parents. In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, child telepath Charles Xavier meets young shapeshifter Raven, whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone \"different\", like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.\n\nIn 1962, Lehnsherr is tracking down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the University of Oxford. In Las Vegas, CIA officer Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidt—now known as Sebastian Shaw—with mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone-producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deployment of nuclear missiles in Turkey. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.\n\nMacTaggert, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret \"Division X\" facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist Hank McCoy, a mutant with prehensile feet, who believes Raven's DNA may provide a \"cure\" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant-locating device Cerebro to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Lehnsherr recruit stripper Angel Salvadore, cabbie Armando Muñoz, Army prisoner Alex Summers, and runaway Sean Cassidy.\n\nWhen Frost meets with a Soviet general in the USSR, and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start World War III that will trigger mutant ascendancy and the extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; and when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR install missiles in Cuba. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.\n\nRaven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.\n\nFearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's helmet, frees Frost from confinement and he then goes by the name : “Magneto”.\n\n\n\n\nOther cast members include Annabelle Wallis as Amy, a young woman with heterochromia; Don Creech as CIA Agent Stryker, father of Major William Stryker (a character who appears in \"X2\", \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\", \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\", and \"X-Men: Apocalypse\"); Michael Ironside; Ray Wise; James Remar; Brendan Fehr; and Aleksander Krupa also portrayed small roles in this film. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Logan / Wolverine in an uncredited cameo in a bar, dismissing an approach by Xavier and Lehnsherr to join them. Jackman said he accepted the offer to appear because \"it sounded perfect to me\", particularly for Wolverine being the only character with a swear word. X-Men creator Stan Lee, who appeared in the first and third movie and regularly cameos in other Marvel-based movies, explained that he was unable to participate in \"First Class\" because \"they shot it too far away\".\n\nDuring the production of \"X2\", producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed the idea of a film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during the production of \"\". One of \"The Last Stand\"s writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin-off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that \"the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [ ... ] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on \"X3\". He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect.\"\n\nAround the same time, in December 2004, 20th Century Fox hired screenwriter Sheldon Turner to draft a spin-off \"X-Men\" film, and he chose to write \"Magneto\", pitching it as \"\"The Pianist\" meets \"X-Men\".\" According to Turner, the script he penned was set from 1939 to 1955, following Magneto trying to survive in Auschwitz. He meets Xavier, a young soldier, during the liberation of the camp. He hunts down the Nazi war criminals who tortured him, and this lust for vengeance turns him and Xavier into enemies. In April 2007, David S. Goyer was hired to direct. The film would take place mostly in flashbacks with actors in their twenties, with Ian McKellen's older Magneto as a framing device, and some usage of the computer-generated facelift applied to him in the prologue of \"\", McKellen reiterated his hope to open and close the film. The Magneto film was planned to shoot in Australia for a 2009 release, but it was delayed by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\nAs producer Simon Kinberg read the comic series \"\", he suggested studio 20th Century Fox to adapt it. Kinberg, however, did not want to follow the comic too much, as he felt \"it was not fresh enough in terms of storytelling\", considering them too similar to \"Twilight\" and John Hughes movies, and also because the producers wanted an adaptation that would introduce new characters. Both Kinberg and Shuler Donner said that they wanted characters with visuals and powers that had not been seen and that worked well as an ensemble, even if they did not work together in the comics. Shuler Donner later said that the original idea was to green-light \"First Class\" depending on the success of \"X-Men Origins: Magneto\". That project was seeking approval to film in Washington, D.C., and by December 2008, Goyer said filming would begin if \"\" was successful. The story was moved forward to 1962, and involves Xavier and Magneto battling a villain.\n\nIn 2008, Josh Schwartz was hired to write the screenplay, while declining the possibility of directing \"X-Men: First Class\". Fox later approached Bryan Singer, director of \"X-Men\" and \"X2\", in October 2009. Schwartz later said that Singer dismissed his work as \"he wanted to make a very different kind of movie\", with the director instead writing his own treatment which was then developed into a new script by Jamie Moss.\n\nIn 2009, Ian McKellen confirmed that he would not be reprising his role as Magneto in the \"Origins\" movie citing his age, and Shuler Donner stated that the movie might never be made, stating it was \"at the back of the queue\" in the studio's priorities. Both Donner and Bryan Singer have stated that \"Magneto\" would not be produced as the plot of \"X-Men: First Class\" \"superseded\" the story of the planned film. Singer denied using Sheldon Turner's script for \"Magneto\" as inspiration to write his draft of \"First Class\", but the Writer's Guild of America arbitration still credited Turner for the film's story, while Moss and Schwartz's collaborations ended up uncredited. Singer set the film in a period where Xavier and Magneto were in their twenties, and seeing that it was during the 1960s, added the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, considering it would be interesting to \"discuss this contemporary concept in a historical context\". Shuler Donner suggested the Hellfire Club as the villains.\n\nIn addition to Moss, Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz were hired to rewrite the script. Miller compared it tonally to Singer's work on the first two \"X-Men\" films. The pair centered the film on Xavier and Magneto's relationship, and wrote the other characters and storylines in terms of \"how they fit in the tension between Erik and Charles\". Singer dropped out of the director's position in March 2010 due to his commitment to a \"Jack the Giant Killer\" adaptation. He formalized his duties from director to producer.\n\nThe producers listed various possible directors, but at first did not consider Matthew Vaughn because he started working on \"The Last Stand\" before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film \"Kick-Ass\" (2010), Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn to see if he would be interested in \"First Class\". When Fox offered Vaughn the \"chance to reboot X-Men and put your stamp all over it\", he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s. The director stated that \"First Class\" would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects: \"I got my cake and ate it, managed to do an \"X-Men\" movie, and a Bond thing, and a Frankenheimer political thriller at the same time\". Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date. Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner Jane Goldman, adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamics—for instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut. The character of Sunspot was also cut, as the director felt that \"we didn't have enough time or money\" to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the Civil Rights Movement, but ultimately the director felt that \"I had enough political subplot in this movie\". Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built - \"Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto.\" An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of \"Inception\" (2010).\n\nDescribing his thought process towards the material, Vaughn said he was motivated by \"unfinished business\" with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and \"Thor\". Vaughn declared that he was more enthusiastic about \"First Class\" than \"The Last Stand\" due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to \"start fresh\", while \"nodding towards\" the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared \"First Class\" to both \"Batman Begins\" (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was \"to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films\" and also that could \"reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise\". Goldman added the film was kind of an \"alternate history\" for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers did not want to go fully \"against the canon of the \"X-Men\" trilogy\", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.\n\nThe film also rescues a central concept in the comics, the fact that radiation is one of the causes of genetic mutation in the \"X-Men\" fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street and some of the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had \"never worked under such time pressure\". The film cost approximately $160 million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140 million.\n\nThe 1960s setting of \"X-Men: First Class\", technologically inspired by the \"James Bond\" films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they \"did a cool job representing the period, in a way it still felt muscular and action-oriented\", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the \"badass, charming, ruthless and sweet\" personality. The director said his goal was to \"feel like a '60s Bond film, but with a little bit of reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time.\" At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the \"bloody hard balancing\" of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was \"not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece.\" The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly \"that 60s misogynist vibe\" with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.\n\nVaughn said he shot the film in a way which resembled the productions of the 1960s, with \"very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang\", and using the anamorphic format \"to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the \"James Bond\" films\". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did \"forty-five percent, fifty-five percent\" of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, \"keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing.\" The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that \"could be done with traditional optical\". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the \"Bond\" films.\n\nThe origin story made the X-Men costumes resemble the ones in the original comics, while still being functional, with the yellow parts resembling Kevlar and the blue looking like ballistic nylon, and resembling 1962 apparel in both the fabrics and the \"Space Age fashion\". The costumes tried to convey the character personalities—for instance, Xavier wore loose clothes, and Emma Frost's costumes were white and shimmery. Magneto's costume at the film's ending also closely resembled the original version from the comics, and three versions of his helmet were made, two to fit Fassbender's head and one for Bacon's.\n\n\"First Class\" employed 1,150 visual effects shots, which was done by six companies: Rhythm & Hues was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; Cinesite handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; Luma Pictures did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; Moving Picture Company did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; Digital Domain created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and Weta Digital was responsible for the climactic battle in Cuba. The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer John Dykstra, who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: \"It was slightly less than a year and I've never done anything like that before (\"Spider-Man\" was frequently two years).\" British company 4dMax employed special 3D scanners to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies. This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in \"Enter the Dragon\" as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities, with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 Red Square, and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style march. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small bridge set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified SR-71 Blackbird, the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s — though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the \"Kresta I\" and \"II\", leading Weta to dub it the \"Kresta III\". Practical effects were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.\n\nWhile in the comics Shaw's absorption power was depicted by having him grow up to ten times his original size, \"First Class\" instead does what company Digital Domain called a \"kinetic echo\", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated \"iterations\" that appear in a short period, to \"see [Shaw] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way\". According to Dykstra, the biggest problem with Frost's diamond body was depicting it \"without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being\". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on going in and out of her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to \"make the wings prettier\". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the \"inky smoky effects\" used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in \"X2\" and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke \"because he was more closely aligned with the devil\". The fire was also used \"as a mask to hide or reveal the body\", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble \"a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness\" by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with \"the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca.\" For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.\n\nHenry Jackman, who had worked with Vaughn in \"Kick-Ass\", composed the score. Following the \"James Bond\" influences on \"First Class\", Jackman drew inspiration from John Barry's work in the said series, which he described as \"extremely posh pop music\". Jackman started his work with a \"\"Superman\"-style theme\", which is only featured in the final parts of the film as Vaughn thought it was too \"successful and triumphant\" for a disjointed and up-and-coming team. Therefore, Vaughn reworked a 'stretched' half time version of the theme into the remainder of the film. The themes for Magneto and Shaw have similarities to reflect their \"perverted father-son\" relationship, with even a seamless transition during the scene where Shaw is killed to represent Lensherr's full transformation into Magneto. The track 'Rage and Serenity' is reused in Vaughn's 2017 film \"\".\n\nIn a roundtable interview with multiple news outlets, Vaughn responded to a question about choosing \"Love Love\" by the British band Take That for the end-credits theme, explaining, \"I bumped into [the band's lead singer] Gary <nowiki>[Barlow]</nowiki> in [Los Angeles], and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do you want to come and see a rough cut of it?' And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, 'I think it'll be a hit', and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it's pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film.\" An instrumental of the song \"Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)\" by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.\n\nThe premiere for \"X-Men: First Class\" took place at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, on May 25, 2011. The promotional campaign aimed for non-traditional partners, with Fox signing deals with Farmers Insurance Group, BlackBerry Playbook and the U.S. Army. Wrigley Australia issued an X-Men themed edition of their 5 chewing gum.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 272 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With a strong script, stylish direction, and powerful performances from its well-rounded cast, \"X-Men: First Class\" is a welcome return to form for the franchise.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nAmong the major trade publications, Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the film as \"audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy\", and said that \"director Vaughn impressively maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power ... and orchestrates the mayhem with a laudable coherence, a task made easier by a charging, churning score by Henry Jackman ... \". Justin Chang of \"Variety\" said the film \"feels swift, sleek and remarkably coherent\", and that \"the visual effects designed by John Dykstra are smoothly and imaginatively integrated ... \" Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\" lauded \"a wickedly smart script with a multilayered theme that ... never loses sight of its ultimate story, and makes each emotional motivation interlock, often shockingly playing for keeps with its characters. This is not a kids' movie.\"\n\nIn consumer publications, Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised \"the kind of youthful, Brit-knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed from his previous collaborations as producer of director Guy Ritchie's bloke-y larks\", and found McAvoy and Fassbender \"a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together: They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work.\" Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" called it \"a blockbuster with brains\" and said Vaughn \"brings similar freshness to this comic creation as he did to \"Kick-Ass\", and manages to do so while hewing to the saga's serious dramatic intent.\"\n\n\"X-Men: First Class\" went on general release on June 3, 2011. In North America, the film opened on approximately 6,900 screens at 3,641 locations, debuting atop the weekend box office with earnings of $55.1 million across the three days, including $3.4 million in its Friday midnight launch. This opening was much lower than the opening weekends of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" ($102.7 million), \"X2\" ($85.5 million), and \"\" ($85.0 million), but slightly higher than the original film ($54.5 million). Executives at 20th Century Fox stated they had achieved their goal by opening with about the same numbers as the first \"X-Men\" film and that it was an excellent start to a new chapter of the franchise.\n\n\"First Class\" also opened 8,900 locations in 74 overseas markets, which brought in $61 million during the weekend—standing third in the overseas ranking behind \"\" and \"The Hangover Part II\". The film opened atop the box office in twenty countries, with the biggest grosses being in the United Kingdom ($9 million, including previews), France ($7.1 million), Mexico ($5 million), South Korea ($5.4 million) and Australia ($5.1 million). In its second weekend \"X-Men: First Class\" dropped 56.2 percent, the second smallest second weekend drop in the franchise behind \"X2: X-Men United\" (53.2 percent), and came in with $24.1 million, in second place to \"Super 8\". Overseas, it rose to number two behind \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", with $42.2 million. The film grossed $146,408,305 in the United States and Canada and $207,215,819 in foreign markets, bringing its worldwide total to $353,624,124.\n\n\"X-Men: First Class\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray September 9, 2011 in the US, and in the UK on October 31, 2011. The home release topped the sales charts in the United States with approximately 385,000 DVDs. Blu-ray accounted for 60 percent of first-week disc sales, amounting to about 575,000 discs. In the UK it sold 150,000 units. The film was later released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on October 4, 2016.\n\nThe movie's success led to the continuation of the film series. A direct sequel, \"\", was released on May 27, 2016. A second and last sequel, \"\", is scheduled to be released on February 14, 2019.\n\n"}
