It is part of a wider South-East Asian tradition of tribal jewelry, as \"\"gantung\" (meaning \"hanging\") in Indonesian/Malay and \"anting-anting\"\" (meaning \"ear pendant\") in Javanese.\n\nIn the Philippine occult tradition, there is usually a corresponding \"agimat\" to deal with in a particular area in a person's life. The most frequent types of \"agimat\" are used for removing hexes and exorcism of evil spirits. An \"agimat\" also called a \"gayuma\" serves as a love charm which makes the owner more attractive to the opposite sex. Although stereotyped as a cross, a flat, round or triangular golden pendant accompanying a necklace or a necklace-like item, it is also depicted as an enchanted stone that came from the sky or a fang left by a lightning strike (\"pangil ng kidlat\") or even a drop of liquid from the heart of a banana tree at midnight (\"mutya\"). In relation to the latter, it is usually ingested. An \"agimat\" is usually accompanied by a small book of magic incantations which must be read during Good Friday or a certain special date to attain the amulet's full power and benefit. An \"agimat\" could also be in the form of a clothing with magic words inscribed on it, or even in the form of edible enchanted mud (\"putik\" in Tagalog).\n\nOther methods of obtaining an \"agimat\" is by getting the liquid that is drained from an exhumed body of an unbaptized child or aborted fetus or offering food and drinks to the spirits in a cemetery during midnight of Holy Wednesday or Holy Thursday. Most of the amulets bear Latin inscriptions into it. Like those in Quiapo district in Manila, most of the \"agimat\" merchants are near churches (like in its courtyard or in the marketplace just nearby). Filipino freedom fighters also wore \"anting-anting\" to battle against the Spaniards and the Americans. Filipino hero Macario Sakay wore a vest that has religious images and Latin phrases to protect him from bullets. Former Philippine-President Ferdinand Marcos, was given an \"anting-anting\" by Gregorio Aglipay that could supposedly make Marcos invisible. Marcos said that the \"agimat\" is a sliver of wood that was inserted into his back before the Bataan campaign on 1942.\n\nEarliest reports of \"anting-anting\" are from the records of Spanish priests in the early colonial period. Pardo de Tavera defines the \"anting-anting\" as \"an amulet, of super natural power, that saves lives.\" With the Christianization of the Philippines, \"anting-anting\" appropriated the forms of the new religion, and incorporated as well the esoteric symbolisms of Freemasonry. An Islamic version of \"anting-anting\" exists in the Southern Muslim islands. In Filipino films, the wearer of the \"agimat\" gains superhuman strength, invisibility, heightened senses, self-healing, and elemental powers. With it, the person can also be able to shoot or fire lightning via hands, or generate electricity throughout one's body. The person can also perform telekinesis, stop a live bullet, can have premonitions, invisibility, flight, morphing abilities, camouflage abilities like a chameleon, can have extreme good luck, possess invincibility, or perform miracle curative powers. In his Filipino films, actor Ramon Revilla, Sr., as \"Nardong Putik\", was depicted to have protection from bullets and slash wounds, provided he eats a certain special mud.\n"}

{"id": "2226500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226500", "title": "Chiwara", "text": "Chiwara\n\nA Chiwara (also Chi wara, Ci Wara, or Tyi Wara; ; ) is a ritual object representing an antelope, used by the Bambara ethnic group in Mali. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.\n\nChiwara masks are categorized in three ways: horizontal, vertical, or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a phallus. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.\n\nThe appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct \"signature\" or \"school\" of Chiwara figures. These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus \"the Bougouni / Southern region style\" are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; \"the Bamako / Northern region style\" is usually of the horizontal style; \"the Segu/ Northern region style\" (the heartland of the Bambara Empire) matches the vertical style with the unique \"cut out\" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including \"the Sikasso region style\", with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.\n\nIn Bambara, \"chi\" \"wara\" means \"laboring\" \"wild animal\", and is a representation of Bambara mythos about the creation of farming.\n\nWhile there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.\n\nThe Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a Roan Antelope with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the aardvark who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of millet, and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of raffia stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.\nThe Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.\n\nAs farmers of the upper Niger river savanna, the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace Islam, after the fall of the Bambara Empire in the late 19th century.\nBambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste cofraternities (\"ton\"/\"jo\"/\"jow\"), and the \"chi wara ton\" society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the \"Soli\" age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the \"chi wara ton\" pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.\n\nThe \"chi wara ton\" is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.\n\nThe Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a \"Sogono Kuni\" (\"Little antelope head\"), which is quite rare to find in museums. \n\nAfrican sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called \"Primitive Art\". The artist Guillaume Apollinaire and collector Paul Guillaume published images of the Chiwara in their \"Sculptures nègres\" in 1917, while Picasso, Braque, and Les Fauves became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.\n\nA vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit \"African Negro Art\", and the \"Masterpieces of African Art\" at the Brooklyn Museum in 1954, (as well as shows in London and Paris) shows which were highly influential to western artists and collectors. Variations of its triangual cut-out pattern are echoed in mid-20th century Modernist art, and its outline remains one of the most recognizable of African art forms.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164465", "title": "Conceit", "text": "Conceit\n\nIn modern literary criticism, in particular of genre fiction, conceit frequently means an extended rhetorical device, summed up in a short phrase, that refers to a situation which either does not exist or exists very infrequently but which is necessary to the plot. \"Faster than light travel\" and \"superior alien science\" are examples from science fiction; the \"hardboiled private gumshoe\" is an example from detective stories.\n\nThe word conceit was originally coined in the context of poetry, deriving from the root \"concept, conceive\". It has subsequently been extended to other forms of literature, the performing arts, painting, photography, and even architecture.\n\nThe term conceit can be used positively or derogatorily.\n\n\nIn modern writing (e.g., reviews of movies or books, or descriptions of others' inventions or ideas), the word \"conceit\", when used by itself without preceding adjectives (such as \"brilliant\" or \"unpersuasive\"), tends to be used more often as criticism than as praise. Such use is especially common when writing for a broad audience rather than specialists in poetry or literary criticism. Which sense is actually intended, however, must be inferred from the overall content and tone of the passage containing the phrase.\n\nIn English literature the term is generally associated with the 17th century metaphysical poets, an extension of contemporary usage. The metaphysical conceit differs from an extended analogy in the sense that it does not have a clear-cut relationship between the things being compared. Helen Gardner observed that \"a conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness\" and that \"a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness.\" An example of the latter occurs in John Donne's \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\", in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to a compass.\n\n<poem>\nDull sublunary lovers' love\nAbsence, because it doth remove\n\nBut we by a love so much refined,\nInter-assured of the mind,\n\nOur two souls therefore, which are one,\nA breach, but an expansion,\n\nIf they be two, they are two so\nThy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\n\nAnd though it in the center sit,\nIt leans and hearkens after it,\n\nSuch wilt thou be to me, who must,\nThy firmness makes my circle just,\n\nThe metaphysical conceit is often imaginative, exploring specific parts of an experience. John Donne's \"\" is a poem seemingly about fleas in a bed. When Sir Philip Sidney begins a sonnet with the conventional idiomatic expression \"My true-love hath my heart and I have his\", he takes the metaphor literally and teases out a number of literal possibilities in the exchange of hearts. The result is a fully formed conceit.\n\nThe Petrarchan conceit is a form of love poetry wherein a man's love interest is referred to in hyperbole. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress is either \"a cloud of dark disdain\" or the sun.\n\nThe paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using oxymoron, for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of Petrarch, in his innovative exploration of human feelings, became clichés in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits when describing his love for Rosaline as \"bright smoke, cold fire, sick health\".\n\nIn the Renaissance, the term (which is related to the word concept) indicated any particularly fanciful expression of wit, and was later used pejoratively of outlandish poetic metaphors.\n\nRecent literary critics have used the term to mean simply the style of extended and heightened metaphor common in the Renaissance and particularly in the 17th century, without any particular indication of value. Within this critical sense, the Princeton Encyclopedia makes a distinction between two kinds of conceits: the Metaphysical conceit, described above, and the Petrarchan conceit. In the latter, human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical hyperbole), like the stock comparison of eyes to the sun, which Shakespeare makes light of in his Sonnet 130: \"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.\"\n\n\n"}

The word \"so\", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of \"Well...\" or to function as an indirect way of saying \"Before answering that, I'd like to...\" or even instead of saying \"On the contrary...\" or \"No, I...\".\n\nIn a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).\n\nSince such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers.

Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the human condition. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a cultural relativist perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are \"cultural\" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited behavior is an issue of \"nature versus nurture\".\n\nThe emergence of these universals dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the first evidence of full behavioral modernity. \n\nIn his book \"Human Universals\" (1991), Donald Brown defines human universals as comprising \"those features of culture, society, language, behavior, and psyche for which there are no known exception\", providing a list of hundreds of items he suggests as universal. Among the cultural universals listed by Donald Brown are:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.\n\nSince any cultures that have been studied by anthropologists have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological research ethics slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied. This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well. This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of civilization and is therefore not the same thing as hyperdiffusionism, it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of innateness.\n\nAnthropology's application of one ordinary evidence standard for data that agrees with its theories of cultural universals and one extraordinary standard of evidence for data that disagree with it raises issues with population level publication bias. While it is possible with strong enough evidence for the validity of one case study that disagree to pass peer review, those that agree will statistically do so more often than those that disagree even if the level of evidence is the same. Since multiple field studies regarding the same culture are combined when statistical prevalences of behaviors are assessed, the result may cause appearances of behaviors having a supposedly universal statistical demographic even if it does not. Some anthropologists suggest that this may give an appearance of statistics such as more men than women hunting large prey being universal without actually being universal, for example that field studies in which more men than women hunted passed peer review while field studies for the same culture in which the genders were equal or inverted for hunting were not published. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "151419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151419", "title": "Eastern philosophy", "text": "Eastern philosophy\n\nEastern philosophy or Asian philosophy includes the various philosophies that originated in East and South Asia including Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophy, and Korean philosophy which are dominant in East Asia and Vietnam, and Indian philosophy (including Buddhist philosophy) which are dominant in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tibet and Mongolia.\n\nIndian philosophy refers to ancient philosophical traditions (; 'world views', 'teachings') of the Indian subcontinent. Jainism may have roots dating back to the times of the Indus Valley Civilization. The major orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the Common Era and the Gupta Empire. These Hindu schools developed what has been called the \"Hindu synthesis\" merging orthodox Brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism. Hindu thought also spread east to the Indonesian Srivijaya empire and the Cambodian Khmer Empire. These religio-philosophical traditions were later grouped under the label Hinduism. Hinduism is the dominant religion, or way of life, in South Asia. It includes Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism among numerous other traditions, and a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of \"daily morality\" based on karma, dharma, and societal norms. Hinduism is a categorization of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid, common set of beliefs. Hinduism, with about one billion followers is the world's third largest religion, after Christianity and Islam. Hinduism has been called the \"oldest religion\" in the world and is traditionally called \"\", \"the eternal law\" or the \"eternal way\"; beyond human origins. Western scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.\n\nSome of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE). Important Indian philosophical concepts include dharma, karma, samsara, moksha and ahimsa. Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning (pramana) and logic and investigated topics such as Ontology (metaphysics, Brahman-Atman, Sunyata-Anatta), reliable means of knowledge (epistemology, Pramanas), value system (axiology) and other topics. Indian philosophy also covered topics such as political philosophy as seen in the Arthashastra c. 4th century BCE and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra. The Kural literature of c. 1st century BCE, written by the Tamil poet-philosopher Valluvar, is believed by many scholars to be based on Jain philosophies.\n\nLater developments include the development of Tantra and Iranian-Islamic influences. Buddhism mostly disappeared from India after the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent, surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India. The early modern period saw the flourishing of Navya-Nyāya (the 'new reason') under philosophers such as Raghunatha Siromani (c. 1460–1540) who founded the tradition, Jayarama Pancanana, Mahadeva Punatamakara and Yashovijaya (who formulated a Jain response).\n\nThe principal Indian philosophical schools are classified as either orthodox or heterodox – āstika or nāstika – depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the Vedas are a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of Brahman and Atman; and whether the school believes in afterlife and Devas.\n\nThere are six major schools of orthodox Indian Hindu philosophy—Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta, and five major heterodox schools—Jain, Buddhist, Ajivika, Ajñana, and Cārvāka. However, there are other methods of classification; Vidyaranya for instance identifies sixteen schools of Hindu Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the Śaiva and Raseśvara traditions.\n\nEach school of Hindu philosophy has extensive epistemological literature called \"Pramana-sastras\".\n\nIn Hindu history, the distinction of the six orthodox schools was current in the Gupta period \"golden age\" of Hinduism. With the disappearance of Vaisheshika and Mīmāṃsā, it became obsolete by the later Middle Ages, when the various sub-schools of Vedanta (Dvaita \"dualism\", Advaita Vedanta \"non-dualism\" and others) began to rise to prominence as the main divisions of religious philosophy. Nyaya survived into the 17th century as \"Navya Nyaya\" \"Neo-Nyaya\", while Samkhya gradually lost its status as an independent school, its tenets absorbed into Yoga and Vedanta.\n\nSāmkhya is a dualist philosophical tradition based on the Samkhyakarika (circa 320-540 CE), while the Yoga school was a closely related tradition emphasizing meditation and liberation whose major text is the Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE). Elements of proto-Samkhya ideas can however be traced back all the way to the period of the early Upanishads. One of the main differences between the two closely related schools was that Yoga allowed for the existence of a God, while most Sāmkhya thinkers criticized this idea.\n\nSāmkhya epistemology accepts three of six pramanas (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge; \"pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"anumāṇa\" (inference) and \"śabda\" (word/testimony of reliable sources). The school developed a complex theoretical exposition of the evolution of consciousness and matter. Sāmkhya sources argue that the universe consists of two realities, puruṣa (consciousness) and prakṛti (matter).\n\nAs shown by the \"Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra\" (c. 14th century CE), Sāmkhya continued to develop throughout the medieval period.\n\nThe Nyāya school of epistemology, explores sources of knowledge (\"Pramāṇa\") and is based on the \"Nyāya Sūtras\" (circa 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE). Nyāya holds that human suffering arises out of ignorance and liberation arises through correct knowledge. Therefore, they sought to investigate the sources of correct knowledge or epistemology.\n\nNyāya traditionally accepts four \"Pramanas\" as reliable means of gaining knowledge – \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"Anumāṇa\" (inference), \"Upamāṇa\" (comparison and analogy) and \"Śabda\" (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). Nyāya also traditionally defended a form of philosophical realism.\n\nThe \"Nyāya Sūtras\" was a very influential text in Indian philosophy, laying the foundations for classical Indian epistemological debates between the different philosophical schools. It includes, for example, the classic Hindu rejoinders against Buddhist not-self (anatta) arguments. The work also famously argues against a creator God (Ishvara), a debate which became central to Hinduism in the medieval period.\n\nVaiśeṣika is a naturalist school of atomism, which accepts only two sources of knowledge, perception and inference. This philosophy held that the universe was reducible to \"paramāṇu\" (atoms), which are indestructible (\"anitya\"), indivisible, and have a special kind of dimension, called “small” (\"aṇu\"). Whatever we experience is a composite of these atoms.\n\nVaiśeṣika organized all objects of experience into what they called \"padārtha\"s (literally: 'the meaning of a word') which included six categories; \"dravya\" (substance), \"guṇa\" (quality), \"karma\" (activity), \"sāmānya\" (generality), \"viśeṣa\" (particularity) and \"samavāya\" (inherence). Later \"Vaiśeṣika\"s (\"Śrīdhara\" and Udayana and \"Śivāditya\") added one more category \"abhava\" (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as \"artha\" (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as \"budhyapekṣam\" (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.\n\nMīmāṃsā is a school of ritual orthopraxy and is known for its hermeneutical study and interpretation of the Vedas. For this tradition, the study of \"dharma\" as rituals and social duties was paramount. They also held that the Vedas were \"eternal, authorless, [and] infallible\" and that Vedic injunctions and mantras in rituals are prescriptive actions of primary importance. Because of their focus on textual study and interpretation, Mīmāṃsā also developed theories of philology and the philosophy of language which influenced other Indian schools. They primarily held that the purpose of language was to clearly \"prescribe\" proper actions, rituals and correct dharma (duty or virtue). Mīmāṃsā is also mainly atheistic, holding that the evidence for the existence of God is insufficient and that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the names, mantras and their power.\n\nA key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the Mīmāṃsā Sūtra of Jaimini and major Mīmāṃsā cholars include Prabhākara (c. 7th century) and Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (fl. roughly 700). The Mīmāṃsā school strongly influenced Vedānta which was also known as \"Uttara-Mīmāṃsā,\" however while Mīmāṃsā emphasized \"karmakāṇḍa\", or the study of ritual actions, using the four early Vedas, the Vedānta schools emphasized \"jñanakāṇḍa\", the study of knowledge, using the later parts of Vedas like the Upaniṣads.\n\nVedānta (meaning \"end of the Vedas\") or \"Uttara-Mīmāṃsā\", are a group of traditions which focus on the philosophical issues found in the Prasthanatrayi (the three sources), which are the \"Principal Upanishads\", the \"Brahma Sutras\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita.\" Vedānta sees the Vedas, particularly the Upanishads, as a reliable source of knowledge.\n\nThe central concern for these schools is the nature of and relationship between \"Brahman (\"ultimate reality, universal consciousness\"),\" \"Ātman (\"individual soul\")\" and \"Prakriti\" (empirical world)\".\"\n\nThe sub-traditions of Vedānta include Advaita (non-dualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Dvaita (dualism) and Bhedabheda (difference and non-difference). Due the popularity of the bhakti movement, Vedānta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period.\n\nWhile the classical enumeration of Indian philosophies lists six orthodox schools, there are other schools which are sometimes seen as orthodox. These include:\n\n\nThe nāstika or heterodox schools are associated with the non-vedic Śramaṇic traditions that existed in India since before the 6th century BCE. The Śramaṇa movement gave rise to diverse range of non-vedic ideas, ranging from accepting or denying the concepts of atman, atomism, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, extreme asceticism, strict ahimsa (non-violence) and vegetarianism. Notable philosophies that arose from Śramaṇic movement were Jainism, early Buddhism, Cārvāka, Ajñana and Ājīvika.\n\nJain philosophy deals extensively with the problems of metaphysics, reality, cosmology, ontology, epistemology and divinity. Jainism is essentially a transtheistic religion of ancient India. It continues the ancient tradition, which co-existed with the Vedic tradition since ancient times. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy includes a mind-body dualism, denial of a creative and omnipotent God, karma, an eternal and uncreated universe, non-violence, the theory of the multiple facets of truth, and a morality based on liberation of the soul. Jain philosophy attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of bondage and the means to achieve liberation.\nIt has often been described as an ascetic movement for its strong emphasis on self-control, austerities and renunciation. It has also been called a model of philosophical liberalism for its insistence that truth is relative and multifaceted and for its willingness to accommodate all possible view-points of the rival philosophies. Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.\n\nThe contribution of the Jains in the development of Indian philosophy has been significant. Jain philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Moksa, Samsara and the like are common with other Indian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism in various forms. While Jainism traces its philosophy from teachings of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras, various Jain philosophers from Kundakunda and Umasvati in ancient times to Yasovijaya and Shrimad Rajchandra in recent times have contributed to Indian philosophical discourse in uniquely Jain ways.\n\nCārvāka or Lokāyata was an atheistic philosophy of scepticism and materialism, who rejected the Vedas and all associated supernatural doctrines. Cārvāka philosophers like Brihaspati were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Cārvāka deemed the Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology. They declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies invented by man whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests.\n\nLikewise they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of liberation, reincarnation and accumulation of merit or demerit through karma. They believed that, the viewpoint of relinquishing pleasure to avoid pain was the \"reasoning of fools\". Cārvāka epistemology holds perception as the primary source of knowledge, while rejecting inference which can be invalid. The primary texts of Cārvāka, like the Barhaspatya sutras (ca. 600 BCE) have been lost.\n\nĀjīvika was founded by Makkhali Gosala, it was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nOriginal scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Hindu Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas. The Ājīvika school is known for its \"Niyati\" doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvika considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an \"ātman\" – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.\n\nAjñana was a Śramaṇa school of radical Indian skepticism and a rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were seen as sophists who specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own. Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (fl. c. 800), author of the skeptical work entitled \"Tattvopaplavasiṃha\" (\"The Lion that Devours All Categories\"/\"The Upsetting of All Principles\"), has been seen as an important Ajñana philosopher.\n\nSikhism is an Indian religion developed by Guru Nanak (1469–1539) in the Punjab region during the Mughal Era. Their main sacred text is the \"Guru Granth Sahib.\" The fundamental beliefs include constant spiritual meditation of God's name, being guided by the Guru instead of yielding to capriciousness, living a householder's life instead of monasticism, truthful action to dharam (righteousness, moral duty), equality of all human beings, and believing in God's grace. Key concepts include \"Simran\", \"Sewa\" , the Three Pillars of Sikhism, and the Five Thieves.\n\nIn response to colonialism and their contact with Western philosophy, 19th century Indians developed new ways of thinking now termed Neo-Vedanta and Hindu modernism. Their ideas focused on the universality of Indian philosophy (particularly Vedanta) and the unity of different religions. It was during this period that Hindu modernists presented a single idealized and united \"Hinduism.\" exemplified by the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. They were also influenced by Western ideas. The first of these movements was that of the Brahmo Samaj of Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833). Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was very influential in developing the Hindu reform movements and in bringing the worldview to the West. Through the work of Indians like Vivekananda as well as westerners such as the proponents of the Theosophical society, modern Hindu thought also had an influence on western culture.\n\nThe political thought of Hindu nationalism is also another important current in modern Indian thought. The work of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo, Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan have had a large impact on modern Indian philosophy.\n\nJainism also had its modern interpreters and defenders, such as Virchand Gandhi, Champat Rai Jain, and Shrimad Rajchandra (well known as a spiritual guide of Mahatma Gandhi).\n\nBuddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (fl. between sixth and fourth centuries BCE) and is preserved in the early Buddhist texts. It generally refers to the philosophical investigations that developed among various Buddhist schools in India and later spread throughout Asia through the silk road. Buddhist thought is trans-regional and trans-cultural. It is the dominant philosophical tradition in Tibet and Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka and Burma.\n\nBuddhism's main concern is soteriological, defined as freedom from dukkha (unease). Because ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering, Buddhist thinkers concerned themselves with philosophical questions related to epistemology and the use of reason. Key Buddhist concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Anatta (not-self) a critique of a fixed personal identity, the transience of all things (Anicca), and a certain skepticism about metaphysical questions. Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in East Asia have covered topics as varied as phenomenology, ethics, ontology, epistemology, logic and philosophy of time.\n\nLater Buddhist philosophical traditions developed complex phenomenological psychologies termed 'Abhidharma'. Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of Shunyata (emptiness of all phenomena) and Vijnapti-matra (appearance only), a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism. The Dignāga (c. 480–540) school of Pramāṇa promoted a complex form of epistemology and Buddhist logic. This tradition contributed to what has been called an \"epistemological turn\" in Indian philosophy. Through the work of Dharmakirti, this tradition of Buddhist logic has become the major epistemological system used in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and debate.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Buddhism from India, these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions. In Tibet, the Indian tradition continued to be developed under the work of thinkers like Sakya Pandita, Tsongkhapa and Ju Mipham. In China, new developments were led by thinkers such as Xuangzang who authored new works on Yogacara, Zhiyi who founded the Tiantai school and developed a new theory of Madhyamaka and Guifeng Zongmi who wrote on Huayan and Zen.\n\nThe modern period saw the rise of Buddhist modernism and Humanistic Buddhism under Western influences and the development of a Western Buddhism with influences from modern psychology and Western philosophy. Important exponents of Buddhist modernism include Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933) and the American convert Henry Steel Olcott, the Chinese modernists Taixu (1890-1947) and Yin Shun (1906–2005), Zen scholar DT Suzuki, and the Tibetan Gendün Chöphel (1903–1951). Buddhist modernism refers to \"forms of Buddhism that have emerged out of an engagement with the dominant cultural and intellectual forces of modernity.\" Forces which influenced modernists like Dhammapala, and Yin Shun included Enlightenment values, and Western Science. A Neo-Buddhist movement was founded by the influential Indian Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar in the 1950s who emphasized social and political reform.\n\nBuddhist modernism includes various movements like Humanistic Buddhism, Secular Buddhism, the Vipassana movement, and Engaged Buddhism. Chinese humanistic Buddhism or \"Buddhism for Human Life\" (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was to be free of supernatural beliefs has also been an influential form of modern Buddhism in Asia.\n\nEast Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the \"Hundred Schools of Thought\" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE). This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major Chinese philosophical schools (Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism) as well as numerous less influential schools (Mohism, School of Names, School of Yin Yang). These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories which, along with Chinese Buddhism, had a direct influence on the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere. Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), through a gradual Silk road transmission and gradually developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/Zen).\n\nConfucianism (\"Kǒngjiào\" — \"Confucius' doctrine\"), also known as \"Ruism\" (\"Rújiào\" — \"doctrine of the scholars\"), is a Chinese philosophical system with ritual, moral, and religious applications. The tradition developed around the teachings of Confucius (\"Kǒng Fūzǐ\", 孔夫子, \"Master Kong\", 551–479 BCE) who saw himself as transmitting the values and theology of the ancestors before him. Other influential classical Confucian philosophers include Mencius and Xun Kuang who famously disagreed on the innate moral nature of humans.\n\nConfucianism focuses on humanistic values like familial and social harmony, filial piety (孝, \"xiào\"), \"Rén\" (仁, \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\") and \"Lǐ\" (禮/礼) which is a system of ritual norms that determines how a person should act to be in harmony with the law of Heaven. Confucianism traditionally holds that these values are based on the transcendent principle known as Heaven (\"Tiān\" 天), and also includes the belief in spirits or gods (\"shén\").\n\nConfucianism was a major ideology of the imperial state during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) and was revived as Neo-Confucianism during the Tang dynasty (618–907). During later Chinese dynasties like Song Dynasty (960-1297) and the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200) and Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state. Beginning in the Song dynasty, confucian classics were the basis of the imperial exams and became the core philosophy of the scholar official class. Confucianism suffered setbacks during the 20th century, but is recently undergoing a revival, which is termed New Confucianism.\n\nTraditionally, East Asian cultures and countries in the cultural sphere are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as well as various overseas territories settled predominantly by Overseas Chinese, such as Singapore.\n\nLegalism (pinyin: \"Fǎjiā;\" school of \"methods\" or \"standards\") was a philosophical tradition which focused on laws, realpolitik and bureaucratic management. Largely ignoring morality or idealized views of how society should be, they focused on pragmatic government through the power of the autocrat and state. Their goal was achieving increased order, security and stability. They were initially influenced by Mohist ideas. A key figure of this school was administrator and political philosopher Shen Buhai (c. 400–337 BC). Another central figure, Shang Yang (390–338 BC), was a leading statesman and reformer who transformed the Qin state into the dominant power that conquered the rest of China in 221 BC. Shen's successor Han Fei (c. 280 – 233 BC) synthesized the thought of the other Legalists in his eponymous text, the \"Han Feizi,\" one of the most influential Legalist texts which was used by successive Chinese statesmen and rulers as a guide for statesmanship and bureaucratic organization of the imperial state.\n\nMohism (\"Mòjiā\"; \"School of Mo\"), was founded by Mozi (c. 470 BC–c. 391 BC) and his students. It was a major school of thought and rival of Confucianism and Taoism during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (c. 770–221 BC). The main text of the school is the \"Mozi\" (book). The administrative thought of Mohism was later absorbed by Legalism, their ethics absorbed into Confucianism and its books were also merged into the Taoist canon, as Mohism all but disappeared as independent school after the Qin dynasty era.\n\nMohism is best known for the idea of \"impartial care\" (Chinese: 兼愛; pinyin: \"jiān ài\"; literally: \"inclusive love/care\"). According to Master Mo, persons should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to them. Mo also advocated impartial meritocracy in government which should be based on talent, not blood relations. Mozi was against Confucian ritualism, instead emphasizing pragmatic survival through farming, fortification, and statecraft. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the \"Will of Heaven\", but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels utilitarianism.\n\nMohism was also associated with and influenced by a separate philosophical school known as the School of Names (\"Míngjiā\"; also known as 'Logicians'), which focused on philosophy of language, definition and logic.\n\nTaoism (or Daoism) is a term for various philosophies and religious systems which emphasize harmony with the \"Tao\" (Chinese: 道; pinyin: \"Dào\"; literally: \"the Way\") which is seen as the principle which is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Taoism tends to emphasize virtues such as \"wu wei\" (effortless action), \"ziran\" (naturalness), \"pu\" (simplicity), and spontaneity while placing less emphasis on norms and ritual (as opposed to Confucianism). The attainment of immortality through external alchemy (waidan) and internal alchemy (neidan) was an important goal for many taoists historically.\n\nEarly forms of Taoism developed in the 4th century BCE, influenced by the cosmological theories of the School of Naturalists and the \"I Ching.\" The School of Naturalists or Yin-yang was another philosophical school that synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements; Zou Yan is considered the founder.\n\nThe \"Dao De Jing\" (\"Tao-Te-Ching,\" ca. 4th century BCE), traditionally attributed to Laozi, and the \"Nan Hua Jing\" (\"Zhuang Zi\") are considered the key texts of the tradition. The first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters') school arose in the 2nd century CE. Xuanxue (\"deep learning\", also \"Neo-Taoism\") was a major philosophical movement influenced by Confucian scholarship, which focused on the interpretation of the \"Yijing,\" \"Daodejing,\" and \"Zhuangzi\" and which flourished during the third to sixth centuries CE. The most important philosophers of this movement were He Yan, Wang Bi, the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Ge Hong and Guo Xiang. Thinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi focused on the deep nature of Tao, which they saw as being best exemplified by the term \"Wu\" (nothingness, non-being, negativity).\n\nOther schools rose to prominence throughout Chinese history, such as the Shangqing school during the Tang dynasty (618–907), the Lingbao school during the Song dynasty (960–1279) and the Quanzhen School which develop during the 13th-14th centuries and during the Yuan dynasty. The later Taoist traditions were also influenced by Chinese Buddhism.\n\nModern Chinese thought is generally seen as being rooted in Classical Confucianism (\"Jingxue\"), Neo-Confucianism (\"Lixue\"), Buddhism, Daoism, and \"Xixue\" (“Western Learning” which arose during the late Ming Dynasty).\n\nThe Opium war of 1839-42 saw the beginning of Western and Japanese invasions and exploitation of China which was humiliating to Chinese thinkers. The late 19th and early 20th century saw Chinese thinkers such as Zhang Zhidong looking to Western practical knowledge as a way to preserve traditional Chinese culture, a doctrine that he defined as “Chinese Learning as Substance and Western Learning as Function” (\"Zhongti Xiyong\").\n\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 and the end of the Qing Dynasty, the May Fourth Movement sought to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China (such as the old civil service system). There were two major philosophical trends during this period. One was anti-traditional and promoted Western learning and ideas. A key figure of this anti-traditional current was Yan Fu (1853-1921) who translated various Western philosophical works including Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Mill's On Liberty. There were also attempts to incorporate Western ideas of democracy, and republicanism into Chinese political philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-Sen (1866-1925) at the beginning of the 20th century. Another influential modern Chinese philosopher was Hu Shi, who was a student of John Dewey at Columbia University and who promoted a form of pragmatism.\n\nThe traditionalists meanwhile sought to revive and fortify traditional Chinese philosophical schools. Chinese Buddhist thought was promoted by thinkers like Yang Rensan and Ou-Yang Jingwu while another influential movement is New Confucianism (Chinese: 新儒家; pinyin: \"xīn rú jiā\"). New Confucianism is a traditionalist revival of Confucian thought in China beginning in 20th century Republican China which is also associated with New Conservatism. Key New Confucians of the first generation are Xiong Shili and Fung Youlan. The second generation (1950–1979) include individuals like Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, and Xu Fuguan, all three students of Xiong Shili. Together with Zhang Junmai, the second generation published the New Confucian Manifesto in 1958.\n\nThe influence of Marxism on modern Chinese political thought is vast, especially through the work of Mao Zedong, the most famous thinker of Chinese Marxist Philosophy. Maoism is a Chinese Marxist philosophy based on the teachings of 20th-century Communist Party of China revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. It is based partially on earlier theories by Marx and Lenin, but rejects the urban proletariat and Leninist emphasis on heavy industrialization in favor of a revolution supported by the peasantry, and a decentralized agrarian economy based on many collectively worked farms. The current government of the People's Republic of China continues to espouse a pragmatic form of socialism as its official party ideology which it calls Socialism with Chinese characteristics. When the Communist Party of China took over the reign, previous schools of thought such as Taoism and Confucianism (except Legalism) were denounced as backward, and later purged during the violence of the Cultural Revolution which saw many Taoist and Buddhist temples and institutions destroyed.\n\nModern Japanese thought is strongly influenced by Western science and philosophy. Japan's rapid modernization was partly aided by the early study of western science (known as Rangaku) during the Edo Period (1603 – 1868). Another intellectual movement during the Edo period was Kokugaku (national study), which sought to focus on the study of ancient Japanese thought, classic texts and culture over and against foreign Chinese and Buddhist cultures. A key figure of this movement is Motoori Norinaga (1730 – 1801), who argued that the essence of classic Japanese literature and culture was a sense called mono no aware (\"sorrow at evanescence\").\n\nIn the Meiji period (1868 – 1912), the modernist Meirokusha (Meiji 6, formed in 1874) intellectual society promoted European enlightenment thought. Meirokusha philosophers like Mori Arinori, Nishi Amane, and Fukuzawa Yukichi sought ways to combine Western ideas with Japanese culture and values. The Shōwa period (1926–1989) saw the rise of State Shinto and Japanese nationalism.\n\nJapanese Buddhist philosophy was influenced by the work of the Kyoto School which drew from western philosophers (especially German philosophy) and Buddhist thought and included Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, Hajime Tanabe and Masao Abe. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is Critical Buddhism, which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as Buddha nature and original enlightenment.\n\nJuche, usually translated as \"self-reliance\", is the official political ideology of North Korea, described by the regime as Kim Il-Sung's \"original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought\". The idea states that an individual is \"the master of his destiny\" and that the North Korean masses are to act as the \"masters of the revolution and construction\".\n\nThere have been many modern attempts to integrate Western and Eastern philosophical traditions.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer developed a philosophy that was essentially a synthesis of Hinduism with Western thought. He anticipated that the \"Upanishads\" (primary Hindu scriptures) would have a much greater influence in the West than they have had. However, Schopenhauer was working with heavily flawed early translations (and sometimes second-degree translations), and many feel that he may not necessarily have accurately grasped the Eastern philosophies which interested him.\n\nRecent attempts to incorporate Western philosophy into Eastern thought include the Kyoto School of philosophers, who combined the phenomenology of Husserl with the insights of Zen Buddhism. Watsuji Tetsurô, a 20th-century Japanese philosopher attempted to combine the works of Søren Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Heidegger with Eastern philosophies. Some have claimed that there is also a definite eastern element within Heidegger's philosophy. For the most part this is not made explicit within Heidegger's philosophy, apart from in the dialogue between a Japanese and inquirer. Heidegger did spend time attempting to translate the Tao Te Ching into German, working with his Chinese student Paul Hsaio. It has also been claimed that much of Heidegger's later philosophy, particularly the sacredness of Being, bears a distinct similarity to Taoist ideas. There are clear parallels between Heidegger and the work of Kyoto School, and ultimately, it may be read that Heidegger's philosophy is an attempt to 'turn eastwards' in response to the crisis in Western civilization. However, this is only an interpretation.\n\nThe 20th century Hindu guru Sri Aurobindo was influenced by German Idealism and his integral yoga is regarded as a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought. The German phenomenologist Jean Gebser's writings on the history of consciousness referred to a new planetary consciousness that would bridge this gap. Followers of these two authors are often grouped together under the term Integral thought.\n\nSwiss psychologist Carl Jung was deeply influenced by the I Ching. The I Ching (Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese text from the Shang Dynasty (Bronze Age 1700BC-1050BC), and uses a system of Yin and Yang, which it places into hexagrams for the purposes of divination. Carl Jung's idea of synchronicity moves towards an Oriental view of causality, as he states in the foreword to Richard Wilhelm's translation of the I Ching (Book of Changes). He explains that this Chinese view of the world is based not on science as the West knows it, but on chance.\n\nSome Western thinkers claim that philosophy as such is only characteristic of Western cultures. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger is even reported to have said that only Greek and German languages are suitable for philosophizing. It is still commonplace in Western universities to teach only Western philosophy and to ignore Asian philosophy altogether, or consider only newer Western-influenced Asian thought proper \"philosophy\". Carine Defoort, herself a specialist in Chinese thought, has offered support for such a \"family\" view of philosophy, while Rein Raud has presented an argument against it and offered a more flexible definition of philosophy that would include both Western and Asian thought on equal terms. In response, Ouyang Min argues that philosophy proper is a Western cultural practice and essentially different from \"zhexue\", which is what the Chinese have, even though \"zhexue\" (originally \"tetsugaku\") is actually a neologism coined in 1873 by Nishi Amane for describing Western philosophy as opposed to traditional Asian thought.\n\nAccording to the British philosopher Victoria S. Harrison, the category of \"Eastern philosophy\", and similarly \"Asian philosophy\" and \"Oriental philosophy\" is a product of 19th-century Western scholarship and did not exist in East Asia or India. This is because in Asia there is no single unified philosophical tradition with a single root, but various autochthonous traditions which have come into contact with each other over time.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1354571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1354571", "title": "Emile, or On Education", "text": "Emile, or On Education\n\nEmile, or On Education () is a treatise on the nature of education and on the nature of man written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who considered it to be the \"best and most important\" of all his writings. Due to a section of the book entitled \"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\", \"Emile\" was banned in Paris and Geneva and was publicly burned in 1762, the year of its first publication. During the French Revolution, \"Emile\" served as the inspiration for what became a new national system of education.\n\nThe work tackles fundamental political and philosophical questions about the relationship between the individual and society—how, in particular, the individual might retain what Rousseau saw as innate human goodness while remaining part of a corrupting collectivity. Its opening sentence: \"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man\".\n\nRousseau seeks to describe a system of education that would enable the \"natural man\" he identifies in \"The Social Contract\" (1762) to survive corrupt society. He employs the novelistic device of Emile and his tutor to illustrate how such an ideal citizen might be educated. \"Emile\" is scarcely a detailed parenting guide but it does contain some specific advice on raising children. It is regarded by some as the first philosophy of education in Western culture to have a serious claim to completeness, as well as being one of the first \"Bildungsroman\" novels.\n\nThe text is divided into five \"books\": the first three are dedicated to the child Emile, the fourth to an exploration of the adolescent, and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart Sophie, as well as to Emile's domestic and civic life.\n\nIn Book I, Rousseau discusses not only his fundamental philosophy but also begins to outline how one would have to raise a child to conform with that philosophy. He begins with the early physical and emotional development of the infant and the child.\n\n\"Emile\" attempts to \"find a way of resolving the contradictions between the natural man who is 'all for himself' and the implications of life in society\". The famous opening line does not bode well for the educational project—\"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man\". But Rousseau acknowledges that every society \"must choose between making a man or a citizen\" and that the best \"social institutions are those that best know how to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity\". To \"denature man\" for Rousseau is to suppress some of the \"natural\" instincts that he extols in \"The Social Contract\", published the same year as \"Emile\", but while it might seem that for Rousseau such a process would be entirely negative, this is not so. \"Emile\" is not a panegyric for the loss of the noble savage, a term Rousseau never actually used. Instead, it is an effort to explain how natural man can live within society.\n\nMany of Rousseau's suggestions in this book are restatements of the ideas of other educational reformers. For example, he endorses Locke's program of \"harden[ing children's] bodies against the intemperance of season, climates, elements; against hunger, thirst, fatigue\". He also emphasizes the perils of swaddling and the benefits of mothers nursing their own infants. Rousseau's enthusiasm for breastfeeding led to him to argue: \"[B]ut let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, nature's sentiments will be awakened in every heart, the state will be repeopled\"—a hyperbole that demonstrates Rousseau's commitment to grandiose rhetoric. As Peter Jimack, the noted Rousseau scholar, argues: \"Rousseau consciously sought to find the striking, lapidary phrase which would compel the attention of his readers and move their hearts, even when it meant, as it often did, an exaggeration of his thought\". And, in fact, Rousseau's pronouncements, although not original, effected a revolution in swaddling and breastfeeding.\n\nThe second book concerns the initial interactions of the child with the world. Rousseau believed that at this phase the education of children should be derived less from books and more from the child's interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to draw inferences from them. Rousseau concludes the chapter with an example of a boy who has been successfully educated through this phase. The father takes the boy out flying kites, and asks the child to infer the position of the kite by looking only at the shadow. This is a task that the child has never specifically been taught, but through inference and understanding of the physical world, the child is able to succeed in his task. In some ways, this approach is the precursor of the Montessori method.\n\nThe third book concerns the selection of a trade. Rousseau believed it necessary that the child must be taught a manual skill appropriate to his gender and age, and suitable to his inclinations, by worthy role models.\n\nOnce Emile is physically strong and learns to carefully observe the world around him, he is ready for the last part of his education—sentiment: \"We have made an active and thinking being. It remains for us, in order to complete the man, only to make a loving and feeling being—that is to say, to perfect reason by sentiment\". Emile is a teenager at this point and it is only now that Rousseau believes he is capable of understanding complex human emotions, particularly sympathy. Rousseau argues that the child cannot put himself in the place of others but once adolescence has been reached and he is able do so, Emile can finally be brought into the world and socialized.\n\nIn addition to introducing a newly passionate Emile to society during his adolescent years, the tutor also introduces him to religion. According to Rousseau, children cannot understand abstract concepts such as the soul before the age of about fifteen or sixteen, so to introduce religion to them is dangerous. He writes: \"It is a lesser evil to be unaware of the divinity than to offend it\". Moreover, because children are incapable of understanding the difficult concepts that are part of religion, he points out that children will only recite what is told to them—they are unable to believe.\n\nBook IV also contains the famous \"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\", the section that was largely responsible for the condemnation of \"Emile\" and the one most frequently excerpted and published independently of its parent tome. Rousseau writes at the end of the \"Profession\": \"I have transcribed this writing not as a rule for the sentiments that one ought to follow in religious matters, but as an example of the way one can reason with one’s pupil in order not to diverge from the method I have tried to establish\". Rousseau, through the priest, leads his readers through an argument which concludes only to belief in \"natural religion\": \"If he must have another religion\", Rousseau writes (that is, beyond a basic \"natural religion\"), \"I no longer have the right to be his guide in that\".\n\nIn Book V, Rousseau turns to the education of Sophie, Emile's wife-to-be. This brief description of female education sparked an immense contemporary response, perhaps even more so than \"Emile\" itself. Mary Wollstonecraft, for example, dedicated a substantial portion of her chapter \"Animadversions on Some of the Writers who have Rendered Women Objects of Pity, Bordering on Contempt\" in \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) to attacking Rousseau and his arguments. \n\nWhen responding to Rousseau’s argument in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft directly quotes Émile, ou De l’éducation in Chapter IV of her piece:\n\nEducate women like men,' says Rousseau [in Émile, ou De l’éducation], 'and the more they resemble our sex the less power will they have over us.' This is the very point I aim at. I do not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves.\n\nFrench writer Louise d'Épinay's Conversations d'Emilie made her disagreement with Rousseau’s take on female education clear as well. Indeed, she believes that females’ education affects their role in society, not natural differences as Rousseau claims. \n\nRousseau begins his description of Sophie, the ideal woman, by describing the inherent differences between men and women in a famous passage:\n\nIn what they have in common, they are equal. Where they differ, they are not comparable. A perfect woman and a perfect man ought not to resemble each other in mind any more than in looks, and perfection is not susceptible of more or less. In the union of the sexes each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same way. From this diversity arises the first assignable difference in the moral relations of the two sexes.\n\nFor Rousseau, \"everything man and woman have in common belongs to the species, and ... everything which distinguishes them belongs to the sex\". Rousseau states that women should be \"passive and weak\", \"put up little resistance\" and are \"made specially to please man\"; he adds, however, that \"man ought to please her in turn\", and he explains the dominance of man as a function of \"the sole fact of his strength\", that is, as a strictly \"natural\" law, prior to the introduction of \"the law of love\".\n\nRousseau also touches on the political upbringing of Emile in book V by including a concise version of his \"Social Contract\" in the book. His political treatise \"The Social Contract\" was published in the same year as \"Emile\" and was likewise soon banned by the government for its controversial theories on general will. The version of this work in \"Emile\", however, does not go into detail concerning the tension between the Sovereign and the Executive, but instead refer the reader to the original work.\n\nRousseau’s stance on female education, much like the other ideas explored in Émile, ou De l’éducation, “crystallize existing feelings” of the time period. During the eighteenth century, women’s education was traditionally focused on domestic skills—including sewing, housekeeping, and cooking—as they were encouraged to stay within their suitable spheres, which Rousseau advocates.\n\nIn the incomplete sequel to \"Emile\", \"Émile et Sophie\" (English: \"Emilius and Sophia\"), published after Rousseau's death, Sophie is unfaithful (in what is hinted at might be a drugged rape), and Emile, initially furious with her betrayal, remarks \"the adulteries of the women of the world are not more than gallantries; but Sophia an adulteress is the most odious of all monsters; the distance between what she was, and what she is, is immense. No! there is no disgrace, no crime equal to hers\". He later relents somewhat, blaming himself for taking her to a city full of temptation, but he still abandons her and their children. Throughout the agonized internal monologue, represented through letters to his old tutor, he repeatedly comments on all of the affective ties that he has formed in his domestic life—\"the chains [his heart] forged for itself\". As he begins to recover from the shock, the reader is led to believe that these \"chains\" are not worth the price of possible pain—\"By renouncing my attachments to a single spot, I extended them to the whole earth, and, while I ceased to be a citizen, became truly a man\". While in \"La Nouvelle Héloïse\" the ideal is domestic, rural happiness (if not bliss), in \"Emile\" and its sequel the ideal is \"emotional self-sufficiency which was the natural state of primitive, pre-social man, but which for modern man can be attained only by the suppression of his natural inclinations\". According to Dr. Wilson Paiva, member of the Rousseau Association, \"[L]eft unfinished, \"Émile et Sophie\" reminds us of Rousseau's incomparable talent for producing a brilliant conjugation of literature and philosophy, as well as a productive approach of sentiment and reason through education\".\n\nRousseau's contemporary and philosophical rival Voltaire was critical of \"Emile\" as a whole, but admired the section in the book which had led to it being banned (the section titled \"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\"). According to Voltaire, \"Emile\" is \n\nHowever, Voltaire went on to endorse the \"Profession of Faith\" section and called it \"fifty good pages... it is regrettable that they should have been written by... such a knave\".\n\nThe German scholar Goethe wrote in 1787 that \"Emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind\".\n\n"}

The focus in past research tended to be on the unique ideas and knowledge of minorities and distinct cultural groups, and how this relates to universal and cross cultural knowledge discovered by humanity as a whole. Knowledge claims that are based more on universal discoveries and natural science can be found in the subjects of philosophy, chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and geology. The term \"ethnogeology\" first enters the geological literature through the work of John Murray of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada in the mid-1990s by virtue of his studies of the Northern Cree First Nation geological worldviews in the Province of Manitoba in Canada. At that time, a cadre of geologists and geoscience educators - particularly Dr. Steven Semken of Navajo Community College in Shiprock, New Mexico and colleagues - were examining the interesting connections among Native American traditional knowledge, geoscience concepts, and the unique vision of planet Earth's history as articulated by indigenous ethnogeological wisdom (see references below).\n\nOne global example of geological knowledge over thousands of years is the making of rock tools and arrowheads. Worldwide, humans have shaped specific kinds of rock into various tools. These artifacts are evidence that there was some basic knowledge of which rocks were hard enough and easy enough to chip into various useful forms. Ancient humans discovered certain rock formations that provided them with materials to work with. Flint, obsidian, chert, copper and quartz were some examples of useful rocks or minerals for thousands of years.\n\nIn addition, humans have always used natural, high, and dry ridges for land transportation. Natural water ways were used for boats, travel, exploration, and trade. Various types of natural elements were used around the Earth for centuries. Gold and silver are prized for jewelry and trade. Good soil is needed for agriculture. Mountains and rivers provided natural boundaries, defence, and borders for various political groups.\n\nIntegration of Native American and Euro-American Culture and Science\n\n\n"}

The \"Flora\" was published by William Curtis in six large volumes. The descriptions of the plants included hand-coloured copperplate plates by botanical artists such as James Sowerby, Sydenham Edwards and William Kilburn.\n\nThe full title of the book is \"Flora Londinensis, or, Plates and descriptions of such plants as grow wild in the environs of London\". The first volume was produced in 1777 and the final one, containing a title and an index, was published in 1798. A binary name is given for each species in the survey; common and other names are also ascribed for the general reader. The remarkable aspect of the volumes was their accessibility. Previous works on the flora of Britain had been intended for the audience of scientists, apothecaries, and the earlier herbalists. The appealing plates also provided a careful botanical detail which could assist in the identification of a species.\n\nCurtis was \"praefectus horti\" (Director, Society of Apothecaries) at the Chelsea Physic Garden and a botanist with a broad knowledge of exotic species. However, \"Flora Londinensis\" was to cover the most familiar territory of its author. Curtis intended documenting the flowering species within a 10-mile radius of London, commissioning several painters cum illustrators to produce hand-coloured copper engravings to accompany the pages. He undertook writing descriptions, publishing, and sales of the volumes, producing six fascicles of twelve issues, each containing six plates. The final survey eventually came to include many species found in southern England and a few more besides.\n\nDespite praise for the importance of the volumes, the work was not produced beyond 300 copies. Many other works were to be issued; the economics of producing a more affordable volume were yet to be refined. The publication by Curtis, \"The Botanical Magazine\", was to be a greater financial success. Sowerby, who helped to publish the volumes and give over seventy of the plates, went on to produce natural history publications in a similar format.\n\nThe work was enlarged by William J. Hooker, who published an edition with his own text in 1817 and 1828. This enlargement was even more comprehensive, by including species from the other British Isles.\n\n\n\n"}

This mix of cultures leads to the creation of traditional tales and narrations better known as myths and legends.\n\nMyths are narrations that tell us about the origin of gods, of the creation of our world and space. The importance of both types of tales is that they are created inside the context of a group and as a result they can be used to see the different characteristics of the group's culture. They usually show us religion, beliefs or try to explain natural phenomena.\n\nAll of the other gods formed two lines around the fire, and then the Tecuciztecatl and Nanahuatzin were placed in front of the fire. All the gods said to Tecuciztécatl: “Tecuciztécatl enter the fire”, he tried to enter, but he could not. He tried 4 times but he did not succeed. It was established that he could not try more than four times. So the gods said to Nanahuatzin: “Try” and, making a big effort and closing his eyes, he entered the fire.\n\nWhen Tecuciztécatl saw that Nanahuatzin had entered the fire, he ran and entered the fire too... After both gods entered the fire, all the other gods sat and waited to see how Nanahuatzin was going to get out. After a while the sky started to change its color, it was red and the light of dawn appeared. It is said that after this, all the gods knelt to wait Nanahuatzin as the sun form. Some of them thought that Nanahuatzin would rise from the north part. Others said he would rise at the midday. The gods thought he could rise from everywhere because there was light everywhere.\n\nSome gods looked at the east and said: “Here, the sun will rise from this part”, this phrase was true. One of these gods were Quetzalcoatl (also known as the god of the wind) and Tótec (lord of the coast lands or red Tezcatlipoca).\n\nWhen the sun rose it was red and nobody could see it because it was very bright. Then the moon appeared from the same part, they rose in the same order they entered the fire. Those who narrate fables say that they had the same intensity of light so the gods met again and said: “It is not possible that both have the same intensity”. So the gods decided\n\nAfter the gods got out of the fire, they stood immobile. So the gods had to die to make the sun move. It is said that the sun did not move after the gods died, then the wind started to blow and he made the sun move. That is why they work at different times: the sun lights during the day and the moon works during the night.\n\nBefore leaving for war, Popocatépetl asked Iztaccíhuatl's father for permission to marry her. Shortly after, a rival of Popocatépetl falsely told Iztaccíhuatl that her love had been killed in battle. The princess died of grief after she heard this news. Popocatépetl returned victorious but was shocked by the princess's death. To honor her, he ordered a tomb to be built close to the sun. Ten hills were united to create a mountain. Popocatépetl laid the princess's body at the mountaintop, and the whole mountain took on the form of a sleeping woman. Then as the warrior kneeled before his lost love, snow covered them, and they both transformed into volcanoes.\n\nLegends are stories created by anonymous authors with some basis in history but with many embellishments. They talk about facts that occurred in the near past and which characters can or cannot be human. Legends show us the vision of the world and the life that people had with, historical, political, philosophical, and cultural value.\n\nDuring Colonial era in Mexico, new narrations began to appear. Many of them created from the mix of religion and past belief tried to mix indigenous and Christian-catholic beliefs.\n\nWhen Don Luis de Velasco I came to replace the Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza, Don Gonzalo Espinosa de Guevara and his daughter Beatriz lived in a big mansion. She had a beautiful face, lovely eyes, with skin as white as lilies. Her lustrous, silky hair fell from her shoulders and cascaded like a waterfall down her fine back. She was also gentle: she used to care for the sick and the injured and to help poor people.\n\nWith such a noble, generous soul, beauty, and a large fortune, it was easy to understand that she had plenty of handsome lovers. Many gentlemen and noblemen fought in front of Beatriz's mansion, but she did not accept anyone.\n\nFinally a gentleman arrived to the mansion—a man whose destiny chose him to be Beatriz's husband. His name was Don Martín de Scópoli, Marquis of Piamonte and Franteschelo, a handsome Italian gentleman who loved Beatriz since the first time he saw her, and his love for her grew with passion.\n\nHe fought bravely with every gentleman that wanted to marry Beatriz, showing his strong and eternal love for her. For this reason many gentleman proved themselves fighting for Beatriz trying to defeat the impertinent Italian man. Don Martín fought days and nights under the moonlight, and he always won.\n\nWhen the sun rose, the police passing through Beatriz's street would always find a dead or injured gentlemen, caused by the sword of the Italian suitor.\n\nBeatriz loved Don Martin immensely because of his demeanor and handsomeness and because of his lovely words. One night, after she had prayed to Santa Lucia (a martyr virgin took out her eyes so as to not be a temptation), she made a terrible decision that would make Don Martin Scúpoli love her no more. The next day, after completing many tasks, such as helping poor people with medicines and food, she confirmed that her father had left and carried to her room a brazier, in which she put charcoal and lit a fire. Suddenly the flames filled the room, and the heat became intense. She prayed to Santa Lucía, and saying Don Martin's name, she knelt down and put her beautiful face over the brazier.\n\nA smell of burning flesh spread throughout the room, taking out the fresh smell of jasmine and almonds. After a few minutes later, Beatriz screamed and fainted next to the brazier. Father Marcos de Jesus and Gracia, who was a confidant of Beatriz, heard Beatriz's scream and ran into the house. He found Beatriz on the floor, he lifted her with care and tried to put some herbs and vinegar on her burnt face, asking her why she had done it.\n\nShe explained to him that with this event, Don Martin would finish with the fights and he would stop loving her. After she told him the reasons, Father Marcos explained to Don Martin what had happened. The Italian gentleman hurried to be where his lover was. He found her sitting on an armchair with a black veil that covered her face. The veil was spotted with blood and burnt flesh.\n\nVery carefully he took off the veil from his lover's face, but he did not jump back terrified when he saw her. He was worried, looking at her beautiful white face burnt by the cruel flames. Under the firmly arched eyebrows, there were two holes with burnt eyelids. Her cheeks were open craters where blood drained and her lips which had been so sumptous, worthy of a passionate kiss, were now a hole which formed a horrible grin. After he saw this, the Marquis of Piamonte knelt down and said with tenderness:\n\n\"Ah, Beatriz, I love you not for your beauty, but for your goodness. You are a noble, generous lady, and your soul is pure.\"\n\nTears fell with these words, and both cried with love and tenderness.\n\nThe Marquis continued, \"When your father comes back, I will ask for your hand in marriage.\"\n\nThe wedding of Beatriz and the Marquis de Piedmont was held at the temple “The Profesa” and was the most sensational event of those times. Don Gonzalo Guevara Espinosa spent his fortune on the celebrations and the Marquis of Piedmont gave the bride dresses, jewelry and furniture brought from Italy.\n\nBeatriz arrived to the altar with a white veil on her face in order to avoid the mad curiosity of the people. After this she only went outside to go to the nearby church to hear mass, accompanied by her husband.\n\nSince that day, the street where Beatriz house was once located is now called the Burnt Girl's Street.\n\nThis is a sad love story of two young people who lived and died in Guanajuato,Mexico: Carmen and Luis. She was as beautiful and pure as an angel, about 20, lovely and single. He was handsome, about 28, tan and tall with an arrogant demeanor, adorned with the best moral qualities, hard-working, honest. With those conditions Luis met Carmen, and as soon as they saw each other, they fell in love. From that moment Luis, went frequently in the evening to Carmen's house after work. And she, with the same feelings, stood on her balcony, beautiful as Dulcinea, white, with big and expressive eyes, in a beautiful and unique manila dress that her father gave her, so when Luis passed by her house she gave him a beautiful smile.\n\nSo the weeks passed by, until Luis dared to greet her and the young lady accepted his greeting with a gentle smile. The next day he started a conversation, shy at the beginning, but polite, as any courtship, after that like any couple of lovers with, love phrases and promises. They quickly started to think of a big wedding, blessed by her mother Madame Matilde, a virtuous and dignified mother that had accepted the relationship between her daughter Carmen and Luis. But Carmen's father did not approve it, because he had already planned marry Ana to a friend of his, which was rich and lived on backing Spain. So Madame Matilde thought that the relationship between Carmen and Luis would probably end, and she decided to tell her husband about the casual meetings that Carmen and Luis had on Carmen's balcony.\n\nOne day Carmen's father saw the two lovers talking, and he forbade Luis from seeing his daughter, also threatening to send Carmen to a convent if she continued seeing Luis.\n\nNeither Carmen nor Luis accepted the attitude that Carmen's father took, so Luis decided to reestablish their relationship behind Carmen's father's back. Luis planned to rent a room in the house next door where there was a balcony in front of her balcony in which they could talk without being seen, so they could plan a way to escape and be happy.\n\nSo the weeks passed by, hiding their courtship from the sun. They only looked at each other in the moonlight from their balconies while Carmen's father slept. Unfortunately the tragedy came. One night Carmen's father woke up and took a knife from his bureau and in blind fury walked to the balcony of his daughter, he surprised his daughter and he buried the knife into her chest. She died in her lover's arms in the white moonlight. Luis took his lover's white hand and two tears fell down. With a big kiss Luis said good bye to his eternal love: Carmen who died on the Alley of the kiss.\n\nIn the offices of the Viceroy of New Spain was an officer named Don Bonifacio. He was a very lazy guy. His payment was the necessary to sustain his wife, his sons and his house. He was always angry, bored, resting in his armchair, and waiting for his meals.\n\nThere was no game of the Royal Lottery in which he wasn't participating. However he never won anything. One day he decided to send a letter to the Viceroy, but what was this letter about?\n\nAfter sending that letter, every Friday Don Bonifacio walked to the Central Palace and waited in a corner where shadow covered him from the intense sun. The Viceroy, ridding in his white horse, approached every Saturday to Don Bonifacio and gave him a box covered with a little of silver. Usually Marteseo. Wilkins took the box back to\n\nWhat they didn't know is that Don Bonifacio was not friend of the Viceroy... he was a lazy worker with the great idea of writing to the Viceroy what follows:\n\n“Dear Viceroy… It would be a pleasure if you were able to give me a little of your soil that is inside your palace. I have seen that in your soil everything is green and profitable. Would you give me the honor of having my crops as beautiful as yours?”\n\nThe golden box contained only soil from the Viceroy's palace.\n\nIt's said that Bonifacio became a very rich and powerful person just because of the magic powder of the Viceroy\n\nIn Mexico it is believed that exposure of a pregnant woman to an eclipse will cause her infant to have a cleft lip or palate.\n\nThe belief originated with the Aztecs, who thought that an eclipse occurred because a bite had been taken out of the moon. If the pregnant woman viewed the eclipse, her infant would have a bite taken out of its mouth.\n\nAn obsidian knife was placed on the woman's abdomen before going out at night to protect her.\n\nThis belief remains intact hundreds of years later, the only difference being that today a metal key or safety pin is used for protection.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3284859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3284859", "title": "Formulaic language", "text": "Formulaic language\n\nFormulaic language (previously known as automatic speech or embolalia) is a linguistic term for verbal expressions that are fixed in form, often non-literal in meaning with attitudinal nuances, and closely related to communicative-pragmatic context. Along with idioms, expletives and proverbs, formulaic language includes pause fillers (e.g., \"Like\", \"Er\" or \"Uhm\") and conversational speech formulas (e.g., \"You've got to be kidding,\" \"Excuse me?\" or \"Hang on a minute\").\n\nThe word embolalia comes from the Greek word \"embolos\" which means 'something thrown in', from the word \"emballo-\" meaning 'to throw in', and \"-lalia\" meaning 'speech, chattering and babbling; abnormal or disordered form of speech.\n\nModern linguists led by Leonard Bloomfield in 1933 call these \"hesitation forms\", the sounds of stammering (uh), stuttering (um, um), throat-clearing (ahem!), stalling (well, um, that is), interjected when the speaker is groping for words or at a loss for the next thought.\n\nFrench psychiatrist Jules Séglas, on the other hand, referred to the term embolalia, as \"the regular addition of prefixes or suffixes to words\" and mentioned that the behavior is sometimes used by normal individuals to demonstrate to their interlocutor that they are paying attention to the conversation.\n\nHarry Levin and Irene Silverman called formulaic language \"vocal segregates\" in their 1965 paper on hesitation phenomena and found out from their experiments on children that these segregates seem to be less voluntary hesitation phenomena and may be signs of uncontrolled emotionality under stress.\n\nThe Irish poet William Butler Yeats argued for formulaic language experiments with his wife, which provided him with symbols for his poetry as well as literary theories.\n\nAccording to \"The Canadian Modern Language Review\", formulaic sequences are \"fixed combinations of words that ... can facilitate fluency in speech by making pauses shorter and less frequent, and allowing longer runs of speech between pauses\".\n\nA formulaic sequence is \"a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is, or appears to be, prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar.\"\n\nThey can be found everywhere in language use and \"make up a large proportion of any discourse\". Formulaic sequences can be of any length and can be used to express messages, functions, social solidarity and process information very fast without communication misunderstanding.\n\n\"Filled pauses\"\n\nFilled pauses consist of repetitions of syllables and words, reformulation or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech to fit the representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning. There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur. Although a schwa-like quality [ə:], appears to be the most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [ɨ:] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending on the quality of the previous word last vowel. Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language. The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only. Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [ɨ:] is appended to achieve the desired effect.\n\n\"Prolonged pauses\"\n\nSimilarly to filled pauses, single occurrences of prolonged pauses occurring between stretches of fluent speech, may be preceded and followed by silent pauses, as they most often occur on function words with a CV or V structure. Even though they are not always central, the vowels of such syllables may be as long as the ones observed for filled pauses.\n\n\"Retraced and unretraced restarts\"\n\nRiggenbach's 1991 study of fluency development in Chinese learners of English had an analysis of repair phenomena, which included retraced restarts and unretraced restarts. Retraced restarts refer to the reformulations whereby a portion of the original utterance is duplicated. They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication of a sound, syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a retraced restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items. Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.\n\nThe semantics of formulaic language have often been debated on, and to date, there lacks a consensus on whether or not filler words are intentional in speech and whether or not they should be considered as words or if they are simply side effects of difficulties in the planning process of speech by speakers. Bailey & Ferriera's (2007) paper found that there is little evidence to suggest that the use of filler words are intentional in speech and that they should not be considered as words in the conventional sense.\n\nFiller words consist of \"Non-lexical fillers\" and \"Lexical fillers\". \"Non-lexical fillers\" are recognized as fillers that are not words and \"Lexical fillers\" are recognized as fillers that are words and both types of fillers are thought to contain little or no semantic information. However, some filler words are used to express certain speech acts. \"Yeah\", a \"Lexical filler\", is used to give affirmation, introduce a new topic, shows speaker's perception and understanding, and occurs after a speech management problem when the speakers does not how to continue their speech. Fillers like \"Mmmm\", a \"Non-lexical filler\", and \"Well\", a \"Lexical filler\", are also said to signal listener's understanding of the information provided.\n\nResearch has shown that people were less likely to use formulaic language in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms. To date, there is insufficient research done to say if fillers are a part of integral meaning, or if they are aspect of performance, but we can say that they are useful in facilitating information for the listener.\n\nFormulaic language is more likely to occur at the beginning of utterance or phrase and the reason is because it is presumed that there is a greater demand on planning processes at these junctures. Features of formulaic language, like filled pauses or repetitions, are most likely to occur immediately prior to the onset of a complex syntactic constituent. Filled pauses are also likely after the initial word in a complex constituent, especially after function words. Therefore, listeners might be able to use the presence of a recent filled pause to predict that an ambiguous structure, and this trait is in favor of a more complex analysis .\n\nThere are several different types of formulaic language. One type is relatively universal, often transcending differences in language and to some degree culture. Simple fillers like \"Uhm\", \"Uh\", or \"Er\" are used by many different people in many different settings. For the most part, these types of fillers are considered innocuous, and are often overlooked by listeners, as long as they are not utilized so often that they overshadow the remainder of the conversation.\n\nOther forms of formulaic language are ingrained within specific cultures, and in fact are sometimes considered an identifying characteristic of people who share a particular religion, or live in a specific geographical region. Along with accents, formulaic language of this type is sometimes considered colorful and somewhat entertaining. Writers often make use of this type of speech to give the characters in their writings additional personality, helping to make them unique.\n\n\"Fluency\"\n\nThe study conducted by Dechert (1980) that investigated the speech performance of a German student of English revealed that there is a tendency for speech pauses to be situated at breaks that are consistent with \"episodic units\". Dechert (1980) found that the more fluent utterances exhibited more pauses at those junctures and lesser within the \"episodic units\", leading him to posit that the study subject was able to use the narrative structure to pace his own speech with natural breaks in order for him to scout for the words and phrases that are to follow subsequently.\n\nThrough the comparison of the story retelling utterances collated of second language learners, Lennon (1984) discovered notable disparities in the distribution of pauses between recounting in the research subjects' first and second languages respectively. The study found that all of the pauses were found to be located either at clause breaks or following nonintegral components of the clause, without pauses within the clauses. On the other hand, the narrators who spoke using their second language exhibited different patterns, with a higher frequency of pauses occurring within the clauses, leading to the conclusion posited by Lennon to be that the speakers seem to be \"planning within clauses as well as in suprasegmental units\", and hence, the occurrence of pauses within clauses and not at the intersection of clauses could well be an indicator distinguishing fluent and confluent speech.\n\nCognitive load is an important predictor of formulaic language. More disfluency is found in longer utterances and when the topic is unfamiliar. In Wood's book, he suggested that when a high degree of cognitive load occurs, such as during expository speech or impromptu descriptions of complex interrelated topics, even native speakers can suffer from disfluency.\n\nFormulaic phrases are uttered more quickly than comparable non-formulaic phrases. Speech rate is closely related to cognitive load. Depending on the cognitive load, the rates of a speaker's utterances are produced either faster or slower, in comparison to a fixed speaking rate which happens usually. For example, speech rate becomes slower when having to make choices that are not anticipated, and tend to accelerate when words are being repeated.\nIn fast conditions, cognitive processes that result in a phonetic plan, fail to keep up with articulation, and thus, the articulation of the existing plan is restarted, resulting in the repetition of words which is more likely to happen but no more likely than fillers.\n\nIn Beattie and Butterworth's (1979) study, low frequency content words and those rated as contextually improbable were preceded by hesitations such as fillers. Speakers, when choosing to use low frequency words in their speech, are aware, and are more likely to be disfluent. This is further supported by Schnadt and Corley where they found that prolongations and fillers increased in words just before multiple-named or low frequency items.\n\nHumans are found to be more disfluent overall when addressing other humans as compared to when addressing machines. More instances of formulaic language is found in dialogues than in monologues. The different roles the addresser played (such as a sister, a daughter or a mother) greatly influences the numbers of disfluencies, particularly, fillers produced, regardless of length or complexity.\n\nThere is a common agreement that disfluencies are accompanied by important modifications both at the segmental and prosodic levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices that are similar to other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints. In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.\n\nWhile formulaic language can serve as a useful cue that more is to come, some people do develop an unconscious dependence on these filler words. When this is the case, it is necessary to correct the problem by making the speaker be aware of their over-reliance on formulaic language production and by training the person to make more efficient use of other verbal strategies. As the individual gains confidence and is less apt to have a need for filler words, the predilection toward formulaic language is then able to gradually diminish.\n\nA study done by Foxtree (2001) showed that both English and Dutch listeners were faster to identify words in a carrier sentence when it was preceded with an \"Uh\" instead of without an \"Uh\", which suggested that different fillers have different effects as they might be conveying different information.\n\nFischer and Brandt-Pook also found out that discourse particles mark thematic breaks, signal the relatedness between the preceding and following utterance, indicate if the speaker has understood the content communicated, and support the formulation process by signalling possible problems in speech management.\n\nWhile fillers might give listeners cues about the information being conveyed, Bailey & Ferreira's study made a distinction between \"Good Cues\" and \"Bad Cues\" in facilitating listener's comprehension. A \"Good Cue\" leads the listener to correctly predict the onset of a new constituent (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase), whereas a \"Bad Cue\" leads the listener to incorrectly predict the onset of a new constituent. \"Good Cue\" make it easier for listeners to process the information they have been presented while \"Bad Cue\" make it harder for listeners process the relevant information.\n\nThere is strong empirical evidence that speakers use formulaic language in similar ways across languages and that formulaic language plays a fundamental role in the structuring of spontaneous speech, as they are used to achieve a better synchronization between interlocutors by announcing upcoming topic changes, delays related to planning load or preparedness problems, as well as speaker's intentions to take/give the floor or to revise/abandon an expression he/she had already presented.\n\nA study conducted by Clark and Foxtree (2002) mentioned that parts of formulaic language, such as fillers, serve a communicative function and are considered integral to the information the speaker tries to convey, although they do not add to the propositional content or the primary message. Instead, they are considered part of a collateral message where the speaker is commenting on her performance. Speakers produce filled pauses (e.g. \"Uh\" or \"Um\") for a variety of reasons, including the intention to discourage interruptions or to gain additional time to plan utterances.\n\nAnother communicative goal includes the attention-impelling function, which explores another purpose of hesitation forms as being to dissociate oneself slightly from the harsh reality of what is to follow. With the use of a beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are \"into distancing\" make use of such formulaic language to create a little distance between themselves and their words, as if it might lessen the impact of their words.\n\nHowever, not all forms of formulaic language are considered appropriate or harmless.There are examples of formulaic language production that lean towards being offensive, for instance, the use of anything considered to be profanity within a given culture.\n\nIn this form, the speech is usually the insertion of swear words within the sentence structure used to convey various ideas. At times, this use of formulaic language comes about due to the individual being greatly distressed or angry. However, there are situations where swear words are inserted unconsciously even if the individual is extremely happy. When the use of swear words is called to the attention of the individual, he or she may not even have been aware of the usage of such formulaic language.\n\nMany patients who suffer from aphasia retain the ability to produce formulaic language, including conversational speech formulas and swear words—in some cases, patients are unable to create words or sentences, but they are able to swear. Also, the ability to pronounce other words can change and evolve during the process of recovery, while pronunciation and use of swear words remain unchanged.\n\nPatients who are affected by transcortical sensory aphasia, a rare form of aphasia, have been found to exhibit formulaic language that is characterised by \"lengthy chunks of memorized material\".\n\nApraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria (muscle weakness affecting speech production) or aphasia (language difficulties related to neurological damage).\n\nOne of the articulatory characteristics of apraxia of speech found in adults includes speech behavior that \"exhibits fewer errors with formulaic language than volitional speech\". Developmental verbal dyspraxia has also been found to have more effect on volitional speech than on formulaic language.\n\nThe characteristics of apraxia of speech include difficulties in imitating speech sounds, imitating no-speech movements, such as sticking out the tongue, groping for sounds, and in severe cases, the inability to produce any sounds, inconsistent errors and a slow rate of speech. However, patients who suffer from apraxia of speech may retain the ability to produce formulaic language, such as \"thank you\" or \"how are you?\". Apraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria, an illness which inflicts muscle weakness affecting speech production), or aphasia, which causes language difficulties related to neurological damage.\n\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the voluntary movements of speech.\nChildren with developmental coordination disorder are unable to formulate certain kinds of voluntary speech; however, they may speak set words or phrases spontaneously, constituting formulaic language—although they may not be able to repeat them on request.\n\n"}
{"id": "571313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571313", "title": "François Coty", "text": "François Coty\n\nFrançois Coty (born Joseph Marie François Spoturno; 3 May 1874 – 25 July 1934) was a French perfumer and businessman. He was a founder of the fascist league \"Solidarité Française\". The company he founded in 1904 is now Coty, Inc., based in New York City.\n\nJoseph Marie François Spoturno was born on 3 May 1874 in Ajaccio, Corsica. He was a descendant of Isabelle Bonaparte, an aunt of Napoleon Bonaparte. His parents were Jean-Baptiste Spoturno and Marie-Adolphine-Françoise Coti, both descendants of Genoese settlers who founded Ajaccio in the 15th century. His parents died when he was a child and the young François was raised by his great-grandmother, Marie Josephe Spoturno, and after her death, by his grandmother, Anna Maria Belone Spoturno, who lived in Marseille.\n\nAfter spending some years in military service, François met a fellow Corsican named Emmanuel Arène. A politician, writer, and future senator, Arène became François's mentor, offering him a job in Paris as his secretary. In Paris, François married Yvonne Alexandrine Le Baron and took the more French-looking name \"Coty\", a variation on his mother's maiden name. He also met Raymond Goery, a pharmacist who made and sold perfume at his Paris shop. Coty began to learn about perfumery from Goery and created his first fragrance, \"Cologne Coty.\"\n\nThrough Arène, Coty met Antoine Chiris, a senator and member of the Chiris family, longtime manufacturers and distributors of perfume. At the Chiris factories in Grasse, Coty studied perfumery and began work on a fragrance, \"La Rose Jacqueminot.\" On his return to Paris in 1904, Coty set off to sell his scents to department stores, boutiques, and barbershops, but initially met with little success. His luck changed when he dropped a bottle of \"La Rose Jacqueminot\" on a countertop at the Grands Magasins du Louvre, the Parisian department store. Attracted by the scent, customers swarmed the area, demanding to buy the perfume. Coty's entire stock was gone in a few minutes and the store offered him a place on the selling floor for his products. The success of \"La Rose\" made Coty a millionaire and established him as a major player in the perfume world.\n\nCoty recognized that an attractive bottle was essential to a perfume's success. Though \"La Rose\" came in a Baccarat bottle, Coty's most famous collaboration was with the great ceramist and jeweler René Lalique. Lalique designed the bottles for Coty's early scents, such as \"Ambre Antique\" and \"L'Origan\", which became bestsellers. He also designed the labels for Coty perfume, which were printed on a gold background with raised lettering. Lalique's designs for Coty were in the Art Nouveau style that was prevalent in the period, and incorporated classic Art Nouveau themes such as nature, flowers, and female figures.\n\nBesides pioneering the concept of bottle design, Coty was responsible for making perfume available to a mass market. Before Coty, perfume was considered a luxury item, affordable only to the very rich. Coty was the first to offer perfumes at many price points. His expensive perfumes, in their Lalique and Baccarat bottles, were aimed at the luxury market, but he also sold perfume in smaller, plainer bottles affordable to middle and working-class women. Coty perfume bottles, though mass-produced, were carefully designed to convey an image of luxury and prestige. Coty also invented the idea of a fragrance set, a gift box containing identically scented items, such as a perfume and matching powder, soap, cream, and cosmetics.\nCoty summed up his approach to business when he said:\n\nGive a woman the best product to be made, market it in the perfect flask, beautiful in its simplicity yet impeccable in its taste, ask a reasonable price for it, and you will witness the birth of a business the size of which the world has never seen.\nIn 1908, Coty relocated his manufacturing headquarters to Suresnes, just outside Paris. He acquired property in the area and began to build what would become \"La cité des Parfums\", a large complex of laboratories and factories that manufactured his products. \"La cité\" had 9,000 employees and was able to manufacture up to 100,000 bottles a day. This allowed Coty to meet the burgeoning demand for his products in France and abroad.\n\nAfter World War I, demand for French perfume grew at a rapid pace. Many American soldiers had been stationed in France during the war and they brought back Coty perfumes to their wives and relatives. Coty realized the importance of the lucrative American market and began to distribute his products in the United States.\n\nIn 1921, with the help of executive Jean Despres, Coty created an American subsidiary in New York to handle the assembly and distribution of its products in the American market. The American offices assembled their own Coty products from raw materials sent by the Parisian factories, thus avoiding the high tariffs on luxury products in the United States. This allowed Coty to offer more competitive prices on its products. Later, additional subsidiaries were established in the United Kingdom and Romania.\n\nCoty soon expanded his product line to include cosmetics and skin care, and expanded his distribution network to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. By 1925, 36 million women worldwide used Coty face powders. His most popular product was his \"Air-spun\" face powder, launched in 1934. Coty collaborated with famous costume designer Léon Bakst to create the look of the Air-spun powder box. It became so popular that soon afterwards Coty launched the Air-spun powder scented with his most popular perfumes, such as \"L'origan\" and \"Emeraude\".\n\nCoty was one of the wealthiest men in France; in 1929, his fortune was estimated at US$34 million. From the beginning, he was determined to use his wealth to gain a foothold in politics and to influence public opinion. In 1923, after a close race, he was elected senator of Corsica, but his victory proved short-lived. The French Senate annulled his election in 1924 after accusations of bribery surfaced. The loss of his senate seat galled Coty and turned him against the Third Republic. \n\nIn 1922, Coty bought \"Le Figaro\", a prestigious conservative newspaper with an upper-class readership. Against the will of its staff, Coty changed the newspaper's name to \"Figaro\" and moved its headquarters to the Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées. Under Coty's ownership, the journal, once moderately conservative, adopted an antisemitic extreme right-wing stance on politics and the economy. \"Figaro\" printed many fierce antisemitic and anti-Communist articles, and was notorious for its strong opposition to the government. Coty's extreme opinions soon alienated his readers and \"Figaro\"'s circulation went into free fall.\n\nIn 1926, Coty worked with Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré to create a fund to stabilize the French currency. He lent 100 million francs to the French government, but never collected on the debt. Despite his largesse, Coty was left out of the group appointed to oversee the fund, possibly because of his controversial political views. Disappointed once again by the French government, Coty pursued its downfall. \n\nIn 1928, Coty launched \"L'Ami du peuple\", a newspaper aimed at the working class. Priced much lower than other competing newspapers, it soon gained a huge readership. In \"L'Ami du peuple\", Coty, an admirer of Benito Mussolini, argued for the overthrow of the French Republic and the establishment of a Bonapartist or fascist government in its place.\n\nCoty was also a fierce anti-Semite. In a long series of articles in \"L'Ami du peuple\", he accused Jewish bankers and financiers of enacting \"bloody, rapacious, inhuman, tyrannical policies\" that had ruined the world. He blamed Jews for establishing communism, for robbing France of its pre-war wealth and glory, and for creating a worldwide economic depression. According to Coty, Jews had allied themselves with Germany and were responsible for its increasing militarization. His incendiary writings did not go unnoticed; on 1 July 1933, he was found guilty in court for libel against Jewish war veterans' groups in France.\n\nCoty gave financial support to numerous far-right organizations, such as the \"Faisceau\", the French fascist party, and \"Croix-de-Feu\", a World War I veterans organization; however, he ended his support after a few years. In 1933, he founded \"Solidarité Française\", a fascist, paramilitary organization headed by himself and his friend Maurice d'Hartoy. The group peaked during the 6 February 1934 crisis where there was a huge demonstration and later a major riot in front of the Palais Bourbon, when it attempted, in alliance with other far right leagues, to topple the Third Republic. The group was outlawed in 1936 by the Popular Front government.\n\nThe Stade François Coty in Ajaccio was named after him.\n\nCoty and Yvonne had two children, Roland and Christiane. Despite his marriage, Coty was well known for his numerous mistresses and illegitimate children. He was known to house his lovers in Paris' Hotel Astoria, and to lavish money and gifts on them. His first mistress then second wife was Henriette Dieudé, a former Coty shopgirl who bore him five children. Coty's love life was widely publicized in the French liberal newspapers, to the detriment of his public image.\n\nCoty had a penchant for acquiring and remodeling property. His first major purchase was the Château de Longchamp in 1906, near the Bois de Boulogne, once the property of the famous French civic planner, Georges Haussmann. Coty used it as a laboratory in which to design his fragrances, bottles, packaging, and advertisements. The renovated Longchamp included a glass dome by Lalique and a stone tower designed by Gustave Eiffel.\n\nIn 1912, he bought the Château d'Artigny near Tours and set out to rebuild it. Over a period of 20 years, Coty rebuilt d'Artigny in a grandiose fashion, installing custom-built kitchens, ballrooms, and a large fresco depicting himself, his family, friends, and even his mistresses. During the 1920s, he resided with his family in a mansion at Avenue Raphael in the Bois de Boulogne, which Coty had rebuilt with etched-glass panels, a stair rail, and a glass ceiling designed by Lalique.\n\nCoty's most famous acquisition was the hunting pavilion of Louveciennes near Saint-Germain-en-Laye, designed by Claude Nicholas Ledoux for Madame du Barry, mistress of Louis XV. Coty had Louveciennes rebuilt to match Ledoux's original plan, but enlarged it to include a perfume laboratory and a third story. He also bought the Château Saint-Hélène in Nice, the Villa Namouna in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, and Le Scudo in Ajaccio, Corsica. Though he owned multiple large residences, Coty often lived in a hotel on the Champs-Élysées. He was something of a recluse, disliking crowds of any kind, and hiding behind his public image.\n\nAfter 1929, Coty's fortunes began to diminish considerably. Both \"Figaro\" and \"L'Ami du peuple\" had been losing money for years and his perfume business had been affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash. But it was his divorce that most contributed to his financial ruin.\n\nIn 1929, Yvonne divorced Coty and married Leon Cotnareanu. Their divorce settlement stipulated that Coty would pay his ex-wife several millions of francs in three installments, but in 1931 Coty defaulted on the last payment, citing financial hardship. Over the next few years, divorce courts ruled in favor of Yvonne, and granted her ownership of most of Coty's fortune and his newspapers.\n\nHe died in 1934 at his home in Louveciennes, of pneumonia and complications after an aneurysm.\n\nIn 1963, Yvonne sold Coty Inc. to pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, with the stipulation that no member of the Coty family would be involved in the company. Under Pfizer, the company began to distribute its perfumes almost exclusively through drugstores, instead of in department stores as it had previously done. In 1992, Pfizer sold Coty to the German company Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH, which owns it today.\n\nFrançois Coty was a pioneer in the field of perfumery, creating countless masterpieces, many now preserved in the archives of the Osmothèque. His most notable perfumes include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20587324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20587324", "title": "Gundam Universal Century technology", "text": "Gundam Universal Century technology\n\nUniversal Century technology are technologies from the Universal Century timeline of the \"Gundam\" anime metaseries. Although they are only fictional technologies, they form the basics of the Real Robot genre of anime and are influencing real life academic research and different anime series.\n\nThe Universal Century technologies debuted in Gundam Century, written by editors, academy and studios hired by \"OUT\" magazine at that time, later part of the book was endorsed by Sunrise and Bandai, and some of the authors of the articles within \"Gundam Century\" became official editors and writers of Gundam mechanics. A main part of the book surrounds the discussion on real-life technologies including space habitats and mass driver. Later, following the trend of militaristic and technological interest in the community, \"Gundam Sentinel Special Edition\" included a section called imidam 0093 (Innovative Mobile Suit Information Dictionary, Annual Series, intentionally using an m at the end to reference Gunda\"m\"), subtitled \"Basic Knowledge of Gundam Mechanics\". Written by mechanical designer Katoki Hajime, summarized both in- and out-of-universe technologies of the Universal Century, sourcing from \"Gundam Century\", \"Gun Sight\", \"VF-1 Valkyrie\", \"MS Graphical Guide 1~3\", \"MSV Technical & History 1~3\". Gundam Officials has collected this information and has presented it along with plot history and character summaries in an encyclopedic form, and \"MS Encyclopedia 2003\" has a short technical summary of these technologies in its first section before going into the lists of mobile weapons in different series, which earlier editions only have.\n\nAlthough fictional technologies seems to carry no real-life significance, these technologies are referred to in almost all of the series of Universal Century. They became a normal reference of the serial story and attracted publishers to publish books on them. These technological settings have also since influenced a lot of anime and manga to have their own technological background to a certain degree. Although it could be viewed as following the \"Star Wars\" trend, nothing similar has started before the 1981 publishing of Gundam Century. Bandai (with its branch Sunrise) noticed the tradition and has hired writers to write articles for other Gundam series too. In the Cosmic Era time line, one of the authors of Gundam Century articles (while still a high school student at that time), Shigeru Morita, who had become a regular employee of Bandai, was assigned to write these kinds of technological articles, possibly a method used by the company to attract Universal Century techno fans to watch the new series. The series' technology is now serving as the inspiration for academic research in different fields, which could include moon settlements and mega-particle cannon.\n\nThe latest robot technology in Japan is also influenced by Gundam, due to its fictional technologies' being highly adapted from real-world science, and the Universal Century technologies including space colonies and mobile suits are also viewed academically as to what they can do in real life.\n\nDuring the Tokyo International Film Festival 2015, Director Tomino first saw Minovsky Particles as a dramatic device, \"Because destroying enemies on the other side of Earth with missiles would not be dramatic, to make people meet and fight in space, ranged weapons have to be rendered useless.\" and claimed that he did not think of Engineering and Electronics at all. While researcher(Associate Professor in University of Tsukuba) and media artist Yoichi Ochiai viewed this in the science angle and said that even currently, if computers are not working right, things will get really weak, mixing in analogue in the machine is a correct choice and the setting is excellent. Ochiai also mentioned the idea in his book \"The Age of Magic\" saying \"The people using computers has a greater power of understanding\", and admitted that this view is influenced by Newtype in Gundam.\n\nThe space colony technology in Universal Century is referenced from the real world projects proposed by Gerard K. O'Neill.\n\nIn the Universal Century (U.C.) timeline, space colonies are placed at the five Earth-Moon Lagrangian points. In most cases, a Lagrangian point is home to more than one group of space colonies. Individual colony pairs are known as Bunches, and a group of colonies that occupy a Lagrangian point are known collectively as a Side. Because Sides sometimes share a single Lagrangian point, it is possible to have two Sides in close orbit to one another. Most colonies in the Universal Century are O'Neill \"Island 3\" type colony cylinders, yet a few early built Bernal sphere (Island 1) and Stanford torus colonies are still in function, but most are changed to space stations or discarded. Side 3's colonies are identical in size and shape to the Island 3 design, but doubled the habitable area by removing the large window strips of the Island 3.\n\nThese technologies are the basic reasoning for the Universal Century's having mobile suits as the main battle units, replacing space fighters. This has influenced later series to include their own reasoning to rationalize the existence of humanoid fighting vehicles.\n\nOne of the most famous rationale being used is the AMBAC system, it is referenced in various other series including Macross. Within the Gundam series, the AMBAC system term is also used in \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\". Active Mass Balance Auto-Control (AMBAC) is a fundamental technology that allows for thrusterless manoeuvring in the zero-G environment of space by mobile suits by means of precise movement control of their limbs in the Gundam universe. AMBAC works by leveraging Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion (when there's an action there is an equal and opposite reaction) with regard to inertia to effect changes in direction. Mobile suits performing AMBAC motions would presumably move similarly to present-day astronauts performing extra-vehicular activity: both typically having roughly similar body structure, their use of that mass to control their rotation would presumably be similar, even if calculated by different means. AMBAC is by its nature limited to re-orienting the unit about its center of mass, and is not a substitute for propulsion. It is often used in conjunction with the propulsion system to quickly turn the unit and shorten aiming speed as well as directing the main thrusters. The system is similar in principle to the momentum wheel system used in present-day satellites, though obviously more complex and allows the centre of mass move outside of the unit.\n\nBinders are technological instruments that provide extra control for the AMBAC systems. The idea is simple: \"If four limbs can manoeuvre the unit better than none, why not equip them with 5 or more?\" The resulting advancement is the tail binder.\n\nA cousin to the tail binder is the wing binder, equipped on most transformable mobile suits with waverider mode as wings. The system made use of the wings' mobility for the transformation during mobile suit mode as AMBAC limbs and further increasing the number of limbs for the AMBAC system. The tail binder is also seen on later models of military aircraft and space fighters in U.C.0088, on the FF-08 Wyvern.\n\nThe Minovsky physics is the fundamental technological advancement in the Universal Century series, as all Beam weaponry, nuclear technology and defensive measures are based upon this fictional physics. According to the \"Gundam Century\", \"MS encyclopedia 2003\" and Gundam Officials, the Minovsky Physics all started from the invention of the then seemingly impossible idea of a nuclear fusion reactor that has a higher theoretical efficiency than classical physics, due to the Minovsky particle.\n\nThe Minovsky-Ionesco reactor was named after its fictional inventors, Dr. Y.T. Minovsky and Dr. Ionesco. This reactor was \"radical\" because it was the first \"clean\" nuclear reactor, emitting zero neutron radiation. The nuclear equation was:\n\nThis is essentially the same equation as used in classical physics, with the addition of the fictional Minovsky particle as a catalyst, instead of a muon.\n\nAccording to the official guide of Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Century and Gundam Officials, the Minovsky Physics Society, while working on the reactor, encountered a strange electromagnetic wave effect in U.C.0065 within the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor that could not be explained by conventional physics. Within the next few years, they identified the cause: a new elementary particle generated by the helium-3 reaction on the inner wall of the reactor, which was named the or \"M\" particle. The Minovsky particle has near-zero rest mass - though, like any particle, its mass increases to reflect its potential or kinetic energy - and can carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. When scattered in open space or in the air, the repulsive forces between charged Minovsky particles cause them to spontaneously align into a regular cubic lattice structure called an I-field. An I-field lattice will slowly expand and scatter into space; however, after dense interference it will take approximately 29 days before the region can support normal electromagnetic communication again.\n\nThe main use of the Minovsky particle was in combat and communication. When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves and radio waves. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged. This became known as the \"Minovsky Effect\".\n\nThe disruption of electromagnetic radiation is due to the small lattice of the I-field creating fringes that long wavelengths cannot penetrate, and that diffract wavelengths that have similar distance with the fringes. This diffraction and polarization process disrupts the electromagnetic waves.\n\nThe only counter measure to the \"M\" particle in the series was to install bulky and expensive shielding on all electronic equipment, but only to counteract the effect it had on electronic circuitry. While this could be done for space ships and naval ships, this ruled out the use of precision guided weapons, such as guided missiles. Due to this, the military use of Minovsky particles ushered in a new era of close-range combat. This is the primary reason for the birth of the Zeon close-combat weapon: the mobile suit.\n\nAccording to the timeline deduced by the Gundam Officials, in UC 0071, Zeon researchers created the Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactor. Instead of the conventional magnetic field, this improved version of the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor used an I-field to confine and compress the reactor fuel, triggering a fusion reaction. The Minovsky particles produced as a byproduct of the helium-3 fusion reaction were recycled to keep that reaction going. The Minovsky particles that form the I-field lattice also helped catalyze the fusion reaction, in a process similar to the muon-catalyzed fusion investigated by real-world scientists during the 1950s. This super-efficient design was only a fifth as large as an equivalently powerful Minovsky-Ionesco reactor; for this reason, it was adopted for use on mobile suits as the standard power plant.\n\nThe fictional weapons of the Universal Century were described to be utilizing the degeneracy of the Minovsky Particle by compressing Minovsky particles in high pressure chambers and firing out the degenerated Minovsky particles (from the fusing of a positively charged and a negatively charged one) which carries high energy and mass from the degeneration of the matter.\n\nSmaller versions of the mega particle cannon are presented in the series, the most famous being the Beam rifle used by the titular mobile suit RX-78 Gundam, which utilizes a technology called E-cap. The mobile suit does not need to spend lots of energy in compressing the Minovsky particles; instead, most of the compression was done by the mother-ship and the mobile suit only needed to provide minimum energy for triggering the final degeneration energy.\n\nIt should be noted that E-cap technology appears outside of UC continuity in \"\".\n\nAccording to \"Gundam Sentinel Special Edition\", the beam smart gun is designed to bend the output beam by up to 20 degrees. In the original \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" series, Char Aznable commented that the way to avoid a beam rifle is to avoid its being pointed at you. As such, a gun that does not need to be pointed directly at the target is more dangerous.\n\nFunnels are essentially funnel-shaped drone units that are designed to be remotely controlled by a Newtype pilot. They are equipped with a small beam cannon and an energy cell to propel the funnel when it is operating. A Newtype pilot is able to control these funnels with great precision via a psycommu system, allowing him/her to conduct BVR attacks on a target from almost all directions without having to establish visual contact, making a funnel-equipped mobile suit extremely deadly. When the funnels are not in use, they are attached to the mother suit's surface hardpoints for recharging. All Zeon funnel-equipped units have the ability to recharge funnels, but the Earth Federation Forces were very slow in adopting the technology.\n\nLater variants include Funnel missiles that are guided missiles using funnel-like remote control designs employed in the story \"\".\n\nThe new DACS (Divert & Attitude Control System) created by the Japan Self-Defense Forces in December, 2006 was quoted as an attempt to create a funnel system in real life by Gizmodo Japan.\n\nThe word Newtype first came into being when Zeon Zum Deikun, the fictional character, founder of the space colony-based Principality of Zeon, created his philosophy: mankind was destined to leave the Earth for space, where they would evolve into a new stage of evolution, called the Newtype.\n\nAs Newtypes began to grow in number during and following the One Year War, the psycommu (psychic communicator) system was invented, which allowed these Newtypes to control wireless weapons known as bits and funnels, and even mobile suits, through thought alone. The device detects and amplifies the user's brainwaves, and a sophisticated computer system enables the user to manipulate weapons by using his/her mind.\n\nThe Psycoframe is a later technology that builds the psycommu into the nanomachines within the metal frame of a mobile suit. This allows a Newtype pilot to control the mobile suit as if it were his/her own body. A \"Psychoframe\" can project a Psychofield, which can happen when two \"Psychoframes\" are near, this \"Psychofield\" is a space where the human consciousness can manipulate the world regardless of the laws of psychics.\n\nOther Newtype technologies are the Bio-Sensor system, the Quasi-psycommu system, the Neo-psycommu system, the Bio-computer, the EXAM System, the Angel Halo fortress, and the \"NT-D\" system.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31720061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31720061", "title": "Hayandose", "text": "Hayandose\n\nHayandose is a cultural category used to express membership and belonging among Zapotec migrants, described by cultural anthropologist Lourdes Gutiérrez-Nájera. Hayandose entails a process of creating ethnically-marked spaces among migrants in an effort to combat feelings of marginalization and displacement in a host country. This concept may be compared to the notion of Native Hubs developed by anthropologist Renya Ramirez to describe how urban Native Americans negotiate a transnational existence. \n“Hayandose”, in \"Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America\", examines the place of indigenous people within the broader scope of Latino Studies and also within the national political landscape. As argued in the text, indigenous subjects do not easily fit the category of \"Latino\" used to describe national identities; for example, Guatemalan, Mexican, Ecuadorian. At the same time, indigenous migrants often are targets of racism and prejudice directed towards them. The essay is in conversation with other essays in the volume that interrogate the ways that Latinos carve out niches for themselves and thrive in urban spaces within the United States. As the essay Hayandose argues, such established spaces allow migrants, struggling with separation from their home country and racist stigmatization in their host country, to engage in a “meaningful practice of belonging” in which they are able to express their cultural membership. Hayandose marks the point at which people finally feel as though they belong through the discovery of themselves in a foreign place.\n\nGutiérrez-Nájera uses Zapotecs as an example of migrants who originate from Oaxaca, México and form their own spaces of belonging in the United States, specifically in Los Angeles. The Zapotecs that Gutiérrez-Najera writes about are from Yalálag, a small rural town in the heart of Oaxaca. The community of Yalaltecos in Los Angeles comes together collectively and participates in festivals, ceremonies, \"tandas\" and other small gatherings where they can gossip in Zapotec, share food, dance, financially and emotionally support one another, and engage in other customs and traditions from their place of origin. The existence and practice of customs and traditions that were once thought to be exclusive to Yalálag, but that have now permeated American society, demonstrates the transnational character of Yalaltecos indigeneity that makes possible the process of Hayandose through the seizure and declaration of these ethnically-marked spaces. Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles have invoked their cultural identity hundreds of miles from home and have used it as a tool to resist the push for assimilation and marginalization within the United States. Therefore, the transmission and continuity of culture across national borders are essential for Yalaltecos to mark their own space and ultimately find themselves in a hostile environment far from their home country. With this new-found sense of belonging, the opportunity for “rally[ing] for indigenous rights and the development of hometown communities in Oaxaca, as well as to organize in the United States around immigrant legislation” no longer remains out of reach. This claim is reaffirmed by another scholar, Annice Jacoby, who argues that the affirmation of transnational identities allows “borders of ownership, space, and social agency” to be challenged. Once a migrant \"se hayan\", or finds themselves, they have gained a sense of belonging by affirming their cultural membership and confronting their marginalization and displacement within a space collectively or individually marked as their own in the host country. This phenomenon then acts as a bridge for migrants to gain social ascendancy and acknowledgment that has the potential to improve lives in the home and host country alike.\n\nHayandose is also reflective of a contemporary cultural process known as de/territorialization. When emigrants moved to the United States they and their culture became deterritorialized. Once they moved, however, they are simultaneously reterritorialized as they begin to form a space for themselves and practice their customs and traditions as they did in their home country. The theory of de/territorialization can be seen in the Yalalteco community in Los Angeles through the perseverance of their cultural solidarity from Oaxaca to California, and the maintenance of community ties that traverse national boundaries. The theories of de/territorialization and Hayandose entail the movement of culture from one place to another, and thus reveal the “multiple centers” culture can obtain, as opposed to just a single \"center\" being the place of origin. Because migration causes displacement among emigrants who are forced to adapt to a new environment, culture, and way of living, bringing the culture and customs that they practiced in their places of origin to their new location helps to combat these negative feelings and also adds an additional “center” to their particular culture. In regards to Gutiérrez-Nájera’s example, Yalaltecos adopted Los Angeles as an additional “center” where their customs and traditions could be expressed as they would have been in Yalálag. This sharing of cultures creates a cultural flow between the United States and Oaxacan communities that have allowed emigrants not to lose their culture and sense of who they are, but to maintain it and ultimately use it as a powerful tool to engage in practices of belonging that resist sentiments of marginalization and displacement in new locations.\n"}
{"id": "10621538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10621538", "title": "Henosis", "text": "Henosis\n\nHenosis () is the classical Greek word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\" or \"unity.\" In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism, the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One (Τὸ Ἕν), the Source, or Monad. The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek mystery religions as well as parallels in Eastern philosophy. It is further developed in the Corpus Hermeticum, in Christian theology, Alevism, soteriology and mysticism, and is an important factor in the historical development of monotheism during Late Antiquity.\n\nThe term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of \"union\" or \"unity\".\n\nHenosis, or primordial unity, is rational and deterministic, emanating from indeterminism an uncaused cause. Each individual as a microcosm reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the macrocosm. In mimicking the demiurge (divine mind), one unites with The One or Monad. Thus the process of unification, of \"The Being\" and \"The One,\" is called henosis, the culmination of which is deification.\n\nHenosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward no thought (nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). As is specified in the writings of Plotinus on Henology, one can reach a tabula rasa, a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. \n\nWithin the Enneads of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge. The Monad or dunamis (force) is of one singular expression (the will or the one is the good), all is contained in the Monad and the Monad is all (pantheism). All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see monism). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the dyad called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul (World Soul).\n\nPlotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical Idealism.\n\nWithin the works of Iamblichus of Chalcis (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of theurgy. By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind. One goes through a series of theurgy or rituals that unites the initiate to the Monad. These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or cosmos. They also mimic the actions of the demiurge as the creator of the material world. Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person. Thus one without conflict internal or external is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but also in western mysticism, \"henosis\" can be acquired by theoria, hesychasm and contemplative prayer. Yet, the concept of theosis, or deification, differs from henosis, since created beings cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or ousia.\n\n\n.group || et/float.innerHtml\n\n\n"}

Himeko would like nothing more than to be a proper, feminine young lady, like her older sister Aiko, so that she could approach her secret crush, Hasekura.\n\nOne night, Himeko is unexpectedly approached by a girl, who is a near-mirror image of herself, floating outside of her bedroom window. She discovers that the girl is Princess Erika of the Magical Kingdom. Erika explains that people in the Magical Kingdom have an exact counterpart in the Human World and that, in order to prove herself worthy as a princess, she must give Himeko a magical item that she has created. Himeko is allowed the use of this item, a red hair ribbon, for one year to determine whether it is useful, and consequently, if Erika will inherit the crown.\n\nThe ribbon allows Himeko to transform into anyone in the Human World for one hour. If Himeko is unable to recite the magic incantation in reverse before the hour is up, she will be trapped in that person’s form for the rest of her life. She is unable to reveal the secret of the ribbon and the existence of the Magical Kingdom to anyone. If she does, her memory will be erased as punishment. Assisting her with this is her stuffed lion, Pokota, whom the ribbon brought to life. Erika will watch her in the Magic Kingdom through her crystal ball for one year, at which point the ribbon will be returned.\n\nIn authoring Hime-chan's Ribbon, Megumi Mizusawa used themes common to magical girl manga. The concept of being able to transform into other people had been a feature of Himitsu no Akko-chan (1962).\n\n\n and \n\n\nTo perform magic several different incantations are recited. When Hime-chan first receives the ribbon she is told to recite \"Parallel, Parallel, \"(person's name)\" ni nare\". After the excitement of transformation Hime-chan dismisses Erika's important instruction to recite this incantation saying \"Parallel\" backwards, \"Rurerapa rurerapa motono sugatani nare.\" which causes her to almost be caught as the Principal of the school forever. Pokota had to remind her of the correct way of pronouncing \"Rurerapa\" to avoid this.\n\nJennifer B from THEM Anime reviews stated that Hime-chan's Ribbon is \"a fun, cute series that's worth watching if you like magical girl shows\" and \"Hime-chan herself is a likable character\".

{"id": "1676362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1676362", "title": "History of anthropology", "text": "History of anthropology\n\nHistory of anthropology'scientific word during the Renaissance, has always meant \"the study (or science) of man\". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under Anthropology.\n\nThe term \"anthropology\" ostensibly is a produced compound of Greek \"anthrōpos\", \"human being\" (understood to mean \"humankind\" or \"humanity\"), and a supposed -λογία \"-logia\", \"study\". The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin \"anthropologia\" of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word \"anthropologie\", transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the -logy suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., \"the study (or science) of\".\n\nThe mixed character of Greek \"anthropos\" and Latin \"-logia\" marks it as New Latin. There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος (logos) has that meaning. James Hunt attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the Anthropological Society of London as president and founder, 1863. He did find an \"anthropologos\" from Aristotle in the standard ancient Greek Lexicon, which he says defines the word as \"speaking or treating of man\". This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: \"i.e. fond of personal conversation\". If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.\n\nThe lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in \"–logia\", enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix. The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant. The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing \"–logia\" to \"logos\", from \"legein\", \"to collect\". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The American Heritage Dictionary says: \"(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos.\" Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os > log-ia (a \"qualitative abstract\")\n\nThe Renaissance origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves functionalists and others in history so classified now.\n\nMarvin Harris, a historian of anthropology, begins \"The Rise of Anthropological Theory\" with the statement that anthropology is \"the science of history\". He is not suggesting that history be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and prehistory, or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in \"history of anthropology\", would seem to imply. He is using \"history\" in a special sense, as the founders of cultural anthropology used it: \"the natural history of society\", in the words of Herbert Spencer, or the \"universal history of mankind\", the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment objective. Just as natural history comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.\n\nAccording to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are nomothetic; that is, they provide laws. He intends \"to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man\". He is looking for \"a general theory of history\". His perception of the laws: \"I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism\", he calls cultural materialism, which he also details in \"Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.\"\n\nElsewhere he refers to \"my theories of historical determinism\", defining the latter: \"By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences.\" The use of \"tends to\" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict determinism, given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: \"free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life.\"\n\nHarris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are abstractions from empirical evidence: \"...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals ...\" Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.\n\nHe borrows terms from linguistics: just as a phon-etic system is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a phon-emic system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be emic and etic. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: \"... etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...\" He makes a further distinction between synchronic and diachronic. Synchronic (\"same time\") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic (\"through time\") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a \"processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy\" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data. Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.\n\nHarris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the \"story\" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary three-age system, the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.\n\nEriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being \"travel writing or social philosophy\", going on to assert \"It is only when these aspects ... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears.\" This process began to occur in the 18th century of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nMany anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of Classical Greece and Classical Rome; for example, John Myres in \"Herodotus and Anthropology\" (1908); E. E. Sikes in \"The Anthropology of the Greeks\" (1914); Clyde Kluckhohn in \"Anthropology and the Classics\" (1961), and many others. An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.\n\nHerodotus was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the Greco-Persian Wars that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed \"the History\" or \"the Histories\". His first line begins: \"These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus ...\"\n\nThe Achaemenid Empire, deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the Bosphorus using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.\n\nThese \"researches\" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, \"Father of History\" (\"pater historiae\"), had been conferred on him probably by Cicero. Pointing out that John Myres in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, James M. Redfield asserts: \"Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology.\" Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes \"theorizing\". Redfield translates it as \"tourism\" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: \"diaitia\", material goods such as houses and consumables; \"ethea\", the mores or customs; and \"nomoi\", the authoritative precedents or laws.\n\nThe Roman historian, Tacitus, wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient Celtic and Germanic peoples.\n\nAnother candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval Persian scholar Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons. Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense. He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and especially South Asia. Biruni's tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the Muslim world through to Ibn Khaldun's work in the fourteenth century.\n\nMedieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered \"different\" from themselves in terms of geography. John of Plano Carpini reported of his stay among the Mongols. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.\n\nMarco Polo's systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space. Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name \"the father of modern anthropology\".\n\nThe first use of the term \"anthropology\" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in Richard Harvey's 1593 \"Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history\", which, includes the passage: \"Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology.\"\n\nMany scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the Age of Enlightenment (1715–89), a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the first European colonization wave. The traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology, and sociology then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the social sciences, of which anthropology was a part.\n\nIt took Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, \"Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View\" (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy. Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own. He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.\nDevelopments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of Classics and Egyptology informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as Johann Gottfried Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey, whose work formed the basis for the \"culture concept\", which is central to the discipline.\n\nInstitutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of natural history (expounded by authors such as Buffon) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the \"human primitives\" overseen by colonial administrations.\n\nThere was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.\n\nEarly anthropology was divided between proponents of unilinealism, who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as diffusionism. Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.\n\nMarxist anthropologist Eric Wolf once characterized anthropology as \"the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences\". Understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.\nScholarly traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.\n\nThese intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of modernity: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels observed in the 1840s:\n\nIronically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.\n\nInstitutionally anthropology emerged from natural history (expounded by authors such as Buffon). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that Lewis Henry Morgan could write monographs on both \"The League of the Iroquois\" and \"The American Beaver and His Works\". This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in natural history museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European chauvinism, since its relationship to imperialism was and is complex.\n\nDrawing on the methods of the natural sciences as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured \"participant-observation\"—and drawing on the new theory of evolution through natural selection, they proposed the scientific study of a new object: \"humankind\", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept \"culture\", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus \"Homo\"—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, \"culture\" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.\n\nAs academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the \"other\".\n\nMuseums such as the British Museum weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the New Imperialism period, starting in the 1870s, zoos became unattended \"laboratories\", especially the so-called \"ethnological exhibitions\" or \"Negro villages\". Thus, \"savages\" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called \"human zoos\". For example, in 1906, Congolese pygmy Ota Benga was put by anthropologist Madison Grant in a cage in the Bronx Zoo, labelled \"the missing link\" between an orangutan and the \"white race\"—Grant, a renowned eugenicist, was also the author of \"The Passing of the Great Race\" (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of scientific racism, which first formulation may be found in Arthur de Gobineau's \"An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races\" (1853–55). In 1931, the Colonial Exhibition in Paris still displayed Kanaks from New Caledonia in the \"indigenous village\"; it received 24 million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such \"human zoos\".\n\nAnthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled \"A Hundred Years of Anthropology\". At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced Polynesian migrations across the Pacific Ocean for instance—although some of them believed it originated in Egypt. Finally, the concept of race was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.\n\nEdward Burnett Tylor (2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) and James George Frazer (1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern social anthropology in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to Mexico, both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.\n\nTylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of \"uniformity of mankind\". Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of cultural diffusionism, stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: \"independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race to another\".\n\nTylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of culture as \"that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society\". However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.\n\nTylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of animism as the earliest stage, and noting that \"religion\" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of \"The Golden Bough\", analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in fieldwork, nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.\n\nToward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present (synchronic analysis, rather than diachronic or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. Cambridge University financed a multidisciplinary expedition to the Torres Strait Islands in 1898, organized by Alfred Cort Haddon and including a physician-anthropologist, William Rivers, as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.\n\nA decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student Bronisław Malinowski (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of fieldwork in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in New Guinea. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.\n\nHe made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by \"British\" anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\" (1922) advocated an approach to fieldwork that became standard in the field: getting \"the native's point of view\" through participant observation. Theoretically, he advocated a functionalist interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.\n\nBritish social anthropology had an expansive moment in the Interwar period, with key contributions coming from the Polish-British Bronisław Malinowski and Meyer Fortes\n\nA. R. Radcliffe-Brown also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply \"The Andaman Islanders\") that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as structural functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French structuralism, which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)\n\nMalinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for \"Social Anthropology\" by teaching at universities across the British Commonwealth. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include \"The Nuer,\" by Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, and \"The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,\" by Meyer Fortes; well-known edited volumes include \"African Systems of Kinship and Marriage\" and \"African Political Systems.\"\n\nMax Gluckman, together with many of his colleagues at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute and students at Manchester University, collectively known as the Manchester School, took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.\n\nIn Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it \"contributed to the erosion of Christianity, the growth of cultural relativism, an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of diachronic modes of analysis with synchronic, all of which are central to modern culture.\"\n\nLater in the 1960s and 1970s, Edmund Leach and his students Mary Douglas and Nur Yalman, among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of Lévi-Strauss; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.\n\nIn countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from physical anthropology and primatology, which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of Classics, Egyptology, and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of folklore, museum studies, human geography, sociology, social relations, ethnic studies, cultural studies, and social work.\n\nAnthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the Financial crisis of 2007–2010 to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. Gillian Tett, a Cambridge University trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the Financial Times is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.\n\nCanadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, Jesuit missionaries such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid \"Socio-cultural\" anthropology.\n\nTrue anthropology began with a Government department: the Geological Survey of Canada, and George Mercer Dawson (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.\n\nAnthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian Edward Sapir.\n\nAnthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.\n\nMost commentators consider Marcel Mauss (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist Émile Durkheim, to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's \"Année Sociologique\" group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.\n\nTwo works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: \"Essay on the Gift,\" a seminal analysis of exchange and reciprocity, and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.\n\nThroughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as surrealism and primitivism, which drew on ethnography for inspiration. Marcel Griaule and Michel Leiris are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as \"ethnologie\" was restricted to museums, such as the Musée de l'Homme founded by Paul Rivet, and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of folklore.\n\nAbove all, Claude Lévi-Strauss helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of structuralism exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as Maurice Godelier and Françoise Héritier. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories (CNRS) rather than academic departments in universities\n\nOther influential writers in the 1970s include Pierre Clastres, who explains in his books on the Guayaki tribe in Paraguay that \"primitive societies\" actively oppose the institution of the state. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of authority as a separate function from society. The leader is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups (\"international relations\") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.\n\nThe most important French social theorist since Foucault and Lévi-Strauss is Pierre Bourdieu, who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyle of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.\nFrom its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of Native American societies. \nCultural anthropology in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology, men such as John Wesley Powell and Frank Hamilton Cushing.\n\nLate-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice Roger B. Taney who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were \"beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race ... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.\n\nIt was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period \"that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'\". Charles Caldwell, Samuel George Morton, Samuel A. Cartwright, George Gliddon, Josiah C. Nott, and Louis Agassiz, and even South Carolina Governor James Henry Hammond were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.\n\nThe high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled \"Types of Mankind\", published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, Frederick Douglass (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled \"The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered\", Douglass argued that \"by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities ... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen\" (p. 287).\n\nLewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881), a lawyer from Rochester, New York, became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the Iroquois. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as Edward Tylor), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from \"savagery\", to \"barbarism\", to \"civilization\". He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.\n\nFranz Boas established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.\n\nInfluenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct \"cultures,\" rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little \"civilization\" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the natural sciences, were not possible.\n\nIn doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas. Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called \"Four Field Approach\" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.\nBoas used his positions at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie, Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict, who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on Indo-European languages.\n\nThe publication of Alfred Kroeber's textbook, \"Anthropology,\" marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.\n\nThough such works as \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" and \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\" remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by Ralph Linton, and Mead was limited to her offices at the AMNH.\n\nAnthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe (Italy, Greece, and the successors to the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on cross-cultural comparison and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.\n\nIn the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).\n\nIn this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.\n\nIn Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the folklore called \"laographia\" (laography), in the form of \"a science of the interior\", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science \"of the outside\". \n\nIn Italy, the development of ethnology and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning, but nonetheless included important researchers and thinkers like Ernesto De Martino.\n\nGermany and Norway are the countries that showed the most division and conflict between scholars focusing on domestic socio-cultural issues and scholars focusing on \"other\" societies.. Some German and Austrian scholars have increased cultural anthropology as both legal anthropology regarding \"other\" societies and anthropology of Western civilization.\n\nThe development of world anthropologies has followed different trajectories.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 Marvin Harris published his \"The Rise of Anthropological Theory\", presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and George W. Stocking, Jr., established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52239", "title": "Hoax", "text": "Hoax\n\nA hoax is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It is distinguishable from errors in observation or judgment, rumors, urban legends, pseudosciences, and April Fools' Day events that are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes.\n\nAlthough practical jokes have likely existed for thousands of years, one of the earliest recorded hoaxes in history was the drummer of Tedworth in 1661. The communication of hoaxes can be accomplished in almost any manner that a fictional story can be communicated: in person, via word of mouth, via words printed on paper, and so on. As the technology of communication has advanced, the speed at which hoaxes spread has also advanced: a rumor about a ghostly drummer, spread by word of mouth, will impact a relatively small area at first, then grow gradually. However, hoaxes could also be spread via chain letters, which became easier as the cost of mailing a letter dropped. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century brought down the cost of a mass-produced books and pamphlets, and the rotary printing press of the 19th century reduced the price even further (see yellow journalism). During the 20th century, the hoax found a mass market in the form of supermarket tabloids, and by the 21st century there were fake news websites which spread hoaxes via social networking websites (in addition to the use of email for a modern type of chain letter).\n\nThe English philologist Robert Nares (1753–1829) says that the word \"hoax\" was coined in the late 18th century as a contraction of the verb \"hocus\", which means \"to cheat,\" \"to impose upon\" or (according to Merrian-Webster) \"to befuddle often with drugged liquor.\" \"Hocus\" is a shortening of the magic incantation \"hocus pocus\", whose origin is disputed.\n\nRobert Nares defined the word \"hoax\" as meaning \"to cheat,\" dating from Thomas Ady's 1656 book \"A candle in the dark, or a treatise on the nature of witches and witchcraft\".\n\nThe term \"hoax\" is occasionally used in reference to urban legends and rumors, but the folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand argues that most of them lack evidence of deliberate creations of falsehood and are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes, so the term should be used for only those with a probable conscious attempt to deceive. As for the closely related terms \"practical joke\" and \"prank\", Brunvand states that although there are instances where they overlap, \"hoax\" tends to indicate \"relatively complex and large-scale fabrications\" and includes deceptions that go beyond the merely playful and \"cause material loss or harm to the victim.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Lynda Walsh of the University of Nevada, Reno, some hoaxes—such as the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814, labeled as a hoax by contemporary commentators—are financial in nature, and successful hoaxers—such as P. T. Barnum, whose Fiji mermaid contributed to his wealth—often acquire monetary gain or fame through their fabrications, so the distinction between \"hoax\" and \"fraud\" is not necessarily clear. Alex Boese, the creator of the Museum of Hoaxes, states that the only distinction between them is the reaction of the public, because a fraud can be classified as a hoax when its method of acquiring financial gain creates a broad public impact or captures the imagination of the masses.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded media hoaxes is a fake almanac published by Jonathan Swift under the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff in 1708. Swift predicted the death of John Partridge, one of the leading astrologers in England at that time, in the almanac and later issued an elegy on the day Partridge was supposed to have died. Partridge's reputation was damaged as a result and his astrological almanac was not published for the next six years.\n\nIt is possible to perpetrate a hoax by making only true statements using unfamiliar wording or context, such as in the Dihydrogen monoxide hoax. Political hoaxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to ridicule or besmirch opposing politicians or political institutions, often before elections.\n\nA hoax differs from a magic trick or from fiction (books, movies, theatre, radio, television, etc.) in that the audience is unaware of being deceived, whereas in watching a magician perform an illusion the audience expects to be tricked.\n\nA hoax is often intended as a practical joke or to cause embarrassment, or to provoke social or political change by raising people's awareness of something. It can also emerge from a marketing or advertising purpose. For example, to market a romantic comedy movie, a director staged a phony \"incident\" during a supposed wedding, which showed a bride and preacher getting knocked into a pool by a clumsy fall from a best man. A resulting video clip of \"Chloe and Keith's Wedding\" was uploaded to YouTube and was viewed by over 30 million people and the couple was interviewed by numerous talk shows. Viewers were deluded into thinking that it was an authentic clip of a real accident at a real wedding; but a story in \"USA Today\" in 2009 revealed it was a hoax.\n\nGovernments sometimes spread false information to facilitate their objectives, such as going to war. These often come under the heading of black propaganda. There is often a mixture of outright hoax and suppression and management of information to give the desired impression. In wartime and times of international tension rumors abound, some of which may be deliberate hoaxes.\n\nExamples of politics-related hoaxes:\n\nPsychologist Peter Hancock has identified six steps which characterise a truly successful hoax:\n\nHoaxes vary widely in their processes of creation, propagation, and entrenchment over time. Examples include:\n\nFake news websites (also referred to as hoax news) deliberately publish hoaxes which may serve the goal of propaganda or disinformation — using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect. Unlike news satire, fake news websites seek to mislead, rather than entertain, readers for financial or political gain.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

It is commonly decorated with elaborate ornaments made from bird beaks, animal horns, hooves and feet. Although contemporary Kazakhs usually wear Western dress, the Turkic people wear more traditional clothing for holidays and special occasions.\n\nTraditional materials used in Kazakh clothing include cloth, skin, felt, and fur. Embroidery, fur, jewelry, and ornamentation may also be used for decoration. Imported materials such as silk, brocade, and velvet can also be used for clothing, but are more expensive than traditional materials.\nTraditional materials, such as horsehair, fox fur, sheep's wool and rabbit hides, are used in the production of clothing. Preparation of the materials includes skinning, drying, and greasing the hides with a mixture of sour milk and flour. After four days, the skins are washed and soaked in a concentrated brine. After more drying, the underside of the hide is scraped with a skinning knife before being heated; this gives the skin its whitish color. The fur is then ready for dyeing in a variety of colors. Yellow dye is made from the crushed root of the Taranovy plant. Red dye is made from the root of \"Uiran Boyau,\" and orange dye is often made from dried pomegranate crusts.\n\nKazakhs often use white wool, and consider wool from the neck of a sheep valuable. The hair of the Bactrian camel is also used for more luxurious clothing. An undercoat, collected after the camel has molted, it is considered particularly valuable.\nImported cotton, silk, and woolen fabrics were used by Kazakh nomads. The feudal nobility used imported fabrics to make their clothing; less-affluent Kazakhs wore more easily accessible materials, such as furs, leather, and homemade wool. Fabrics were home-spun on a primitive, horizontal loom.\n\nWomen wear a shirt-like garment known as a \"koylek\". Different fabrics are used, with more-expensive fabrics for festive wear and common fabrics for everyday use. The \"koylek\" is made by folding a piece of fabric in half and sewing the sides from the armpits to the bottom hem.\n\nA \"koylek\" usually worn by unmarried Kazakh girls is typically made from a light, soft fabric which accentuates the waist. \"Kunikey\" means \"sun-like\" in Kazakh, and the word is used to describe this type of clothing.\nKazakh girls wear trousers made of sheepskin, homespun cloth, and heavy cotton fabrics. They may be short (\"shalbar\") or long (\"dalbar\").\n\nA \"kupe\" is a coat worn by women and men which is typically made of fox fur or, occasionally, goatskin. It is usually lined with camel or sheep wool and hemmed with otter fur on the sleeves for warmth during early spring and fall. A woman's \"kupe\" is distinguishable from a man's by its embroidered collar.\nA staple article of Kazakh clothing is the chapan or \"shapan\", a long, loose robe. Unlike other clothing, it is not gender-specific and is worn by men and women. Chapans are made from various fabrics and are available in a range of colors (most often monochrome or dark). They are lined with a layer of wool or cotton. Festive velvet chapans are decorated with appliqué, brushing, and gold embroidery. This type of robe was worn by wealthy Kazakhs.\n\nA \"syrmaly\" is a hapan which is quilted and strengthened with denser fabric. A \"kaptal\" is a lined chapan, and a \"shabu\" is a chapan trimmed with fur.\n\nHeadgear indicate a woman's relationship status. Unmarried girls wear a skullcap scarf and a warm, fur-edged cap. Wealthier girls' hats are made of bright velvet fabric and embroidered with golden thread.\n\nBridal headgear of a bride is a \"saukele.\" These headdresses, often over a foot tall, are embedded with valuable ornaments such as pearls, coral, and pressed silver. Long suspension brackets, \"zhaktau\", are fastened to the sides of the \"saukele\" and frame the bride's face. They sometimes reach the bride's waist. Less prosperous women make the \"saukele\" from cloth or satin and decorate it with glass beads; the \"zhaktau\" are added later.\n\nAfter the birth of her first child, a woman wears a hat made of white fabric (often for the rest of her life). The details of the hat vary by region to region. It has two parts; the bottom (\"kimeshka\") is placed on the head and the top is twisted to form a turban.\n\nMen wear two types of skin shirts (without an undershirt), inner and outer trousers and loose-fitting robes made from various materials and belted with leather or cloth. During the 18th century, the top trousers (\"shalbar\") were sewn from homespun camel hair fabric and skin. They had embroidered silk patterns in vegetable shapes, the ends often sheathed by an ornate band and lace and edged with fur.\n\nJackets were sewn from monochrome dark (occasionally multicolored) fabrics. They had a cloth lining, often insulated with a thin layer of wool. Popular among young Kazakh men, the \"zhargak shapa\" is decorated with traditional patterns and worn on important occasions.\n\nA coat (\"ton\") is often made of sheepskin, but may be made from the skin of raccoons (\"janat ishik\") or silver foxes (\"kara tulki\"). Nobles often wear \"kok ton\", fur coats made from blue cloth covered (and trimmed) with beaver skin. \"Tons\" are often made by sewing together tanned sheepskins with wool on the inside; more prosperous Kazakhs wear \"tons\" made from the wool of four- to five-month-old lambs.\n\nAn \"aiyr kalpak\" is a pointed, upturned cap, usually worn by the upper class. The fabric cap is decorated with unique, ornamental patterns to indicate wealth, power and social status. A \"borik\" is a warm, round cap trimmed with otter, marten or raccoon fur, and a \"tymak\" is a fur hat which covers the ears.\n\nA \"kulapara\" is a hood worn by hunters, shepherds, and herdsmen which attaches to the coat collar. For camouflage, hunters wear differently colored \"kulapara\" in different seasons: white in winter, green in summer, and yellow in autumn. A \"takiya\" is a light, round hat decorated with patterns which include zoomorphic embroidery, flowers, and anima horns.\n"}
{"id": "4751657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4751657", "title": "Lipstick feminism", "text": "Lipstick feminism\n\nLipstick feminism is a variety of third-wave feminism that seeks to embrace traditional concepts of femininity, including the sexual power of women, alongside feminist ideas.\n\nUnlike early feminist campaigns that focused on the basic fundamental rights of women, starting with the Women's Suffrage Movement, lipstick feminism seeks to ascertain that women could still be feminist without ignoring or negating their femininity, particularly in terms of sexuality. During the second wave of feminism, feminists had focused solely on legal and social equality of women and refused to 'embrace' their sexuality; some even abhorred the idea of men and would often take on physical characteristics and persona that was far from what the average woman looked like, thus creating stereotypes of what feminism and feminists looked like. Lipstick feminism, on the other hand, embraces the concepts of womanhood and the female sexuality emitted from a woman's body and the need to embrace sex. Lipstick feminism also seeks to reclaim certain derogatory words and turn them into powerful tools for their cause such as the word 'slut' as seen in the SlutWalk movement. It developed in part as a response to the ideological backlash against radical varieties of second-wave feminism, with the negative stereotypes it generated of the “ugly feminist” or the “anti-sex feminist”; in part the result of the belief that the successes of second-wave feminism had made it possible to reclaim aspects of femininity that had earlier been seen as disempowering, like make-up or stilettos.\n\nLinguistically, lipstick feminism proposed to semantically reclaim, for feminist usage, double-standard insult words, such as “slut”, in order to eliminate the social stigma applied to a woman whose sexual behaviour was \"patriarchically\" interpreted to denote “immoral woman” and libertine.\n\nPhilosophically, lipstick feminism proposes that a woman can be empowered — psychologically, socially, politically – by the wearing of cosmetic make up, sensually-appealing clothes, and the embrace of sexual allure for her own self-image as a confidently sexual being. The rhetoric of choice and empowerment is used to validate such overt sexual practices, because they no longer represent coerced acquiescence to societally established gender roles, such as “the good girl”, “the decent woman”, “the abnegated mother”, “the virtuous sister”, \"et aliæ\".\n\nOther feminists object that the so-called empowerment of lipstick feminism is a philosophic contradiction wherein a woman chooses to sexually objectify herself, and so ceases to be her own woman, in control neither of her self nor of her person. In an ongoing debate, lipstick feminism counter-proposes that the practice of sexual allure is a form of social power in the interpersonal relations between a man and a woman, which may occur in the realms of cultural, social, and gender equality.\n\nStiletto feminism, a more ideologically radical variety of lipstick feminism, sees the postmodern use of fetish fashion as empowering; and extends the argument from the acceptance of makeup, to the validity of women practicing occupations specifically predicated upon female physical beauty, such as working as a striptease dancer or as a pole dancer, as well as flashing or lesbian (girl-on-girl) exhibitionism.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "595618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=595618", "title": "Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty", "text": "Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is an action-adventure stealth game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 13 November 2001. It is the fourth \"Metal Gear\" game written and directed by Hideo Kojima and serves as the direct sequel to the original \"Metal Gear Solid\". An expanded edition, titled Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, was released the following year for Xbox and Microsoft Windows in addition to the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe story revolves around the \"Big Shell\", a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by a group of terrorists who call themselves the \"Sons of Liberty\". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the course of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.\n\nWhile the game received acclaim for its gameplay, graphics, and its attention to detail, critics were initially divided on the protagonist and the philosophical nature and execution of the game's storyline, which explores themes such as memetics, social engineering, political conspiracies, censorship, artificial intelligence, existentialism, postmodernism and post-truth politics. \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" has since been considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as a leading example of artistic expression in video games. By 2003, the game had sold over seven million copies worldwide.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" carries the subtitle of \"Tactical Espionage Action\", and most of the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental is the wider range of skills offered to the player. The first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or hang off walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from \"Metal Gear Solid\", which allowed players a sneak peek around the next bend is expanded to allow players to fire from cover. Other abilities included leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers, and sneaking up behind enemies to hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition. Players are able to shoot out the enemy's radio so they are unable to communicate with others on their team. The environment also has a greater impact on the stealth gameplay, taking into account factors such as weather, smell, atmosphere, and temperature.\n\nIn \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", the enemy guards are given more advanced AI \"to prevent an imbalance of power,\" and unlike the original \"Metal Gear Solid\", work in squads. They call on their radios for a strike team upon seeing the player, then attempt to flank him and cut off his escape while avoiding the player's attacks. Often strike teams will carry body armor and riot shields, making them a greater threat. Even if the player escapes to a hiding place, a team will sweep in to check the area. The game has a collective enemy AI, where enemy guards work together in squads, can communicate with one another, and react in a more realistic manner towards the player. The game's enemy AI was considered one of the best in gaming for many years.\n\nThe game expanded its predecessor's cover mechanic, with Solid Snake or Raiden able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player character. The enemies will often take cover to call for backup, but during battle, they will take cover then pop out and shoot at the player or blindly throw grenades from behind their cover. The game features a laser sight mechanic, where a laser sight helps assist with manually aiming a gun. Boss battles and set-pieces remain a case of finding a strategy that bypasses the defenses of the enemy. However, in a major break from action game standards, it is also possible to clear the entire game, including boss fights, without causing a single deliberate death, through use of tranquilizer guns, stun grenades, and melee attacks.\n\nThe protagonist of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" is a young rookie agent named Raiden. He is supported by his commanding officer, the Colonel, and Rosemary, his girlfriend. Allies formed on the mission include Lt. Junior Grade Iroquois Pliskin, a Navy SEAL of mysterious background who provides his knowledge of the facility and later revealed as the claimed terrorist Solid Snake; Peter Stillman, a NYPD bomb-disposal expert; Otacon, a computer security specialist; and a cyborg ninja imitating Gray Fox's persona, first calling itself Deepthroat, then changing its name to Mr. X.\n\nThe antagonists are the Sons of Liberty, a group of terrorists who seize control of the Big Shell Disposal Facility, including anti-terror training unit Dead Cell, and a Russian mercenary force. The Dead Cell team members are Vamp, an immortal man exhibiting vampire-like attributes; Fatman, a rotund man with exceptional knowledge of bombs; and Fortune, a woman capable of cheating death by apparently supernatural means. The leader of Sons of Liberty claims to be Solid Snake, previously declared dead after a terrorist attack, later revealed to be Solidus Snake, a third clone in \"Les Enfants Terribles\" project. Assisting the Sons of Liberty are Olga Gurlukovich, commander of a rogue Russian mercenary army, and Revolver Ocelot, a disenfranchised Russian nationalist and former FOXHOUND agent, Solid Snake's old nemesis, and henchman of Solidus Snake.\n\nOther characters include Emma Emmerich, Otacon's stepsister and a computer whiz-kid; Sergei Gurlukovich, Ocelot's former commanding officer and Olga's father; President James Johnson, held hostage by the Sons of Liberty; and DIA operative Richard Ames. Liquid Snake returns as he communicates via Ocelot because his right hand, sliced by Gray Fox in the previous game, has been replaced with the right hand of Liquid. The game also features cameos by Mei Ling, the communications expert who aided Snake in the first game, and Johnny Sasaki, the luckless soldier with chronic digestive problems.\n\nThe game opens with a flashback, two years after the Shadow Moses incident in the original \"Metal Gear Solid\". On August 8, 2007, Solid Snake and Otacon, now members of the non-governmental organization Philanthropy, are investigating the development of a new Metal Gear by the United States Marine Corps. Snake arrives on the tanker transporting the weapon in the middle of an attack by Russian mercenaries, led by Colonel Gurlukovich, his daughter Olga and Snake's enemy Ocelot, who has transplanted the right arm of Liquid Snake following the loss of his own in \"Metal Gear Solid\". After Snake knocks Olga unconscious, he sneaks down to the hold in order to record pictures of the new Metal Gear RAY. As the mercenaries take control below, Ocelot betrays his allies and shoots both Colonel Gurlukovich and the Marine commander. Just before Ocelot can commandeer Metal Gear RAY, Snake emerges and confronts him. Upon seeing Snake, Ocelot becomes possessed by Liquid Snake and escapes with RAY, leaving the ship to sink. In the aftermath, Snake is blamed for the disaster and is believed to have perished. The Big Shell clean-up facility is later constructed, ostensibly to help clean the Lower New York Bay after the major oil spill that occurred due to the tanker sinking.\n\nOn April 29, 2009, Raiden (who operates briefly under the code name Snake) is tasked under a reformed FOXHOUND. He has orders to infiltrate the Big Shell to rescue hostages, including the US president, from the terrorist group Sons of Liberty (whose leader claims to be Solid Snake), backed up by the rogue anti-terror training unit Dead Cell, who are also threatening to destroy the facility. All members of SEAL Team 10 are killed by Dead Cell members Vamp and Fortune, and the Big Shell is patrolled by the surviving Russian mercenaries from the Tanker chapter, led now by Olga, who is unaware of the extent of Ocelot's betrayal, and believes Snake was responsible for her father's murder. The remaining members of the SEAL assault team, Iroquois Pliskin and Peter Stillman join Raiden to disable explosives planted on the Shell by Stillman's former pupil, Fatman, now a terrorist. Stillman is killed by Fatman's booby trap in Shell 2, though he manages to warn Raiden in time, who successfully disables the respective bomb in Shell 1, preventing the sinking of the facility. Raiden then survives a direct confrontation with Fortune and Vamp, and kills Fatman on the heliport.\n\nAs Raiden searches for the President, he begins to doubt Pliskin's identity but agrees to the plan of transporting hostages off the Big Shell with a helicopter. However, they are attacked by the leader of the Sons of Liberty, who identifies himself as Solid Snake. Pliskin, however, shouts that the man is not Snake, and assists Raiden in fending off the leader when he attacks with a Harrier Jet piloted by Vamp. The battle ends with the Harrier being shot down, though it is seized by the Metal Gear RAY seen in the Tanker chapter, and the two terrorists escape. Pliskin reveals himself to be the real Solid Snake, who, along with Otacon, helps Raiden locate the President. When Raiden finally contacts President Johnson, he is informed that the Big Shell is a facade to hide a new Metal Gear. Known as Arsenal Gear, it houses a powerful AI called \"GW\", which is capable of controlling the transmission of digital information. The President also claims that the democratic process is a sham, and the true rulers of the United States are a secret organization called the Patriots. The President then reveals the leader of the Sons of Liberty is his predecessor George Sears, a perfect clone of Big Boss known as Solidus Snake, who fell out of the Patriots' favor following Shadow Moses and has now gone rogue with Dead Cell to escape the Patriots' control. Ocelot kills the President soon after this revelation. Raiden moves on to disabling Arsenal Gear, going to rescue an engineer, Emma Emmerich (Otacon's step-sister). After fighting Vamp, who seemingly drowns after being shot, Raiden rescues Emma, who agrees to help upload a virus into the \"GW\" mainframe. However, the upload is halted partway when Emma is attacked by Vamp. Raiden then defeats Vamp by shooting him again, although the injuries Emma suffers prove fatal. Otacon escapes with the surviving hostages, while Raiden is captured by Olga when Solid Snake seemingly betrays him.\n\nRaiden awakens in a torture chamber where Solidus Snake reveals that he once adopted Raiden, a former child soldier, as his son during the Liberian civil war and that Raiden is now a Patriot agent. Solidus then leaves the chamber, and Olga steps in and frees Raiden, telling him that she is also a Patriot double-agent and that she was blackmailed to aid Raiden in order to protect her child. Olga also tells Raiden to find Solid Snake, who only allowed Raiden to be captured so he could gain access to Arsenal Gear. While Raiden makes his way through the bowels of the facility to rendezvous with Snake, his commanding officer, the Colonel, begins to act very erratically. Upon investigation, Otacon reveals that the \"Colonel\" is actually a construct of the GW supercomputer and that the partially uploaded virus is beginning to damage its systems. Raiden receives a call from Rose, whose voice begins to deepen and slow down as the conversation is cut off, but not before she reveals she is pregnant with his child. Raiden reunites with Snake and his gear, and the two then encounter Fortune, who fights Snake while Raiden searches for Solidus. He is then forced into a battle with twenty-five Metal Gear RAY units in Arsenal Gear. Olga protects him, before Solidus kills her, and captures Snake and Raiden. Ocelot reveals that he too is a Patriot agent and that the entire Big Shell mission was a carefully coordinated attempt to reenact the events of the Shadow Moses incident, for the purpose of creating a soldier (Raiden) on par with Solid Snake. Ocelot kills Fortune, before being possessed by Liquid again, who announces his plan to hunt down the Patriots using his host's knowledge and the first Metal Gear RAY. Snake escapes to pursue Liquid, as Arsenal Gear goes out of control.\n\nThe next morning on April 30, 2009, Arsenal crashes into downtown Manhattan, launching Raiden and Solidus onto the roof of Federal Hall National Memorial. Solidus attempts to kill Raiden, intending to use his nanomachines to lead him to the Patriots, eliminate them, and form a nation of \"Sons of Liberty\". At this point, Raiden is contacted by AI's of the Colonel and Rosemary, introducing themselves as representatives of the Patriots, who reveal that the true purpose of the simulation was to see how they could simulate and control human behavior in order to prevent society from dumbing down due to trivial information drowning valuable knowledge and inconvenient truths. They order Raiden to eliminate Solidus, threatening to kill Rose and Olga's child if he refuses to cooperate. After Solidus's death, Snake reveals he planted a tracking device on Liquid's Metal Gear. Snake and Otacon plan to follow him, rescue Olga's child, and hunt down the Patriots, whose details were hidden in the GW computer virus disc. Raiden is finally reunited with Rose for the anniversary of their first meeting.\n\nIn a brief epilogue, Otacon and Snake discuss the decoding of the virus disc, which contains the personal data on all twelve members of the Patriots' high council. However, it is revealed that not only is one of the Wisemen's Committee one of Philantropy's biggest contributors, but all of them have been dead for about one hundred years.\n\nThe creator Hideo Kojima's original design document for the game was completed in January 1999; it was made publicly available several years later and translated into English in 2006. It mentioned that the game was originally going to be called \"Metal Gear Solid III\" to symbolize Manhattan's three tallest skyscrapers.\" The document outlines new game mechanics and features, such as bodies that need to be hidden, enemies being able to detect shadows, lights in an area that can be destroyed to affect enemy vision, realistic enemy AI that relies on squad tactics rather than working individually, and multi-level environments that add an element of \"vertical tension\" to the stealth gameplay. It also outlines themes, such as passing on memories, environmental issues, and particularly social themes regarding the \"digitization of the military,\" digital simulations, the \"digitization of operational planning,\" the \"digitization of everyday life,\" and the \"effects of digitization on personality.\" The document stated that the \"aim of the story\" involves \"a series of betrayals and sudden reversals, to the point where the player is unable to tell fact from fiction\" (departing from the \"very clear and understandable story\" of its predecessor), that \"every character lies to (betrays) someone once,\" blurring the line between \"what is real, and what is fantasy,\" and \"ironies aimed at the digital society and gaming culture.\"\n\nThe game's production budget was $10 million. Kojima states that when he \"heard about the hardware for the PlayStation 2,\" he \"wanted to try something new. Up to that point, all cutscenes had focused more on details like facial expressions, but I wanted to pay more attention to the surroundings, to see how much I could change them in real time.\"\n\nFor \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", the established protagonist of Solid Snake was only made playable for the prologue portion of the game. A new protagonist named Raiden would substitute him as the player character for the main portion. The decision to introduce a new protagonist came from the idea of portraying Solid Snake from another character's perspective, but also to get around the dilemma of having to write gameplay tutorials directed at Snake, as Kojima felt that having to explain mission procedures and weapon handling to a veteran soldier like Snake would've felt unnatural after three games. The character of Raiden was created in order to appeal to female players after Kojima overheard female debuggers working on the first \"Metal Gear Solid\" remark that \"games like that only have old men as protagonists.\" Raiden's presence in the game was kept a secret prior to release, with preview trailers showing Snake in situations and battles that actually occurred to Raiden in the published game, such as a battle against a Harrier on George Washington Bridge and an encounter with the new Cyborg Ninja inside the tanker.\n\nAccording to Kojima in the documentary \"Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1\", the original plot of the game revolved around nuclear weapon inspections in Iraq and Iran and had Solid Snake trying to stop the Metal Gear while it was located on an aircraft carrier, in a certain time limit, while trying to stop Liquid Snake and his group. However, about six months into the project the political situation in the Middle East became a concern and they decided that they could not make a game with such a plot. The tanker in the released game is based on this original plot.\n\n\"MGS2\" was also intended to reference the novel \"City of Glass\", notably in the naming of its characters. Raiden's support team originally featured a different field commander named Colonel Daniel Quinn; Maxine \"Max\" Work, an Asian woman who saves game data and quotes Shakespeare, and William \"Doc\" Wilson, the creator of GW. All take their names from key characters in the book, and all three would have turned out to be AIs. None of these characters survived to the final edition, their roles being absorbed by other characters, namely the \"Colonel Campbell\" simulation, Rose, and Emma Emmerich. Peter Stillman, however, takes his name from another \"City of Glass\" character.\n\nA character named Chinaman, originally planned to be included as a villain, was later on omitted and his abilities incorporated in Vamp, namely the ability to walk on water and walls. Chinaman would have movements modeled after Jet Li and have a body tattoo of a dragon that would come alive as soon as he dove into the water.\n\nSignificant changes to the game's ending were made late in development following the September 11 attacks in New York, where the finale occurs. A sequence depicting Arsenal Gear's displacement of the Statue of Liberty and crashing through half of Manhattan was removed, as was a short coda to appear after the credits, a breaking newscast showing the Statue of Liberty's new resting place, Ellis Island. At the point where Solidus dies, Raiden was supposed to have cut the rope on Federal Hall's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over Solidus' body, and American flags that were supposed to be on all the flagpoles in New York were removed from the title. The Japanese spelling of the name \"Raiden\" was changed from katakana (ライデン) to kanji (雷電) due to the former form of the name resembling \"Bin Laden\" in Japanese.\n\nKojima's choice of composer for \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" was highly publicized in the run-up to the game's release, with him deciding upon Harry Gregson-Williams, a film composer from Hans Zimmer's studio, after watching \"The Replacement Killers\" with sound director Kazuki Muraoka. A mix CD containing 18 tracks of Gregson-Williams' work was sent to his office. Flattered by the research put into creating the CD (as some of the tracks were unreleased, and that what tracks he'd worked on for some films were undocumented), he joined the project soon after.\n\nIn order to bypass the language barrier and allow the score to be developed before the cutscenes were finalized, Gregson-Williams was sent short phrases or descriptions of the intended action. The resultant themes then shaped the action sequences in return. Gregson-Williams also arranged and re-orchestrated the original \"\"Metal Gear Solid\" Main Theme\" for use in the game's opening title sequence.\n\nNorihiko Hibino, who had worked on previous Konami games such as \"Metal Gear: Ghost Babel\", was responsible for the in-game music. He also worked on the majority of the game's cutscenes, re-orchestrating Gregson-Williams' \"Main Theme\" remix for use in several sequences.\n\nAs with \"Metal Gear Solid\", the cutscene music includes orchestral and choir pieces, while the in-game soundtrack is scored with ambient music. However, the score as a whole incorporates more electronic elements (particularly breakbeat) than its predecessor, in order to reflect the plot's thematic thrust of a machine-dominated society. Rika Muranaka again provided a vocal ending theme, a jazz track entitled \"Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday\", sung by Carla White. The game's music was released via four CDs: \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nThe game's main theme was chosen by the London Philharmonic Orchestra for their \"Greatest Video Game Music\" compilation, and the theme is a key regular in the \"Video Games Live\" concert when the \"Metal Gear Solid\" segment is introduced. A segment of the song's main chorus is included in the closing sequence of \"\".\n\nIn contrast to the original \"Metal Gear Solid\", \"Sons of Liberty\" was released in North America first, on November 13, 2001. Because of the later release in the region, the protagonist switch was not kept a secret in the Japanese version in the weeks prior to its release. A preview event was held in Zepp Tokyo on the day of the game's North American release in which the character of Raiden was unveiled to the Japanese public. As a result, the Japanese packaging artwork depicts Raiden standing prominently next to Solid Snake, as opposed to only having Snake like on the cover artwork used for the American (and later European) version. A questionnaire was also added in the Japanese version, in which players are asked about their experience with the original \"Metal Gear Solid\" and action games in general; the answers to the questionnaire determines the difficulty level of the game and whether the player starts the game on the Tanker chapter or skips directly to the Plant chapter (an option that is only available after clearing the game once in the American version). The Japanese version has a few other additional features over the American version, including two extra game modes unlocked after completing the main game: Boss Survival, in which the player replays through the boss battles from the main game as either, Snake or Raiden; and Casting Theater, in which the player can view certain cutscenes from the main game and replace the character models.\n\nThe Japanese version was released on November 29, two weeks after the American version. As with the original \"Metal Gear Solid\", \"Sons of Liberty\" was sold in a limited \"Premium Package\" edition in addition to the standard release, which was packaged in a black box containing the game itself with a reversible cover art on the DVD case (with Snake on one side and Raiden on the other), a video DVD known as the \"Premium Disc\", which features a collection of \"Metal Gear Solid\"-related commercials and trailers, a metallic Solid Snake figurine, and an 80-page booklet titled \"Metal Gear Chronicle\" featuring artwork and commentary about the series.\n\nThe European version, which was initially scheduled for February 22, 2002, was released on March 8, nearly four months after the other regions. The added features from the Japanese release were carried over to the European version, along with a new difficulty setting (European Extreme). The European version came packaged with a video DVD titled \"The Making of Metal Gear Solid 2\". As well as collating all of the game's promotional trailers and a GameSpot feature on the game's final days of development, it features a titular documentary produced by French television production house FunTV, which was filmed at KCE Japan West's Japanese studio. The DVD was included as an apology to European consumers for the several month delay that had occurred since the original November release in North America and Japan, which saw numerous European gaming magazines detail the various twists in the game.\n\nReleased on September 12, 2002, in Japan and September 24 in North America, \"The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\" is an interactive database for the PlayStation 2 that documents the development of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\". It contains a gallery of all the 3D models of characters, scenery, and objects that were used in the game (as well as unused assets), along with corresponding concept art when available. All the real-time cutscenes (or polygon demos) are also available to view (without audio), with the option to pause them at any point, change the camera angle and move them frame by frame. Other content includes storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, music tracks (with the option to play alternate patterns when applicable), the finalized screenplay, Hideo Kojima's original draft (available in Japanese only), a development timeline, and a gallery of \"Metal Gear Solid\" related products and merchandise. The disc also includes a sampler selection of VR training missions that were later featured in \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\". In Europe, the disc was bundled as a bonus with the PlayStation 2 version of \"Substance\" instead of having a stand-alone release. It was also included in the Japanese 20th Anniversary re-release of \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" in July 2007.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\", the expanded edition of the game, was released on the original Xbox and Microsoft Windows in addition to the PlayStation 2. The Xbox version was initially released in North America as a timed exclusive for the console on November 5, 2002. This was followed by the PlayStation 2 version, released in Japan on December 19 of the same year. \"Substance\" was eventually released on PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows in North America and on all three platforms in Europe in March 2003. The console versions were developed internally by KCE Japan, whereas the Windows port was outsourced to Success.\n\n\"Substance\" contains several supplemental game modes in addition to the main story mode from the original \"Sons of Liberty\" releases. The main game contains all the changes and additions that were made in the Japanese and European versions of the original release (e.g. Boss Survival, Casting Theater, European Extreme), along with further additional changes. Players can now start the main story mode at the Tanker or Plant chapters without the need to answer a questionnaire first and a new set of collectible dog tags have been added (exclusively on the PlayStation 2 version) based on names submitted from a second contest in addition to the original (2001) set. The visual effect for the thermal goggles was also changed in \"Substance\" and the \"FHM\"-licensed posters that adorned several locations in the original \"Sons of Liberty\" version have been replaced with public domain images (these were also replaced in \"The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\"). The Xbox and Windows versions feature slight dialogue changes during certain control explanations in which the term \"analog stick\" was substituted with \"thumbstick\" (Microsoft's preferred term). The controls were also slightly altered for the Xbox version, due to its fewer shoulder buttons (clicking on the left thumbstick switches between normal and first-person view, while the Y button serves as a lock-on for the player's aim). The Xbox version has support for 5.1 surround sound.\n\nThe primary addition of \"Substance\" is the inclusion of an extra missions mode with 350 VR missions set in a computer-constructed environment and 150 \"Alternative\" missions set in areas from the main story. The player can choose to play these missions as Solid Snake or Raiden, with alternate versions of both characters (in different outfits) becoming available as the player progresses. These missions are divided into eight categories (although not all of them are available to every character): Sneaking, Weapon, First Person View (which simulates a first-person shooter), Variety, Hold Up, Bomb Disposal, Elimination, and Photograph.\n\nThe other new addition is \"Snake Tales\", which is a set of five story-based missions featuring Solid Snake as the player character. These missions are primarily set in the Big Shell and involve characters from the main story in new roles such as Fatman, Emma, Vamp and Solidus Snake, while one mission set in the Tanker has Meryl Silverburgh (from the original \"Metal Gear Solid\") as the main antagonist. These missions, which are unrelated to the main story, have no voice acted cutscenes - instead, the story is told through text in interludes.\n\nExclusive to the PlayStation 2 version is a skateboarding minigame in which the player control Snake or Raiden in a pair of Big Shell-themed levels. The player has to complete a set of objectives before time runs out, which range from collecting dog tags scattered throughout the level to blowing up parts of Big Shell. The minigame uses the same engine from \"Evolution Skateboarding\", which was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka.\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 35 out of 40.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - HD Edition\" was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in and for the PlayStation Vita in . This version is included in the \"Metal Gear Solid HD Collection\" but is also available as a digital download on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions feature an increased 720p resolution and a aspect ratio, providing a clearer and wider view of the player's surroundings compared to the original 480p resolution and ratio of the PlayStation 2 version, while the PS Vita version runs at qHD resolution. Cutscenes can now be viewed in fullscreen or letterboxed format, while online achievements/trophies have been added as well. Most of the additional content from \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\" has also been ported in this version, such as the Missions and Snake Tales modes, although the Skateboarding minigame that was present in the PlayStation 2 version of \"Substance\" is absent. The PS3 and Vita versions have a \"transfarring\" option that allows players to transfer save data between both versions through a wi-fi connection or a cloud network. The Vita version has touchscreen and touchpad support for certain gameplay functions such as switching between items and weapons or zooming into cutscenes.\n\nIDW Publishing published a 12-issue comic book adaptation from 2006 to 2007, titled \"Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty\", illustrated by Ashley Wood (who also worked on the comic book adaptation of the previous game) and written by Alex Garner. This version deviates from the game, where many scenes involving Raiden are substituted with Snake.\n\nA digital version of the comic, titled \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée\", was released on June 12, 2008, in Japan. Originally announced as a PlayStation Portable game, similar to the \"Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel\", the digital comic was released as a DVD film instead. A fully voiced version of the graphic novel adaptation of the first \"Metal Gear Solid\" is featured as well.\n\nA novelization of the game written by Raymond Benson and published by Del Rey. The American paperback edition was published on November 24, 2009. A majority of the character interaction in the novel is taken verbatim from the Codec conversations in the game itself.\n\nA second novelization by Kenji Yano (written under the pen name Hitori Nojima), titled \"Metal Gear Solid Substance II\", was published by Kadokawa Shoten in Japan on September 24, 2015. This novelization is narrated in real time during the events of the Plant chapter from the perspective of a young man living Manhattan.\n\nAs a result of promising trailers and the huge commercial success of its predecessor \"Metal Gear Solid\", there was a high level of anticipation in the gaming community surrounding the release of \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\". The game's E3 2000 demo, surprised many spectators with its level of realism and played a key role in the PlayStation 2 console's early success.\n\nIn the United States, the game sold 500,000 units within two days of release, and 680,000 copies within five. By July 2006, it had sold 2 million copies and earned $85 million in the United States alone. \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 16th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. In Japan, the game sold 400,000 units in its first day, in addition to its 600,000 pre-orders in that country. The game's PlayStation 2 version received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It ultimately sold 7 million copies worldwide, making it the highest-selling game in the series.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" received a critical average of 96% on Metacritic, where it is the fourth highest-rated game on the PlayStation 2, and the tied sixth highest-rated game of all time. \"Game Informer\" gave the game a score of 10/10 (notably, this is the second game \"Game Informer\" ever gave a 10/10 score), and it received high reviews from nearly all major publications and websites. GameSpot gave the game a high 9.6 rating, stating, \"It boils down to this: You must play \"Metal Gear Solid 2\"\". Critics praised the title's stealth gameplay and the improvements over its predecessor, as well as the game's level of graphical detail, particularly in the use of in-game graphics to render plot-driving cutscenes.\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed, gaining a 95.09% and 96/100 aggregate at rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively, the highest score for a \"Metal Gear Solid\" game on both websites. The title's storyline, however, was initially divisive and became the source of controversy. The storyline explores many social, philosophical and cyberpunk themes in great detail, including meme theory, social engineering, sociology, artificial intelligence, information control, conspiracy theories, political and military maneuvering, evolution, existentialism, censorship, the nature of reality, post-truth politics, child exploitation, and taboos such as incest and sexual orientation. Hideo Kojima's ambitious script has been praised, some even calling it the first example of a postmodern video game. However, some critics considered the plot to be \"incomprehensible\" and overly heavy for an action game, and also felt that the lengthy dialogue sections heavily disrupted the gameplay and that the dialogue itself was overly disjointed and convoluted. The surprise introduction of Raiden as the protagonist for the majority of the game (replacing long-time series protagonist Solid Snake) was also controversial with fans of \"Metal Gear Solid\".\n\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" is often considered the first example of a postmodern video game and has often been cited as a primary example of artistic expression in video games. In his paper \"How Videogames Express Ideas\", Matthew Weise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology described \" Sons of Liberty\" as \"perhaps the most vivid example of a game that uses tension between different levels of player agency to fuel a multi-faceted ideological argument,\" noting Solidus Snake's suggestion of the United States being a \"totalitarian regime of thought control\" and pointing to the \"very meta concept\" of \"how the designer’s imposed plan or path for the player maps to the tyrannical nature of the government\", where, \"like the player, Jack has no agency other than what his puppet masters give him.\" In the book \"Joystick Soldiers: The Politics of Play in Military Video Games\", Tanner Higgin examined the game's \"resistant and subversive counter-history of military engagement,\" describing its \"convoluted narrative and unconventional gameplay logics\" as a \"critique\" of \"the very networks of biopolitical and informational control that comprise the postmodern military, and posthumanity generally,\" and noting that it \"purposefully manufactures frustration and negative affect\" to \"highlight the typically unexamined codes, conventions, and hidden pleasures of the military game genre.\"\n\nJeremy Parish of 1UP.com notes that \"\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" is a game built on misinformation\" and that it \"was simply too avant-garde—too clever—for its own good.\" Steven Poole commented in a 2012 \"Edge\" column, \"the story of \"MGS2\", with its mythic wit and sweep, is still in a different league from the vast majority of videogame yarns. ... [H]owever, the fact that \"MGS2\" still seems so avant-garde today might well prompt a worry: does it represent the pinnacle of a now-vanished era, the age of the experimental mainstream? This was, after all, a big-budget commercial boxed product that gleefully took risks and subverted genre conventions at every turn. Modern blockbuster games play it painfully safe by comparison.\" Gamasutra has compared the game's themes to the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, as well as the more recent social media and social gaming trends. In November 2018 blogger Hussain Ather used the game to describe modern dangers of artificial intelligence and genetic engineering.\n\nFifteen years after its original release, Alex Wiltshire of \"Glixel\" found the game to be \"strangely prescient of not only its own time but also today\", noting how it dodged \"truth at every turn\" and comparing it to post-truth politics, Facebook's curated News Feed, and the 2016 United States presidential election. Nicholas Montegriffo of Moviepilot further draws comparisons to contemporary concepts such as fake news, echo chambers and alternative facts. According to Cameron Kunzelman of \"Vice\", \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" is still politically relevant in 2017. In March 2018, GamesRadar drew comparisons to recent political events including the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and the investigations involving Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n\nIn a 2006 viewer poll conducted by Japan's \"Famitsu\" magazine of top 100 games of all time, \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" was ranked at #42 in the poll. In the 200th issue of \"Game Informer Magazine\" in 2009, its list of top 200 games of all time ranked the game at #50 on the list. \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" was ranked #7 in \"Game Informer\"s 2008 list of the top ten video game openings. In 2010, GamesRadar included the game in its list of top seven games \"with mega plot twists you never saw coming.\" The game was included in Tony Mott and Peter Molyneux's 2011 book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\". It has also been listed as one of the best games of all time by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"Empire\", GameFAQs, GameRankings, IGN, Metacritic, \"Slant\", and \"Stuff\".\n\nIn 2009, \"Wired\" included the game in its list of \"The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade\" at #13, concluding that every \"videogame story that subverts a player’s expectations owes a debt to the ground broken by \"Metal Gear Solid 2\".\" The artistic influence of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" can be seen in later video games such as Goichi Suda's similarly postmodern game \"Killer7\", the similarly metanarrative game \"Portal\", the survival horror title \"\", and particularly the first-person shooter \"BioShock\", which featured a similar plot twist to \"Metal Gear Solid 2\". Several game mechanics developed in \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", such as the cover system and laser sight mechanic, have since become staples of stealth games as well as shooters, including \"Kill Switch\" (2003), \"Resident Evil 4\" (2005) and \"Gears of War\" (2006). According to Kojima, \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" paid more \"attention to the surroundings\" in real-time and later \"games like \"Call of Duty\" have followed this trend of making your surroundings more realistic.\"\n\nThe early anticipation that surrounded \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" since its E3 2000 demo has also been credited as a key factor in the PlayStation 2's best-selling success and dominance during the sixth console generation, as well as the demise of Sega's Dreamcast. According to John Szczepaniak, \"\"MGS2\" was the game which single-handedly sold Sony's new PlayStation 2 to the masses.\" The reveal of \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" also led to the development of \"Splinter Cell\", which Ubisoft originally intended to be \"a \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" killer.\" \"MGS2\", along with its predecessor, has been featured in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's exhibition The Art of Video Games in 2012.\n\n\"WhatCulture\" noted a number of striking similarities between \"Sons of Liberty\" and the 2014 Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"\", including a similar opening tanker mission, shady cyborg-like antagonist, and organization covertly attempting to shape the world's future, as well as a close-quarters combat fight scene similar to later \"Metal Gear Solid\" games. \"Entertainment Weekly\" also noted that the film's opening tanker mission was \"rendered as a \"Metal Gear Solid\" stealth mission\".\n"}
{"id": "629901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=629901", "title": "Mingrelian language", "text": "Mingrelian language\n\nMingrelian or Megrelian ( \"margaluri nina\") is a Kartvelian language spoken in Western Georgia (regions of Samegrelo and Abkhazia), primarily by Mingrelians. The language was also called Iverian (Georgian \"iveriuli ena\") in the early 20th century. Since Mingrelian has historically been only a regional language within boundaries of both historical Georgian states and modern Georgia, the number of younger people speaking it has decreased substantially, with UNESCO designating it as a \"definitely endangered language\".\n\nNo reliable figures exist for the number of Mingrelian native speakers, but it is estimated to be between 300,000 and 500,000. Most speakers live in the Samegrelo (Mingrelia) region of Georgia, which comprises the Odishi Hills and the Kolkheti Lowlands, from the Black Sea coast to the Svan Mountains and the Tskhenistskali River. Smaller enclaves existed in Abkhazia, but the ongoing civil unrest there has displaced many Mingrelian speakers to other regions of Georgia. Their geographical distribution is relatively compact, which has helped to promote the transmission of the language between generations.\n\nMingrelian is generally written with the Georgian alphabet, but has no written standard or official status. Almost all speakers are bilingual; they use Mingrelian mainly for familiar and informal conversation, and Georgian (or, for expatriate speakers, the local official language) for other purposes.\n\nIn the summer of 1999, books of the Georgian poet Murman Lebanidze were burned in the Mingrelian capital, Zugdidi, after he made disparaging remarks about the Mingrelian language.\n\nMingrelian is one of the Kartvelian languages. It is closely related to Laz, from which it has differentiated mostly in the last 500 years, after the northern (Mingrelian) and southern (Laz) communities were separated by Turkic invasions. It is somewhat less closely related to Georgian (the two branches having separated in the first millennium BC or earlier) and even more distantly related to Svan (which is believed to have branched off in the 2nd millennium BC or earlier). Mingrelian is not mutually intelligible with any of those other languages, although it is said that its speakers can recognize many Laz words.\n\nSome linguists refer to Mingrelian and Laz as grouped within the Zan languages. Zan had already split into Mingrelian and Laz variants by early modern times, however, and it is not customary to speak of a unified Zan language today.\n\nThe oldest surviving texts in Mingrelian date from the 19th century, and are mainly ethnographical literature. The earliest linguistic studies of Mingrelian include a phonetic analysis by Aleksandre Tsagareli (1880), and grammars by Ioseb Kipshidze (1914) and Shalva Beridze (1920). From 1930 to 1938 several newspapers were published in Mingrelian, such as \"Kazakhishi Gazeti\", \"Komuna\", \"Samargalosh Chai\", \"Narazenish Chai\", and \"Samargalosh Tutumi\". More recently, there has been some revival of the language, with the publication of dictionaries—Mingrelian–Georgian by Otar Kajaia, and Mingrelian-German by Otar Kajaia and Heinz Fähnrich—and poetry books by Lasha Gakharia, Edem Izoria, Lasha Gvasalia, Guri Otobaia, Giorgi Sichinava, Jumber Kukava, and Vakhtang Kharchilava, as well as books and magazines published by Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nMingrelian has five primary vowels \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\". The Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect has a sixth, \"ə\", which is the result of reduction of \"i\" and \"u\".\n\nThe consonant inventory of Mingrelian is almost identical to Laz, Georgian, and Svan.\n\nCertain pairs of vowels reduce to single vowels:\n\nIn Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect the vowels \"i\" and \"u\" also often reduce to \"ə\".\n\nBefore consonants, \"g\" → \"r\".\n\nIn word-initial prevocalic and intervocalic positions, \"q' → ʔ\". Before the consonant \"v\", \"q' → ʔ/ḳ\".\n\nThe common types are:\n\nIf the stem contains \"r\" then the suffixes \"-ar\" and \"-ur\" transform to \"-al\" and \"-ul\", e.g. \"xorga (Khorga, the village)→ xorg-ul-i\" (\"Khorgan\").\nThe rule is not valid if in the stem with \"r\" an \"l\" appears later, e.g. \"marṭvili (\"Martvili\", the town) → marṭvil-ur-i (adj. \"Martvilian\")\"\n\nIn a stem with voiceless affricates or voiceless sibilants, a later \"ǯ\" is deaffricated to \"d\", e.g. \"orcxonǯi → orcxondi\" \"comb\", \"č'anǯi → č'andi\" \"fly (insect)\", \"isinǯi → isindi\" \"arrow\", etc.\n\n\nBetween the vowels the organic \"v\" disappears, e.g. \"xvavi (Geo. \"abundance, plenty\") → *xvai → xvee\" (id.), \"mṭevani (Geo. \"raceme\") → ṭiani\" (id.), etc.\n\nBefore the stops and affricates, an inorganic augmentation \"n\" may appear (before labials \"n → m\").\n\nMegrelian is written in the Mkhedruli script.\n\nThe main dialects and subdialects of Mingrelian are:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "565176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=565176", "title": "Narration", "text": "Narration\n\nNarration is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience. Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the creator of the story presents their story, including:\n\nA \"narrator\" is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered \"participant\" if he/she is a character within the story, and \"non-participant\" if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.\n\nNarration encompasses not only \"who\" tells the story, but also \"how\" the story is told (for example, by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration). In traditional literary narratives (such as novels, short stories, and memoirs), narration is a required story element; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.\n\nNarrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told. It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.\n\nWith the \"first-person\" point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a character within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer. Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of \"I\" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, \"we\". Frequently, the narrator is the protagonist, whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\n\nThe \"second-person\" point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns \"you\", \"your\", and \"yours.\" The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare. Examples include the short fiction of Lorrie Moore and Junot Díaz. An example in contemporary literature is Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.\n\"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy.\"—Opening lines of Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (1984)\n\nIn the \"third-person\" narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as \"he\", \"she\", or \"they\", but never as \"I\" or \"we\" (first-person), or \"you\" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified entity or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.\n\nTraditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied \"commentary\" or \"voice\", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the \"he/she\" perspective.\n\nThe third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with \"third person subjective\" narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and \"third person objective\" narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A \"third person omniscient\" narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a \"third person limited \" narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.\n\nWhile the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the \"\" adventure series, by D. J. MacHale, switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home. Margaret Atwood's \"Alias Grace\" provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in Barbara Kingsolver's \"The Poisonwood Bible\".\n\nAudrey Niffenegger's \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. John Green & David Levithan's novel \"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\" rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. Nick Hornby's \"A Long Way Down\" has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.\n\nThe narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by \"viewing\" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.\n\nA \"stream of consciousness\" gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" and \"As I Lay Dying\", and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\". Irish writer James Joyce exemplifies this style in his novel \"Ulysses\".\n\nOne of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the \"character voice\", in which a conscious \"person\" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a \"viewpoint character\". In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the storytelling. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include Doctor Watson, Scout in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and Nick Carraway of \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nThe unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.\n\nThe \"epistolary narrative voice\" uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. \"Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons), \"by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story \"Passing\", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.\n\nThe third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.\n\nHistorically, the \"third-person omniscient\" (or simply \"omniscient\") perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, and George Eliot. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.\n\nIn addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic \"cast-of-thousands\" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe \"third-person subjective\" is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed \"third-person limited\", in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the protagonist) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", and \"they\", but not \"I\". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's \"The Dead\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\", or Santiago in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\"). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as \"third person, subjective\" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.\n\nThis style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \"over the shoulder\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\", or George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\nThe focal character, protagonist, antagonist, or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.\n\nThe \"third-person objective\" employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \"fly-on-the-wall\" or \"camera lens\" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called \"camera-eye perspective\" is \"Hills Like White Elephants\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThis narrative mode is also called the \"third-person dramatic\" because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the \"nouveau roman\" tradition.\n\nThe third person indirect style or free indirect style is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.\n\nMany stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more omniscient third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series and the books by George R. R. Martin, a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. \"The Home and the World\", written in 1916 by Rabindranath Tagore, is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In \"The Heroes of Olympus\" series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The \"Harry Potter\" series is told in \"third person limited\" (in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).\n\nThe \"narrative tense\" or \"narrative time\" determines the grammatical tense of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in real time. In English, this tense, also known as the \"historical present\", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a prophetic tone.\n\n\"Narration\" has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, \"true crime\", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term \"narration\" refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.\n\nAlong with exposition, argumentation, and description, narration (broadly defined) is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.\n\nNarrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.\n\nThe ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing mark schemes used for National Curriculum assessments in England reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.\n\nIn literature, \"person\" is used to describe the viewpoint from which the narrative is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. \"Third person omniscient\" specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.\n\nIn movies and video games first- and third-person describe camera viewpoints. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, \"general\" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.\n\nFor example, in a horror film, the first-person perspective of an antagonist could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.\n\nIn video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the first-person shooter genre, such as in \"Doom\", or in simulations (racing games, flight simulation games, and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of 3D computer graphics in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise.\n\nText-based interactive fiction conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as Zork. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from Spiderweb Software which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions. Charles Stross's novel Halting State was written in second person as an allusion to this style.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9710254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9710254", "title": "Science festival", "text": "Science festival\n\nA science festival is a festival that showcases science and technology with the same freshness and flair that would be expected from an arts or music festival. Events can be varied, including lectures, exhibitions, workshops, live demonstrations of experiments, guided tours, and panel discussions. There may also be events linking science to the arts or history, such as plays, dramatised readings, and musical productions. The core content is that of science and technology, but the style comes from the world of the arts.\n\nThe modern concept of a science festival comes from the city of Edinburgh in 1989. The choice of Glasgow as European Capital of Culture for 1990 took Edinburgh by surprise and stimulated it to rebrand itself as a city of science, building on the success of a series of big urban developments led by its Economic Development Department. A senior member of the development team, Ian Wall, proposed that Edinburgh should highlight its new image by complementing its world-famous autumn arts festival with a new type of spring event for which he coined the phrase 'science festival'. Reaction was mixed, with some organisations doubting whether science could be packaged in an arts format. Even so, the city put resources behind the idea, appointing a director and project team, and in April 1989 the first Edinburgh International Science Festival took place.\n\nEdinburgh's success led to the development of science festivals in many other parts of the world. The British Science Association restructured its annual meeting, originally established in 1831 as a discussion forum for scientists, to turn it into the British Science Festival of today. The town of Cheltenham—famous for its jazz, music, and literature festivals— added science to its portfolio with the creation of the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2002.\n\nAs science organizations and funding bodies put ever more emphasis on outreach to foster public understanding both of the results and the wider relevance of science, recent years have seen the creation of a number of new science festivals. An umbrella organization for European science festivals and other science communication events, the European Science Events Association (EUSEA), was formed in 2001 and now has approximately 100 member organizations from 36 different countries.\n\nThe concept spread to Sweden in 1997 with The International Science Festival in Gothenburg which is an annual festival in central Gothenburg, Sweden with thought provoking science activities for the public. The festival is visited by about each year. This makes it the largest popular science event in Sweden and one of the largest popular science events in Europe.\n\nThe spread of science festivals within the United States is relatively recent. One of the earliest examples is Wonderfest, an annual Bay Area science festival that began in 1998. Additionally, the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science includes a number of public events. Focusing on one particular science, the physics festival \"Mastering the Mysteries of the Universe\", was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1999 in association with the centennial of the American Physical Society.\nSince 2004, there has been a science festival in Pittsburgh (the SciTech festival; from 2005 on known as the SciTech Spectacular), and new science festivals have been held in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the Cambridge Science Festival, first held in April 2007); and in New York City (the World Science Festival held at the end of May 2008); and in March 2009, San Diego hosted the first west coast science festival, the San Diego Science Festival founded by Larry Bock.\n\nIn September 2010, the North Carolina Science Festival became the first statewide science festival in the United States, presenting more than 400 events across the state over a two-week span. The second NC Science Festival was held April 13–29, 2012, and the festival is now an annual event. Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at UNC-Chapel Hill founded the North Carolina Science Festival and continues to administer it.\n\nIn late October 2010, the USA Science and Engineering Festival was the \"country’s first national science festival\". This national emphasis was based partly on encouraging local events to coincide with the major event in Washington DC.\n\nFestivals can vary greatly in size and scope. A university might stage a small festival in its hometown. On the other end of the scale, the 2006 British Association Festival of Science held on September 2–9 in Norwich, England, was attended by more than 174,000 visitors.\n\nScience festivals feature a wide variety of events. A typical format for a science festival is to have a series of lectures, with topics ranging from cutting-edge research to unusual perspectives on science. For instance, the 2007 Edinburgh festival \"Big Ideas\" series included talks on what makes racing cars fast, the molecular basis of food preparation, the neurobiology of love and beauty, and the properties of quarks. Most science festivals include hands-on activities similar to those found in science centers. Another popular theme is the interaction of science and culture, including the arts.\n\nScience festivals are also aimed at playing an important, if informal part in secondary science education. Many have events specifically aimed at students and/or teachers, such as workshops or offering curriculum-linked workshops, and science shows to regional schools throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFestivals in Australasia\n\n\nFestivals in Asia\n\n\n\n"}

Since a civilization advanced enough to be capable of manufacturing a new star would likely have vast material and energy resources at its disposal, it almost certainly wouldn't \"need\" to do so.\n\nMany science fiction authors have explored the possible applications of stellar engineering, among them Iain M Banks, Larry Niven and Arthur C.

The Tardis, the ship The Doctor (a renegade Time Lord) flies is actually built around and thus contains an artificially created star, providing the power needed to travel through time and space. \"It's bigger on the inside\"\n\nIn Firefly (TV series), set 500 years in the future, several gas giants are \"Helioformed\" to create viable suns for the surrounding planets and moons.\n\nIn the \"Space Empires\" series the last available technology for research is called Stellar Manipulation. In addition to the ability to create and destroy stars, this branch also gives a race the ability to create and destroy black holes, wormholes, nebulae, planets, ringworlds and sphereworlds. Just as described above, this technology is so advanced that once the player has the ability to use them, they usually don't need them anymore. This is even more the case with the last two; once one of these megastructures is complete, the race controlling the ringworld or sphereworld has almost unlimited resources, usually leading to defeat of the others.\n\nIn \"The Saga of the Seven Suns\", by Kevin J. Anderson, humans are able to convert gas giant planets into stars through the use of a \"Klikiss Torch\". This device creates a wormhole between two points in space, allowing a neutron star to be dropped into the planet and ignite stellar nuclear fusion.\n\n"}

In the interviews, students were asked about what they remembered, how they felt about the task, and how they had approached the task. Analysis of the interviews showed that the students could be divided into two distinct groups:\n\nThese findings were corroborated by the laboratory studies of G. Pask and co-workers. Pask referred to the two groups of students as \"holists\" and \"serialists.\" Holists have a broad focus and see their task in context, using analogies and illustrations. Serialists look at details and at steps in an argument. \n\nResearchers later proposed the “strategic approach or achievement approach” those individuals who try to attain the maximum grade by studying in an organized fashion utilizing time-management skill .   \n\nUsing the following sub-scale: “(1) organized study, (2) time management, (3) being alert to assessment demands, (4) achieving high grades, and (5) monitoring effectiveness” . \n\nLater, Entwistle and McCune (2004) suggest that the strategic approach is an approach to studying rather than an approach to learning but when combined with the deep approach, students seem to show successful academic performance. \n\nMarton has also been involved in the development of phenomenography, a qualitative research methodology. Phenomenography seeks to create a detailed understanding of people's experiences and thoughts.\n\nLearning approaches are not the same as learning styles. Students will use different learning approaches for different tasks.\n\nLearning approaches are not inherent personality traits; they are produced by the interaction of the student with specific learning tasks. \n\n\nAvailable at: http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/iad/Learning_teaching/Academic_teaching/Resources/Experience_of_learning/EoLChapter11.pdf \n"}

Many of the units derive from Japanese units of measurement and have similar names as Chinese units of measurement but different conversions than in mainland China or Hong Kong. In some cases these units are used exclusively, in some cases alongside official metric (SI) units, and in other cases they have been supplanted by metric units. Linguistically, practically all Taiwanese units of measure are Chinese classifiers used to classify nouns.\n\nLinear measure in Taiwan is largely metric but some units derived from traditional Japanese units of measurement remain in use as a legacy of Japanese rule.\n\nUnlike with other measures, area continues to be almost commonly measured with traditional units. The principal unit for measuring the floorspace of an office or apartment, the \"ping\" () derives from the Japanese \"tsubo\", the base unit of the Japanese area. Taiwanese units of land measurement derive from both traditional Dutch and Japanese measurements. The principal unit of land measure, the \"jia\" (), derives from the obsolete Dutch \"morgen\", which was introduced during Taiwan's Dutch era. The \"li\" () represented the area that could be farmed by one man with one ox and one plow in one day.\n\n\nOfficially, land area is measured in hectares and square kilometers.\n\nVolume measure in Taiwan is largely metric, with common units such as liter and milliliter.\n\nPackaged goods in Taiwan largely use metric measurements but bulk foodstuffs sold in wet markets and supermarkets are typically measured with units derived from traditional Japanese units of mass, which are similar but not equivalent to corresponding Chinese units of mass. \n\nNote the tael and catty are widely used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1544179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1544179", "title": "Technogaianism", "text": "Technogaianism\n\nTechnogaianism (a portmanteau word combining \"techno-\" for technology and \"gaian\" for Gaia philosophy) is a bright green environmentalist stance of active support for the research, development and use of emerging and future technologies to help restore Earth's environment. Technogaians argue that developing safe, clean, alternative technology should be an important goal of environmentalists.\n\nThis point of view is different from the default position of radical environmentalists and a common opinion that all technology necessarily degrades the environment, and that environmental restoration can therefore occur only with reduced reliance on technology. Technogaians argue that technology gets cleaner and more efficient with time. They would also point to such things as hydrogen fuel cells to demonstrate that developments do not have to come at the environment's expense. More directly, they argue that such things as nanotechnology and biotechnology can directly reverse environmental degradation. Molecular nanotechnology, for example, could convert garbage in landfills into useful materials and products, while biotechnology could lead to novel microbes that devour hazardous waste.\n\nWhile many environmentalists still contend that \"most\" technology is detrimental to the environment, technogaians point out that it has been in humanity's best interests to exploit the environment mercilessly until fairly recently. This sort of behaviour follows accurately to current understandings of evolutionary systems, in that when new factors (such as foreign species or mutant subspecies) are introduced into an ecosystem, they tend to maximise their own resource consumption until either, \"a)\" they reach an equilibrium beyond which they cannot continue unmitigated growth, or \"b)\" they become extinct. In these models, it is \"completely impossible\" for such a factor to totally destroy its host environment, though they may precipitate major ecological transformation before their ultimate eradication. Technogaians believe humanity has currently reached just such a threshold, and that the only way for human civilization to continue advancing is to accept the tenets of technogaianism and limit future exploitive exhaustion of natural resources and minimize further unsustainable development or face the widespread, ongoing mass extinction of species. The destructive effects of modern civilization can be mitigated by technological solutions, such as using nuclear power. Furthermore, technogaians argue that only science and technology can help humanity be aware of, and possibly develop counter-measures for, risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth such as a possible impact event. \n\nSociologist James Hughes mentions Walter Truett Anderson, author of \"To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal\", as an example of a technogaian political philosopher; argues that technogaianism applied to environmental management is found in the reconciliation ecology writings such as Michael Rosenzweig's \"Win-Win Ecology: How The Earth's Species Can Survive In The Midst of Human Enterprise\"; and considers Bruce Sterling's Viridian design movement to be an exemplary technogaian initiative.\n\nThe theories of English writer Fraser Clark may be broadly categorised as technogaian. Clark advocated \"balancing the hippie right brain with the techno left brain\". The idea of combining technology and ecology were extrapolated at length by a South African eco-anarchist project in the 1990s. The Kagenna Magazine project aimed to combine technology, art and ecology in an emerging movement that could restore the balance between human and nature.\n\nGeorge Dvorsky suggests the sentiment of technogaianism is to heal the Earth, use sustainable technology, and create ecologically diverse environments. Dvorsky argues that defensive counter measures could be designed to counter the harmful effects of asteroid impacts, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Dvorksky also suggest that genetic engineering could be used to reduce the environmental impact humans have on the earth.\n\nTechnology facilities the sampling, testing and monitoring of various environments and ecosystems. NASA uses space-based observations to conduct research on solar activity, sea level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and changes in sea ice and land ice.\n\nClimate engineering is a technogaian method that uses two categories of technologies- carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management. Carbon dioxide removal addresses a cause of climate change by removing one of the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Solar radiation management attempts to offset effects of greenhouse gases by causing the Earth to absorb less solar radiation.\n\nEarthquake engineering is a technogaian method concerned with protecting society and the natural and man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to acceptable levels.\nAnother example of a technogaian practice is an artificial closed ecological system used to test if and how people could live and work in a closed biosphere, while carrying out scientific experiments. It is in some cases used to explore the possible use of closed biospheres in space colonization, and also allows the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's. The most advanced technogaian proposal is the \"terraforming\" of a planet, moon, or other body by deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, or ecology to be similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans.\n\nS. Matthew Liao, professor of philosophy and bioethics at New York University, claims that the human impact on the environment could be reduced by genetically engineering humans to have, a smaller stature, an intolerance to eating meat, and an increased ability to see in the dark, thereby using less lighting. Liao argues that human engineering is less risky than geoengineering.\n\nGenetically modified foods have reduced the amount of herbicide and insecticide needed for cultivation. The development of glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) plants has changed the herbicide use profile away from more environmentally persistent herbicides with higher toxicity, such as atrazine, metribuzin and alachlor, and reduced the volume and danger of herbicide runoff.\n\nAn environmental benefit of Bt-cotton and maize is reduced use of chemical insecticides. A PG Economics study concluded that global pesticide use was reduced by 286,000 tons in 2006, decreasing the environmental impact of herbicides and pesticides by 15%. A survey of small Indian farms between 2002 and 2008 concluded that Bt cotton adoption had led to higher yields and lower pesticide use. Another study concluded insecticide use on cotton and corn during the years 1996 to 2005 fell by of active ingredient, which is roughly equal to the annual amount applied in the EU. A Bt cotton study in six northern Chinese provinces from 1990 to 2010 concluded that it halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders and extended environmental benefits to neighbouring crops of maize, peanuts and soybeans.\n\n"}

She is also the author of \"Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster,\" published in 2012, which has been released in hardcover, trade paperback, e-book and audio editions. The book has also been translated into French, Italian and Chinese.\n\nTere was raised in Los Angeles, California, where her perspective was shaped and influenced by the city itself, along with the music, imagery and pop culture of the late 1960s. She spent her teen years going to clubs on the Sunset Strip to see musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Michael Bloomfield and Jim Morrison perform. \n\nRocker Jim Morrison's girlfriend, Pamela Courson, discovered Tere and recruited her to design for her La Cienega Boulevard boutique, Themis. Simultaneously, Tere was hired as an apprentice by Young Edwardian, then the most important junior fashion label in the country, to sketch designs in the back room. Six months later, she proved herself by designing a collection which sold tens of millions of dollars at retail stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, and Neiman-Marcus. Before reaching voting age, Tere herself had become a force in the fashion industry.\n\nTere caught the attention of Andy Warhol in Los Angeles. They invited her to visit the Factory, then at 33 Union Square West, when she came to New York. Soon she was writing for and being written about in Andy Warhol's \"Interview Magazine\". Warhol once described Tere as \"looking like Hedy Lamarr and acting like Lucille Ball.\" Her passion for rock music segued into film, which resulted in her interviewing many prominent filmmakers for the magazine, such as Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese.\n\nNext, she was cast in the black comedy, \"Andy Warhol's Bad\" (1977), directed by Jed Johnson. She played the mother of an autistic child, which was a ground-breaking subject for film at the time.\n\nTere continued creating fashion trends (her designs garnered 24 covers of \"Women's Wear Daily\") and setting trends in her personal life with her idiosyncratic apartment, which was featured in \"Architectural Digest\" and as an early collector of artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat. Golden Age of Hollywood photographer, George Hurrell, was brought out of retirement to photograph her.\n\nShe emerged from a hiatus to design cutting-edge fashions for the twenty-somethings of the 21st Century. Paris Hilton was soon seen wearing Tere Tereba's latest designs for bebe stores.\n\nNo longer active in the fashion world, Tereba has written a biography of the notorious Hollywood mob boss Mickey Cohen that delves into the Los Angeles underworld, titled \"Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster.\" The book was released on May 1, 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

A highly acclaimed, bestselling work, it is still in print today.\n\nIn the book, Bernstein completely abandons the traditional academic style of books on classical music. Some of the chapters are cast in the style of conversations about music between Bernstein and several imaginary people. (One of these conversations contains Bernstein's thoughts on Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\", a work he never conducted or recorded.) Other chapters of the book are made up of complete transcribed scripts of Bernstein's television music lectures of the 1950s, taken from the TV show \"Omnibus\". They include his famous dissection of the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. But the published scripts rely heavily on printed musical illustrations, so readers unfamiliar with music notation were once unable to appreciate them fully. However, all of Bernstein's \"Omnibus\" lectures have recently been released on DVD, so readers of \"The Joy of Music\" are now able to hear the musical examples they may have been unable to read. The program on jazz was also recorded on an LP and has been released on CD. The Beethoven's Fifth lecture has also been released on CD, but in an unfortunate format making it impossible to listen without hearing \"feedback\" in different languages.\n"}

It is performed primarily in April (chopail), May (danoh), July (Basin) and August (Thanksgiving) and also sometimes in a ceremony which prays for rain. The name originates from the place where mask-playing started, Yangju province in Korea. It was the first mask play to be designated as an \"Important Intangible Cultural Property\".\n\nAccording to the Korean official culture information service, Yangju byeolsandae nori was started by government officials working in Yangju province. In Yangju, a group of entertainers called Ttakttakyipae from Hanyang came to perform every April and May but they frequently broke their promise and failed to put on a show. As a result, the officials in Yangju started to make their own mask drama and hold performances. Lee Eul-chuk was the main organiser of the show and the first to produce mask dramas in Yangju. At that time, Yangju was both a big town and transport hub, and also a city with many officials. So the Yangju byeolsandae nori become the special play that was performed by people living near the Yangju office. Sandae nori is also called \"sandi nori\", \"sanji nori\" or \"sandu nori\" and originated from \"sandae gabhee\", a welcoming ceremony for Chinese diplomats. It spread mainly from Seoul and Gyeonggi Province to Aeohgae (now Ahyeon-dong), Manrijae, Gameundol (now Heukseokdong), Nokbeon, Sajikgol, Gupabal, Nodes (now Noryangjin), Toegyewon and Uijeongbu but it is not performed in these regions any more. \n\nBefore the mask drama starts, a ceremony takes place praying for a good performance and traditional foods are served. These include jora, tteok and fruits organized in three colors, head of beef and leg of pork. Usually rich people and merchants in town paid the cost of the show and the performers were unpaid. The performance took place at Sagikgol, which is to the north of Mount Bulgok in the town. There had been a shaman house there and props needed for the show were placed inside. There were no rules as to the exact times of performances but they usually started in the evening and ended at dawn the following day. Occasionally, it was shortened to three or four hours. The main instruments used in the performance were two piri (flute), one jeotdae, one haegeum, one janggu and one buk which are all traditional Korean instruments. Kkwaenggari was added when it was needed and sometimes players danced with only piri and janggu. They used the rhythms of taryong or gutgurigok and the dance style was divided into geodeureumsik and kkaekkisik. Yangju byeolsandae nori is organized with mainly dancing to music like other talchum, and it is divided into dance performance, miming and drama where the actors have set lines. The traditional characters include Sangjwa, lotus and nunkkeumjjeokyi, waejangnyeo, aesadang, somu, veteran, monkeys, haesanmo, podo Director and miyal grandma. Some roles do not have any words so only dancing and gesture are required but other roles have lines as well as dance and gesture. The typical Bongsan Talchum is in verse but in Yangju byeolsandae nori, the lines are in prose.\n\nYangju byeolsandae nori is organized with 32 characters but as some masks are used in two or three ways, only 22 masks are used during the performance. The 22 characters are two Sangjwa, scabies, four mokjung, yeonip, nunkkeumjjeokyi, wanbo, sinjubu, waejangnyeo, nojang, two Somu, maltuki, monkeys, Chwibari, one sanim, podo Director, sinhalahbi and miyal grandma.\n\n"}

It was originally created in the 1960s to promote the Catalan language and spread Catalan culture.\n\nOver the years it has increased its involvement in broader social issues; in 2012 it committed itself to Catalan independence, specifically demanding the right of self-determination for Catalonia.\n\nÒmnium Cultural was created on 11 July 1961 in the context of Francoist Spain when the institutional use of Catalan was forbidden. In 1963 the Francoist authorities closed down the association. Òmnium had to continue to exist as a clandestine association between 1963–1967. In 1967, after a long legal case before the Francoist courts, the association won its right to exist and was once again authorised.\n\nIn order to promote Catalan culture within the many limits of Francoism, Òmnium was the main creator and sponsor of various awards and literary contests for works published in Catalan, such as the \"Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes\" (1969). In the early 1970s it established the \"Nit de Santa Llúcia\" a festival of Catalan literature where three prizes are awarded: the \"Premi Sant Jordi\" (novel), the \"Premi Mercè Rodoreda\" (short story) and the \"Premi Carles Riba\" (poetry).\n\nAfter the Francoist dictatorship ended in 1975, Òmnium continued its work promoting Catalan language and culture. Once democracy was restored, Òmnium supported and defended Catalan self-government, especially from the Spanish Constitutional Court's rejection of the new \"Estatut\" onwards. One million people marched on 10 July 2010 in Barcelona calling for national self-determination in a 2010 Catalan autonomy protest organised by Òmnium.\n\nIt was one of the main organisations pressing for Catalan politicians to hold a Catalan self-determination referendum in 2017.\n\nÒmnium reached a membership of 115,000 in 2018 and has nearly 40 regional offices besides the headquarters in Barcelona. In December 2015, Jordi Cuixart was elected president, by a large majority, in elections in which 5,719 members participated, over 10% of the then membership of 50,000.\n\nBetween 2005–2012 the association received different grants from the Catalan government (Generalitat), including €1.4 million in 2011.\n\nIn 2013 the association announced that it would no longer receive funding from the Catalan government. In 2016, different local authorities gave grants to Òmnium, basically for local cultural activities, for a value of €144,404.12, out of a total income in 2016 of €4.4 million.\n\nIn 2009 the Generalitat officially named Omnium as a public interest body, thus automatically conferring a more favourable tax regime for the association.\n\nÒmnium Cultural cooperates with other organizations that share similar goals in other Catalan-speaking territories: Acció Cultural del País Valencià (in the Valencian Community) and Obra Cultural Balear (in the Balearic Islands).\n\nIt was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi by the Generalitat in 1984.\n\nIn November 2015 Òmnium was condemned by the Audiencia Nacional, an exceptional high court, for the unauthorised use and deficient custody of personal data, after its data had been stolen by a hacker. This led to a €200,000 sanction imposed by the Spanish agency responsible for data protection.\n\nÒmnium Cultural had more than 128,000 members in October 2018.\n\n"}
