{"id": "7949484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7949484", "title": "2006 Ferentari riot", "text": "2006 Ferentari riot\n\nA small riot took place in Ferentari-Zăbrăuți area of Bucharest, Romania on the evening of November 14, 2006. Ferentari is Bucharest's poorest district, and has the city's largest population of Roma people.\n\nThe riot took place after four Roma children were asphyxiated in the basement of an apartment block in the Zăbrăuţi area on November 13, as a result of a fire caused by candles. The children had lived with their mother in their dwelling for more than two years, and were obliged to light the basement with candles as they had no access to electricity.\n\nAccording to the administrator of the apartment block, none of the building's inhabitants had formal access to electricity for four years, with many people connecting themselves illegally to the electricity grid.\n\nThe riot occurred because Electrica decided to cut the electricity of some blocks, due to energy theft and consumer debts. However, power outages occurred for several blocks, including few consumers without debts. In most flats there was no central heating and people were using electric radiators (which are costly to operate). There were also some apartments with air conditioners, so the total debts rose to €400,000. The stolen energy was estimated to €430,000 per month.\n\nAccording to the protesters, the local council of Sector 5 had repeatedly refused to authorize their re-connection to the grid. This led to around 200 inhabitants from the Zăbrăuţi area to violently protest against their situation, by torching tires, blocking traffic in the area and breaking the window of a fire truck, while calling for the electricity supply to be restored. However, only 20% of the inhabitants of the area had any papers proving ownership or rent over the said flats, with the rest being squatters.\n\nThe electricity provider was criticized for not cutting the energy in summer, so that people could make plans for winter.\n\nBoth the electricity provider and Bucharest 5'th Sector, Marian Vanghelie were criticized for concluding electricity supply contracts for those blocks, as they were built as temporary shelter for construction workers and were never finalized. Apart from electricity, they do not have a fresh water supply, sewage or heating.\n\nMarian Vanghelie said he would not make any concessions. President Traian Băsescu also commented on the events: \"I stand by my previous statement. Bucharest is not for everyone. Every one of us must pay [our bills]!\" ().\n\nRealitatea TV was presenting a news broadcast about the riot at the same time with the planned show about the latest ranking of the richest Romanians made by the publication \"Capital\", at which Cristian Țânțăreanu and Gigi Becali were invited to speak about their wealth. Cristian Țânțăreanu said the ranking contained the 300 richest Romanians and there were about 300 people protesting, so why shouldn't every one of them help one of the poor people who were protesting. Gigi Becali said he would donate enough money to help all the protesting people, but he doesn't have time to make sure that the respective people would also go to work (clean their buildings, etc.), as Țânțăreanu suggested. At that time Becali didn't know how much money this would cost him; he was later informed it was ~€400,000, which he paid.\n\nBecali was criticized for this, as it might be unfair for the ones who only through effort managed to pay the energy bills. Alex Savitescu, said \"crime becomes not only understood, accepted, but rewarded\".\n\nAccording to a poll made by students from SNSPA (The National School for Political and Administrative Studies) two days after the protests, if elections where to be held the following Sunday, 93% of people from Zăbrăuți would go to vote and 70% would vote for Gigi Becali as President, and 55.1% would vote for his party, the New Generation Party – Christian Democratic (PNG). At the meeting where people were thanking him, he said\nPe mine mă cheamă Becali. Cuvântul meu e literă de Evanghelie. Nu o să pot să fac toată țara asta, o să fac toată țara asta când o să devin președinte și o să mă doară inima de români(My name is Becali. My word is as good as the word of the Holy Scripture. I cannot do the same for everyone in this country now but I will do so when I become president and as president I'll feel the grief of the Romanian people).\n\n\n"}

Kenyan government officials asserted that many of the murders and blasts were carried out by Al-Shabaab in retaliation for Operation Linda Nchi, a coordinated military mission between the Somalian military and Kenyan military that began in October 2011, when troops from Kenya crossed the border into the conflict zones of southern Somalia. According to Kenyan security experts, the bulk of the attacks were increasingly carried out by radicalized Kenyan youth who were hired for the purpose. Kenya security officials also indicated that they were part of death squads, which carried out many of the killings under the orders of a government security council. By mid-2014, the cumulative attacks began affecting Kenya's tourism industry, as Western nations issued travel warnings to their citizens.\n\nSince the Operation Linda Nchi began, Al-Shabaab vowed retaliation against the Kenyan authorities. At the militant group's urging, a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya have since been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to Islam. Estimates in 2014 placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 25% of Al-Shabaab's total forces. Referred to as the \"Kenyan Mujahideen\" by Al-Shabaab's core members, the converts are typically young and overzealous, poverty making them easier targets for the outfit's recruitment activities. Because the Kenyan insurgents have a different profile from the Somali and Arab militants that allows them to blend in with the general population of Kenya, they are also often harder to track. Reports suggest that Al-Shabaab is attempting to build an even more multi-ethnic generation of fighters in the larger region. One such recent convert who helped carry out the Kampala bombings but now cooperates with the Kenyan police believes that in doing so, the group is essentially trying to use local Kenyans to do its \"dirty work\" for it while its core members escape unscathed. According to diplomats, Muslim areas in coastal Kenya and Tanzania, such as Mombasa and Zanzibar, are also especially vulnerable for recruitment.\n\nIn December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al-Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the extrajudicial killings. The murders reportedly totaled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed \"Makaburi\", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the International Bar Association, Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported death squads, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges.\n\nBy May 2014, the United States, United Kingdom, France and Australia began issuing travel warnings to their citizens in Kenya. This had an immediate impact on Kenya's tourism industry, as European visitors left the country and hotel establishments were consequently forced to lay off staff. The U.S. also reduced its staff levels at its Nairobi embassy. In June 2014, the U.K. likewise shut down its Honorary Consulate in Mombasa over security concerns.\n\nThe first attack by al-Shabaab was on a blue-collar bar known as Mwaura's in downtown Mfangano Street in Nairobi on Monday, 24 October 2011, at around 1:15 am. The hurled grenade left one person dead and wounded more than 20. Police said that the weapon used was a Russian-made F1 grenade.\n\nA second blast occurred later the same day, when a grenade was tossed out of a moving vehicle into the Machakos bus terminus. 59 men and ten women were subsequently hospitalised, of which two were in intensive care and five people were confirmed dead.\n\nThe attacks came only two days after the United States warned of \"imminent\" terror attacks. The US warning had implied that al-Shabaab would carry out reprisals in response to Kenyan troops' incursion into Somalia in mid-October. Elgiva Bwire Oliacha, a recent Kenyan Muslim convert, was arrested in connection with the two blasts and was sentenced to life in prison after having pleaded guilty to all charges.\n\nAl-Shabaab was suspected of carrying out a few more attacks in October as well. In November 2011, Al-Shabaab attacked several other locations including the East African Pentecostal Church, a military convoy, and a Holiday Inn hotel. The militant group is suspected of carrying out nine attacks in Kenya in December 2011; some of the attacks resulted in injuries and casualties while some resulted in no injuries.\n\nMilitants were responsible for several attacks over the first few months of 2012. In January, there were three reported attacks, including the killing of the chairperson of the Community Peace and Security Team in Hagadera camp as well as several police officers. It was also reported that Kenyan police seized explosive equipment in an Ifo camp in the Dadaab complex, arresting nine suspects. In February, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for an attack that resulted in the death of a police officer and a civilian while injuring two other civilians. On 10 March 2012, six were killed and over sixty were injured after four grenades were thrown into a Machakos bus station in Nairobi.\n\nOn Sunday, 29 April 2012, around 8:50am, an attack took place at God's House of Miracles Church at Ngara Estate in Nairobi. As reported by one of the dailies, an attacker, who goes by the name Amar, entered the church and left. He later came back and took a seat in the back, hurling the grenade at worshipers while they had been called by the pastor to the pulpit. The experts said that the grenade used had been made in China.\n\nOne person died and 11 people were admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital.\n\nOn Tuesday, 15 May, three hand grenades were hurled at the Bella Vista nightclub in Mombasa, Kenya, killing one and leaving five others injured. The attacker also fired indiscriminately after he was denied entry into the Bella Vista club. A woman died as a result of a gunshot to the chest the two guards were injured. A suspect who had sustained injuries in the attack was arrested in connection to the assault. A bus ticket to Nairobi was recovered from the suspect and a magazine loaded with eight rounds of ammunition. Police arrested a suspect Mr. Thabit Jamaldin Yahya. He is still in remand.\n\nOn Monday, 28 May, a blast went off from inside the Sasa Boutique located within Assanand's House on Nairobi's Moi Avenue. 27 people were injured in the blast, and it was reported that four were in critical condition. Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said that the explosion was the result of either a grenade or a bomb. Over the course of four other May attacks, one police officer was killed and numerous others were injured.\n\nOn Sunday, 24 June at around 10 pm EAT, another grenade attack was reported at a Jericho Beer Garden in Mishomoroni, Kisauni Constituency in Mombasa, Kenya. The bar was packed with patrons who had gathered to watch the UEFA European Championships 2012 football match between England and Italy. The grenade killed one person on the spot while two more died due to injuries while they were receiving treatment at the Coast general hospital. 30 more were injured, including a suspect who was alleged to be part of the attackers, a 9-year-old boy.\n\nThis attack happened on the same day the Kenyan Navy had taken away two explosive devices that had been found floating in the Indian Ocean. The US government (through its embassy in Kenya) had issued a warning to its citizens to leave the coastal city of Mombasa due to a possible imminent attack. Athman Salim, a 23-year-old Kenyan day labourer from the Kilifi District was the main suspect of the attack. Although a Muslim, Athman denied any involvement with extremist groups or having ever journeyed to Somalia. He claimed that he had visited the pub to listen some local music, and indicated that he had never worked outside the city of Mombasa. He was released on 9 July after spending 10 days in Nyali police station.\n\nOn 1 July at around 10:15 am EAT, masked gunmen attacked two churches (the Central Catholic Cathedral and AIC churches) simultaneously in Garissa, located approximately 140 kilometres from the Somali border. The assailants killed seventeen people and left fifty injured. The churches are 3 kilometres apart and the dead included two police officers, four men, nine women and two children. The North Eastern Police Provincial Officer (PPO) Philip Ndolo reported that the gunmen attacked the two policemen first and took their firearms before they proceeded to attack the churches. The attackers used pistols to shoot the policemen at point blank range and then snatched their G3 rifles which were later used to shoot at the AIC church worshipers indiscriminately. No shooting was reported at the Catholic's Central Cathedral but a hand grenade was set off, resulting in less casualties than the AIC attack. The Supreme Muslim Council (SUPKEM) in Kenya warned of a misinterpretation of this attack as a religious war against the Christians. A joint effort by the Kenya Police, Administration Police, National Security Intelligence Service and the paramilitary General Service Unit saw the arrest of 83 suspects in connection with the attack during a massive security swoop after the attack.\n\nFour people were reported injured on 18 July when two hand grenades went off at a barbershop in Wajir. In addition, three police officers were injured on 25 July when their patrol hit a landmine.\n\nPolice also arrested a man who was carrying two grenades at the Nakuru Agricultural Show shortly before President Mwai Kibaki arrived to deliver a speech. It was also reported that they arrested two men with four hand grenades in Kitale as they were boarding a Nairobi-bound bus; a third man escaped capture.\n\nOn the evening of 3 August, one person was killed and six more were left injured at the Eastleigh neighbourhood near the Kenya Airforce headquarters in Nairobi. The attack came on the eve of a visit by Hillary Clinton, the United States secretary of state. The suicide bombing was inadvertently carried out by an innocent carrier of the detonated home-made device. The attackers have adopted a new way of executing their plans by giving unsuspecting citizens armed home-made explosives that they in turn detonate remotely at a safe distance. The attackers have been using ordinary home equipment like the transistor radios and gas cylinders in their new methods. This attack on 3 August blew the upper torso of the carrier of the transistor radio which contained the explosive. On 28 August, three Kenyan policeman are killed and over a dozen wounded in a grenade attack during riots in the port city of Mombasa over the killing of Islamist cleric Aboud Rogo Mohammed.\n\nOn 30 September, at around 10:30am, a 9-year-old boy was killed when a grenade was hurled towards Sunday school children at St Polycarp Anglican Church along Juja road in Nairobi. On 21 September, four police officers and three civilians were injured during a series of two explosions. The first explosion targeted a GSU lorry and the secondary explosion went off when officers rushed to the scene.\n\nThere were several attacks on Administration Police officers in September. On 30 September, two police officers were shot dead from behind while patrolling along Ngamia road in Garissa. Additionally, on 15 September, two Administration Police officers were injured in an explosion when their vehicle hit a landmine.\n\nOn 27 October, CID officer Yussuf Yero was shot and killed in a Hagdera, Daadab mosque as he read the Koran.\n\nOn 20 November, Kenya Defence Forces were involved in an operation in Garissa, where KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters, killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents received treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by Farah Maalim, accused Kenyan officers of fomenting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), if the perpetrators are not brought to justice. Maalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval, and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2billion in missed revenue. Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation. CJPC Bishops also urged Kenyans to resist engaging in violence, and instead to report offences to the relevant authorities.\n\nAdditionally, several police officers were killed and injured as attacks escalated. It was reported that on 11 November at least 38 police officers are killed by cattle rustlers in the northern part of the country. On 1 November, a policeman was on shot dead and another seriously injured on by assailants in Garissa town. The officers were on patrol when they were ambushed by four men, one of whom was a teenager. On 4 November, a policeman has been killed and 10 people were injured in a grenade attack on a church in Kenya.\n\nOn Sunday, 18 November, ten people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosive went off on a mass transit mini-bus (matatu) in Eastleigh. The explosion is believed to be an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort. Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensues. Somalis defend their property, and interpret the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community. Relative calm reportedly returns by mid-afternoon.\n\nOn Wednesday, 5 December, around 7pm, an explosion went off in the Joska area of Eastleigh, Nairobi, killing one person and wounding six others.\nThe explosion that occurred during rush hour traffic was caused by a roadside bomb, and was not far from the site of a blast a few weeks earlier.\n\nOn Friday, 7 December, around 7:30pm, five people were killed and eight others injured in an explosion near a mosque in the Eastleigh area of Nairobi. The wounded included the area member of parliament Abdi Yusuf Hassan. A second attack was carried out at the same mosque on 16 December, seriously injuring one person.\n\nOn 19 December, two people were injured after two blasts went off outside Al Amin mosque in Eastleigh area of Nairobi.

The assailants also stole a G3 rifle from the two constables.\n\nOn 4 January, at 7 pm, two people were killed and seven wounded in a grenade attack at Dagahale area in Garissa. The grenade was hurled from a saloon car at a tent where people were chewing khat.\n\nA grenade was thrown into a police vehicle as it drove past a crowd along Ngamia road near the local District Officer's (DO) office on 7 January 2013. Four people including three police officers were seriously wounded in a grenade attack on a police car in Garissa town. On 8 January, one of the wounded, a 22-year-old man, succumbed to injuries. The number of wounded admitted in hospital was confirmed as eight people including four police officers.\n\nOn the evening of 9 January, two grenades were thrown into the World Food Programme (WFP) compound in Mandera Town. There were no injuries reported. The blast occurred as a group of worshipers was leaving a nearby mosque after their prayers.\n\nOn 16 January, suspected Islamic militants shot dead five people and injured three others at a restaurant in the eastern city of Garissa.

In his preface, Giles claims that such a work of history was not already available, even in Chinese, since Chinese scholars realized the \"uttter hopelessness\" of \"achieving even comparative success in a general historical survey of the subject\". But he adds that \"It may be said without offence that a work which would be inadequate to the requirements of a native public, may properly be submitted to English readers as an introduction into the great field which lies beyond\". A large part of the book is devoted to translations, \"enabling the Chinese author, so far as is possible, to speak for himself\".\n\nThe scholar and writer Lin Yutang commented that \"'History of Chinese Literature' was a misnomer; it was a series of attempted essays on certain Chinese works, and was not even an outline covering the successive periods.” \n\nQian Zhongshu noted what he called an \"amusing mistake\" in Giles' \"very readable book.\" Giles \n\nEzra Pound used Giles' translations as the basis for what have been called his English \"translations of translations\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56176898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56176898", "title": "Alliteration (Latin)", "text": "Alliteration (Latin)\n\nThe term alliteration was invented by the Italian humanist Giovanni Pontano (1426–1503), in his dialogue \"Actius\", to describe the practice common in Virgil, Lucretius, and other Roman writers of beginning words or syllables with the same consonant or vowel. He gives examples such as Sale Saxa Sonabant\" \"the rocks were resounding with the salt-water\" or Anchisen Agnovit Amicum\" \"he recognised his friend Anchises\" or \"Multa Munita Virum Vi\" \"defended by a great force of men\".\n\nPontano also used it to refer to repetition of letters in medial positions. Among other kinds, he mentions the frequent case when the last syllable of a word begins with the same consonant as the first syllable of the next word, as in \"loRicam ex aeRe Rigentem\" \"the rigid breastplate made of bronze\" (Virgil). Since \"x\" was pronounced \"cs\", the phrase \"Sale SacSa Sonabant\" \"the rocks were resounding with sea water\" (Virgil) can also be considered an example of this kind.\n\nAlliteration was a prominent feature of Latin literature (in contrast to Greek), especially in poetry in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, and continued to be used by some writers even in the Middle Ages. \n\nScholars differ as to how alliteration should be defined. Some, such as Keith Maclennan (2017), suggest that the term alliteration should be used only of repeated sounds at the beginning of words, and assonance of sounds repeated in another context. Tracy (1884) also gives examples only of word-initial alliteration.\n\nHowever, Pontano himself, who invented the term, used it also of the alliteration of medial consonants. The French scholars A. Cordier (1939) and (1933) similarly define it as \"the repetition, near or exact, of a phoneme or group of phonemes at the beginning of syllables (e.g. \"fanfare\") or at the beginning of words (e.g. \"bel et bien\") nearby one another in the utterance.\"\n\nThe German classicist August Ferdinand Naeke (1829) also accepted internal alliteration and cited examples such as \"paene eFFregisti Fatue Foribus cardines\" \"you've nearly broken the hinges of the door, you idiot!\" (Plautus), in which the first F, though medial, clearly contributes to the effect of the whole.\n\nThe Lucretius specialists (1947) and Margaret Deutsch (1939), on the other hand, give a slightly different definition. They define alliteration as the repetition of \"consonants\" (whether initial or medial), and assonance as the repetition of \"vowel\" sounds or of syllables. From the examples Bailey gives, such as \"ipse\", it is clear that he considered that consonants at the end of syllables and words could contribute to alliteration as well as those at the beginning.\n\nThus when several words in a row begin with the same vowel, as in \"Incidit Ictus Ingens ad terram\" \"the huge man, struck, falls to the ground\" (Virgil), some scholars follow Pontano in referring to it as alliteration, while others such as Bailey use the term assonance.\n\nConversely, when a medial consonant is involved, as in \"SaXa Sonabant\", it is called \"internal alliteration\" by Bailey but would be considered as assonance by Maclennan.\n\nAlthough simple alliteration involving only the initial consonants of words is very common, in Latin authors of all periods it will often be found that primary alliteration on an initial consonant is accompanied by a secondary or \"minor\" alliteration on a medial consonant. Thus Cicero's PaTent PorTae\" \"the gates are open\" as well as the primary alliteration of P has minor alliteration of T. Occasionally there are two minor consonants involved, as in LaCūS LuCoSque\" \"lakes and groves\" (Cicero) or SeRPentum SPiRiS \"with coils of snakes\" (Virgil).\n\nIn other examples, the same consonant occurs both initially and medially, e.g. Cum seCuri CaudiCali\" (Plautus) and CaeCo Carpitur\" (Virgil) with C, or \"loRicam ex aeRe Rigentem\" (Virgil) with R. Often two different consonants are involved in the same phrase, partly initial and partly medial: Magnae MeTus TuMulTus\" (Naevius) and \"ne Me TerreTe TiMenTem\" (Virgil) with M and T; MoLLīs LaMbere fLaMMa coMas\" and MoLLis fLaMMa MeduLLas\" with M and L (Virgil); and ReGi de GRaecia\" (Nepos), \"ReGina GRavi\" (Virgil) and \"peRGe ... diRiGe GRessum\" (Virgil) with R and G.\n\nAny account of alliteration in Latin must therefore take such cases into consideration. However, as Bailey warns, caution must be observed in recognising such examples, as the internal alliteration may sometimes be accidental.\n\nAlliteration frequently overlaps with assonance, which is defined by one dictionary as \"a resemblance in the sounds of words or syllables, either between their vowels (e.g. \"meat, bean\") or between their consonants (e.g. \"keep, cape\")\". (This latter kind is also known as consonance.)\n\nBy this definition some of the examples which Naeke calls alliteration, such as fur trifurcifer \"thief who wears three yokes\" (Plautus), \"neque fīctum, neque pīctum, neque scrīptum\" \"it's never been imagined, or painted, or written\" (Plautus), or \"labōrat e dolōre\" \"she is overcome with grief\" (Terence) would usually these days be referred to as assonance.\n\nOften alliteration and assonance are combined, as in \"sAnguine LARgo colL' ARmosque LAvant\" \"with copious blood they wash their necks and shoulders\" (Virgil), where there is alliteration of L L L, but also assonance of A AR AR A.\n\nThe earliest appearance of alliteration in Latin seems to have been not in poetry but in proverbs and popular sayings, and phrases of a religious or legal character. Examples of popular phrases are: Oleum et Operam perdere\" \"to waste both oil and time\", Cave Canem\" \"beware of the dog\", Vivus Vidensque\" \"alive and well\", Satis Superque\" \"enough and more\", Albus an Ater\" \"white or black\", Publica Privata\" \"public and private\", and so on. Legal and religious phrases included such as Tabulae Testesque\" \"tablets and witnesses\", Arae et Altaria\" \"altars and shrines\", Tecta Templa\" \"houses and temples\", Fortes Fideles\" \"brave and loyal\", Fusi Fugati\" \"routed and put to flight\", Fors Fortuna\" \"Chance and Fortune\". Frequently such alliterating phrases show asyndeton, i.e. the two words are placed side by side with no conjunction such as \"et\" \"and\". Another example of this is the boast \"Veni Vidi Vici\" \"I came, I saw, I conquered\" attributed to Julius Caesar.\n\nIt has been noted that in these phrases that if one of two alliterated words has an \"a\" in it, it is usually placed second: Ferro Flammaque\" \"by sword and flame\", Longe Lateque\" \"far and wide\", Colles Campique\" \"hills and plains\", Multi et Magni\" \"many and great\". When the words are of unequal length, the shorter one usually precedes: Fama Fortuna\" \"fame and fortune\", Aurum Argentum\" \"gold and silver\", \"Cura Custodiaque\" \"care and custody\", and so on. As both and Cordier noted, the Latin language naturally lends itself to such phrases, making them part of everyday speech. Some apparent examples of alliteration therefore are likely to be fortuitous, for example Jesus's saying \"ego sum Via et Veritas et Vita\" \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life\" (John 14.6), which is translated from a Greek original.\n\nSome of the early prayers (\"carmina\") which survive, such as the one which begins as follows, are partly alliterative, but the alliteration is not maintained throughout the prayer:\n\nIt contains alliterative lines such as this:\n\nHowever, much of the prayer is not alliterative. McGann (1958) concludes that alliteration is an important but occasional device which adds greatly to the effect of the composition, but does not perform a structural function in the \"carmen\" as a whole.\n\nThe earliest Latin poems, unlike early Germanic and English poetry, do not have obligatory alliteration. Most of the fragments of the early accentual Saturnian poetry listed by Lindsay exhibit no alliteration, although some do, for example the following line, attributed to Naevius (c.270–c.201 BC), which has alliteration of M, P, and T:\n\nThe epic poet Ennius (c.239–c.169 BC) made very frequent use of alliteration. In the following hexameter, the primary alliteration with T is supported by a secondary medial alliteration of R to reinforce the idea of terror and trembling:\n\nT and R are also used in the following often-quoted line:\n\nTo a greater extent than later poets, Ennius often uses the same alliteration throughout the line:\n\nAnother famous line is the following:\n\nThis line was quoted with disapproval for its excessive alliteration in the Rhetorica ad Herennium 4.12, and some modern critics have called it \"almost absurd\" or \"embarrassing\".\n\nAnother Ennius example, which Austin describes as \"noble\", is the following iambic octonarius. Here there is assonance between \"Magna Templa ...\" and \"-Mixta sTellis\" at corresponding places in the two halves of the line, combined with alliteration of C, S, and minor alliteration of L and P:\n\nThe comic playwright Plautus also has innumerable instances of alliteration, usually for comic effect:\n\nThe other surviving comic playwright, Terence, by contrast, used alliteration hardly at all, and this is a major difference between his work and that of Plautus. Naeke, who quotes numerous examples from Plautus, can cite only a few from Terence, including the following:\n\nCicero in his poetry has frequent examples of alliteration, but usually involving only two or three words in any one verse. In the following lines, which describe the killing of Orion by the Scorpion as depicted in the stars, the primary alliteration of V V V is accompanied by minor alliteration of D, C, T, F and R:\n\nLucretius and Virgil also both used alliteration widely, Lucretius \"with striking power in many memorable passages\" (Austin). In Virgil, alliteration was \"no longer an external ornament ... but an inner secret of sound, subtly employed to serve emotion\".\n\nIn Horace and Catullus it occurs much less frequently. Nonetheless even in Catullus there are lines such as the following with its delicate alternation of C, G, T and D sounds, which appear to imitate the shaking of a tambourine:\n\nIn his lament for his dead brother the chiastic alliteration F M M F is reinforced by minor alliteration of T:\n\nOvid employs alliteration much less obviously than Lucretius and Virgil (some examples are given below). He sometimes seems to play with words, as when Apollo tells his son Phaethon:\n\nIn Lucan alliteration is found, although not as commonly as in Virgil. His epic poem on the Civil War begins as follows, with an alliteration on C, P and V:\n\nAlliteration is rarely used in Juvenal and Martial, although there are occasional phrases such as \"Periturae ParCere Chartae\" (\"to spare paper which is going to perish anyway\") (Juvenal) or the following from Martial, in which L, C, and S are interwoven: \n\nAlthough alliteration is found most often in poetry, Pontano notes that prose writers also sometimes used it, and quotes from a sentence from Cicero's treatise Brutus: \n\nIn his speeches, Cicero uses alliteration sparingly, but effectively, as in famous suggestion to Catiline: \n\nAgain using assonance as well as alliteration, in an emotional moment of indignation in the \"pro Sulla\" he says:\n\nNear the ending of the 2nd Philippic oration Cicero uses both alliteration and assonance to add force to an unexpected metaphor. The major alliteration, on stressed initial syllables, is D P P D P; but there is also internal or minor alliteration of L D D L as well as assonance of PAR PAR:\n\nIn another example from the same paragraph of the 2nd Philippic, with alternation of M, R, and L, Cicero says:\n\nSome orators evidently used alliteration too much, however, causing the author of the \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" (c. 80 BC) to complain about \"eiusdem litterae nimia assiduitas\" \"the excessive use of the same letter\".\n\nAmong historians Nepos, according to Rolfe, used it \"to excess\". The following sentence is an example: \n\nTacitus did not make great of use alliteration generally, but was fond of alliterative pairs of words such as Largitio et Luxus\" \"generosity and extravagance\" or Socordia ducum, Seditione legionum\" \"by laziness of the generals, and insurrection of the legions\".\n\nAlliteration became very frequent again in north African authors of the 2nd and 3rd century A.D.: \"It occurs on almost every page of Apuleius, Fronto, and Tertullian, and is very common in Cyprian\".\n\nSome scholars have performed statistical studies on different poets. Clarke (1976) compared Virgil and Ovid, finding minor differences in their usage. For example, Ovid tends frequently to put alliterating words in the first half of the verse, while Virgil is more likely to put them in the second half. In both poets, the most likely position for an alliterating word is after the 3rd-foot caesura, and the second most common the beginning of the verse. Often there is alliteration in both of these places at once, as in the following line of Ovid:\n\nGreenberg (1980), who criticises Clarke's study as statistically unsound in some respects, compares Virgil and Lucretius. One of his conclusions is that Lucretius is more likely than Virgil to use three or more initially alliterating words in the same line, for example: \n\nIn order to simplify their investigation, neither scholar takes internal alliteration into account, or alliterations such as \"incidit ictus ingens\" which spread over more than one line. However, Greenberg states: \"There is no intrinsic reason why alliteration should be limited to the confines of a single verse or to word-initials.\"\n\nCertain letters are used in alliteration more frequently than others. In Virgil, according to Clarke, the commonest letters for word-initial alliteration are \"a, c, p, s, m, t, d, e, f, i, n, v\"; alliteration with \"b\" is very rare. However, when an alliterating word comes after a verse-break such as a caesura, the letter \"a\" is less common, coming only in 6th or 7th place.\n\nUsually a letter alliterates only with itself, but sometimes \"qu\" can alliterate with \"c\"; \"ph\" may alliterate with \"p\"; \"ae\" and \"au\" may alliterate with \"a\"; and \"sc\", \"sp\", \"st\" may alliterate with \"s\".\n\nFrom both studies, it is clear that when only two words in a line begin with the same letter, it is difficult or impossible to identify objectively whether the alliteration is accidental or deliberate, since alliterated words occur no more often in any line than would be due to chance. To identify whether alliteration is present, more subjective criteria must be used, such as whether the two words are important for the meaning of the line. Thus although Lucretius 3.267 (\"et sapor et tamen\") is counted as an example of alliteration by Greenberg's computer programme, it is doubtful if alliteration can be made on a weak word such as \"et\" \"and\".\n\nWhen two pairs of words alliterate in the same line, the order \"abab\" is most common, then \"aabb\", then \"abba\". An example of the last is the following from Virgil:\n\nAlthough alliteration is common in Virgil, Ovid, and Lucretius, it is not found in every line. Overall, some 35-40% of lines in both Virgil and Ovid have no word-initial alliteration at all; in many of the remainder, the alliteration may well be accidental.\n\nFrequently alliteration simply adorns and beautifies a verse, without adding any particular emphasis. As Headlam (1920) notes, often the alliteration runs through a passage, linking together the various clauses, as in the opening of \"Aeneid\" 4, where the letters C, C, V, V, T, T recur repeatedly, as well as assonances such as \"vulnus / virtus / multus / vultus\", \"cura / carpitur / recursat\", and \"gentis / haerent\":\n\nIn his commentary on these lines, Ingo Gildenhard suggests that in the repeated alliteration with V in three pairs of words, Virgil seems to be hinting at a thematic link between the \"vulnus\" \"wound\" of Dido and the \"virtus\" \"manliness\", \"vultus\" \"face\", and \"verba\" \"words\" of Aeneas.\n\nAnother use for alliteration is to link together synonyms or thematically similar words:\n\nIn the following example, the great quantity of blood when the two bulls fight is emphasised by the alliteration on the words \"largo\" \"copious\" and \"lavant\" \"they wash\":\n\nAlliteration can also be used in both prose and verse to emphasise an antithesis between two opposite things:\n\nFrequently both Lucretius and Virgil use alliteration onomatopoeically to paint pictures in sound. Thus alliteration with S may represent the whooshing of an arrow or a spear, the sound of waves breaking on the rocks, or the hissing of serpents:\n\nR, C, T, and S may call up \"loud and violent sounds\". In the following lines the alliteration is reinforced by assonance of \"or, or\" and \"to, to, tu, tu\":\n\nC, R, T imitate the crackling of flames in the following lines of Lucretius:\n\nC and T can also imitate the sounds of musical instruments, as in these lines of Lucretius:\n\nIn the opening of Virgil's first Eclogue, as in the line of Theocritus that it imitates, the T and P sounds have been explained as the whispering of the leaves of the tree:\n\nM may represent the rolling of thunder or the roaring of the sea:\n\nWith the letters P and D Virgil can represent the sound of men running:\n\nThe alternation of T Q C and G combined with a dactylic rhythm can imitate the \"tattaka tattaka\" or \"takkatak takkatak\" sound of a horse cantering across the plain:\n\nThe letter H, which is only rarely used, can imitate the panting of a dog:\n\nIn this line, describing the fate of some Lycian peasants who have been transformed into frogs, Ovid uses the alliteration (with assonance) of QUA QUA to represent their quacking, even before revealing what creatures they have been metamorphosed into: \n\nIn the following highly alliterative line it has been suggested that Ovid is imitating the chattering sound of the local Black Sea languages:\n\nAs Bailey points out often a key word will set the alliteration in a line. Thus \"murmur\" \"rumbling\" will suggest the letters M and R, \"ventus\" \"wind\" and \"vis\" \"force\" will suggest V, and the letter L, the initial of \"lux\" and \"lumen\" (both meaning \"light\"), may represent the effects of light:\n\nLikewise in the following lines from book 2 of the \"Aeneid\" the L, C, and ŪC sounds of the word \"lūce\" \"light\" are picked out and repeated:\n\nL can also suggest the gliding of liquid, as at Lucretius 5.950, where there is secondary alliteration of R:\n\nBoth ideas are combined in the following lines, also from Lucretius:\n\nAnother use of alliteration in Virgil is to emphasise particular key words or names. Headlam (1921) demonstrates how when Virgil introduces a proper name he often uses echoes of the sound of that name through alliteration or assonance in nearby words, a technique he refers to as \"echo alliteration\":\n\nNot only proper names but also other key words can be highlighted in this way. In the passage below, the god Faunus and the wild olive tree (\"oleaster\") both play a significant role in the story. The first of these is highlighted by the alliteration F F F; the second by assonance (\"-oliis oleas-\"). There are further echoes in the syllables \"ste\", \"ter\", \"ol\" and \"le\" in the second line:\n\nAlliteration is frequently used in the \"Aeneid\" at moments of high drama, such as the moment that Aeneas's enemy Turnus is finally struck down by Aeneas in book 12. In this passage can be heard first the noisy STR STR imitating the sound of the spear's flight, then the vocalic alliteration of I I I as Turnus falls, and finally an assonance of PLI PLI as his knees buckle:\n\nAnother warrior dies in book 9 of the \"Aeneid\" as follows, with primary alliteration of V V, F F, and secondary alliteration of L L and NG NG:\n\nOvid also sometimes uses alliteration to mark significant moments in the story, as when he describes Echo's transformation. Here the alliteration of F F is accompanied by an assonance of OSS ISS:\n\nWhen Scylla silently enters her father's bedroom and cuts off the lock of hair whose loss will destroy the city, the letter T is constantly repeated, the word \"facinus\" \"crime\" and \"fatali\" \"fatal\" are emphasised by alliteration of F, and \"intrat ... nata parentem\" are linked by the assonance of NT. Finally alliteration of S emphasises the word \"spoliat\" \"robs\":\n\nIn the following lines Ovid describes the dangerous moment in the flight of Icarus when he flies too close to the sun. Here the consonants D and C of the word \"audaci\" \"daring\" are echoed through two lines, before giving way to T T T:\n\nAlliteration and assonance also often add emphasis to expressions of emotion, such as anger, scorn, grief, panic, and terror, as in the following lines from book 2 of the \"Aeneid\", where the ghost of Hector orders Aeneas to flee. Here alliteration is combined with assonance of \"Priamo ... Pergama\" and \"possent ... fuissent\":\n\nIn book 12 of the \"Aeneid\" Turnus's sister cries these words:\n\nAeneas taunts his enemy with alliteration of T C S and assonance of VA VAR VA AR A as follows:\n\nIn his reply, Turnus combines alliteration of T D T D with assonance of FER TER FER TER:\n\nTastes in alliteration gradually changed, and some writers, such as Plautus, Ennius, Lucretius, and Virgil, used it much more freely than others such as Catullus or Horace. From the first century AD it became less common. The scholar Servius (c.400), who wrote a commentary on Virgil, commented on the triple alliteration of \"Aeneid\" 3.183 (\"casus Cassandra canebat\" \"Cassandra used to sing of these events\") and similar phrases: \"This style of composition is now considered a fault, although our ancestors liked it\". He also disapproved of phrases such as \"Dorica castra\" (\"Aeneid\" 2.27) in which the final syllable of a word was repeated in the next word. \n\nA few years later Martianus Capella (fl. 410-20) wrote: \"Compositionis vitium maximum est non vitare cuiuslibet litterae assiduitatem in odium repetitam.\" \"It is a very great fault in composition not to avoid the constant use of a letter repeated ad nauseam.\"\n\nFrom the 7th century onwards English scholars began writing poetry in Latin, beginning with Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury in Wiltshire. Imitating and perhaps even exceeding the type of alliteration familiar in Old English, poems were written such as the following, attributed to Aldhelm himself, which displays both major and minor alliteration:\n\nAldhelm also used alliteration in many of his hexameter lines, such as the following:\n\nLapidge (1979) discusses where exactly alliteration should be sought: at the beginning of the word, on the stressed syllable, or on the verse ictus. However, these questions still remain largely unanswered.\n\nAnother highly alliterative work produced in England is the \"Melos Amoris\" (\"Melody of Love\") written about 1330 by the Yorkshire mystic Richard Rolle. An excerpt of this work, which is written in prose, but with some characteristics of verse, is the following:\n\nThe same author's \"Canticum Amoris\" is a shorter poem written in alliterative verse. At about the same time as Richard Rolle wrote this, an Alliterative Revival also began in English poetry, and in the same part of England.\n\n"}
{"id": "18293303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18293303", "title": "American Mafia", "text": "American Mafia\n\nThe American Mafia (commonly referred to as the Mafia or the Mob, though \"the Mob\" can refer to other organized crime groups or organized crime in general) or Italian-American Mafia, is the highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (, \"our thing\") and by the government as La Cosa Nostra (LCN). The organization's name is derived from the original \"Mafia\" or \"Cosa nostra\", the Sicilian Mafia, and it originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American gangsters and Italian-American crime groups (such as the American Camorra) living in the United States and Canada that are not of Sicilian origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related organized crime groups in Italy.\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished Italian immigrant neighborhoods or ghettos in New York's East Harlem (or Italian Harlem), Lower East Side, and Brooklyn. It also emerged in other areas of the East Coast of the United States and several other major metropolitan areas (such as New Orleans and Chicago) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. Neapolitan, Calabrian, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with Italian organized crime groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra of Naples, and 'Ndrangheta of Calabria. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"family,\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of \"family\" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.\n\nThe Mafia is currently most active in the northeastern United States, especially in New York City, Philadelphia, New Jersey, Buffalo and New England, in areas such as Boston, Providence and Hartford. It is also heavily active in Chicago and other large Midwestern cities such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City as well as in New Orleans, Florida, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, with smaller families, associates, and crews in other parts of the country. At the Mafia's peak, there were at least 26 cities around the United States with Cosa Nostra families, with many more offshoots and associates in other cities. There are five main New York City Mafia families, known as the Five Families: the Gambino, Lucchese, Genovese, Bonanno, and Colombo families. At its peak, the American Mafia dominated organized crime in the United States. Each crime family has its own territory (except for the Five Families) and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by the Commission, which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families.\n\nToday, most of the Mafia's activities are contained to the northeastern United States and Chicago, where they continue to dominate organized crime, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups.\n\nThe term \"Mafia\" was originally used in Italy by the media and law enforcement to describe criminal groups in Sicily. The origins of the term are debatable, though most agree the term is derived from the word \"ma'afir\", a term rooted in Arabic and meaning 'shelter' or 'place of refuge'. Like the Sicilian Mafia, the American Mafia did not use the term \"mafia\" to describe itself. Neither group has a formal name and instead used the term \"cosa nostra\" (Italian for 'our thing') when referring to themselves. When Italian immigrants started forming organized crime groups in the United States, the American press borrowed the term \"mafia\" from Italy and it became the predominant name used by law enforcement and the public.\n\n\"Mafia\" properly refers to either the Sicilian or Italian-American Mafia. In modern usage, when referring to the Mafia, there may be several meanings, including a local area's Italian organized crime element, the Mafia family of a major city, the entire Mafia of the United States, or the original Sicilian Mafia. Widespread recognition of the word has led to its use in the names of other criminal organizations, such as the Jewish Mafia, Mexican Mafia, or Russian Mafia, as well as non-criminal organizations, such as John F. Kennedy's political team, referred to as the \"Irish Mafia\" (not to be confused with the Irish Mob).\n\nThe press also coined the name \"National Crime Syndicate\" to refer to the entire network of U.S. organized crime, which includes the Jewish Mafia elements and the Italian-American Mafia. It was described as a confederation of mainly Italian and Jewish-American organized crime groups throughout the U.S., as revealed by the findings of a U.S. Senate Special Committee in the 1950s chaired by Estes Kefauver.\n\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869. The \"New Orleans Times\" reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by \"well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city.\" Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.\n\nMafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York City area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor Italian ghettos to citywide and eventually national organizations. The Black Hand was a name given to an extortion method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.\n\nGiuseppe Morello was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States. He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province. He was arrested in New Orleans in 1881 and extradited to Italy.\n\nNew Orleans was also the site of the first Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention. On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent David Hennessy was murdered execution-style. It is still unclear whether Italian immigrants actually killed him, or whether it was a frame-up by nativists against the reviled underclass immigrants. Hundreds of Sicilians were arrested on mostly baseless charges, and nineteen were eventually indicted for the murder. An acquittal followed, with rumors of bribed and intimidated witnesses. On March 14, 1891, the outraged citizens of New Orleans organized a lynch mob after the acquittal, and proceeded to kill eleven of the nineteen defendants. Two were hanged, nine were shot, and the remaining eight escaped.\n\nFrom the 1890s to 1920 in New York City the Five Points Gang, founded by Paul Kelly, were very powerful in the Little Italy of the Lower East Side. Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century such as Johnny Torrio, Al Capone, Lucky Luciano and Frankie Yale. They were often in conflict with the Jewish Eastmans of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan Camorra was also very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the \"Bloody Nineteenth\" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, feuds, and vendettas.\n\nOn January 17, 1920, Prohibition began in the United States with the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. Not explicitly related to Mafia involvement the murder rate during the Prohibition Era rose from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses. The profits that could be made from selling and distributing alcohol were worth the risk of punishment from the government, which had a difficult time enforcing prohibition. There were over 900,000 cases of liquor shipped to the borders of U.S. cities. Criminal gangs and politicians saw the opportunity to make fortunes and began shipping larger quantities of alcohol to U.S. cities. The majority of the alcohol was imported from Canada, the Caribbean, and the American Midwest where stills manufactured illegal alcohol.\n\nIn the early 1920s, fascist Benito Mussolini took control of Italy and waves of Italian immigrants fled to the United States. Sicilian Mafia members also fled to the United States, as Mussolini cracked down on Mafia activities in Italy. Most Italian immigrants resided in tenement buildings. As a way to escape the poor lifestyle, some Italian immigrants chose to join the American Mafia.\n\nThe Mafia took advantage of prohibition and began selling illegal alcohol. The profits from bootlegging far exceeded the traditional crimes of protection, extortion, gambling, and prostitution. Prohibition allowed Mafia families to make fortunes. As prohibition continued, victorious factions went on to dominate organized crime in their respective cities, setting up the family structure of each city. Gangs hijacked each other's alcohol shipments, forcing rivals to pay them for \"protection\" to leave their operations alone, and armed guards almost invariably accompanied the caravans that delivered the liquor.\n\nIn the 1920s, Italian Mafia families began waging wars for absolute control over lucrative bootlegging rackets. As the violence erupted, Italians fought Irish and Jewish ethnic gangs for control of bootlegging in their respective territories. In New York City, Frankie Yale waged war with the Irish American White Hand Gang. In Chicago, Al Capone and his family massacred the North Side Gang, another Irish American outfit. In New York City, by the end of the 1920s, two factions of organized crime had emerged to fight for control of the criminal underworld, one led by Joe Masseria and the other by Salvatore Maranzano. This caused the Castellammarese War, which led to Masseria's murder in 1931. Maranzano then divided New York City into five families. Maranzano, the first leader of the American Mafia, established the code of conduct for the organization, set up the \"family\" divisions and structure, and established procedures for resolving disputes. In an unprecedented move, Maranzano set himself up as boss of all bosses and required all families to pay tribute to him. This new role was received negatively, and Maranzano was murdered within six months on the orders of Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. Luciano was a former Masseria underling who had switched sides to Maranzano and orchestrated the killing of Masseria.\n\nAfter prohibition ended in 1933, organized crime groups were confronted with an impasse and needed other ways to maintain the high profits that they had acquired throughout the 1920s. The smarter of the organized crime groups expanded into other ventures, such as unions, construction, sanitation, and drug trafficking. On the other hand, those Mafia families that neglected the need to change eventually lost power and influence and were ultimately absorbed by other groups.\n\nAs an alternative to the previous despotic Mafia practice of naming a single Mafia boss as \"capo di tutti capi\", or \"boss of all bosses,\" Luciano set up The Commission, where the bosses of the most powerful families would have equal say and vote on important matters and solve disputes between families. This group ruled over the National Crime Syndicate and brought in an era of peace and prosperity for the American Mafia. By mid-century, there were 26 official Commission-sanctioned Mafia crime families, each based in a different city (except for the Five Families which were all based in New York). Each family operated independently from the others and generally had exclusive territory it controlled. As opposed to the older generation of \"Mustache Petes\" such as Maranzano and Masseria, who usually worked only with fellow Italians, the \"Young Turks\" led by Luciano were more open to working with other groups, most notably the Jewish-American criminal syndicates to achieve greater profits. The Mafia thrived by following a strict set of rules that originated in Sicily that called for an organized hierarchical structure and a code of silence that forbade its members from cooperating with the police (Omertà). Failure to follow any of these rules was punishable by death.\n\nThe rise of power that the Mafia acquired during Prohibition would continue long after alcohol was made legal again. Criminal empires which had expanded on bootleg money would find other avenues to continue making large sums of money. When alcohol ceased to be prohibited in 1933, the Mafia diversified its money-making criminal activities to include (both old and new): illegal gambling operations, loan sharking, extortion, protection rackets, drug trafficking, fencing, and labor racketeering through control of labor unions. In the mid-20th century, the Mafia was reputed to have infiltrated many labor unions in the United States, most notably the Teamsters and International Longshoremen's Association. This allowed crime families to make inroads into very profitable legitimate businesses such as construction, demolition, waste management, trucking, and in the waterfront and garment industry. In addition they could raid the unions' health and pension funds, extort businesses with threats of a workers' strike and participate in bid rigging. In New York City, most construction projects could not be performed without the Five Families' approval. In the port and loading dock industries, the Mafia bribed union members to tip them off to valuable items being brought in. Mobsters would then steal these products and fence the stolen merchandise.\n\nMeyer Lansky made inroads into the casino industry in Cuba during the 1930s while the Mafia was already involved in exporting Cuban sugar and rum. When his friend Fulgencio Batista became president of Cuba in 1952, several Mafia bosses were able to make legitimate investments in legalized casinos. One estimate of the number of casinos mobsters owned was no less than 19. However, when Batista was overthrown following the Cuban Revolution, his successor Fidel Castro banned U.S. investment in the country, putting an end to the Mafia's presence in Cuba. Las Vegas was seen as an \"open city\" where any family can work. Once Nevada legalized gambling, mobsters were quick to take advantage and the casino industry became very popular in Las Vegas. Since the 1940s, Mafia families from New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago had interests in Las Vegas casinos. They got loans from the Teamsters' pension fund, a union they effectively controlled, and used legitimate front men to build casinos. When money came into the counting room, hired men skimmed cash before it was recorded, then delivered it to their respective bosses. This money went unrecorded, but the amount is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOperating in the shadows, the Mafia faced little opposition from law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies did not have the resources or knowledge to effectively combat organized crime committed by a secret society they were unaware existed. Many people within police forces and courts were simply bribed, while witness intimidation was also common. In 1951, a U.S. Senate committee called the Kefauver Hearings determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated in the nation. Many suspected mobsters were subpoenaed for questioning, but few testified and none gave any meaningful information. In 1957, New York State Police uncovered a meeting and arrested major figures from around the country in Apalachin, New York. The event (dubbed the \"Apalachin Meeting\") forced the FBI to recognize organized crime as a serious problem in the United States and changed the way law enforcement investigated it. In 1963, Joe Valachi became the first Mafia member to turn state's evidence, and provided detailed information of its inner workings and secrets. More importantly, he revealed Mafia's existence to the law, which enabled the Federal Bureau of Investigations to begin an aggressive assault on the Mafia's National Crime Syndicate. Following Valachi's testimony, the Mafia could no longer operate completely in the shadows. The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime actives nationwide and created the Organized Crime Strike Force in various cities. However, while all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little to curb their criminal activities. Success was made by the beginning of the 1980s, when the FBI was able to rid Las Vegas casinos of Mafia control and made a determined effort to loosen the Mafia's strong hold on labor unions.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Mafia were involved in many industries, including betting on college sports. Several Mafia members associated with the Lucchese crime family participated in a point shaving scandal involving Boston College basketball team. Rick Kuhn, Henry Hill, and others associated with the Lucchese crime family, manipulated the results of the games during the 19781979 basketball season. Through bribing and intimidating several members of the team, they ensured their bets on the point spread of each game would go in their favor.\n\nOne of the most lucrative gains for the Mafia was through gas-tax fraud. They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. Michael Franzese, also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed. Franzese was caught in 1985.\n\nLabor racketeering helped the Mafia control many industries from a macroeconomic scale. This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. La Cosa Nostra was a Mafia group that rose to economic power through their heavy involvement in unions. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the teamster union.\n\nRestaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin through the Al Dente Pizzeria Chain, hiding the cargo in various food products.\n\nAnother one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was Las Vegas, Nevada, beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort \"The Flamingo\". Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid 20th Century. It was through millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts that laid the foundation for further economic growth. This capital didn't come from one Mafia family alone, but many throughout the country seeking to gain even more power and wealth. Large profits from casinos, run as legitimate businesses, would help to finance many of the illegal activities of the Mafia from the 1950s into the 1980s. In the 1950s more Mafia-financed casinos were constructed, such as the Stardust, Sahara, Tropicana, Desert Inn, and Riviera. Tourism in the city greatly increased through the 1960s and strengthened the local economy.\n\nHowever, the 1960s was also when the Mafia's influence in the Las Vegas economy began to dwindle. The Nevada State government and Federal government had been working to weaken Mafia activity on the Strip. In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the RICO Act a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters. It provides for extended criminal penalties for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Violation of the act is punishable by up to 20 years in prison per count, up to $25,000 in fines, and the violator must forfeit all properties attained while violating the RICO Act. The RICO Act has proven to be a very powerful weapon, because it attacks the entire corrupt entity instead of individuals who can easily be replaced with other organized crime members. Between 1981 and 1992, 23 bosses from around the country were convicted under the law while between 1981 and 1988, 13 underbosses and 43 captains were convicted. Over 1000 crime family figures were convicted by 1990. While this significantly crippled many Mafia families around the country, the most powerful families continued to dominate crime in their territories, even if the new laws put more mobsters in jail and made it harder to operate. With Sammy Gravano agreeing to cooperate with the FBI and turn state's evidence in 1991, he helped the FBI convict top Mafia leaders in New York. Although not the first Mafia member to testify against his peers, such a powerful mobster agreeing to do so set a precedent for waves of mobsters thereafter to break the code of silence to do the same; giving up information and testifying in exchange for immunity from prosecution for their crimes. Aside from avoiding long prison stretches, the FBI could put mobsters in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, changing their identities and supporting them financially for life. This led to dozens of mobsters testifying and providing information during the 1990s, which led to the imprisonment of hundreds of mobsters. As a result, the Mafia has seen a major decline in its power and influence in organized crime since the 1990s.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mafia has continued to be involved in a broad spectrum of illegal activities. These include murder, extortion, corruption of public officials, gambling, infiltration of legitimate businesses, labor racketeering, loan sharking, tax fraud schemes and stock manipulation schemes. Another factor contributing to the Mafia's downfall is the assimilation of Italian Americans, which left a shallower recruitment pool of new mobsters. Although the Mafia used to be nationwide, today most of its activities are confined to the Northeast and Chicago. While other criminal organizations such as the Russian Mafia, Chinese Triad, Mexican drug cartels and others have all grabbed a share of criminal activities, the Mafia continues to be the dominant criminal organization in these regions, partly due to its strict hierarchical structure. Law enforcement is concerned with the possible resurgence of the Mafia as it regroups from the turmoil of the 1990s, although FBI and local law enforcement agencies now focus more on homeland security and less on organized crime since the September 11 attacks. In 2002 the FBI estimated that the Mafia earns $50–$90 billion a year. To avoid FBI attention and prosecution, the modern Mafia also outsources a lot of its work to other criminal groups, such as motorcycle gangs.\n\nThe American Mafia operates on a strict hierarchical structure. While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. All inducted members of the Mafia are called \"made\" men. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a \"caporegime\" (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the chain of command. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated. This provides what is called plausible deniability.\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader Vincent Gigante.\n\nThe initiation ritual emerged from various sources, such as Roman Catholic confraternities and Masonic Lodges in mid-19th century Sicily and has hardly changed to this day. The Chief of Police of Palermo in 1875 reported that the man of honor to be initiated would be led into the presence of a group of bosses and underbosses. One of these men would prick the initiate's arm or hand and tell him to smear the blood onto a sacred image, usually a saint. The oath of loyalty would be taken as the image was burned and scattered, thus symbolizing the annihilation of traitors. This was confirmed by the first pentito, Tommaso Buscetta.\n\nA \"hit\", or murder, of a \"made\" man had to be approved by the leadership of his family, or retaliatory hits would be made, possibly inciting a war. In a state of war, families would \"go to the mattresses\"—an Italian phrase which roughly meant to go into battle.\n\nWhen the boss decides to let a member into the family one will be part of a ceremony, involving the drawing of blood, swearing an oath over a gun or holy picture, and obeying the rules of the organization. In New York City, the Mafia created customs and traditions which the members have to follow. If one breaks any of the rules they can be killed by another member of the family and usually the murder is committed by the people closest to that person.\n\n\nHomosexuality is reportedly incompatible with the American Mafia code of conduct. In 1992, John D'Amato, acting boss of the DeCavalcante family, was killed when the family learned of his sexual relationships with other men.\n\n\nThe following is a list of Mafia families that have been active in the U.S. Note that some families have members and associates working in other regions as well. The organization is not limited to these regions.\n\n\nU.S. Naval Intelligence entered into an agreement with Lucky Luciano to gain his assistance in keeping the New York waterfront free from saboteurs after the destruction of the \"SS Normandie\".\nThis spectacular disaster convinced both sides to talk seriously about protecting the United States' East Coast on the afternoon of February 9, 1942. While it was in the process of being converted into a troopship, the luxury ocean liner, \"Normandie\", mysteriously burst into flames with 1,500 sailors and civilians on board. All but one escaped, but 128 were injured and by the next day the ship was a smoking hulk. In his report, twelve years later, William B. Herlands, Commissioner of Investigation, made the case for the US government talking to top criminals, stating \"The Intelligence authorities were greatly concerned with the problems of sabotage and espionage ... Suspicions were rife with respect to the leaking of information about convoy movements. The \"Normandie\", which was being converted to war use as the Navy auxiliary \"Lafayette\", had burned at the pier in the North River, New York City. Sabotage was suspected.\"\n\nIn August 1960, Colonel Sheffield Edwards, director of the Office of Security of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), proposed the assassination of Cuban head of state Fidel Castro by Mafia assassins. Between August 1960 and April 1961, the CIA, with the help of the Mafia, pursued a series of plots to poison or shoot Castro. Those allegedly involved included Sam Giancana, Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante Jr., and John Roselli.\n\nIn 2007, Linda Schiro testified in an unrelated court case that her late boyfriend, Gregory Scarpa, a \"capo\" in the Colombo family, had been recruited by the FBI to help find the bodies of three civil rights workers who had been murdered in Mississippi in 1964 by the Ku Klux Klan. She said that she had been with Scarpa in Mississippi at the time and had witnessed him being given a gun, and later a cash payment, by FBI agents. She testified that Scarpa had threatened a Klansman by placing a gun in the Klansman's mouth, forcing the Klansman to reveal the location of the bodies. Similar stories of Mafia involvement in recovering the bodies had been circulating for years, and had been previously published in the New York \"Daily News\", but had never before been introduced in court.\n\nIn several Mafia families, killing a state authority is forbidden due to the possibility of extreme police retaliation. In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate Dutch Schultz was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill New York City prosecutor Thomas Dewey and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer Joe Petrosino was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily. A statue of him was later erected across the street from a Lucchese hangout.\n\nIn 1951, a U.S. Senate special committee, chaired by Democratic Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated around the United States. The United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce (known as the \"Kefauver Hearings\"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the \"Top Hoodlum Program\". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.\n\nThe Apalachin meeting was a historic summit of the American Mafia held at the home of mobster Joseph \"Joe the Barber\" Barbara, in Apalachin, New York, on November 14, 1957. Allegedly, the meeting was held to discuss various topics including loansharking, narcotics trafficking, and gambling, along with dividing the illegal operations controlled by the late Albert Anastasia. An estimated 100 Mafiosi from the United States, Italy, and Cuba are thought to have attended this meeting. Vito Genovese, then head of the renamed Genovese family, initially called the meeting as a way to recognize his new power as \"capo dei capi\".\n\nLocal and state law enforcement became suspicious when numerous expensive cars bearing license plates from around the country arrived in what was described as \"the sleepy hamlet of Apalachin\". After setting up roadblocks, the police raided the meeting, causing many of the participants to flee into the woods and area surrounding the Barbara estate. More than 60 underworld bosses were detained and indicted following the raid. One of the most direct and significant outcomes of the Apalachin Meeting was that it helped to confirm the existence of a nationwide criminal conspiracy, a fact that some, including Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover, had long refused to acknowledge.\n\nIn 1963, Joe Valachi became the first American Cosa Nostra member to provide a detailed look at the inside of the organization. Having been recruited by FBI special agents, and testifying before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations, Valachi exposed the name, structure, power bases, codes, swearing-in ceremony, and members of this organization. All of this had been secret up to this point.\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act), passed as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, made it a crime to belong to an organization that performed illegal acts. The witness protection program was also enhanced by the same legislation. Frequent use of the act began during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Charges of racketeering were successfully pressed against scores of mobsters, including three of New York's Godfathers, Anthony Corallo, Carmine Persico and Philip Rastelli during the Mafia Commission Trial in 1985. Others like Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, was thought of as the Genovese Godfather but was only a front-boss while Gambino boss Paul Castellano was murdered before the trial began. The act continues to be used to great effect today and has hurt the Mob severely.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, the United States Justice Department issued 16 indictments against Northeast American Mafia families resulting in 127 charged defendants and more than 110 arrests. The charges included murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, arson, robbery, narcotics trafficking, extortion, illegal gambling and labor racketeering. It has been described as the largest operation against the Mafia in U.S. history. Families that have been affected included the Five Families of New York as well as the DeCavalcante crime family of New Jersey and Patriarca crime family of New England.\n\nThe film \"Scarface\" (1932) is loosely based on the story of Al Capone.\n\nIn 1968, Paramount Pictures released the film \"The Brotherhood\" starring Kirk Douglas as a mafia don, which was a financial flop. Nevertheless, Paramount's production chief Robert Evans subsidized the completion of a Mario Puzo novel with similar themes and plot elements, and bought the screen rights \"before\" completion. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather\" became a huge success, both critically and financially (it won the Best Picture Oscar and for a year was the highest-grossing film ever made). It immediately inspired other mafia-related films, including a direct sequel, \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), also (partly) based on Puzo's novel, and yet another big winner at the Academy Awards, as well as films based on real Mafiosi like \"Honor Thy Father\" and \"Lucky Luciano\" (both in 1973) and \"Lepke\" and \"Capone\" (both in 1975). An ambitious 13-part miniseries by NBC called \"The Gangster Chronicles\" based on the rise of many major crime bosses of the 1920s and 1930s, aired in 1981.\n\n"}

In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an esquire attendant upon a knight, but bearing his own unique armorial device. \n\n\"Armiger\" was also used as a Latin cognomen, and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.\n\nToday, the term \"armiger\" is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom, where heraldry is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the College of Arms, the Chief Herald of Canada, the Court of the Lord Lyon or the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically agnatic) descent from a person with a right to bear a heraldic achievement, or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.\n\nMost of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.\n\nIn the Netherlands, titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not.

{"id": "54326073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54326073", "title": "Bet van Beeren", "text": "Bet van Beeren\n\nBet van Beeren (12 February 1902—16 July 1967) was a flamboyant, legendary bar owner in Amsterdam. While hers wasn't the first bar that allowed LGBT persons to openly associate, the fact that she was openly lesbian, and accepting of a very diverse clientele, led her establishment to be one of the most known. In 2017, she was honored by the city of Amsterdam when a canal bridge was renamed in her honor.\n\nElisabeth Maria van Beeren was born on 12 February 1902 in the Jordaan neighborhood of Amsterdam to Maria Johanna (née Brants) and Johannes Hendrik van Beeren. She was the oldest daughter and one of thirteen children of the couple. Her father worked in street construction and her mother ran a boarding house and delivered fish and vegetables by car around the neighborhood. Bet's education ended at middle school because her family needed her to work.\n\nVan Beeren went to work in a canning factory on Haarlemmerweg, quickly working her way up to foreman, but she didn't like the job and the work was dangerous. She lost two fingertips while working and after a fight with her boss, quit and went to work for her uncle at his pub, \"Amstelstroom\", where she had previously worked part-time. She also rode around town in leather clothing on her motorcycle and sold fish. In 1927, she bought the bar with loans from the Oranjeboom Brewery and thereafter, was always loyal to that brand of beer, though other breweries later tried to gain her patronage. It was very unusual for a woman to own a business at that time, especially on the rough seawall area where it was located. She renamed the pub, Café 't Mandje (The Basket Café) because her mother brought the food in every day in a basket.\n\nVan Beeren ran an open establishment where lesbians and gays could freely associate as long as there was no kissing, which would have violated the vice laws and have cost her her liquor license. Her mixed clientele included artists, intellectuals, pimps and prostitutes, sailors, and Major Bosshardt, the disapproving head of the Salvation Army. Van Beeren was flamboyant, craving the spotlight, and often dressed in a sailor suit or leathers, entertaining her clients with singing and dancing. She was openly lesbian, though she could entertain wealthy men if it would put meat or pastries on her family table. She drank a lot, some reports were 40 bottles of beer a day, and could curse like a sailor.\n\nMaking a lot of money from the pub, van Beeren was known for her charitable works, helping the poor, children and the elderly. She also claimed to have paid for one of the crosses atop the Nicholaas Church. Among her other legendary deeds, she allowed the bar to be used as an arms depot for the Dutch resistance during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. While homosexual men became targets of the Germans, van Beeren's pub was off-limits to German troops because of its reputation as a red-light district establishment. The use of the term \"owl\" for heterosexuals has been attributed to a device van Beeren used when the bar was being raided or when homophobic patrols were sweeping the area. She had a light installed in a plaster owl, which was lit to warn her customers. She hung neckties and souvenirs from patrons from the ceiling, held dances on Queen's Day where same sex couples could dance together, and on Fridays would let the Salvation Army band come in to raise funds for charity.\n\nVan Beeren died of liver disease on 16 July 1967. She laid in state on the billiard table of the pub for several days before her burial on 20 July at the Nieuwe Oosterbegraafplaats in Amsterdam. Greet, van Beeren's younger sister, continued to operate the business until 1982, when she closed it because of the heroin trade expansion in the area. Some of the items from the bar were incorporated into the Amsterdam Museum in 1998, but for the most part, the building remained untouched until Greet, shortly before her death, sold it to her niece, Diana van Laar. Van Laar completed a renovation of the pub and reopened it on 2 April 2008. In 2017, a bridge spanning the canal between the Korte Stormsteeg and Korte Niezel streets was renamed on the pub's 90th anniversary to honor van Beeren in a symbolic representation of her building bridges in the community between diverse groups.\n\n"}

{"id": "36999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36999", "title": "Carry On (franchise)", "text": "Carry On (franchise)\n\nThe Carry On series primarily consists of 31 British comedy motion pictures (1958–92), four Christmas specials, a television series of thirteen episodes, and three West End and provincial stage plays. The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas, and Jim Dale.\n\nThe \"Carry On\" series contains the largest number of films of any British series, and it is the longest continually running UK film series, although with a fourteen-year break (1978–92). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958–66), the Rank Organisation made eighteen (1966–78) and United International Pictures made one (1992).\n\nProducer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958–62) and Talbot Rothwell (1963–74). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972, and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975, and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions.\n\nAll the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late 1960s (at the height of the series' success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales, (with the foot of Mount Snowdon standing in for the Khyber Pass in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\"), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in \"Follow That Camel\".\n\n\"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits doing National Service; its title, the command commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties, was in keeping with its setting. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful, further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961, \"Carry On Regardless\", but it still followed a similar plot to that of many of the early films—a small group of misfit newcomers to a job make comic mistakes, but come together to succeed in the end.\n\nThe remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Spying\"), westerns (\"Cowboy\"), and Hammer horror films (\"Screaming!\"). The most impressive of these was \"Carry On Cleo\" (1964), after the Burton and Taylor epic \"Cleopatra\" (1963), where the budget-conscious \"Carry On\" team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. \"Carry On Emmannuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original 'run'.\n\nThe stock-in-trade of \"Carry On\" humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (\"Nurse\", \"Doctor\", \"Again Doctor\", \"Matron\" and the proposed \"Again Nurse\"), the monarchy (\"Henry\"), the Empire (\"Up the Khyber\"), the armed forces (\"Sergeant\", \"England\", \"Jack\" and the proposed \"Flying\" and \"Escaping\"), the police (\"Constable\") and the trade unions (\"At Your Convenience\") as well as camping (\"Camping\"), foreign holidays (\"Cruising\", \"Abroad\"), beauty contests (\"Girls\"), caravan holidays (\"Behind\"), and the education system (\"Teacher\") amongst others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they mostly proved very popular with audiences. In 2007, the pun \"Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for me\", spoken by Kenneth Williams (playing Julius Caesar) in \"Carry on Cleo\", was voted the funniest one-line joke in film history.\n\nA film had appeared in 1957 under the title \"Carry On Admiral\"; although this was a comedy in similar vein (and even featured Joan Sims in the cast) it has no connection to the \"Carry On\" series itself. The much earlier 1937 film \"Carry On London\" is also unrelated (though it coincidentally starred future \"Carry On\" performer Eric Barker).\n\nThe cast were poorly paid—around £5,000 per film for a principal performer. In his diaries, Kenneth Williams lamented this, and criticised several of the movies despite his declared fondness for the series as a whole. Peter Rogers, the series' producer, acknowledged: \"Kenneth was worth taking care of, because while he cost very little <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> he made a very great deal of money for the franchise.\"\n\nSeveral other films were planned, scripted (or partly scripted) or entered pre-production before being abandoned:\n\n\"Carry On Spaceman\" was to be released shortly after \"Carry On Regardless\", in 1961. It was scripted by Norman Hudis, and was to satirise interests in the Space Race from the Western world's point of view. The cast was to consist of three would-be astronauts who constantly bungled on their training and their mission into outer space – most likely the trio would have been played by the trinity of Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, and Leslie Phillips that had been established in \"Carry On Constable\".\n\nAttempts to revive \"Carry On Spaceman\" in 1962 under Denis Gifford, again by Hudis, failed, and the project was subsequently abandoned.\n\nThree scripts were written for an intended sub-sequel to the successful \"Carry On Nurse\", the second instalment of the \"Carry On\" series. The first film was renamed, and the other two never made.\n\nThe first intended \"Carry On Again Nurse\" was made in 1967, but released as \"Carry On Doctor\". \"Carry On Nurse\" was alluded to twice in \"Carry On Doctor\", firstly with the sub-titles (one reading \"Nurse Carries On Again\" and \"Death of a Daffodil\"), and again in a later scene with Frankie Howerd commenting on a vase of daffodils in his ward.\n\nA second attempt at \"Carry On Again Nurse\" came in 1979, after the series left Rank Films and moved to Hemdale. A completed script had been written by George Layton and Jonathan Lynn in 1977. It was cancelled due to the financial loss of \" Carry On Emmannuelle\".\n\nThe final attempt to create \"Carry On Again Nurse\" came in 1988, with a script written by Norman Hudis. It was to revolve around a hospital set for closure, and set to star original actors Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Connor and Joan Sims, with Sims filling in the role of matron that was previously held by Hattie Jacques. The end of the film was going to be a tribute to Jacques, with Sims turning around a photograph of the actress and asking \"Well, did I do alright?\" (the script is included in the book \"The Lost Carry Ons\"). Production was scheduled to begin in June 1988, but the deaths of Williams and Hawtrey (in April and October 1988 respectively), combined with a budget of £1.5 million which was deemed too expensive, proved to be the end of the film and it was cancelled.\n\nA new film, \"Carry On London\", was announced in 2003 by producer Peter Rogers and producer James Black but remained in pre-production well into 2008. The script was signed off by the production company in late March 2008, and \"centred on a limousine company ferrying celebrities to an awards show.\" The film had several false starts, with the producers and cast changing extensively over time. Only the rather unknown Welsh actress Jynine James remained a consistent name from 2003 to 2008. Danniella Westbrook, David Jason, Shaun Williamson and Burt Reynolds were also once attached to the project. In May 2006 it was announced Vinnie Jones and Shane Richie were to star in the film, which was to be directed by Peter Richardson, though Ed Bye later replaced him as the named director. At the 50th anniversary party held at Pinewood Studios in March 2008, Peter Rogers confirmed that he was planning a series of \"Carry On\" films after \"London\", subject to the success of the first.\n\nIn early 2009, \"Carry On London\" or \"Carry On Bananas\" was once again 'back on', with Charlie Higson attached as director, and a different more modern cast list involving Paul O'Grady (as the acidic Kenneth Williamsesque character), Jynine James, Lenny Henry, Justin Lee Collins, Jennifer Ellison (as the saucy Barbara Windsor type), Liza Tarbuck (Hattie Jacques), Meera Syal, James Dreyfus, and Frank Skinner (filling in the Sid James role). Despite new media interest and sets being constructed at Pinewood film studios, the film once again was put on hold, and the project was shelved after the death of Peter Rogers in April 2009.\n\nIn May 2016, producer Jonathan Sothcott of Hereford Films announced plans for a new series of \"Carry On\" films, beginning with \"Carry On Doctors\" and \"Carry On Campus\". As of early 2017, no news had surfaced on if the planned reboot is still going ahead. On 12 April 2017, Sothcott confirmed to thehollywoodnews that he is no longer involved with the film series. \n\nThe characters and comedy style of the \"Carry On\" film series, were adapted to a television series titled \"Carry On Laughing\", and several Christmas specials.\n\nIn 1971, Music For Pleasure released a long playing record, \"Oh! What a Carry On!\" (MFP MONO 1416), featuring songs performed by Kenneth Williams, Jim Dale, Kenneth Connor, Frankie Howerd, Bernard Bresslaw, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, and Dora Bryan.\n\nA 50-minute television documentary, \"What's a Carry On?\", was made in 1998 for the 40th anniversary of the first film. It included archive clips, out-takes and interviews with surviving cast members. It was included as an extra on the DVD release of \"Carry On Emmannuelle\".\n\nIn November 2003 a T.V. series called Popcorn ran a \"Carry On\" Special documentary and interviews on S4C featuring Jynine James. This was in respect of a new \"Carry On\" film being produced by Peter Rogers called Carry On London. It featured interviews and clips of the past \"Carry On\" films and went into detail about the new film and cast. However, despite the script being signed off and sets constructed at Pinewood film studios, the project was shelved, owing to the untimely death of producer Peter Rogers.\n\nA two-hour radio documentary \"Carry On Forever!\", presented by Leslie Phillips, was broadcast in two parts on BBC Radio 2 in two parts on 19–20 July 2010. A three-part television retrospective with the same title, narrated by Martin Clunes, was shown on ITV3 in the UK over Easter 2015.\n\nThe success of the \"Carry On\" series occasionally led to affectionate parodies of the series by other contemporary comedians:\n\nFalcon De Luxe, a UK company owned by Jumbo Games, released a jigsaw based on the official Carry On movie posters. The jigsaw is a montage of numerous movie posters along with the main movie logo in the centre.\n\nThe \"Carry On\" film series has had numerous individual releases on VHS, and a number of VHSs were released in an eighteen VHS box-set on 1 September 2003.\n\nThe film series was first released as a DVD box-set on 1 September 2008, by ITV Studios Home Entertainment. Five years later 7 October 2013 it was re-released with smaller packaging. All the movies contained in the collection are also available to buy individually.\n\nSince 2013, StudioCanal has begun to release a number of the \"Carry On\" films on Blu-ray. starting with \"Carry On Screaming!\" (21 October 2013), \"Carry On Cleo\" (5 May 2014), \"Carry On Cowboy\" (2 June 2014) and \"Carry On Jack\" (7 July 2014).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28132286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28132286", "title": "Chairman Mao badge", "text": "Chairman Mao badge\n\nChairman Mao badge () is the name given to a type of pin badge displaying an image of Mao Zedong that was ubiquitous in the People's Republic of China during the active phase of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1971. The term is also used for badges associated with Mao that do not actually have a picture of him on them. Chairman Mao badges were, together with the \"little red book\", one of the most visible and iconic manifestations of the . It is estimated that several billion Chairman Mao badges were produced during the period of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nBadges depicting Mao Zedong first appeared at the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political College (中国人民抗日军事政治大学) at Yan'an during the 1930s. These early badges were homemade, usually being constructed out of the metal from used toothpaste tubes.\n\nBy the 1940s badges showing Mao by himself or together with other important people were being produced in small numbers as commemorative medals or as awards for service to the communist party or to the army. Unlike the later Cultural Revolution period badges, which normally portrayed Mao by himself, these badges frequently portrayed Mao side by side with other Chinese revolutionary figures such as Zhu De, Chen Yi, He Long, Lin Biao and Lu Xun, or showed Mao with communist leaders from other countries, such as Stalin and Kim Il Sung. During this period badges were smaller but more robust than the Cultural Revolution period badges, and some badges produced during the 1950s were even made of gold (initially 22 carat, but later reduced to 13 or 14 carat).\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, badges showing an image of Mao were produced mainly for special occasions, for example Chinese soldiers were given star-shaped badges with a portrait of Mao when they returned to China from the Korean War, and labourers working on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway were given gold-plated copper badges with a bilingual inscription in Chinese and Tibetan on completion of the road in December 1954. By the mid-1960s Mao badges began to become more prevalent, and were even distributed at international events such as the 1965 Leipzig Trade Fair, but it was not until the end of 1965 that small aluminium Mao badges, similar to the Cultural revolution period badges, first started to be produced in Shanghai.\n\nMao badges exploded in popularity with the launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Almost overnight the function of Mao badges changed completely: what had previously been largely commemorative or ceremonial items worn by a comparative few suddenly became required symbols of loyalty to Mao worn by almost everyone. Along with the \"little red books\" of Mao's sayings, badges with a portrait of Mao become essential indicators of the wearer's loyalty to Mao, worn on the left side just above the heart. Bigger badges indicated a greater degree of loyalty to Mao, and some even pinned the badges directly into their skin as an extreme indication of their loyalty. Conversely, members of the landowning class and reactionaries were not allowed to wear Mao badges, and the conspicuous lack of a Mao badge marked them out as enemies of the people.\n\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution few ordinary people wore Mao badges in the ordinary course of their daily life, and although production of badges in Shanghai increased steadily from 32,000 in July 1966 to 175,000 the following month, it was only when Mao was presented with some Mao badges by Red Guards at a mass rally at Tiananmen Square on 18 August 1966 that the wearing of these badges became widespread. In September 1966 production of Mao badges in Shanghai soared to 1.3 million, and during the height of the Cultural Revolution, from 1968 to 1971, an estimated total of between 2 and 5 billion Chairman Mao badges were produced throughout the country. Badges were primarily distributed to workers, students and soldiers by their work units, and they were not widely available for purchase at shops. Badges were further distributed by trading between friends or on the black market, and by being given as gifts.\n\nThe high tide of Mao badge mania was reached in April 1969, during the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, when huge numbers of Mao badges were produced for distribution at the congress. However, the vast quantities of aluminium being used was having serious repercussions on Chinese industry, causing Mao to demand \"Give me back the airplanes\" (还我飞机), and in June 1969 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a document forbidding the production of any more Mao badges unless specially authorized. After the death of Lin Biao in September 1971, the wearing of Mao badges declined rapidly, and few people outside rural areas wore Mao badges in public during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution, from 1972 to 1976. After the fall of the Gang of Four in October 1976, a month after the death of Mao, work units started to organize the collection and recycling of Mao badges, although many people secretly held on to their badges.\n\nThe typical Chairman Mao badges of the Cultural Revolution period were made from an aluminium base, either coloured gold or left silver, covered with a red plastic pattern, to produce a red and gold or a red and silver design. Other colours were also used sometimes, such as yellow for a field of sunflowers as a background to Mao. In addition to the typical aluminium and plastic badges, badges were also made in other materials, such as porcelain, bamboo, perspex and plastic, but these made up only a tiny fraction of the total number of badges produced.\nThe vast majority of designs have the same profile image of Mao, coloured gold or silver, always looking to the left. The central image of Mao is usually set in a red background, which may be plain or patterned, with or without a border design, and with or without an inscription. Inscriptions vary from a single character (most commonly 忠 \"zhōng\" meaning \"loyalty\") to quotations from Mao or lines of his poetry, or simply slogans such as \"the Revolutionary Committee is good\" (革命委员会好).\n\nMost badges have an inscription on the reverse, which often recorded where the badge was made and, if appropriate, what special occasion it commemorated. In addition the reverse may also feature a revolutionary slogan, a quotation from Mao, or respectful wishes for long life to Chairman Mao. Thus each obverse design may have hundreds of different varieties with different reverse inscriptions, being produced in different parts of the country or to commemorate different events.\n\nThe British Museum catalogue of Chairman Mao badges classifies the obverse designs of Mao badges from the Cultural Revolution period as follows.\nA. Mao profile\n\nB. Mao in military attire\n\nC. Mao portraits in civilian attire\n\nD. Badges without Mao's portrait\n\nEven during the Cultural Revolution, Mao badges were extensively collected, traded and given as gifts. However it is unlikely that anyone was able to match the collection of Mao badges that Ye Qun, wife of Lin Biao, managed to put together at the start of the Mao badge craze. She collected several thousand different types of Mao badge to give to Mao on his 73rd birthday on 26 December 1966, although she was unable to achieve the symbolic target of ten thousand badges that she was hoping for.\n\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution upon Mao's death in September 1976, Mao badges were meant to be handed in for recycling, but many or most remained in private ownership. From the mid-1980s Mao memorabilia became very collectible, and Mao badges could be bought at flea markets across China. There are now many private collectors of Chairman Mao badges in China, with the most prolific collectors accumulating tens of thousands of specimens. Wang Anting (王安廷) from Chengdu, had a collection of more than 50,000 badges by 2001, and in 2006 Lin Yizhou (林意洲) was reported to have amassed a collection of more than 200,000 badges. The Jianchuan Museum in China has a vast collection of Cultural Revolution material. Outside of China, some museums have started to acquire collections of objects relating to Chairman Mao, including badges, and the British Museum in London has a modest but well-catalogued collection of nearly 350 Chairman Mao badges.\n\nOutside of China, there are private and public collections of Mao badges: at the British Museum (London, UK), at the Kulturen Museum (Lund, Sweden), the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto and others.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40774741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40774741", "title": "Corps Hubertia Freiburg", "text": "Corps Hubertia Freiburg\n\nThe Corps Hubertia Freiburg is a fraternity (\"Studentenverbindung\") in Freiburg, Germany. It was founded on October 29, 1868 and is one of 162 German Student Corps in Europe today. The Corps is a member of the Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (KSCV), the oldest federation of classical European fraternal corporations with roots dating back to the 15th century and member fraternities across Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Latvia and Switzerland.\n\nMembership to the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Freiburg's universities and based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character. Members of the Corps Hubertia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing duels as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Hubertia's members wear the traditional Couleur, colored stripes, in green-gold-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds. Hubertia's members are often referred to as \"Huberten\".\n\nMembers of the fraternity controlled the forestry departments of Baden, the south-west of Germany, in a de facto monopoly from the late 1800s to the early 20th century. Many of the members today practice this heritage as passionate hunters in private and fraternity events.\n\nLike all Corps, Hubertia expects and practices tolerance in political, scientific and religious affairs.\n\nMembers of the Corps Hubertia value and practice the tradition of academic fencing duels, or \"Mensur\" in German, with members of other proper fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing the corps member to show his determination by standing one's ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the corps brothers at the same time.\n\nHubertia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional Couleur, colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition known as \"wearing colors\" (German: \"Farben tragen\") provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the corps brothers with each other and their traditions.\n\nMembers are encouraged to have their own world view and be able to argue it; but Hubertia as such always remains neutral. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \"fox\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (\"Rezeption\").\n\nThe fraternity has approximately 255 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or residing in Austria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, France, Germany, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. Every full member is member for life.\n\nHubertia's members value nature, and the manifold ways to experience her. Enjoyed in good company and providing a benevolent Diana, hunting is tradition and it provides means to spend time among Corps Brothers of high standard.\n\nHubertia defined its fraternity colors \"green-gold-black\" on February 7, 1897. These colors are worn in the form a ribbon with a golden percussion (rim) diagonally across the chest, as it is typical for European fraternities. The common fraternity cap is the green \"Tellermütze\" or the more traditional Stürmer in dark-green. The freshly admitted (pledging \"fox\") members wear the two-colored ribbon in green-and-gold. To official fraternity events, some members might additionally wear a traditional green jacket, an adapted version of the contemporary chief forester's jacket typical for the Elsass, a former German region bordering France. This jacket is then combined with a Hirschfänger, a specific style of hunting dagger, on the side.\n\nThe Slogan \"Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur\" (concord will make small things flourish, discord will destroy even the greatest) was adapted on August 23, 1870. It still defines the fraternity members' association with each other and the way things are managed inside, as well as outside the fraternity, today.\n\nHubertia was founded on Oktober 29, 1868 als association among students of forestry at the university Polytechnikum der Forstschule Karlsruhe. The colors \"green-gold-black\" were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles, and initially were not yet worn openly. The slogan \"Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur\" (understood as \"strength through unity\") was defined in 1870, influencing the fraternities members' connections up to this day. Then, on Oktober 18, 1874, the fraternity was openened up to students outside of forestry and Couleur became part of every Corps brother's daily routine on Juni 7, 1875. Shortly after that, a local fencing club was established at the fraternity's location in 1876.\nThe so-called \"compulsory satisfaction\", meaning everyone's duty to keep or regain one's honor in a fencing duel with sharp blades if challenged, became part of the fraternity's charter in 1886 and every member's tradition. This step further intensified the number and quality of academic fencing duels of Hubertia's fraternity members.\n\nWhen the department of forestry moved from Karlsruhe to Freiburg im Breisgau, Hubertia settled in Freiburg and became Corps on November 27, 1920. After a short acquaintance period with the other SC-Corps in Freiburg, the Corps Hubertia became a full member of the Freiburg's league of corps (SC) on February 2, 1921.\n\nHubertia had 14 student members in Summer of 1920, a large number at that time, especially considering that they were all forestry students as all other members had to remain in Karlsruhe for the time being, as their departments had not moved and switching universities was a complicated procedure. The first weeks in Freiburg were filled with establishing regular meetings to celebrate or fence. Official fencing relationships, so-called \"Paukverhältnisse\", were established with the other local Corps in Freiburg's league of corps (SC) and the fraternity \"Turnerschaft Markomanno-Albertia\". Establishing this fencing relationship allowing regular fencing practice and duels to take place was back then the common procedure for a Corps to become a member of the local League of Corps at a university location, a tradition that has not changed to this day. This step was supported by the and Corps Suevia Freiburg who were hoping to increase the number of students from Baden (lower Germany) to counteract the rising number of students from the north of Germany in Freiburg's fraternity landscape.\nThe fraternity's alumni convention, \"Alte Herren Vereinigung\" in German, granted the student members' convention (), to file an application to enter Freiburg's League of Corps (). Following a short period of joint gatherings and duels in academic fencing with Freiburg's other Corps as well as an inspection of Hubertia's statutes, Corps Rhenania officially requested for Corps Hubertia to become an official member of the local SC on February 2, 1921. Culminating in a grand ceremony, Hubertia thus had, 53 years after her inception, become a full member Corps of the Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (KSCV).\n\nMembers of dueling fraternities (fraternities practicing academic fencing) were highly respected during the time of the German Empire, 1871 to 1918, both in general terms as well as holding public offices. This started to change slowly during times for the Weimar Republic, 1918 to 1933, even in local forestry departments. The finance minister of Baden, , a politician belonging to the , demanded openly in the state senate that \"Hubertia's members are to be extinct in Baden's state forestry duties and minteries\".\n\nIn 1920, 118 of the 227 of Hubertia's living members were men in forestry (~1/2). Of these 118, 83 held a state or private forestry office in the area of what is Baden-Württemberg today, formed by combining the former states Baden and Württemberg during the post-war area in 1952. Hence, as there were roughly 240 forestry offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg in 1920, Hubertia had members managing about 1/3 of all the forestry offices in today's state borders. Köhler wanted to minimize this high number of Huberten[s]. His first step was to establish a so-called \"Numerus clausus\" for forestry in Freiburg and determined personally about a prospective student's admission in person. During the following ten years, Köhler's selection had its effect on Hubertia's influence: While the fraternity provided 37 prospective forestry officers in 1920, the number fell to only six in 1938.\n\nAs this so-called culture fight was originally one between Catholics and more Protestant, Bismark-oriented and Prussia-friendly group of people, Hubertia was caught in the middle. Becker was a politician of the catholic Centrum party and openly voiced that Catholics only made it into higher offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg when they had been members of Hubertia. This can be understood as a typical statement during the cultural war (Kulturkampf) with Köhler voicing his antipathy towards the fraternity of Hubertia. On the other hand, Hasel completely disproves Köhller's view: He points out that the view of Catholics only having gotten into higher office positions if they had been Hubertia's members must be false as access to Baden's office career track was not bound by confession. Catholic forestry office applicants were not hindered on their path, which is proven by several of personnel files.\n\nThis report and the catholic men mentioned for offices in forestry provide evidence that religions orientation of applicants did not influence hiring decisions in Baden's forestry department. Furthermore, there was not one of Hubertia's members within the ranks of the foresrty officers mentioned in Hasel's notes. Due to that, there was no verifiable connection between an applicant's religious orientation and his connection to the fraternity of Hubertia, when he ran for a public forestry office.\n\nThe report on Duke Wiser, mentioned above, on the other hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, had been a member of Hubertia since 1877. Krutina on the other hand, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.\n\nWhen the position of the state's forestry minister and office head of Baden's forestry department was to be reappointed, Köhler intentionally decided against a member of Hubertia and put Karl Philipp in the position. Karl Phillip represented the so-called \"young forestry school\" and was knows to be very critical of the old establishment in Baden's forstry departments. He made many enemies with his destructive critique and his dogmatic lopsidedness, especially with his predecessors.\n\nWith Philipp's assumption of office, two fractions developed within Baden's forestry departments. The \"young forest school\", being under Philipp's management, was supported by younger forestry officers; while none of the older ones openly sided with Philipp. With a majority of Hubertia's members belonging to the conservative and older members within Baden's forestry depeartments, this had to hurt long-term, as indicated in several publications and memoirs criticizing Philipps actions or workings.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1936, 41 forsety officers were members of Hubertia, five of which were governors of the state forestry department and three had been the foresrty president.\n\nFree and open-minded student organizations were a thorn in the National Socialist party's view of the world. Before coming to power, the national socialists had instituted the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDSB) that strove to be the one and only students' association. Once in power in 1933, Hitler's party started to ban independent fraternities and sororities in Germany. Similar to other Corps, Hubertia's reaction was first to go underground and exist as a so-called \"association among Freiburg's fencing circle\" instead of being referred to as a Corps. As pressure increased, Hubertia's members chose the official self-liquidation (\"Selbst-Suspension\") on May 18, 1936 to avoid discovery or annexation to the NSDSB.\n\nTo still provide means for Hubertia's Corps student and Alumni members to meet, the SC-Comradeship \"Hermann Löns\" was formed together with representatives from other Corps in Freiburg. This comradeship allowed fraternity members to remain undiscovered during congregations and to continue their practice of academic fencing, which had become strictly forbidden and could, when discovered, lead to capital punishment in Nazi Germany at that point in time. The meeting place remained Hubertia's fraternity house. While partially interrupted due to heightened pressure of nazi espionage, fencing Mensur duels continued and even intensified from 1941 on, with over 100 of such duels happening during World War II.\n\nFollowing the war, Hubertia's alumni association was reactivated on May 20, 1946. Both, the members of the formerly established SC-Comradeship and the \"Association of Bremer Students\" (est. on Oct. 29, 1947 by members of Hubertia who had started alternative comradeships during the war) were formerly accepted into the fraternity on January 17, 1948. The students from Bremen officially moved to Freiburg that year and re-established the Studentenverbindung Hubertia not yet as Corps as these were still forbidden under Allied control. The official Allied guideline was to make sure that \"nothing Nazi\" would be re-established post-war and student organizations were handled with care in general. Hubertia took the following two years to establish that it was her confrontation with Nazi-Germany that led to the former dissolution by choice and underground existence. In parallel, some of Hubertia's members moved from Bremen to Marburg as Freiburg university did not yet provide certain departments that early after the war. These members helped to re-establish, or reconstitute, the , and in Marburg.\nOn November 14, 1950, Hubertia officially took the title Corps Hubertia back on. The League of Corps \"SC-Freiburg\" reconstituted in the following year with Hubertia, Rhenania and Suevia. Next, Hubertia helped to reconstitute the KSCV at the Godesburg the same year, 1951. The next years were ones of ensuring balance and normality for fraternities in Germany again. Hubertia became the leading Corps in 1966 with \"Hans-Joachim Hiebsch\" as the president of the oKC, the official Kösen Congregation.\n\nToday, Hubertia is the oldest fraternity in Baden-Württemberg and the second-oldest one in Germany that continues to practice a tradition of \"forestry and fencing\". As, currently, the oldest fraternity sharing Corps Hubertia Freiburg's traditions, Corps Hubertia München is giving up on the tradition of forestry and hunting, Hubertia is set to become the oldest fraternity in Europe keeping these values alive.\n\nWhen Baden-Württemberg's Minister of Justice and Vice-Ministerpresedent and Corps Hubertia's alumni was interviewed by local and national media about his relationship to guns, media focused on his fraternity background too and the value that hunting has in our society.\n\nSince 1945, Hubertia's members were essential for the reconstruction / re-endowment of the following Corps: \n\nThe original house in Freiburg „Zum Felsenkeller“ was bought on Schlossbergstraße 7 in 1921 and served the fraternity through the troubled times before, during and shortly after WW II. The house was then torn down in 1968 and replaced with a new house at Fürstenbergstraße 23 in the south of Freiburg.\n\nMany fraternity members pay regular visits to the lodge higher up in the Black Forest mountains near Freiburg. Traditionally, the last hour of the hike is done around sun-down to soak up what nature has to offer from dusk 'till dawn. The lodge provides means for relaxation, recreation and meditation without iPhones and computers.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Klinggräff-Medal is awarded for the combination of extraordinary accomplishments in academia, involvement for the fraternity and proven leadership on local and, preferentially, national level. An average of \"five medals is awarded each year nation-wide\", chosen by a joint alumni committee of KSCV and WSC representatives. The award indirectly reflects back at the fraternity, showing leaders in their field among the fraternity's brothers. For more information see at the .\n\nRecipient of the Klinggräff-Medal for Corps Hubertia is:\n\nHubertia's members are - quite literally - Brothers in Arms. Be it the proper handling of a fencing blade under the psychological and physical strains of the Mensur or the correct management of a hunting rifle out in the field; be it hunting as a team or deerstalking in a dusky Sunday evening, followed by hours spent together near the campfire: Hubertia provides some of life's experiences in its purest form.\n\nA hunting school offers courses to obtain the hunting license,with classes taking place at the fraternity house. This license, colloquially referred to as the \"Green Diploma\" does take about half a year of work and covers information from flora and fauna to legal and safety issues as well as the proper way to handle and successfully apply fire arms, in essence delivering a \"forestry light\" course. Most of the participants are students at the local universities, studying subjects from Algebra over Medicine, and Law to Engineering.\n\nHunting in general and the experience with other Corps brothers specifically has a very high standing within the fraternity. Many of the alumni provide the hunting location and hospitality to members as well as invited guests, often organizing joint events with the younger members from Freiburg. The tradition strengthens bonds across different age groups and usually forms and deepens lifelong friendships.\n\nCorps form relationships with each other that are the basis for regular visits and various forms of support between the fraternities. One of Hubertia's relationships, yet, is an exceptional one: The bond formed with the Corps Friso-Cheruskia (WSC) in Karlsruhe established a bridge between the two main Corps associations, the KSCV and the . This brigding bond is unique for all Corps in Europe. Hubertia continued to form relationships with like-minded Corps, as elaborated in the following section.\n\n\n\nImpressions of Corps Hubertia's traditions outliving the times from the 19th to the 21st century.\n\n\n"}

Denominations may also be used with other means of payment like gift cards. For example, \"five euros\" is the denomination of a five euro note.\n\nIn a currency, there is usually a main unit (base), and a subunit that is a fraction of the main unit. In some countries, there are multiple levels of subunits. In the former Ottoman Empire, 1 lira = 100 kuruş = 4000 para = 12000 akçe. Today, only a few places have more than one subunit, notably the Jordanian dinar is divided into 10 dirham, 100 qirsh/piastres, or 1000 fils. Many countries where Western European languages are spoken currently have their main units divided into 100 subunits. Some currencies that previously had subunits no longer do, because inflation has rendered the subunit useless. A prominent example is the Japanese yen, which was formerly divided into 100 sen or 1000 rin. Both subunits were demonetized at the end of 1953.\n\nOccasionally, a super unit is used as a multiple of the main unit. Examples include Korean won = 5 yang in 1893, Iranian toman 10 rials (used informally today). In the Ottoman Empire, lira and kuruş were super units at some point before becoming the main unit.\n\nA decimal currency is a currency where the ratio between the main unit and the subunit is an integral power of 10. Non-decimal currencies are now rare but had some advantages in daily life transactions. For example, 1 South German Gulden = 60 Kreuzer. 60 can be divided into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 or 30 parts that are still integers, making pricing easy. This advantage (in an age without mechanical or electronic calculators) and the lack of widespread accurate weighing apparatus (meaning an item might sometimes simply be divided in 2,4,6 etc.) coupled with tradition were the reasons why non-decimal currencies were used.\n\nIn theory, two countries currently use non-decimal currency: Mauritania (1 ouguiya = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja). In practice, however, the value of the main unit in each case is so low (less than 1/1000 of a United States dollar) that the sub-unit is not of any practical use and is rarely seen in circulation. In the case of the iraimbilanja, this is a carryover of the Madagascar's previous currency, the Malagasy franc, which had the ariary as a super unit worth 5 francs, and iraimbilanja was an alternate term for the franc. The last major countries to use non-decimal currencies in practice were the United Kingdom (until 1971), Ireland (1971), Malta (1972) and Nigeria (1973).\n\nThe \"optimal denomination problem\"\nis a problem for people who design entirely new currencies:\nWhat denominations should be chosen for the coins\nin order to minimize the average effort required to make change --\ni.e., the average number of coins needed to make change?\nAs of 2014, most decimal currencies use a 1-2-5 series of coins,\nbut some other set of denominations would require fewer denominations of coins or a smaller average number of coins to make change or both.\n\nIt is common to name a unit with a unit of weight, such as pound, lira, and baht. In most cases, these currencies were originally defined as that amount of some precious metal. Another choice of name is some form of derivative of the political entity. The Afghan afghani and European euro fall into this category. Sometimes the name is simply the name of the metal of which the coins were or are made, such as Polish złoty (“golden”) and Vietnamese đồng (“copper”), or its geographical origin, e.g. Joachimsthaler (see Dollar).\n\n"}
{"id": "42935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42935", "title": "Detection", "text": "Detection\n\nIn general, detection is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from or synchronization with the sender.\n\nIn the history of radio communications, the term \"detector\" was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio signal, since all communications were in Morse code. The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic waves present. Detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier signal, as in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting, but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from noise, as in radio astronomy, or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in steganography.\n\nIn optoelectronics, \"detection\" means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. For example, the light signal received through an optical fiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode.\n\nIn steganography, attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as steganalysis. Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. \n\nIn the military, detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance.\n\nFinally, the art of detection, also known as \"following clues\", is the work of a detective in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.\n\n"}
{"id": "30946399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30946399", "title": "Displacement (linguistics)", "text": "Displacement (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, displacement is the capability of language to communicate about things that are not immediately present (spatially or temporally); i.e., things that are either not here or are not here now.\n\nIn 1960, Charles F. Hockett proposed displacement as one of 13 design features of language that distinguish human language from animal communication systems (ACSs):\n\nHoneybees use the waggle dance to communicate the location of a patch of flowers suitable for foraging. The degree of displacement in this example remains limited when compared to human language. A bee can only communicate the location of the most recent food source it has visited. It cannot communicate an idea about a food source at a specific point in the past, nor can it speculate about food sources in the future. In addition, displacement in the waggle dance is restricted by the language's lack of creativity and productivity. The bees can express direction and distance, but it has been experimentally determined that they lack a sign for \"above\". It is also doubtful that bees can communicate about non-existent nectar for the purpose of deception. Consequently, in honeybee communication, the potential for displacement is limited, but it is there insofar as they have the ability to communicate about something not currently present (i.e., something that is spatially removed).\n\nAnts have been observed sending out scouts to patrol for food items, and coming back for other workers if the food found is too large to bring to the nest by the finder alone, for example a dead caterpillar that is too heavy. This again would involve displacement by communicating outside of the here and now. Recruitment has also been observed by the African Weaver Ant \"Oecophylla longinoda\" for the purpose of communicating new food sources, emigration to new sites, and for defense against intruders. Researchers have described no less than five distinct systems to fulfill these functions in this species. The ants communicate using a system composed of olfactory or scent clues from several glands together with body movements. The animals will use antennation, body jerking, and/or mouth-opening, and will combine these clues with the application of the scent trails or scent release to pass on information regarding resources or intruders.\n\nRavens (\"Corvus corax\") have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal. However, at first glance their motivation for recruiting is less obvious, and the specifics of their communication system are more elusive. Still, it has been documented that ravens must have such a system, as their patterns of gathering at sites clearly indicate that they must have been informed of the presence of the resource. It is believed that non-mated ravens call in a group of other non-mated birds to be able to feed and not get chased away by mated territorial pairs of established ravens.\n\nThe need to convey information using displacement has been suspected to have been the evolutionary pressure leading to language development in humans, as outlined by Derek Bickerton in \"Adam's Tongue\". The pressure of such need is present in species with a foraging strategy that presents the challenge of directing members of its group to a food source too large to be utilized singly or in small numbers, requiring recruitment of assistance.\n\nThe unique environmental need selecting for a communication system capable for displacement in humans or our direct ancestors is not identified, but hypotheses include Bickerton's theory of small groups finding large herbivore carcasses, and needing the assistance from other small groups of humans to defend against other dangerous scavengers (large cats, hyenas) competing for the same source of food. Language development most certainly did not stop there—since otherwise bees or ants would have comparable communication systems to ours—but this is where it is hypothesized to have begun, giving our ancestors the ability to take communication out of the here and now.\n\n"}

Published by Del Rey Books in 2003, it is the eighteenth book in the \"Dragonriders of Pern\" series and the first with Todd as co-author.\n\n\"Dragon's Kin\" may be considered the first of a trilogy by the McCaffreys, preceding \"Dragon's Fire\" and \"Dragon Harper\". Primarily the three books feature Kindan as a boy and young man, about 500 years after landing on Pern (500 AL).\n\nAnne McCaffrey (1926–2011) created Pern in the novella \"Weyr Search\" (1967) when her second child Todd was eleven. In 2001 and 2002 she published her fifteenth Pern novel and second collection of short stories. \"Dragon's Kin\" was their first collaborative work.\n\nTodd later recalled that a Del Rey editor in the 1990s \"pitched it to me that someone ought to continue Mum’s legacy when she was no longer able. At the time I had misgivings and no story ideas.\"\n\nPreviously, as Todd Johnson, he had contributed the chapter \"Training and Fighting Dragons\" to \"The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern\" (1989). Mother and son had also discussed Pern and its setting for years, and she had suggested that he \"write the military science fiction prequels\" to the colonization, but that never progressed far.\n\nThey co-authored four Pern novels and, as of December 2011, Todd has done three alone. All are set just before and during the \"Third Pass\", about 500 years after human settlement on Pern and 2000 years before the \"Ninth Pass\" events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books.\n\nThe story tells how the people of the fictional planet Pern discover the special abilities of the watch-whers or whers, a distant relative of the dragons. Subsequently, these beasts are used in mines to warn miners of gas pockets and also to locate stranded miners, should there be a cave-in.\n\nThe story begins some years before the 3rd Pass in Camp Natalon, a mining camp. There, the reader is introduced to a young boy Kindan, whose father owns a watch-wher called Dask. During a mining cave-in, Kindan loses his entire family as well as Dask, and is adopted by the Master Harper Zist, who begins to train him to be both an entertainer and a spy, something that Harpers do. This is how Kindan learns that the camp is divided into two parties, Natalon's and his uncle Tarik's.\n\nMeanwhile, the camp is without a watch-wher and minor accidents keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tarik and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of coal for a chance for Kindan to ask a queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins the difficult task of raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train the watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, towards the end of the novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon.\n\nCitations – books\n"}

The book, which deals with death and the afterlife, has been translated into various languages, including Dutch and English, and was adapted in animated and movie format.\n\nThe story involves a duck who acquaints a character called Death who, as it turns out, has been following her all her life. The two become friends, discussing life, death, and what any afterlife might be like. They go diving together and sit in a tree, pondering what would happen to the duck's lake after her death. The duck reports that some ducks say that they become angels and sit on clouds, looking down on earth. Death says that this is possible since ducks already have wings. Then, she says that some ducks also say that there is a hell, down below, where bad ducks are roasted; Death replies that it's remarkable what ducks all think of, and says \"who knows,\" prompting the duck to respond, \"so you don't know either.\" In the end, the duck indeed dies, and Death carries her to a river, placing the duck gently in the water and laying the tulip on her: \"For a long time he watched her. When she was lost to sight, he was almost a little moved.\"\n\nThe book was nominated for the 2008 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis; the jury praised Erlbruch's \"soft-philosophical \"Pas de deux\"\" and his sparse illustrations: \"the radical reduction of the images underlines the dramatic subject matter in a fulminant manner.\" Meg Rosoff, in a review for \"The Guardian\", called \"Duck, Death and the Tulip\" an \"outstanding book\": \"There is something infinitely tender in the way Death strokes her ruffled feathers into place, lifts her body and places it gently in the river, watching as she drifts off into the distance.\"\nSieglinde Duchateau, in a review of the Dutch translation, also praised the book: \"The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and full of comfort. In the masterpiece a difficult theme is made accessible for children in an idiosyncratic manner with a touch of humor.\"\n\nFor his illustrations, Erlbruch received honorable mention in the 2008 Dutch Gouden Penseel competition for best children's book illustrations.\n\nAn animated adaptation was directed by Matthias Bruhn; Death was voiced by Harry Rowohlt, Duck by Anna Thalbach.

She formed suffrage clubs in several different states and in Canada, and became one of the district presidents of the Ohio Women's Suffrage Association.\n\nEllen Sulley was born in the parish of Calverton, Nottinghamshire, England, December 2, 1832. She was descended from Huguenot and Danish ancestors. Her mother was a near relative of Lord Denman, Chief Justice of England. Her father was Richard Sulley. who married Elizabeth Denman in 1827, and of their six children, Fray was the third daughter. Her father was a well-known writer upon social and economical questions, and had distinguished himself at the time of the repeal of the Corn Laws in England. When she was but a child, Mr. Sulley moved with his family to the United States, and after some years located in Rochester, New York.\n\nDuring the early years of her life, while they were traveling from place to place, opportunities for education were limited so lar as books were concerned. Her father thought that it mattered little, as all that girls needed was to write and read, with a little knowledge of arithmetic added. Fray became a reader and a student of history. As a young girl, Fray heard such subjects discussed constantly and became deeply interested in all reforms of the day.\n\nIn 1848, she first became roused upon the question of woman suffrage, through attendance upon a convention held in Rochester and presided over by Abigail Bush, with Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and others of the earlier agitators as speakers. That marked an epoch in her life. She had learned of woman's inferiority through the religious instruction which she had received, but henceforth she felt that something in it was wrong. She was advised by her Sunday School teacher carefully to study and compare passages in the Old and New Testaments. That she did thoroughly, and became satisfied that Christ nowhere made any difference between the sexes. Henceforth, her work lay in the direction thus given, and she labored to promote political equality for woman and to advance her rights in the industrial fields.\n\nShe formed suffrage clubs in several different States and in Canada, and was repeatedly a delegate to National councils, giving her time and money for the cause. In 1886, Fray entered into a political canvass in Rochester to put a woman upon the board of managers of the State Industrial School; with Mary Stafford Anthony, she worked for three weeks and gained the victory. She went on to become one of the district presidents of the Ohio Woman's Suffrage Association and a prominent member of several of the leading clubs -literary, social and economic- in Toledo. Fray was a member of the Lucas County Board of Visitors to Charitable and Correctional Institutions, and served as president of the Lucas County Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nIn 1853, she married Frank M. Fray, and they made their home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, before moving to Toledo, Ohio in 1870. It was a happy union, lasting for twenty years, until the death of Mr. Fray. Her two children died in childhood, leaving her alone and free to devote herself to those things which she felt were of a character to help humanity. She died in 1903.\n\n"}

As opposed to commercial theatres, group theatre is \"a theatre that is not professional or commercial\", characterized by its tendency for experimentation in theme, content and production, and its aim of using the proscenium stage to highlight social messages, rather than having primarily making-money objectives.Bikramgarh Maru Behag group theatre director Smt.Jolly Guha Roy\n\nThe play \"Nabanna\" in 1944 is said to be the birth of group theatres in Kolkata. \"Nabanna\" was written by Bijon Bhattacharya, who also co-directed it with Sambhu Mitra. They were both active members of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), the association of leftist theatre-artists. In the commercial theatres at that time, entertainment was the sole purpose. However, the time was tumultuous—the Indian independence movement was strengthening on the backdrop of the World War 2, and the plight of Bengal province was further worsened by the Bengal famine of 1943. Activists and thinkers attempted to use the media of theatre to highlight the plight of the people, and to stage a form of artistic protest.\n\nIn this backdrop, the drama \"Nabanna\" portrayed a group of peasants as victim of the famine. The peasants had to leave their village due to famine, and they traveled to Kolkata with the hope for survival in the big city. However, they faced a series of crises and eventually got \"...reduced to the most abject acknowledge poverty in Kolkata, where they develop a political awareness of their suffering\". Another production of IPTA was \"Jobanbondi\".\n\nPrior to the start of group theatre movement, the commercial theatre of Kolkata strived to attract audiences based on star-power. Popular actors such as Sisir Bhaduri, Ahindra Chowdhury and others were considered consistent crowd-pullers. The group theatre tried to depart from this paradigm. Instead of superstars, the emphasis in group theatre was on the group—which was commonly an amalgamation of non-professional participants who identified themselves with the social motives of the movement and participated in the production out of passion for the art. The attempt was to make \"gononatyo\" (people's theatre).\n\nThe initial group of IPTA dispersed in 1947. However, the principal members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. Ahindra Chowdhuri, Sombhu Mitra and Tripti Mitra were the leading members of the group \"Bohurupee\". \"Raktakarabi\", \"Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana\", \"Char Adhyay\" (written by Rabindranath Tagore) were some of the earlier productions of Bohurupee. Utpal Dutt led another faction of artists and went to create classics like \"Tiner Talowar\" and \"Kallol\". In 1950s and 1960s, many critically acclaimed productions were staged, which used international literature including the works of Anton Chekhov, Luigi Pirandello, Henrik Ibsen and Bertolt Brecht. According to one critic, the productions had the \"right mix of democratic politics — with certain groups drifting towards a revolutionary rhetoric — and humane ideals, based on literature drawn from the world over\".\n\nNotable group theatres include the Little Theatre Group, Gandharba, Theatre Commune, Amulya Natyagosthi, Calcutta Theatre, Nandikar.\nGhola Kaalmukur\n\nSome notable personalities associated with group theatre movement in Kolkata are as follows:\nSanjay chakraborty founded [ultadanga dashkatha] in 2011\n"}

It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. Joseph Victor von Scheffel provided the lyrics under the title Altassyrisch (Old Assyrian) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier.\n\nThe lyrics reflect an endorsement of the bacchanalian mayhem of student life, similar as in Gaudeamus igitur. The song describes an old Assyrian drinking binge of a man in an inn with some references to the Classics. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in cuneiform on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption. Charles Godfrey Leland has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel. Each stanza begins with the naming verse \"Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon\", but varies the outcome. The \"Im\" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:\n<br>\nIm schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon\n<br>\nDa trank ein Mann drei Tag',\n<br>\nBis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel\n<br>\nAm Marmortische lag.\n<br>\n\n'In the Black Whale at Ascalon\n<br>\nA man drank day by day,\n<br>\nTill, stiff as any broom-handle,\n<br>\nUpon the floor he lay.\n<br>\n\nIn the Black Whale at Ascalon\n<br>\nThe waiters brought the bill,\n<br>\nIn arrow-heads on six broad tiles\n<br>\nTo him who thus did swill.\n<br>\n\nIn the Black Whale at Ascalon\n<br>\nNo prophet hath renown;\n<br>\nAnd he who there would drink in peace\n<br>\nMust pay the money down.\n<br>\nIn typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science, as e.g. Historical criticism and interpretations of the Book of Jonah as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as „Aussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi“ (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.\nThe song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and Bad Säckingen. In Bad Säckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club \"Walfisch Gesellschaft Säckingen\" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.\n\nThere is one version just and only one for mathematics, called 'International'.\n\nIn ancient times, upon the door <br>\nOf Plato, there was writt'n: <br>\n“To each non-mathematicus <br>\nThe entrance is forbidd'n.<br>\n\nThe same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (Μελαίνῃ τῇ ἐν Φαλαίνᾳ - Melaínē (black) tē (the) en (in) Phalaína (whale)) and Volapük, which are sung one after the other.\n\n\n"}

They come in a procession that comprises a leading Guardian figure, followed by a Caregiver and an Entertainer. Figures of Dragons and Phoenixes are also common as symbols of freedom and regeneration.\n\nIn Korean mythology, the dead was believed to be in angst and confusion. To ease the experience of the afterlife, a procession of helpful figures would accompany them to guide and protect them, care for them, and entertain them. These figures were symbolised by lavishly decorated wooden servant statuettes that ornated the funeral bier, and were commonplace during the Joseon Dynasty, including for commoners. The practice came in favour in the 4th century CE and endured until the early 20th century.\n\nThe Guardian serves the dead by guiding him in the afterlife, and by driving away evil spirits. Traditionally mounted, fierce-looking and armed with swords or poled weapons, he later took the form of an army officer or policeman in Western-inspired attire, with a sabre.\n\nThe Caregiver serves the dead as if he was still alive, providing medical and prophylactic care. This figure is often a woman, or sometimes a couple. He comes immediately behind the Guardian in the procession.\n\nThe Entertainer fulfills a comforting role for both the spirit of the deceased and for the living who mourn them. This figure is often an acrobat or a musician. \nFigures of Dragons or Phoenixes are often featured on the bier, as symbols of regeneration as well as of the freedom gained by the soul of the deceased departing their body.\n\n"}

{"id": "168315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168315", "title": "Laundry symbol", "text": "Laundry symbol\n\nA laundry symbol, also called a care symbol, is a pictogram which represents a method of washing, for example drying, dry-cleaning and ironing clothing. Such symbols are written on labels, known as care labels or care tags, attached to clothing to indicate how a particular item should best be cleaned. Standard symbols for these care labels differ by region. In some standards, pictograms coexist with or are complemented by written instructions.\n\nThe Canadian system was formerly based on colour: green for \"go ahead\", yellow for \"be careful\", and red for \"stop\". That system was abandoned in favour of a common North American scheme.\n\nAlthough there is an international standard that has been agreed by the ISO and within Europe by the EU, copyright laws make it difficult to publish these widely. However, there have been attempts to summarize the main national and international standards.\n\nGINETEX, based in France, is the European association for textile care labelling, and formed in 1963 after academic conferences in the late 1950s were formed to define one standard of labelling.\n\nThe care label describes the allowable treatment of the garment without damaging the textile. Whether this treatment is necessary or sufficient, is not stated. A milder than specified treatment is always acceptable. The symbols are protected and their use is required to comply with the license conditions; incorrect labelling is prohibited. A bar below each symbol calls for a gentler treatment than usual and a double bar for a very gentle treatment.\n\nA stylized \"washtub\" is shown, and the number in the tub means the maximum wash temperature (degrees Celsius). A bar under the tub signifies a gentler treatment in the washing machine. A double bar signifies very gentle handling. A hand in the tub signifies that only (gentle) hand washing (not above 40°C) is allowed. A cross through washtub means that the textile may not be washed under normal household conditions. \n\nIn the European standard, the level of wash agitation recommended is indicated by bars below the wash tub symbol. Absence of bar indicates a maximum agitation (cotton wash), a single bar indicates medium agitation (synthetics cycle) and a double bar indicates very minimal agitation (silk/wool cycle). The bar symbols also indicate the level of spin recommended with more bars indicating lower preferred spin speed.\n\nAn empty \"triangle\" (formerly lettered Cl) allows the bleaching with chlorine or non-chlorine bleach. Two oblique lines in the triangle prohibit chlorine bleaching. A crossed triangle prohibits any bleaching.\n\nA \"circle in the square\" symbolizes a clothes dryer. One dot requires drying at reduced temperature and two dots for normal temperature. The crossed symbol means that the clothing does not tolerate machine drying. In the U.S. and Japan, there are other icons for natural drying.\n\nThe \"iron\" with up to three dots allows for ironing. The number of dots are assigned temperatures: one prescribes 110°C, two for 150°C and three for 200°C. An iron with a cross prohibits ironing.\n\nA \"circle\" identifies the possibilities of professional cleaning. A bar under the symbol means clean gently, and two bars means very gentle cleaning.\n\nThe letters P and F in a circle are for the different solvents used in professional dry cleaning.\n\nThe letter W in a circle is for professional wet cleaning. \n\n"}
{"id": "3288450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3288450", "title": "List of Rush instrumentals", "text": "List of Rush instrumentals\n\nThe Canadian rock band Rush has written, recorded, and performed several instrumentals throughout its career.\n\nFrom the \"2112\" album, \"Overture\" opens up one of Rush's concept suites. Geddy Lee's voice is recorded as an instrument in the early parts of the song, as he sings no words. However, there is, despite the Overture's overall instrumental nature, one line sung at the end, as the piece transitions to \"The Temples of Syrinx\": \"And the Meek shall inherit the Earth\". Like some overtures, music from the \"2112\" Overture is repeated or built upon in other places in the suite, such as \"The Temples of Syrinx\", \"Presentation\", \"Oracle: The Dream\", and \"Soliloquy.\" At the end of Overture, there's a direct quotation from Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\", played by Lifeson.\n\nThis section of the suite includes some \"spoken\" lines at the end, with the following sentences repeated three times successively: \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation\", and then \"We have assumed control\".\n\nLa Villa Strangiato was released on the 1978 album \"Hemispheres\", and is subtitled \"An Exercise in Self-Indulgence\". The 9:37 song, the fourth and final track of the album, was Rush's first entirely instrumental piece. The multi-part piece was inspired by a dream guitarist Alex Lifeson had, and the music in these sections correspond to the occurrences in his dream. The opening segment was played on a nylon-string classical guitar. The next segment introduces the main theme of La Villa, the Strangiato theme. The song progresses to include an increasingly complex guitar solo backed by string synthesizer, followed closely by bass and drum fills. The Strangiato theme is then revisited before the song ends abruptly with phased bass and drums. The song is divided as follows:\n\n\nLive versions of \"La Villa Strangiato\" have often featured altered sections. For instance, on \"Exit...Stage Left\", Lee sings part of a nursery rhyme over \"Danforth and Pape\" (the liner notes include a translation of his words) and adds a short bass solo during \"Monsters! (Reprise).\" During later tours, as documented on Rush in Rio, a drum/bass vamp was inserted before \"Strangiato Theme (Reprise),\" over which Lifeson made a stream of consciousness rant. The classical guitar introduction was either played on electric guitar or, more commonly, cut out altogether. During the 2010-2011 Time Machine Tour, the piece began with a polka rendition of \"To sleep, perchance to dream,\" then transitioned into the original arrangement.\n\nThe band set out to record the song in one take, however it ultimately required three separate takes. According to Lee, \"We spent more time recording 'Strangiato' than the entire \"Fly By Night\" album. It was our first piece without any vocals at all. So each section had to stand up with a theme and musical structure of its own.\"\n\nThe segments titled \"Monsters!\" and \"Monsters! (Reprise)\" are an adaptation of Raymond Scott's popular composition \"Powerhouse\". Though Scott's publishers did not attempt to take legal action until the statute of limitations had run out, Rush's management, feeling it was the right thing to do, gave some monetary compensation to Mr. and Mrs. Scott.\n\n\"La Villa Strangiato\" translates roughly to \"The Strange Village\" or \"Weird City\".\n\nFrom the \"Moving Pictures\" album. \"YYZ\" (natively pronounced \"why-why-zed\") is the airport code for the Toronto Pearson International Airport, and the instrumental opens with a rhythm in 5/4 that is Morse code for \"YYZ\" (-.-- -.-- --..). The piece evolved into a drum/bass solo during the 1980s. \"YYZ\" was the first of six Rush songs (over three decades) to be nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\n\nFrom the \"Roll the Bones\" album, \"Where's My Thing?\" was Rush's second song nominated for a Grammy, losing to Eric Johnson's \"Cliffs of Dover\". The song has a pop-oriented feel, featuring an upbeat tempo and a brass-like synthesizer line. On the original album, it is humorously subtitled \"Part IV: 'Gangster of Boats' Trilogy.\" The song was performed on the \"Roll the Bones\" tour and did not appear in concert again until the 2012 Clockwork Angels Tour, with an added drum solo. This version of the song was titled \"Where's My Thing?/Here It Is!\" on the live album \"Clockwork Angels Tour\".\n\nFrom the \"Counterparts\" album. During the \"Counterparts\", \"Test for Echo\", and \"Vapor Trails\" tours, and featured on the \"Different Stages\" and \"Rush in Rio\" live albums, \"Leave That Thing Alone\" preceded Peart's drum solo and was played with an extended ending to showcase Lee's bass work. It was then omitted from the set lists until 2010's Time Machine Tour.\n\nThis track was the third song nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1994, losing to Pink Floyd's \"Marooned.\"\n\nFrom the \"Test for Echo\" album. Like the \"2112 Overture,\" \"Limbo\" features vocals by Lee; however, he does not sing any lyrics. The song includes spoken samples from Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett's novelty song \"Monster Mash.\"\n\nRush's album \"Snakes & Arrows\" is the first Rush album to feature multiple instrumental tracks: \"The Main Monkey Business\", \"Hope\", and \"Malignant Narcissism\". \"The Main Monkey Business\" is just over six minutes long. As with \"Limbo\" and \"2112 Overture\", Lee's voice is briefly heard, but no words are sung. The other two songs, \"Hope\" and \"Malignant Narcissism\", are two of the shortest songs ever recorded by Rush, both being just over two minutes long. \"Hope\" is a solo guitar piece written by Lifeson. \"Malignant Narcissism\" features Lee playing a fretless bass and Peart on a four-piece drum kit. \"Malignant Narcissism\" contains a spoken sample, \"Usually a case of malignant narcissism brought on during childhood,\" from the movie \"\". \"Malignant Narcissism\" became the fifth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance, in 2008, losing to Bruce Springsteen's \"Once Upon A Time In The West\". A live recording of \"Hope\" from the album \"\" became the sixth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2009. It lost to Zappa Plays Zappa's \"Peaches en Regalia\".\n\nFound on the \"Exit...Stage Left\" live album, \"Broon's Bane\" is a short classical guitar arrangement performed by Lifeson as an extended intro to \"The Trees.\" The song is named after Terry Brown, nicknamed \"Broon\" by the band, who produced \"Exit...Stage Left\" and 10 other Rush albums. (On the same album, Lee refers to Brown as \"T.C. Broonsie\" when introducing \"Jacob's Ladder.\") It is not featured on any other live or studio recording by Rush. The song repeats and builds upon the same three-beat line, coming to a climax about one minute into the piece before segueing into \"The Trees.\"\n\nOn the live album \"Rush in Rio\", an abridged version of \"Cygnus X-1\" is performed as an instrumental. The piece consists of the \"Prologue\" section of the song, without the spoken introduction. The Moog Taurus synthesizer heard in the studio recording is replaced with a choir-like synthesizer sound.\n\nOn the R40 Live Tour, the Prelude of Book II was played, transposed down by one whole step due to Lee's decreased vocal range. Immediately afterward, the band played the first and third parts of Book I as instrumentals, with a Peart drum solo as an interlude between them.\n\nThe opening song of Rush's 2004 tour dates featured an instrumental combining sections of one song from each of the band's first six albums.\n\nThe songs featured in the medley were:\n\nDuring the 2010-11 Time Machine Tour, Lifeson would perform a brief 12-string guitar piece (entitled \"O'Malley's Break\" on the CD and DVD) that segued into \"Closer to the Heart.\"\n\nDuring the 2012 Clockwork Angels Tour, Lifeson would play a guitar solo (called \"Peke's Repose\" on the CD/DVD/BD) that served as an introduction to \"Halo Effect\".\n\nA staple and highlight of Rush's concerts is a drum solo by Neil Peart. These solos have been featured on every live album released by the band. On the early live albums (\"All the World's a Stage\" and \"Exit...Stage Left\"), the drum solo was included as part of a song (\"Working Man/Finding My Way\" and \"YYZ,\" respectively). On all subsequent live albums, the drum solo has been included on a separate track. On \"A Show of Hands\" and \"Different Stages\", the drum solos were titled \"The Rhythm Method\" (a pun on the form of birth control); on \"Rush in Rio\", it was entitled \"O Baterista\"; and on \"R30 Live In Frankfurt\" it was titled \"Der Trommler\". On Rush's 2008 live album, \"Snakes & Arrows Live\", it is titled \"De Slagwerker,\" and is coupled with \"Malignant Narcissism\" on the track-list. \"O Baterista\" was the fourth song nominated for a Grammy, in 2005, losing to Brian Wilson's \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\". For the 2010 Time Machine Tour, the solo was called \"Love 4 Sale,\" but was renamed \"Moto Perpetuo\" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.\n\nThe titles \"O Baterista\", \"Der Trommler\" and \"De Slagwerker\" all translate to \"The Drummer\" in Portuguese, German and Dutch respectively.\n\nAll of Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, leaving each performance unique. Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favor of newer, more-complex ones. Since the mid-late 1980s Peart has utilized MIDI trigger pads to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a marimba, harp, temple blocks, triangles, glockenspiel, orchestra bells, tubular bells, timpani and vibra-slap as well as other, more esoteric percussion. Some purely electronic, description-defying sounds are also used. All are incorporated into each drum solo.\n\nPeart's solos from 1987 until 2007 included marimba excerpts from \"Pieces of Eight,\" a piece that first appeared as a flexi disc record in the May 1987 issue of \"Modern Drummer\" magazine. In addition, all solos since 1991 have contained marimba portions of another Peart composition entitled \"Momo's Dance Party,\" and those from 1991 to 2004 featured a complex pattern from the song \"Scars\" (from the studio album \"Presto\"). For the \"Vapor Trails\" and R30 tours, each solo concluded with a section of the Count Basie standard \"One O'Clock Jump,\" which Peart recorded while producing \"Burning For Buddy\", a two-volume tribute album to legendary big band drummer and bandleader, Buddy Rich. For the Snakes & Arrows Tour, Peart replaced the finale with an excerpt from \"Cotton Tail,\" which he recorded with the Buddy Rich Band in the mid-1990s. For the Time Machine Tour, Peart again replaced the finale with an excerpt from the Buddy Rich standard \"Love for Sale,\" which he also performed with the Buddy Rich Big Band at a 2008 memorial concert. He initially named the solo after that song, calling it \"Love 4 Sale,\" but eventually changed the name to \"Moto Perpetuo\" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.\n\nFor the Clockwork Angels Tour, Peart played three short drum solos instead of a single long one: an interlude during \"Where's My Thing?\" in the first set, then an interlude during \"Headlong Flight\" and a lead-in to \"Red Sector A\" in the second. The solos were respectively named \"Here It Is!\", \"Drumbastica,\" and \"The Percussor - (I) Binary Love Theme / (II) Steambanger's Ball\" on the tour's live album/DVD release. \"The Percussor\" is a mainly electronic drum solo dominated by the sounds of triggered samples assigned to many parts of Peart's kit.\n\nFor the R40 Live Tour, Peart played two short solos: the \"Drumbastica\" interlude during \"Headlong Flight\" in the first set, and an interlude named \"The Story So Far\" during \"Cygnus X-1\" in the second.\n\n"}
{"id": "2907238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2907238", "title": "Metal Slug", "text": "Metal Slug\n\nThe gameplay of the series is characteristic of run and gun games: large numbers of enemies and a player character with extremely powerful weapons. In most run and guns, contact with an enemy leads to damage. In this series, however, contact results in the opportunity to perform a melee attack and the opportunity for the enemy to perform a melee attack of his own, if he has one. The player's melee attack is also much stronger than most shots. This leads to the players ability to run in and use melee attacks to take down a number of enemies, and the ability to quickly defeat enemies that can take plenty of damage, such as the mummies in \"Metal Slug 2\".\n\nThe player starts with only a simple handgun; as the game progresses, the player may pick up new weapons. The player can only use one weapon at a time. When a new weapon is found, it replaces the previous one. Similarly, when ammunition runs out, the player reverts to using the handgun, which has unlimited ammunition. A new system was implemented with \"Metal Slug 6\" allowing players to carry and switch between the handgun and two other weapons. The player is also equipped with grenades which can be used to throw at enemies and cause more damage, however the number of grenades is limited and must be replenished periodically with ammunition found along the way.\n\nThe SV-001 (SV being an abbreviation for \"Super Vehicle\") or 'Metal Slug' is the main vehicle of the \"Metal Slug\" franchise. It is a small, cartoonish silver-gray tank propelled by caterpillar treads. The tank is armed with one cannon which shoots powerful bombs in limited numbers, and twin vulcan cannons which shoot unlimited tracer bullets. The vehicle can jump and crouch. Crouching opens a hatch on the top of the tank through which grenades already in the player's possession can be thrown. The grenades remain independent of the cannon's ammunition system. The vehicle's bombs can also be replenished with ammunition boxes found along the way. The vehicle can run over infantry and perform a suicide attack, with the driver jumping clear and the tank ramming into and exploding upon the target. The vehicle can take three direct hits before it is destroyed, at which point a warning will be given to eject before the vehicle explodes. The enemy chaser variant has a shield that must be destroyed before the vehicle can be destroyed.\n\nOver time, these specifications changed into any vehicle armed with a vulcan cannon and a cannon variant suited to the role of the vehicle, and propelled suitably for that vehicle's environment. Some vehicles will only provide vulcan cannons (which are more powerful than the handgun's bullets and are also unlimited), but neither special bombs (grenades must be used) nor armored protection to the player. In \"Metal Slug 6\" (and the home version of \"Metal Slug\" X, 3, 4, 5), the playable character Tarma can lock the vulcan cannons into one position and fire continuously.\n\nMetal Slug games typically have 6 levels. The exceptions are Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 5, and Metal Slug 6, which have 5 and Metal Slug 7 which has 7. In several of the arcade and console versions, the game would have the blood censored, showing white blood instead of red. However, there is a code to disable this censor.\n\nMetal Slug 1 through to 5 were created for Neo-Geo, though some of these titles were later ported to platforms including the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Nintendo Switch and also for PC via Steam. Subsequent main games and spin-offs were created for platforms including Nintendo DS, Neo Geo Pocket Color and Game Boy Advance. A collection of the first seven games in the main series, including the \"Metal Slug X\" remake, \"Metal Slug Anthology\", is available for the Wii, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2, with a similar collection, \"Metal Slug Collection PC\", being available for PC, while a revamped version of the seventh game, Metal Slug XX is separately sold from the collection. A spin-off tower defense game, \"Metal Slug Defense\", was created for iOS and Android. Another spin-off game, \"Metal Slug Touch\", was created just for iOS in 2009, though was removed from the App Store in 2012.\n\nThe first game's story involved the Peregrine Falcon (PF) Squad, a small but skilled team of soldiers serving under the Regular Army's special operations division, who fight against the army of General Donald Morden in order to prevent a massive coup d'état and the creation of a New World Order. Later games featured characters from the Sparrows Unit, which is under the control of the Regular Army's intelligence division. Beginning with \"Metal Slug 2\", the PF Squad also battles an alien threat to Earth (the Mars People), as well as several other supernatural threats including yetis, zombies, ambulatory Venus flytraps, giant crabs, and mummies. These outlandish elements were removed from the fourth game to return to the feel of the original title. The fifth moved to the motif of modern guerrilla warfare, leaving only traces of the series' signature quirky humor and paranormal enemies, with the exception of the final boss. \"Metal Slug 6\" returned to the plot of the first three installments, bringing back Morden's Rebel Army and the Mars People. \"Metal Slug 7\" has less outlandish elements with the Mars People replaced by an alternative universe of Morden's Army with futuristic equipment and weapons.\n\nMarco Rossi and Tarma Roving were the only playable characters in the first game, and each was reserved solely to the first and second player, respectively. From the second installment, characters can be chosen independently, and Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina \"Fio\" Germi were added to the cast. These four are typically considered to be the quintessential \"Metal Slug\" team. In the fourth game, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey made their debut, replacing Eri and Tarma. They have not returned in later games, as they were created by the Korean-based Mega Enterprise and due to Playmore retaining intellectual rights to all SNK titles. Eri and Tarma returned in the fifth game. The Game Boy Advance edition of the game features two new characters specific to that title: PF squad trainees Walter Ryan and Tyra Elson. \"The King of Fighters\"/\"Ikari Warriors\" characters Ralf Jones and Clark Still have appeared since \"Metal Slug 6\", and their \"King of Fighters\" teammate Leona Heidern is available as an extra downloadable character for \"Metal Slug XX\", a revised edition of \"Metal Slug 7\".\n\nGeneral Donald Morden is the main antagonist of the \"Metal Slug\" franchise. He is depicted as a rambling madman wearing a beret, eyepatch, and wearing his army's uniform. He appears in every game except \"Metal Slug 5.\" He apparently mends his ways by the end of \"Metal Slug 6\", as he (or Rootmars depending on the player(s)' chosen route) rescues the player(s) after they are knocked off a wall by an explosion caused by the alien end boss. His army is the main force of opposition in the Metal Slug games, with the exception of \"Metal Slug\" 5 and 6. He commands the Rebel Army, and in \"Metal Slug 4\" he was thought to be behind the Amadeus Terror Syndicate. He once again returns to his roots of attempted world domination in \"Metal Slug 7\", this time with the help of the Rebel Army from the future, also being the final boss for the first time since the original \"Metal Slug\". Like the main characters, General Morden appears in various SNK games as a cameo, especially in the \"\" series.\n\nAllen O'Neil, a sub-boss, appears in all of the games except Metal Slug 5 and 6. He returns in Metal Slug 7. He uses an M60 machine gun, a knife, and grenades. Despite the fact that Allen is clearly killed at the conclusion of every encounter, the game makers have humorously brought him back in each new iteration of the series. Allen's son, Allen Jr., appears in \"Metal Slug Advance\" as the recruits' drill sergeant but later reveals himself as a double-agent for the Rebel Army. He can be fought in the final mission as an optional boss.\n\nThe Mars People are aliens that are in a plot to take over Earth in the \"Metal Slug\" universe. They resemble squids, using their tentacles as a form of movement, and a strange fighting style which involves gas and a laser pistol. In \"Metal Slug 2\", they appeared as enemies near the climax of the game, with their mothership appearing as the final boss. They appear again in \"Metal Slug 3\", abducting Morden and one of the members of the Regular Army in the final level (which ever one the player uses will be abducted), only for the Regular Army and Morden's army to take the fight to their mothership and defeat them, and their leader Rootmars. In \"Metal Slug 6\", the Mars People, Morden, as well as his rebel army, and the Ikari Warriors, join forces with the Regular Army to fight a new alien invader who feeds on the Mars People. In \"Metal Slug X\" they appear as enemies early in the game. Mars People also are the first characters from the \"Metal Slug\" series who appear in a fighting game: first in \"\" as a hidden (but playable) character, and later in \"Neo Geo Battle Coliseum\" as an unlockable playable character.\n\nMetal Slug Zero Online was a massively multiplayer online game, part of the \"Metal Slug\" series. It was being developed by SNK Playmore, Namco Bandai Games, and Sammy Corporation for the South Korean market. There was no word on a Japanese or North American release. The game was on course for a 2009 release, however in summer of 2009, developer Dragonfly suspended development of the game due to their belief that the achievement of \"Metal Slug Zero Online\" being developed by Wiz Hands is far below their expectation, and the game could not conform to the trend of current gaming industry. The online game ended 24 March 2013.\n\nThe aspect of the \"Metal Slug\" series was to create a simple, but exciting side-scrolling shoot-em-up game with a very easy control scheme (one joystick and three buttons). The same team that created \"Metal Slug\" for the Neo-Geo previously created several games for Irem which have very similar graphics and gameplay, such as \"GunForce\" (1991), \"In the Hunt\" (1993) and \"Gunforce 2\" (1994). Because of this, some fans refer to \"Gunforce 2\" as \"Metal Slug Zero\".\n\nSome of the stock sound effects and sprites from Irem and The King of Fighters titles were used in the \"Metal Slug\" games. The music was composed by Takushi Hiyamuta (who is credited as \"Hiya!\"), a key member of the Nazca Corporation, which was acquired by SNK in 1996. The first 3 titles were developed by the \"Nazca\" team before SNK declared bankruptcy in October 2001, leading to the disbandment of the original team. Anticipating the collapse of SNK, the company Playmore was launched August 2001, which became known as SNK Playmore in 2003, the year after \"Metal Slug 4\" was released. Development on the series has since continued without the original staff.\n\n"}

Unlike deaf sign languages, they are better understood as forms of symbolic gestural communication rather than languages, and some writers have preferred to describe them as sign lexicons.\n\nThe purposes for which these sign lexicons were used were varied. Travelling Franciscan friars used finger alphabets, possibly as memory aids for preaching, and in Benedictine monasteries, signs representing words were used for limited communication when silence was required. Rather than the popularly imagined total \"Vows of Silence,\" the Rule of St. Benedict actually dictates that conversation is only not allowed in certain areas of the monastery and during certain hours of the day. It was only much later, in the 17th century, that certain Cistercian and Trappist orders came to see absolute silence as a penance to endure along with the other deprivations of their austere lives.\n\nSigns are well documented in medieval Benedictine monasteries of Western Europe, from Portugal to England. Antique texts present lists of words with accompanying signs, including instructions for sign production, and occasionally also the rationale for the choice of sign. Signs are mostly nouns relating to monastic life, such as foods, articles of clothing, particular rooms and buildings, ritual objects, and the many different ranks of clerical office. The few signs that act as verbs include \"sit,\" \"stand up,\" \"kneel,\" and \"confess.\" They almost always bear an iconic or visually motivated connection to the thing represented by the sign. No grammar is described for these signs, and they were probably used in the word order of an oral language—either Latin or the local vernacular—and possibly with accompanying gesture such as pointing. Modern Cistercian monks in England or the United States use a syntax derived \"heavily, but not exclusively,\" from English, while Cistercian monks in France loosely follow the syntax of the French language; at least as much as it is possible to do so, given the limited lexicon. Vocabulary lists in the medieval texts ranged from 52 signs to 472, with \"the average at 178 and a mean at 145.\"\n\nThe earliest Benedictine sign books date from around 1075 (and again at about 1083) at the Abbey of Cluny (in what is now France), and Hirsau Abbey (in what is now Germany) at around the same time. Bonaventure in the 13th century used a finger alphabet, and the medieval \"Monasteriales Indicia\" describes 127 signs used by Anglo-Saxon Benedictine monks.

{"id": "15400699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15400699", "title": "Paladin", "text": "Paladin\n\nThe paladins (), sometimes known as the Twelve Peers, were the foremost warriors of Charlemagne's court, according to the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. They first appear in the early \"chansons de geste\" such as \"The Song of Roland\", where they represent Christian valour against the Saracen hordes inside Europe.\n\nThe paladins and their associated exploits are largely later fictional inventions, with some basis in historical Frankish retainers of the 8th century and events such as the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778 and the confrontation of the Frankish Empire with Umayyad Al-Andalus in the \"Marca Hispanica\".\n\nThe earliest recorded instance of the word \"paladin\" in the English language dates to 1592, in \"Delia\" (Sonnet XLVI) by Samuel Daniel. It entered English through the Middle French word \"paladin\", which itself derived from the Latin \"palatinus\". All these words for Charlemagne's Twelve Peers descend ultimately from the Latin \"palatinus,\" most likely through the Old French \"palatin\".\n\nThe Latin \"palatinus\" referred to an official of the Roman Emperor connected to the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill. Over time this word came to refer to other high-level officials in the imperial, majestic and royal courts. The word palatine, used in various European countries in the medieval and modern eras, has the same derivation.\n\nBy the 13th century words referring specifically to Charlemagne's peers began appearing in European languages; the earliest is the Italian \"paladino\". Modern French has \"paladin\", Spanish has \"paladín\" or \"paladino\" (reflecting alternate derivations from the French and Italian), while German has \"Paladin\". By extension, \"paladin\" has come to refer to any chivalrous hero such as King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table.\n\n\"Paladin\" was also used to refer to the leaders of armies supporting the Protestant Frederick V in the Thirty Years' War ending in 1648.\n\nIn their earliest appearances the paladins were not the companions of Charlemagne, but of his vassal Roland. This Roland is based on the historical figure Hruodland mentioned by Charlemagne's biographer Einhard as a Lord of the Breton March who died in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778. Nothing else is known of him. By the end of the 12th century the paladins were increasingly thought of as an association reporting to the king after the fashion of the Round Table; the earliest romance to portray them in this way is \"Fierabras\", dating to around 1170.\n\nThe names of the twelve paladins vary from romance to romance, and often more than twelve are named. The number is popular because it resembles the Twelve Apostles giving the king the position of Jesus as a reminder of his holy mission as ruler.\nAll Carolingian paladin stories feature paladins named Roland and Oliver; other recurring characters are Archbishop Turpin, Ogier the Dane, Huon of Bordeaux, Fierabras, Renaud de Montauban and Ganelon. Tales of the paladins once rivaled the stories of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table in popularity.\n\nThe paladins figure into many \"chansons de geste\" and other tales associated with Charlemagne. In the above-mentioned \"Fierabras\", they retrieve holy relics stolen from Rome by the Saracen giant Fierabras and (in some versions) convert him to Christianity and recruit him to their ranks. In \"Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne\" they accompany their king on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Constantinople in order to outdo the Byzantine Emperor Hugo.\n\nTheir greatest moments come in \"The Song of Roland\", which depicts their defense of Charlemagne's army against the Saracens of Al-Andalus, and their deaths at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass due to the treachery of Ganelon. \"The Song of Roland\" lists the twelve paladins as Roland, Charlemagne's nephew and the chief hero among the paladins; Oliver, Roland's friend and strongest ally; and Gérin, Gérier (these two are killed in the same \"laisse\" [123] by the same Saracen, Grandonie), Bérengier, Otton, Samson, Engelier, Ivon, Ivoire, Anséis, Girard (similar spellings are possible). Other characters elsewhere considered part of the twelve appear in the song, such as Archbishop Turpin and Ogier the Dane.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance authors Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto, whose works were once as widely read and respected as William Shakespeare's, contributed prominently to the literary and poetical reworking of the tales of the epic deeds of the paladins. Their works, \"Orlando Innamorato\" and \"Orlando Furioso\", send the paladins on even more fantastic adventures than their predecessors. They list the paladins quite differently, but keep the number at twelve.\n\nBoiardo and Ariosto's paladins are Orlando (Roland), Charlemagne's nephew and the chief hero among the paladins; Oliver, the rival to Roland; Ferumbras (Fierabras), the Saracen who became a Christian; Astolpho, descended from Charles Martel and cousin to Orlando; Ogier the Dane; Ganelon the betrayer, who appears in Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\"; Rinaldo (Renaud de Montauban); Malagigi (Maugris), a sorcerer; Florismart, a friend to Orlando; Guy de Bourgogne; Namo (Naimon or Namus), Duke of Bavaria, Charlemagne's trusted adviser; and Otuel, another converted Saracen.\n\nThe Italian \"Orlandos\" inspired a number of composers over the next few centuries, who created operas and other musical works on Orlando and the paladins. Afterwards the Charlemagne material went into decline. While the Arthurian legend experienced a major revival in the 19th century in the hands of the Romantic and Victorian poets, writers, and artists, ensuring that Arthur and his knights are well known into the 21st century, no such resurgence occurred for Charlemagne and his paladins. Modern adaptations and reworkings including the Carolingian paladins are few and far between, but the concept of the chivalrous \"paladin\" lives on.\n\nIn the fantasy novel \"The Castle of Iron\" by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, a man from the 20th century, Harold Shea, uses mathematics to travel to the world of Orlando Furioso.\n\nThe hero of the television program \"Have Gun – Will Travel\" takes the name Paladin and has a picture of a chess knight on his calling card.\n"}
{"id": "1009030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009030", "title": "Pathos", "text": "Pathos\n\nPathos (, ; plural: \"pathea\"; , for \"suffering\" or \"experience\"; adjectival form: \"pathetic\" from ) appeallogic to the emotions of the audience and elicits feelings that already reside in them. Pathos is a communication technique used most often in rhetoric (in which it is considered one of the three modes of persuasion, alongside ethos and logos), as well as in literature, film, and other narrative art.\n\nEmotional appeal can be accomplished in many ways, such as the following:\n\nIn \"Rhetoric\", Aristotle identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is \"awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired.\" In the first chapter, he includes the way in which \"men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects\" (Book 2.1.2–3). Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that \"to understand the emotions—that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24–1356a25). Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good ethos in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5–9).\n\nAristotle details what individual emotions are useful to a speaker (Book 2.2.27). In doing so, Aristotle focused on whom, toward whom, and why, stating that \"[i]t is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions.\" He also arranges the emotions with one another so that they may counteract one another. For example, one would pair sadness with happiness (Book 2.1.9).\n\nWith this understanding, Aristotle argues for the rhetor to understand the entire situation of goals and audiences to decide which specific emotion the speaker would exhibit or call upon in order to persuade the audience. Aristotle’s theory of pathos has three main foci: the frame of mind the audience is in, the variation of emotion between people, and the influence the rhetor has on the emotions of the audience. Aristotle classifies the third of this trio as the ultimate goal of pathos. Similarly, Aristotle outlines the individual importance of persuasive emotions, as well as the combined effectiveness of these emotions on the audience. Moreover, Aristotle pointedly discusses pleasure and pain in relation to the reactions these two emotions cause in an audience member. According to Aristotle, emotions vary from person to person. Therefore, he stresses the importance of understanding specific social situations in order to successfully utilize pathos as a mode of persuasion.\n\nAristotle identifies the introduction and the conclusion as the two most important places for an emotional appeal in any persuasive argument.\n\nPathos has its hand in politics as well, primarily in speech and how to persuade the audience. Mshvenieradze states that \"Pathos is directly linked with an audience. Audience is a collective subject of speakers on which an orator tries to impact by own argumentation.\" Similarly to how Aristotle discusses how to effectively utilize pathos in rhetoric, the way in which one appeals to the reader is similar in appealing to an audience of voters. In the case of politics and politicians, it is primarily more in argumentative writing and speaking. In Book II of Aristotle's writing's in \"Rhetoric,\" in essence knowing people's emotions helps to enable one to act with words versus writing alone, to earn another's credibility and faith.\n\nAs Aristotle's teachings expanded, many other groups of thinkers would go on to adopt different variations of political usage with the elements of pathos involved, which includes groups such as the Epicureans and Stoics.\n\nScholars have discussed the different interpretations of Aristotle’s views of rhetoric and his philosophy. Some believe that it is actually a myth, that Aristotle invented it entirely. In the second chapter of \"Rhetoric\", Aristotle's view on pathos changes from the use in discourse to the understanding of emotions and their effects. William Fortenbaugh pointed out that for the Sophist Gorgias, \"Being overcome with emotion is analogous to rape.\" Aristotle opposed this view and created a systematic approach to pathos. Fortenbaugh argues that Aristotle's systematic approach to emotional appeals \"depends upon correctly understanding the nature of individual emotions, upon knowing the conditions favorable to, the objects of, and the grounds for individual emotions\".\n\nModern philosophers were typically more skeptical of the use of emotions in communication, with political theorists such as John Locke hoping to extract emotion from reasoned communication entirely. George Campbell presents another view unlike the common systematic approach of Aristotle. Campbell explored whether appeals to emotion or passions would be \"an unfair method of persuasion,\" identifying seven circumstances to judge emotions: probability, plausibility, importance, proximity in time, connection of place, relations to the persons concerned, and interest in the consequences.\n\nThe 84 BC \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" book of an unknown author theorizes that the conclusion is the most important place in a persuasive argument to consider emotions such as mercy or hatred, depending on the nature of the persuasion. The \"appeal to pity\", as it is classified in \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\", is a means to conclude by reiterating the major premise of the work and tying while incorporating an emotional sentiment. The author suggests ways in which to appeal to the pity of the audience: \"We shall stir pity in our hearers by recalling vicissitudes of future; by comparing the prosperity we once enjoyed with our present adversity; by entreating those whose pity we seek to win, and by submitting ourselves to their mercy.\" Additionally, the text impresses the importance of invoking kindness, humanity and sympathy upon the hearer. Finally, the author suggests that the appeal to pity be brief for \"nothing dries more quickly than a tear.\"\n\nAristotle's teachings would go on to influence many influential groups of thinkers. One such group of thinkers, the Epicureans who practiced Epicureanism, interpreted and placed pathos in much more colloquial means and situations. The group would place pathos in pleasure, and study it in almost every facet in regards to pleasure, analyzing emotional specificity that an individual may feel or may need to undergo to appreciate said pathos.\n\nThe concept of emotional appeal existed in rhetoric long before Aristotle’s \"Rhetoric\". George A. Kennedy, a well-respected, modern-day scholar, identifies the appeal to emotions in the newly formed democratic court system before 400 BC in his book, \"The Art of Persuasion in Greece\". Gorgias, a Sophist who preceded Aristotle, was interested in the orator’s emotional appeal as well. Gorgias believed the orator was able to capture and lead the audience in any direction they pleased through the use of emotional appeal. In the \"Encomium of Helen\", Gorgias states that a soul can feel a particular sentiment on account of words such as sorrow and pity. Certain words act as \"bringers-on of pleasure and takers-off of pain. Furthermore, Gorgias equates emotional persuasion to the sensation of being overtaken by a drug: \"[f]or just as different drug draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to disease and other to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick to soul.\"\n\nPlato also discussed emotional appeal in rhetoric. Plato preceded Aristotle and therefore laid the groundwork, as did other Sophists, for Aristotle to theorize the concept of pathos. In his dialogue \"Gorgias\", Plato discusses pleasure versus pain in the realm of pathos though in a fictional conversation between Gorgias and Socrates. The dialogue between several ancient rhetors that Plato created centers around the value of rhetoric, and the men incorporate aspects of pathos in their responses. Gorgias discredits pathos and instead promotes the use of ethos in persuasion. In another of Plato’s texts, \"Phaedrus\", his discussion of emotions is more pointed; however, he still does not outline exactly how emotions manipulate an audience.<ref name=\"Bedford/ St. Martin's\"></ref> Plato discusses the danger of emotions in oratory. He argues that emotional appeal in rhetoric should be used as the means to an end and not the point of the discussion.\n\nGeorge Campbell, a contributor to the Scottish Enlightenment, was one of the first rhetoricians to incorporate scientific evidence into his theory of emotional appeal. Campbell relied heavily on a book written by physician David Hartley, entitled \"Observations on Man\". The book synthesized emotions and neurology and introduced the concept that action is a result of impression. Hartley determined that emotions drive people to react to appeals based on circumstance but also passions made up of cognitive impulses. Campbell argues that belief and persuasion depend heavily on the force of an emotional appeal. Furthermore, Campbell introduced the importance of the audience’s imagination and will on emotional persuasion that is equally as important as basic understanding of an argument. Campbell, by drawing on the theories of rhetoricians before him, drew up a contemporary view of pathos that incorporates the psychological aspect of emotional appeal.\n\nAn orator’s reliance on emotional appeal is evident in modern-day speechmaking, but in some schools of thought this is seen primarily as psychological versus emotional appeal.\n\nSpeech is one of the primary places where one sees the application of pathos. Pathos is in essence the driving force behind an argument, to hit the emotional pangs that allow the audience to relate to the speaker.\n\nAny emotional response from the audience correlates to pathos used by the director. Pathos can also be utilized for manipulation and propaganda purposes and is very prevalent within the film industry.\n\n"}

Each sculpture is an 8-metre tall statue of bronze, copper or concrete. The sculpture was inaugurated at the NGO Forum of the FAO summit in Rome in 1996. Since then three other pillars have been erected, in Hong Kong, Mexico, and Brazil. A fourth one in Berlin was planned for completion in 2002, but the plan has not come to fruition due to various issues.\n\nAccording to Galschiot, the sculptures remind people of a shameful event which must never recur. The torn and twisted bodies of the sculpture symbolize the degradation, devaluation and lack of respect for the individual. The black colour symbolizes grief and loss and the sculpture, which represents the victims, expresses the pain and the despair of the event. It can be used by both sides in complicated conflict situations, where it can be difficult to point out the guilty party.\n\nThe \"Pillar of Shame\" (Chinese: ) in Hong Kong is a concrete sculpture, first erected in Victoria Park in 1997 to mark the eighth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The statue depicts 50 torn and twisted bodies to symbolize those who died in the government crackdown. On the base of the statue, the history and pictures of the massacre are carved in and engraved into the base, in both English and Chinese, are the words \"The Tiananmen Massacre\", \"June 4th 1989\" and \"The old cannot kill the young forever.\"\n\nThe \"Pillar\" was first exhibited at the Candlelight Vigil in commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests on 3 June 1997. Following the vigil on the night of 4 June 1997, local university students fought for a place to permanently home the statue. After scuffles with the police and controversy with the university leadership, at 3 a.m. students succeeded in moving the 2-tonne statue onto the podium of the Haking Wong Building at the University of Hong Kong, however the pieces were not assembled due to concerns that the floor was not strong enough. The \"Pillar\" was re-erected at the same place on 16 June 1997.\n\nDuring the following months, the \"Pillar\" was exhibited at the following universities:\n\nOn 31 May 1998, the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, the sculpture was returned to Victoria Park where a candlelit vigil was held. On the morning before the vigil, a self-professed artist splashed two buckets of red paint onto the \"Pillar\", claiming that \"the blood of people is also my blood.\"\n\nOn 24 and 25 September 1998, The Hong Kong University Students' Union (HKUSU) held a general polling on a motion to home the \"Pillar of Shame\" at the University of Hong Kong on a long-term basis. The students' motion was carried, when 1,629 out of 2,190 voted to support, and the \"Pillar\" was moved onto the Haking Wong Podium again on 3 December 1998. It was again exhibited at the 10th anniversary candlelit vigil of the Massacre in 1999 at Victoria Park. Without the University authorities' endorsement, the \"Pillar\" was moved back to the Haking Wong podium after the anniversary, where has remained on display at; a silent tribute is held by HKUSU and The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China in May every year.\n\nOn 30 April 2008, the \"Pillar of Shame\" was painted orange as part of the project The Color Orange, to raise awareness about human rights in China. As the sculptor Galschiot was denied access to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China painted the \"Pillar\" without his participation.\n\nOther \"Pillars\" have been erected in the following locations:\n\nA fourth \"Pillar of Shame\" was planned in Berlin, Germany, in homage to the victims of the Nazi regime. Due to various problems, the artist had to cancel the project.\n\nA pile of over 16,000 shoes, each pair representing a victim of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre is placed in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Sunday July 11, 2010. The shoes were collected to make \"The Pillar of Shame\" by German activist Phillip Ruch's monument to Srebrenica.\n\n\n"}

Given the broad nature of public affairs, what exactly the industry encapsulates remains a point of discussion. While often equated with lobbying, this is usually only a small part of what a public affairs practitioner might do. Other typical functions include research, strategy planning and providing advice. \n\nIt is difficult to determine the size of the public affairs industry in the United Kingdom. Studies suggest the industry is becoming more professionalized, and that it is more widespread than often assumed. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), which is the UK's professional body for public relations including public affairs, estimates there are around 48,000 people involved in PR, of which 30% are involved in public affairs. This research is limited as it only measures specific job titles and those who declare themselves to be working in PR. There are large numbers of professionals providing public affairs services while working under different job titles across a wide variety of sectors. The job titles of public affairs practitioners may vary, depending on the focus of their role, but may include, \"public affairs\", \"external affairs/relations\", \"corporate communications\", \"government/parliamentary affairs\" and \"policy\". \n\nOrganizations who make use of public affairs are typically large companies, charities, trade unions, membership organizations and interest groups. They will either have staff working directly for them or employ a firm of public affairs consultants. Very often public affairs staff will work with their non-PR colleagues who are experts in a given field. \n\nIt has been argued that professional lobbying goes against democracy as it allows big business to buy power and influence with well funded campaigns giving them an unfair advantage. Steps are being taken in several countries to attempt to increase levels of regulation and transparency in the public affairs industry. Several countries have introduced a mandatory register for lobbyists. The European Union has been working with a voluntary register since July 2008. Many other governments including the United Kingdom are debating a register of some kind.\n\nIn the United States, President Barack Obama has introduced several measures intended to increase transparency in public affairs. In an attempt to close the \"revolving door\" of executive-branch officials becoming lobbyists immediately following the expiration of their federal appointments, he issued Executive Order 13490 on January 21, 2009, dictating, among other things, a two-year ban on lobbying for former top executive branch officials related to any issue that they worked on during their final year in government employment. He also introduced a ban on verbal communication between lobbyists and the federal agencies tasked with awarding economic recovery funds. These measures have proved controversial and while some argue they are a positive and necessary step, others have deemed the policies as failures due to various loopholes.\n\nPublic affairs practitioners are engaged in a variety of roles. These can include lobbying, monitoring and predicting political, legal, economic and social developments, and providing political intelligence and strategic advice. In addition, public affairs practitioners may undertake media relations work, understanding and relating with the many streams of business, trade and electronic media in seeking publicity for an organization or in responding to media inquiries and issues. \n\nCentral to all of these areas is the concept of stakeholder relations. Building relationships and partnerships are key when engaging with policymakers.\nConsideration should be given to potential partnership with a variety of groups and individuals, usually encompassed in the ubiquitous public affairs term \"key stakeholders\" which includes community groups, pressure groups, nongovernmental organizations, technical experts and policy and influences from think tanks and academics.\n\n"}
{"id": "20931707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20931707", "title": "Ripieno concerto", "text": "Ripieno concerto\n\nThe ripieno concerto is a somewhat later type of Baroque music, the term concerto here reverting to its earlier meaning of work for an ensemble. The word \"\" is from the Italian for \"padding\". The \" was sometimes referred to as a \" (or \" if the orchestra included two viola parts, a standard scoring in the 17th century). These were merely compositions for the ripieno alone (i.e. for string orchestra and continuo), with either no solo parts or clearly subsidiary ones. Beginning with the six ripieno concertos, Op. 5 (1692), of Giuseppe Torelli, this genre enjoyed an efflorescence that extended until about 1740.\n\nMost ripieno concertos fall into one of two distinct classes: a sonata type and a sinfonia type. The sonata type generally mirrors the form and style of the \" in its use of four-movement slow–fast–slow–fast cycles and predominantly fugal texture.\n\nThe more modern sinfonia type was firmly established in Torelli's second publication to include concertos, Op. 6 (1698), and in Giulio Taglietti's , Op. 4 (1699), which turn to the three-movement (fast-slow-fast) pattern and more homophonic texture familiar to us from the solo concerto and opera sinfonia. The opening movements also parallel the solo concerto in utilizing ritornello form (without solo sections), in which the opening material recurs from one to several times in various keys, the last statement normally in the tonic. Finales are most often binary in form and dancelike in style. The sinfonia type gradually merged with the early concert symphony beginning in the 1720s, doubtless in part because the term concerto was by that time acquiring an indelible association with the notion of tutti-solo contrast.\n\nA special class of 20th-century concertos is the Concerto for Orchestra. These works are not for the most part ripieno concertos in the Baroque sense but rather display pieces in which the orchestra itself is the virtuoso, from soloists to sections of the orchestra, choirs or tutti. Examples of this genre, best known through Bartók's popular work of 1943, include compositions by Hindemith (1925), Walter Piston (1933), Zoltán Kodály (1939–40), Michael Tippett (1962–63), and Elliott Carter (1969). In the latter piece, Carter dramatically personifies or characterizes the various concertino groupings, a technique he had previously explored in his Double Concerto for harpsichord and piano (1961) and his Piano Concerto (1964–65).\n\n"}

It is usually associated when governments, or security apparatuses within a government, allow or even encourage extremist groups to perform attacks, bombings, murders, and the like. In extreme circumstances, it can even involve agent provocateurs and false flag operations where a terrorist threat is outright invented or created. The goal in such strategies is that such a struggle will rally support behind the military or police forces opposing the radicals, to radicalize opposing movements so that they can be better marginalized, or to permit loosely allied extremist groups to attack enemies of the government. As few organizations would openly say that they are pursuing a strategy of tension, accusations generally come from opponents that such a strategy is being pursued.\n\nThe strategy of tension is most closely identified with the Years of Lead in Italy from 1968–1982, wherein both far-left Marxist extremists and far-right neo-fascist groups performed bombings, kidnappings, arsons, and murders. Activists have accused NATO of allowing and sanctioning such terrorism, although this conclusion is hotly disputed. Other cases where writers have alleged a strategy of tension include the Turkish military against Islamists from the 1970s–1990s (\"Ergenekon\"), the war veterans and ZANU–PF in Zimbabwe which coordinated the farm invasions of 2000, the DRS security agency in Algeria from 1991-1999, and Belgium's state security service from 1982–1986.\n\nFrom 1968–1982, Italy suffered numerous terrorist attacks by both the left and the right, which were often followed by government round-ups and mass arrests. An allegation, especially made by adherents of the Italian Communist Party, was that the government trumped up and intentionally allowed the attacks of communist radicals as an excuse to arrest other communists, and allowed the attacks of far-right paramilitary organizations as an extrajudicial way to silence enemies. The veracity of parts of these allegations has been disputed; while most sources agree that elements within the Italian government were eager to use the terrorist strikes as a reason to round-up communists, the idea that the government directly worked with said communist groups is more far-fetched. In the same way, some contacts between the government and far-right organizations existed, but allegations of an explicit \"green light\" to perform raids and the like are considered less reliable.\n\nVarious parliamentary committees were held to investigate these crimes as well as prosecute them in the 1990s. A 1995 report from the Left Democrats (the rebranded Communist Party of Italy, PCI) to a subcommittee of the Italian Parliament stated that a \"strategy of tension\" had been supported by the United States to \"stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the PSI, from reaching executive power in the country\". Aldo Giannuli, a historian who worked as a consultant to the parliamentary terrorism commission, wrote that he considered the Left Democrats' report as dictated primarily by domestic political considerations rather than historical ones: \"Since they have been in power the Left Democrats have given us very little help in gaining access to security service archives,\" he said. \"This is a falsely courageous report.\" Giannuli did decry the fact that many more leftist terrorists were prosecuted and convicted than rightist terrorists, though.\n\nSwiss academic Daniele Ganser wrote \"NATO's Secret Armies\", a 2004 book that alleged direct NATO support for far-right terrorists in Italy as part of its \"strategy of tension\". Ganser also alleges that Operation Gladio, an effort to organize stay-behind guerillas and resistance in the event of a communist takeover by the Eastern bloc of Italy, continued into the 1970s and supplied the far-right neofascist movements with weapons. Ganser's conclusions have been disputed; most notably, Ganser heavily cites the document \"US Army Field Manual 30-31B\", a 1976 Soviet hoax meant to discredit the US.\n\n"}

The Strawberry Generation, like the Post-80s of China, could be the Asian counterpart of the Millennials in the Western world.\n\nIn an ironic reference to the term, a 2008 student-led political movement in Taiwan started the Wild Strawberries Movement. This movement was in response to the visit of China's ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin to the island. Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of Taiwan's national flag and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in Taipei, Taiwan, to begin a sit-in in front of the Executive Yuan in protest of Taiwan's Parade and Assembly Law ().\n\n\n"}

The first event took place on June 3, 2017 and have taken place throughout California, in Mexico and Milwaukee.\n\nWhile Latinos currently make up around a third of Orange County's residents and there are 120,000 Muslims, both minority groups do not have much political power. In 2016, both groups of people saw an increase in documented hate crimes against their communities. Also in 2016, Marco Gutierrez of the \"Latinos for Trump\" group, said, \"You're going to have taco trucks on every corner.\" When Donald Trump won the presidency, there was an increase in the amount of both anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim feelings in American culture. After Trump won, Rida Hamida, a Muslim from Anaheim, and Benjamin Vazquez, who is a Latino from Santa Ana, met and began a discussion about what Muslims and Latinos could learn from one another. Hamida and Vasquez thought about the taco truck idea and about bringing Muslims to Mexican restaurants. In the end, they decided to bring taco trucks to mosques. Using the taco trucks (or \"loncheras\") was also a way to empower Latinos. Taco Trucks At Every Mosque is also a way for the two minority communities to get to know one another and combat the fear of immigrant communities. \n\nThe first event, an iftar, took place on June 3, 2017 at the Islamic Center of Santa Ana and was attended by 600 people. The halal tacos were given free to people attending the iftar. The second event, a few weeks later at the Islamic Society of Orange County, was attended by 1,400 people. The groups raise money to pay for the tacos and in 2017, visited every mosque in Orange County during Ramadan. Because Ramadan is also a time of charity, the taco truck plan was a good fit. Even though the events focus on the Latino and Muslim communities, everyone is welcome. One person attending the second event hoped that Taco Trucks At Every Mosque would inspire more Muslims to come to Latino events. Hamida and Vazquez promoted the events on Twitter with the hashtag, #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque.\n\nThe Taco Trucks At Every Mosque events have taken place in communities from Baja California in Mexico to Sacramento. They have also taken place during Eid al-Adha. The events have inspired a mosque in Milwaukee, the Islamic Society of Milwaukee, to copy the idea. Marco Gutierrez even posted a video on his Instagram, saying \"I tried to warn you people. #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorning has mutated into #TacoTrucksatEveryMosque!\"\n\n\n"}

McKiernan's Mithgar novel \"The Iron Tower\". \n\nTuckerby Underbank was born to an ordinary Warrow family in the Boskydells, and apparently had the same carefree upbringing as any other Warrow child. He became fast friends with several other young Warrows, including Danner Bramblethorn and his dammia Merrilee. \n\nHowever, when an unnaturally bitter winter falls over all of Mithgar, Tuck began training as a Thornwalker and soon became one of the best archers. After being assigned to the Spindlethorn, Tuck had two narrow escapes with Vulgs, each time losing a close friend, and one time nearly losing his life when he fell into a river and was carried under by the current.\n\nWhen the call came out for Warrows to fight at Challerain Keep, Tuck volunteered along with Danner and Patrel Rushlock. Upon arriving, they become acquainted with High King Aurion Redeye, his son Prince Igon, his future daughter-in-law Princess Laurelin, as well as the elf lord Gildor Goldbranch and Hrosmarshal Vidron, all of whom become friends with the Warrows. They also are invited to Laurelin's nineteenth birthday party, but during the party a messenger arrives, saying that the fortress is about to be attacked.\n\nTuck and the Warrows take part in the battle against Modru's Horde, but he becomes lost and ends up inside a crypt with the crown prince, King Galen, where Tuck retrieves a small red arrow. He and Galen manage to escape the slaughter as Challerain Keep is destroyed, and end up in an elven village where they are cared for and fed. Tuck is satisfied to stay there, until he is informed that Laurelin has been captured by Modru and Aurion has been killed. He agrees to follow Galen, since only Warrow eyes can see in the dark.\n\nTuck follows Gildor and Galen along the road to rally their allies, and come across a dwarf named Brega, who leads them to the ancient dwarf mine of Kraggen-Cor, where they are almost killed by a monstrous tentacled creature. When they encounter the monstrous Gargon on the other side, Tuck distracts it by stabbing it in the leg, allowing the others to finish it off.\n\nHe is reunited with Merrilee as the armies march to Gron, and he manages to infiltrate the Iron Tower before being captured. He learns that Modru is planning to sacrifice Laurelin, and release his master Gyphon from exile. However, Tuck uses the red arrow to pierce the darkness-creating Myrkenstone, which destroys his vision, but also keeps Gyphon in exile, and kills Modru and his Horde.\n\nUpon his return to the Boskydells, Tuck marries Merrilee. They have one child, Raven, and his journals become a famed historical epic. He dies at a ripe old age.\n\nLike other Warrows, Tuck is very short, at exactly three and a half feet.

{"id": "1465002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1465002", "title": "Usog", "text": "Usog\n\nUsog or balis is a topic in psycho-medicine in Filipino Psychology (but considered just as a Filipino superstition in Western Psychology) where an affliction or psychological disorder is attributed to a greeting by a stranger, or an evil eye hex. It usually affects an unsuspecting child, usually an infant or toddler, who has been greeted by a visitor or a stranger.\n\nIn some limited areas, it is said that the condition is also caused by the stranger having an evil eye or \"masamang mata\" in Tagalog, lurking around. This may have been influenced by the advent of the Spaniards who long believed in the \"mal de ojo\" superstition.\n\nOnce affected, the child begins to develop fever, and sometimes convulsions. Supposedly, the child can be cured by placing its clothing in hot water and boiling it. In most other places, to counter the effects of the \"usog\" the stranger or newcomer is asked to put some of his or her saliva on the baby's abdomen, shoulder or forehead before leaving the house. The newcomer then leaves while saying: \"Pwera usog... pwera usog...\" The saliva is placed on the finger first, before the finger is rubbed on the baby's abdomen or forehead. The stranger is never to lick the child. The practice is that the stranger or visitor is asked to touch his or her finger with saliva to the child's body, arm or foot (\"lawayan\") to prevent the child from getting overpowered (\"upang hindi mausog\").\n\nOne theory (Kristina Palacio) explains \"usog\" in terms of child distress that leads to greater susceptibility to illness and diseases. There are observations that a stranger (or a newcomer or even a visiting relative) especially someone with a strong personality (physically big, boisterous, has strong smell, domineering, etc.) may easily distress a child. Thus, the child is said to be \"overpowered\" or \"nauusog\" and thus may feel afraid, develop fever, get sick, etc.\nIn \"usog\", the child's distress is the consequence of the child's failure to adapt to change. It is, in medical terms, the consequence of the disruption of homeostasis through physical or psychological stimuli brought about by the stranger. Technically, the condition results from the child-environment interaction that leads the child to perceive a painful discrepancy, real or imagined, between the demands of a situation on the one hand and their social, biological, or psychological resources on the other. The stressful stimuli to the child may be mental (stranger is perceived as a threat, malevolent or demanding), physiological (loud and/or high-pitched voice of the stranger that is hurting to the child's eardrum; strong smell of the stranger that irritates the child's nasal nerves), or physical (stranger has heavy hands or is taking up too much space).\n\nThe stranger's act of gently placing his finger with his saliva to the child's arm, foot, or any particular part of the child's body, could make him more familiar to the child, and thus, reduce if not remove the stress. As the stranger keeps gently saying, \"Pwera usog... pwera usog...,\" the child is made to feel and assured that he means no harm. The \"usog\" is said to be counteracted because the child is prevented from succumbing to an illness since the child is no longer in distress. Children or even adults who are shy or have weak personalities are more susceptible to \"usog\" in accordance with observations and theory. Some have observed that at times even praising a shy child by a visiting relative caused an \"usog\".\n\nThe saliva from the stranger, granted that he or she is healthy and consistent with his or her oral hygiene, is relatively clean and contains enough antimicrobial compounds such as lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, and secretory immunoglobulin A which can help clear pathogens from the child and benefit the child against infection. Furthermore, human saliva has opiorphin, a newly researched pain-killing substance. Initial research with mice shows the compound has a painkilling effect of up to six times that of morphine. It works by stopping the normal breakdown of natural pain-killing opioids in the spine, called enkephalins. Opiorphin in human saliva is a relatively simple molecule, and the child's immune system may trigger a biochemical cascade (complement system) to produce other stress-reducing compounds.\n\nUsog can also, though less commonly, affect adults, and it may induce vomiting and stomach ache rather than fever. Supposedly, it can be prevented by stopping a stranger or visitor from greeting the person.\n\nUnlike \"lihi\", however, usog is not yet medically accepted. More than the superstitious folks, researchers dealing with Filipino Psychology say they have observed this phenomenon with regularity and suggest that this be added to the Psychiatric Disorders Handbook DSM-V.\n\n"}

From Antiquity, European slaves were common during the reign of Ancient Rome and were prominent during the Ottoman Empire into the early modern period. In Feudalism, there were various forms of status below the Freeman that is known as Serfdom (such as the bordar, villein, vagabond and slave) which could be bought and sold as property and were subject to labor and branding by their owners or demense. Under Muslim rule, the Arab slave trades that included Caucasian captives were often fueled by raids into European territories or were taken as children in the form of a blood tax by the families of citizens of conquered territories to serve the empire for a variety of functions. In the mid 1800s, the term 'white slavery' was used to describe the Christian slaves that were sold into the Barbary slave trade.\n\nModern use of the term can also include sexual slavery, forced prostitution and human trafficking.\n\nThe phrase \"white slavery\" was used by Charles Sumner in 1847 to describe the chattel slavery of Christians throughout the Barbary States and primarily in the Algiers, the capitol of Ottoman Algeria. It also encompassed many forms of slavery, including the European concubines often found in Turkish harems.\n\nThe term was also used from the beginning of the twentieth century when most of the countries of Europe signed in Paris in 1904 an International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic aimed at combating the sale of women who were forced into prostitution in the countries of continental Europe. In the early twentieth century, the term was used against the forced prostitution and sexual slavery of girls who worked in Chicago brothels.\n\nThe Volga trade route was established by the Varangians (Vikings) who settled in Northwestern Russia in the early 9th century. About south of the Volkhov River entry into Lake Ladoga, they established a settlement called Ladoga (Old Norse: \"Aldeigjuborg\"). It connected Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia with the Caspian Sea, via the Volga River. The Rus used this route to trade with Muslim countries on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as Baghdad. The route functioned concurrently with the Dnieper trade route, better known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, and lost its importance in the 11th century.\n\nSaqaliba refers to Slavic slaves, kidnapped from the coasts of Europe or in wars, as well as white mercenaries in the medieval Muslim world, in the Middle East, North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus. Saqaliba served, or were forced to serve, in a multitude of ways: servants, harem concubines, eunuchs, craftsmen, soldiers, and as Caliph's guards. In Iberia, Morocco, Damascus and Sicily, their military role may be compared with that of mamluks in the Ottoman Empire. In Spain, Slavic eunuchs were so popular and widely distributed that they became synonymous with Saqāliba.\n\nIn the time of the Crimean Khanate, Crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland-Lithuania, and Muscovy. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savğa) of 10 percent or 20 percent. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into \"sefers\", declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and \"çapuls\", raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. Caffa was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets. Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved between 1 and 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500–1700. Caffa (city on Crimean peninsula) was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets. In 1769, a last major Tatar raid resulted in the capture of 20,000 Russian and Ruthenian slaves.\n\nSlave markets flourished on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, in what is modern-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and western Libya, between the 15th and middle of the 18th century.\n\nThese markets prospered while the states were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, though, in reality, they were mostly autonomous. The North African slave markets traded in European slaves which were acquired by Barbary pirates in slave raids on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to Spain, Portugal, France, England, the Netherlands, and as far afield as the Turkish Abductions in Iceland. Men, women, and children were captured to such a devastating extent that vast numbers of sea coast towns were abandoned.\n\nAccording to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 15th and 19th centuries. However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates were constant for a 250-year period, stating:\n\nDavis' numbers have been challenged by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa.\n\nIn addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia. Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records. Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation.\n\nSuch observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy.\n\nFrom bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore, Ireland were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.\n\nWhile Barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured, their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom. Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive, but not obliged to work; the most famous of these was the author Miguel de Cervantes, who was held for almost five years. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Attractive women or boys could be used as sex slaves. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.\n\n16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700. The markets declined after the loss of the Barbary Wars and ended in the 1830s, when the region was conquered by France.\n\nDuring the Al-Andalus (also known as Muslim Spain or Islamic Iberia), the Moors controlled much of the peninsula. They imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the Reconquista in the late 15th century. The slaves were exported from the Christian section of Spain, as well as Eastern Europe, sparking significant reaction from many in Christian Spain and many Christians still living in Muslim Spain. Soon after, Muslims were successful, taking 30,000 Christian captives from Spain. In the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to \"frequent cross-border skirmishes, interspersed between periods of major campaigns\". By the tenth century, in the eastern Mediterranean Byzantine, Christians were captured by Muslims. Many of the raids designed by Muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners. Therefore, Muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing. The Iberian peninsula served as a base for further exports of slaves into other Muslim regions in Northern Africa.\n\nSlavery was a legal and a significant part of the Ottoman Empire's economy and society. The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa, Eastern Europe and Circassia in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations. Enslavement of Europeans was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed.\n\nEven after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unabated into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire. Sexual slavery was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.\n\nIn the Roman Republic and later Roman Empire, slaves accounted for most of the means of industrial output in Roman commerce. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, including Gaul, Hispania, North Africa, Syria, Germania, Britannia, the Balkans, and Greece. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital, where their number was largest, at its peak.\n\nSlaves numbering in the tens of thousands were condemned to work in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. \"Damnati in metallum\" (\"those condemned to the mine\") were convicts who lost their freedom as citizens (\"libertas\"), forfeited their property (\"bona\") to the state, and became \"servi poenae\", slaves as a legal penalty. Their status under the law was different from that of other slaves; they could not buy their freedom, be sold, or be set free. They were expected to live and die in the mines. Imperial slaves and freedmen (the \"familia Caesaris)\" worked in mine administration and management.\n\nIn the Late Republic, about half the gladiators who fought in Roman arenas were slaves, though the most skilled were often free volunteers. Successful gladiators were occasionally rewarded with freedom. However, gladiators being trained warriors and having access to weapons, were potentially the most dangerous slaves. At an earlier time, many gladiators had been soldiers taken captive in war. Spartacus, who led the great slave rebellion of 73-71 BCE, was a rebel gladiator.\n\nThe slaves imported in Italy were native Europeans, and very few of them were from outside Europe. This has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three imperial-era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only one individual came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another two possibly did, but results are inconclusive. In the rest of the Italian peninsula, the fraction of non European slaves was much lower than that.\n\nThe \"pençik\" or \"penç-yek\" tax, meaning \"one fifth\", was a taxation based on a verse of the Quran; whereby one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to God, to Muhammad and his family, to orphans, to those in need and to travelers. This eventually included slaves and war captives were given to soldiers and officers to help motivate their participation in wars. \nChristians and Jews, known as People of the Book in Islam, were considered dhimmis in territories under Muslim rule, a status of second-class citizens that were afforded limited freedoms, legal protections, personal safety, and were allowed to \"practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy\". In order to keep these protections and rights, dhimmis were required to pay the Jizya and Kharaj taxes as an acknowledgement of Muslim rule. According to Abu Yusuf, Failure to pay this tax should render the dhemmi's life and property void and subject the dhemmi to forced conversion, enslavement, imprisonment or death. If anyone had agreed to pay the jizya, leaving Muslim territory for enemy land was punishable by enslavement if captured. \n\nFailure to pay the jizya was commonly punished by house arrest and some legal authorities allowed enslavement of dhimmis for non-payment of taxes. In South Asia, for example, seizure of dhimmi families upon their failure to pay annual jizya was one of the two significant sources of slaves sold in the slave markets of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era.\nThe Devshirme was a blood tax largely imposed in the Balkans and Anatolia in which the Ottoman Empire sent military to collect Christian boys between the ages of 8 to 18 that were taken from their families and raised to serve the empire. The tax was imposed by Murad I in the mid 1300s and lasted until the reign of Ahmet III in the early 1700s. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the devşirme–janissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males. These boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and forced conversion to Islam. Basilike Papoulia wrote that \"...the devsirme was the 'forcible removal', in the form of a tribute, of children of the Christian subjects from their ethnic, religious and cultural environment and their transportation into the Turkish-Islamic environment with the aim of employing them in the service of the Palace, the army, and the state, whereby they were on the one hand to serve the Sultan as slaves and freedmen and on the other to form the ruling class of the State.\"\n\nIn the modern era, many whites in England, Ireland and British North America were indentured servants, a form of slavery now banned by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nBetween 50 and 67 percent of white immigrants to the American colonies, from the 1630s and American Revolution, had traveled under indenture.\n\nThe International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic is a series of anti–human trafficking treaties, the first of which was first negotiated in Paris in 1904. It was one of the first multilateral treaties to address issues of slavery and human trafficking. The Slavery, Servitude, Forced Labour and Similar Institutions and Practices Convention of 1926 and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age of 1933 are similar documents.\n\nTo battle sex trafficking in the United States, in 1910 the US Congress passed the White Slave Traffic Act (better known as the Mann Act), which made it a felony to transport women across state borders for the purpose of \"prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\" As more women were being trafficked from foreign countries, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country such as the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924. Following the banning of immigrants during the 1920s, human trafficking was not considered a major issue until the 1990s.\n\nAn attempt was made to introduce a similar law into the UK between 1910 and 1913 as the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912. Arthur Lee would state in the House of Commons:\n\"the United Kingdom, and particularly England, is increasingly becoming a clearing-house and depot and dispatch centre of the white slave traffic, and the headquarters of the foreign agents engaged in the most expensive and lucrative phase of the business.\" South America was stated as the main destination for the trafficked girls.\n\"The Spectator\" commented that \"the Bill has been blocked by a member [alluding to Frederick Booth ] or members who, for various reasons consider that it is not a measure which ought to be placed upon the statute book\" as it would affect the liberty of the individual.\n\n"}
