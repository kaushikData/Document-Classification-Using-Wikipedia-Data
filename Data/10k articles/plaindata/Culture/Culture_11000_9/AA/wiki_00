The original score and songs were composed and conducted by James Horner.\n\nThe album garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Music critics felt that the musical score fit the film well, but believed it to be similar to several of Horner's previous films.\n\nComposer James Horner was a frequent collaborator with Ron Howard, the director of \"A Beautiful Mind\". Horner desired to feature vocals reminiscent of being midway between a girl and woman, and wrote the score specifically for 15-year-old Welsh singer Charlotte Church. In an interview, she stated that it was \"one of the most haunting and beautiful [things] I have ever performed.\" To convey \"the beauty of mathematics,\" Horner decided to use the idea of a kaleidoscope, as its \"patterns are always changing, and things move very quickly, but in moving so quickly, they create other patterns that move very slowly underneath.\" He added that these changing patterns were conveyed with the piano and Church's voice.\n\nWriting for \"Empire\" magazine, Danny Graydon gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. He thought the score contained elements of Horner's previous films \"Sneakers\" (1992) and \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999), but said \"if you can forgive that, this is a clever, masterful and romantic score that captures a brilliant mind in conflict.\" In the tracks \"Creating Government Dynamics\" and \"Cracking The Russian Codes\", Graydon opined that Church's \"poignant vocals mix well with the frenetic piano and strings to represent Nash’s brilliance,\" and wished that her voice had been used more in the film.\n\nDan Goldwasser of Soundtrack.net also found similarities to the score in \"Bicentennial Man\", but thought Horner's work fit the film regardless, explaining \"it effectively underscores the drama and romance, and even provides a few bits of tension for the action scene.\" Goldwasser concluded that \"while it all works well in the film, there is enough about this score that just seemed to 'familiar' to make it stand out. Contributing to National Public Radio, Andy Trudeau believed Church's particular voice adds a \"human element. It's the sound that, I think, gives a sense of--the center of this character, if you will. I think it's the soul. And it's trying to be normal in a way, and underneath it it's trying to be crazy.\"\n\nHorner's score garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score. It lost the Golden Globe to the film \"Moulin Rouge!\" and the Oscar to \"\".\n\nAdapted from:\n"}

The terms \"serious\" or \"cultivated\" are frequently used in relation to music in order to present a contrast with ordinary, everyday music (i.e. popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). At the beginning of the 20th century art music was divided into \"serious music\" and \"light music\".\n\n\"Art music\" is mostly used to refer to music descending from the tradition of Western classical music. Authors associated with the critical musicology movement and popular music studies, such as Philip Tagg, tend to reject the elitism associated with art music; he refers to it as one of an \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. According to Bruno Nettl, \"Western classical music\" may also be synonymous with \"art music\", \"canonic music, \"cultivated music\". \"serious music\", as well as the more flippantly used \"real music\" and \"normal music\". Musician Catherine Schmidt-Jones defines art music as \"a music which requires significantly more work by the listener to fully appreciate than is typical of popular music\". In her view, \"[t]his can include the more challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical\".\n\nThe term may also refer to:\n\nThe term \"art music\" refers primarily to classical traditions (including contemporary as well as historical classical music forms) that focus on formal styles, invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In strict western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation, as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings (like popular and traditional music).\n\nThere have been continual attempts throughout the history of popular music to make a claim for itself as art rather than as popular culture, and a number of music styles that were previously understood as \"popular music\" have since been categorized in the art or classical category. According to the academic Tim Wall, the most significant example of the struggle between Tin Pan Alley, African-American, vernacular, and art discourses was in jazz. As early as the 1930s, artists attempted to cultivate ideas of \"symphonic jazz\", taking it away from its perceived vernacular and black American roots. Following these developments, histories of popular music tend to marginalize jazz, partly because the reformulation of jazz in the art discourse has been so successful that many (as of 2013) would not consider it a form of popular music.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a large-scale trend in American culture toward blurring the boundaries between art and pop music. Beginning in 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands who fused elements of composed music with the oral musical traditions of rock. During the late 1960s and 1970s, progressive-rock bands represented a form of crossover music that combined rock with high art musical forms either through quotation, allusion, or imitation. Progressive music may be equated with explicit references to aspects of art music, sometimes resulting in the reification of rock as art music.\n\nWhile progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, as author Kevin Holm-Hudson explains: \"sometimes progressive rock fails to integrate classical sources ... [it] moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from European art music, but other cultural domains (such as East Indian, Celtic, folk, and African) and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between formalism and eclecticism\".\n\n"}
{"id": "33413026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33413026", "title": "Artificial muscle", "text": "Artificial muscle\n\nArtificial muscle is a generic term used for actuators, materials or devices that mimic natural muscle and can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component due to an external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature). The three basic actuation responses – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions (e.g. bending, by contracting one side of the material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and pneumatic linear or rotary actuators do not qualify as artificial muscles, because there is more than one component involved in the actuation.\n\nDue to their high flexibility, versatility and power-to-weight ratio compared with traditional rigid actuators, artificial muscles have the potential to be a highly disruptive emerging technology. Though currently in limited use, the technology may have wide future applications in industry, medicine, robotics and many other fields.\n\nWhile there is no general theory that allows for actuators to be compared, there are \"power criteria\" for artificial muscle technologies that allow for specification of new actuator technologies in comparison with natural muscular properties. In summary, the criteria include stress, strain, strain rate, cycle life, and elastic modulus. Some authors have considered other criteria (Huber et al., 1997), such as actuator density and strain resolution. As of 2014, the most powerful artificial muscle fibers in existence can offer a hundredfold increase in power over equivalent lengths of natural muscle fibers.\n\nResearchers measure the speed, energy density, power, and efficiency of artificial muscles; no one type of artificial muscle is the best in all areas.\n\nArtificial muscles can be divided into three major groups based on their actuation mechanism.\n\nElectroactive polymers (EAPs) are polymers that can be actuated through the application of electric fields. Currently, the most prominent EAPs include piezoelectric polymers, dielectric actuators (DEAs), electrostrictive graft elastomers, liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and ferroelectric polymers. While these EAPs can be made to bend, their low capacities for torque motion currently limit their usefulness as artificial muscles. Moreover, without an accepted standard material for creating EAP devices, commercialization has remained impractical. However, significant progress has been made in EAP technology since the 1990s.\n\nIonic EAPs are polymers that can be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include polyelectrode gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted carbon nanotubes could also be actuated by applying an electric field.\n\nTwisted and coiled polymer (TCP) muscles also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) are coiled polymer that can be actuated by electric power . A TCP muscle look like a helical spring. TCP muscles are usually made from silver coated Nylon. TCP muscle can also made from other electrical conductance coat such as gold. TCP muscles should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which also known as Joule heating, Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP muscle increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the muscle contraction. .\n\nPneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) operate by filling a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas pressure to the bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among the most commonly used PAMs today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.\n\nArtificial muscles constructed from ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times more power than a human muscle of the same length and weight.\n\nArtificial muscles based on fishing line already cost orders of magnitude less (per pound) than shape-memory alloy or carbon nanotube yarn; but currently have relatively poor efficiency.\n\nIndividual macromolecules are aligned with the fiber in commercially available polymer fibers. By winding them into coils, researchers make artificial muscles that contract at speeds similar to human muscles.\n\nA (untwisted) polymer fiber, such as polyethelene fishing line or nylon sewing thread, unlike most materials, shortens when heated—up to about 4% for a 250 K increase in temperature. By twisting the fiber and winding the twisted fiber into a coil,\nheating causes the coil to tighten up and shorten by up to 49%. Researchers found another way to wind the coil such that heating causes the coil to lengthen by 69%.\n\nOne application of thermally-activated artificial muscles is to automatically open and close windows, responding to temperature without using any power.\n\nTiny artificial muscles composed of twisted carbon nanotubes filled with paraffin are 200 times stronger than human muscle.\n\nShape-memory alloys (SMAs), liquid crystalline elastomers, and metallic alloys that can be deformed and then returned to their original shape when exposed to heat, can function as artificial muscles. Thermal actuator-based artificial muscles offer heat resistance, impact resistance, low density, high fatigue strength, and large force generation during shape changes. In 2012, a new class of electric field-activated, electrolyte-free artificial muscles called \"twisted yarn actuators\" were demonstrated, based on the thermal expansion of a secondary material within the muscle's conductive twisted structure. It has also been demonstrated that a coiled vanadium dioxide ribbon can twist and untwist at a peak torsional speed of 200,000 rpm.\n\nThe three types of artificial muscles have different constraints that affect the type of control system they require for actuation. It is important to note, however, that control systems are often designed to meet the specifications of a given experiment, with some experiments calling for the combined use of a variety of different actuators or a hybrid control schema. As such, the following examples should not be treated as an exhaustive list of the variety of control systems that may be employed to actuate a given artificial muscle.\n\nThe twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) muscles can be modeled by first-order linear time-invariant state spaces when input is electrical voltage, with accuracy more than 85%. Therefore, A TCP muscles can be easily controlled by a digital PID controller. A fuzzy controller can be used to speed up the PID controller .\n\nEAPs offer lower weight, faster response, higher power density and quieter operation when compared to traditional actuators. Both electric and ionic EAPs are primarily actuated using feedback control loops, better known as closed-loop control systems.\n\nCurrently there are two types of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). The first type has a single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve and the second type has a double bladder.\n\nPneumatic artificial muscles, while lightweight and inexpensive, pose a particularly difficult control problem as they are both highly nonlinear and have properties, such as temperature, that fluctuate significantly over time. PAMs generally consist of rubber and plastic components. As these parts come into contact with each other during actuation, the PAM's temperature increases, ultimately leading to permanent changes in the structure of the artificial muscle over time. This problem has led to a variety of experimental approaches. In summary (provided by Ahn et al.), viable experimental control systems include PID control, adaptive control (Lilly, 2003), nonlinear optimal predictive control (Reynolds et al., 2003), variable structure control (Repperger et al., 1998; Medrano-Cerda et al.,1995), gain scheduling (Repperger et al.,1999), and various soft computing approaches including neural network Kohonen training algorithm control (Hesselroth et al.,1994), neural network/nonlinear PID control (Ahn and Thanh, 2005), and neuro-fuzzy/genetic control (Chan et al., 2003; Lilly et al., 2003).\n\nControl problems regarding highly nonlinear systems have generally been addressed through a trial-and-error approach through which \"fuzzy models\" (Chan et al., 2003) of the system's behavioral capacities could be teased out (from the experimental results of the specific system being tested) by a knowledgeable human expert. However, some research has employed \"real data\" (Nelles O., 2000) to train up the accuracy of a given fuzzy model while simultaneously avoiding the mathematical complexities of previous models. Ahn et al.'s experiment is simply one example of recent experiments that use modified genetic algorithms (MGAs) to train up fuzzy models using experimental input-output data from a PAM robot arm.\n\nThis actuator consists of an external membrane with an internal flexible membrane dividing the interior of the muscle into two portions. A tendon is secured to the membrane, and exits the muscle through a sleeve so that the tendon can contract into the muscle. A tube allows air into the internal bladder, which then rolls out into the external bladder. A key advantage of this type of pneumatic muscle is that there is no potentially frictive movement of the bladder against an outer sleeve.\n\nSMA artificial muscles, while lightweight and useful in applications that require large force and displacement, also present specific control challenges; namely, SMA artificial muscles are limited by their hysteretic input-output relationships and bandwidth limitations. As Wen et al. discuss, the SMA phase transformation phenomenon is \"hysteretic\" in that the resulting output SMA strand is dependent on the history of its heat input. As for bandwidth limitations, the dynamic response of an SMA actuator during hysteretic phase transformations is very slow due to the amount of time required for the heat to transfer to the SMA artificial muscle. Very little research has been conducted regarding SMA control due to assumptions that regard SMA applications as static devices; nevertheless, a variety of control approaches have been tested to address the control problem of hysteretic nonlinearity.\n\nGenerally, this problem has required the application of either open-loop compensation or closed-loop feedback control. Regarding open-loop control, the Preisach model has often been used for its simple structure and ability for easy simulation and control (Hughes and Wen, 1995). As for closed-loop control, a passivity-based approach analyzing SMA closed loop stability has been used (Madill and Wen, 1994). Wen et al.'s study provides another example of closed-loop feedback control, demonstrating the stability of closed-loop control in SMA applications through applying a combination of force feedback control and position control on a flexible aluminum beam actuated by an SMA made from Nitinol.\n\nArtificial muscle technologies have wide potential applications in biomimetic machines, including robots, industrial actuators and powered exoskeletons. EAP-based artificial muscles offer a combination of light weight, low power requirements, resilience and agility for locomotion and manipulation. Future EAP devices will have applications in aerospace, automotive industry, medicine, robotics, articulation mechanisms, entertainment, animation, toys, clothing, haptic and tactile interfaces, noise control, transducers, power generators, and smart structures.\n\nPneumatic artificial muscles also offer greater flexibility, controllability and lightness compared to conventional pneumatic cylinders. Most PAM applications involve the utilization of McKibben-like muscles. Thermal actuators such as SMAs have various military, medical, safety, and robotic applications, and could furthermore be used to generate energy through mechanical shape changes.\n\n"}

Kennedy assassination and the subsequent conspiracy theories surrounding it have been discussed, referenced, or recreated in popular culture numerous times.\n\nThe fictional novel \"Gideon's March\" by J. J. Marric, was published in 1962 by Hodder and Stoughton in London, the year \"before\" the Kennedy assassination. Inspector George Gideon learns of a plot to assassinate President Kennedy during a state visit to London. The assassination is to take place during a parade, by means of a bomb; the assassin, called O'Hara, is a Southern bigot who hates the President for his Roman Catholic faith and his civil-rights initiatives.\n\nJ. G. Ballard wrote a 1967 short-short story titled \"The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy considered as a downhill motor race.\"\n\n\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" first published in 1975 by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson depicts the assassination scene, with several would-be assassins trying to kill Kennedy simultaneously.\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes in Dallas\" (Dodd, Mead 1980) by Edmund Aubrey, brings the renowned consulting detective out of his Sussex retirement to investigate the Kennedy assassination.\n\nDon DeLillo's 1988 novel \"Libra\" is a fictional imagining of the assassination, with Lee Harvey Oswald as the protagonist.\n\nJames Ellroy's Underworld USA Trilogy, particularly the 1995 novel \"American Tabloid\", constructs a fictional narrative involving several characters who have part in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nIn William Harrington's 1994 novel \"Columbo: The Grassy Knoll\" Lieutenant Columbo solves the Kennedy Assassination after a talk-show host is murdered before an exposé.\n\nThe 1996 \"Doctor Who\" spin-off novel \"Who Killed Kennedy\" features the Doctor's enemy the Master attempting to kill Oswald before the assassination as Kennedy's survival would trigger a chain reaction in history that could wipe the Doctor from existence, requiring journalist James Stevens to go back in time and kill Kennedy himself (acting as both gunmen at different points in his life, as Oswald's rifle had a misaligned targeting scope that prevented him delivering the fatal shot from the Book Depository on the first trip).\n\nDistrict Attorney Jim Garrison's fictional novel, \"The Star Spangled Contract\" (1976), and Taylor Caldwell's \"Captains and the Kings\" are both based in part on a conspiratorial view of the Kennedy assassination.\n\nIn the first album of Jean van Hamme and William Vance's comic book series \"XIII\" the title character XIII is shown to be the alleged assassin of U.S. President William B. Sheridan, who was murdered in his car during an official presidential visit to a city.

Nick Fury muses that the assassination of Kennedy was the Skull's way of showing that he would no longer take orders from America.\n\nIn the 2008-2009 series \"\" by Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá, the Kennedy assassination is a central plot element. The series initially takes place in a timeline where the assassination never happened, until an organisation of time-travelling assassins go back to 1963 to kill Kennedy. When the Umbrella Academy intercept the gunmen, The Rumour, disguised as Jacqueline Kennedy, uses her powers to make Kennedy's head explode.\n\nThe 1966 Emile de Antonio documentary \"Rush to Judgment\", based on Mark Lane's book, shows Lane interviewing witnesses who claim the shots came from the grassy knoll instead of the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nAndy Warhol's 1966 film \"Since\" recreated the assassination from multiple perspectives with participants from The Factory. \"Since\" is heavily improvised and explores the media portrayal of the assassination.\n\nThe 1967 satirical play \"MacBird!\" by Barbara Garson superimposes the events of the assassination on the general plot structure of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" with Kennedy becoming murdered king \"Ken O'Dunc\" and Lyndon Johnson the treacherous title character. The mockery of the play's name is derived from Johnson's propensity to refer to his wife Claudia as \"Lady Bird\" and his elder daughter as \"Lynda Bird.\" Garson insisted that her play was a satire and not intended to suggest seriously that Johnson had had a hand in the assassination.\n\nTonino Valerii's 1969 Spaghetti Western film \"The Price of Power\", starring Giuliano Gemma and Van Johnson, was the first filmed drama to present a critical perspective on the Kennedy assassination; although it dramatises the assassination of James A.

When asked how he knows this, he replies, \"Still got the shovel!\"\n\nZack Snyder's 2009 movie \"Watchmen\", based on the 1986–87 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, during the opening credits sequence portrays The Comedian, one of the members of the Watchmen, as Kennedy's assassin; he's shown firing the fatal headshot from the grassy knoll behind Abraham Zapruder.\n\nThe 2009 \"Mad Men\" episode \"The Grownups\" focused on the characters' reaction to JFK’s assassination and the subsequent events in their personal lives.\n\nThe 2010 \"Bones\" episode \"The Proof in the Pudding\" has the characters being forced by the Secret Service to identify cause of death on a highly classified skeleton they later identify as JFK. They determine that JFK was shot twice in the head from two different angles suggesting a second shooter. This causes Booth to question his trust in the government until Bones performs another test that determines this skeleton suffered from a bone disorder JFK didn't suffer from, meaning this wasn't JFK. After the skeleton was returned Bones admits in private that JFK had Scarlet Fever as a child and that could have created a false-positive on her test but they were all better off not knowing for certain if that really was JFK.\n\nThe 2013 docudrama \"Parkland\" follows the actions of several people closely related to the assassination from November 22–25, 1963, including the Presidential limousine, the staff of Parkland Memorial Hospital's trauma room, the Secret Service and FBI agents, Abraham Zapruder, and Lee Harvey Oswald's family.\n\nThe 2013 TV movie \"Killing Kennedy\", an adaptation of the Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard book \"Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot\", dramatizes the presidency and assassination of Kennedy, as well as the life of Lee Harvey Oswald in the years leading up to the assassination.\n\nThe 2014 movie \"\" featured some scenes set in 1973 which reveal that Magneto has been in prison beneath the Pentagon since 1963 for his apparent role in the Kennedy assassination. Magneto maintains his innocence by claiming he was trying to save Kennedy's life because he claims that Kennedy was one of them (mutants) but his efforts were interrupted by the police who arrested him. Xavier held his assassination against Magneto for a while due to a similar incident involving the loss of his legs back in and even claimed to Logan that Erik always had a way with guns.\n\nThe 2016 film \"Jackie\" follows the aftermath of the assassination from Jaqueline Kennedy's (played by Natalie Portman) perspective.\n\n\"The Suspicious Assassination of JFK\", released September 29, 2017, was episode 10 of season 2 of BuzzFeed web series, \"BuzzFeed Unsolved: True Crime\" in which the various theories surrounding the assassination were discussed.\n\nThe 1968 Rolling Stones song \"Sympathy for the Devil\" references both John and brother Robert's assassinations with the lyric, \"I shouted out / Who killed the Kennedys? / When after all / It was you and me.\"\n\nThe 1978 Misfits single \"Bullet\" describes the events around the assassination, stating that \"Texas is the reason\" for his death in lyrics directed towards Jacqueline Kennedy, in addition to sexual demands.\n\nThe English rock duo Godley & Creme song \"Lonnie\" is the 7th track on the 1980 album \"Ismism\" featuring lyrics about a man named Lonnie Garamond who kills Kennedy with a camera gun.\n\nThe Human League song \"\"Seconds\"\" from their 1981 album \"Dare\" deals directly with the Kennedy assassination and is directed at Lee Harvey Oswald. When playing live, the group regularly projected slides onto the background of the stage, and would play this song in front of images of Kennedy and the assassination in Dallas.\n\nPaul Simon's 1983 song \"The Late Great Johnny Ace\" references Kennedy's assassination among other famous deaths.\n\nThe Was (Not Was) songs \"11 Miles An Hour\" and \"11 MPH (Abe Zapp Ruder Version)\" on respective International and US-Japan releases of their 1988 album \"What Up, Dog?\" is about the JFK assassination and the speed the car was going, as well as referencing Abraham Zapruder and the Zapruder film of the event.\n\nThe 1990 Broadway musical \"Assassins\", written by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, climaxes as the ghosts of John Wilkes Booth, Leon Czolgosz, Charles Guiteau, and other \"would be\" assassins including John Hinckley, appear before a suicidally depressed Lee Harvey Oswald, and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it.\n\nThe music video for \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" by Alternative Rock group XTC on their 1992 album \"Nonsuch\" reenacts some events of the day of Kennedy's assassination drawing parallels with the death of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe 1998 Steve Gillette song \"Two Men in the Building\" on his album \"Texas & Tennessee\" is mostly about the assassination, in fact presenting Steve's own theory about it. Steve is a well-known songwriter, best known as the co-writer of the song \"Darcy Farrow\".\n\nThe 1999 music video \"Coma White\" on the 1998 album \"Mechanical Animals\" by American gothic rock band Marilyn Manson shows a darker bloodless representation of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, including his then-fiancée Rose McGowan as Jacqueline Kennedy. Furthermore, their 2000 album \"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" by Marilyn Manson contains numerous references to the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe 2012 music video \"National Anthem\" by singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey depicts her as Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy and shows re-enactments of home videos with ASAP Rocky as John F. Kennedy and re-enacting the assassination of the president.\n\nThe assassination has been the subject of many time travel and alternate history stories in science fiction film, television and literature, many with Kennedy and/or Oswald surviving or other people in the Presidential limousine dead. Some of these have Governor John Connally killed in place of Kennedy.\n\nA pair of alternate history films called \"The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald\" made in 1964 and 1977 have the accused assassin not being killed by Jack Ruby and standing trial for the murder of President Kennedy. Neither film ends in a verdict: the earlier movie ends after jury instructions, imploring viewers to debate among themselves; while the latter one has him being shot to death while being escorted from his jail cell to the courtroom just after the jury came back from deliberating.\n\nIn the 1980 novel \"Timescape\" by Gregory Benford, Kennedy's assassination was averted by a high school student who interrupted Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas School Book Depository, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Although seriously injured, Kennedy survived. This interference created an alternate timeline in which William Scranton was the US President in 1974, having defeated Robert F. Kennedy due to a telephone tapping scandal.\n\nThe 1990 TV movie, \"Running Against Time\", depicts a contemporary schoolteacher (Robert Hays) who continues to lament the 1966 death of his brother in Vietnam. He's given the chance to go back in time and seeks to prevent the November 1963 assassination, based on the belief that it would prevent Lyndon Johnson from beginning an escalation of the conflict. However, his attempt results in him being accused of the crime and the subject of a nationwide manhunt. The film is based on the 1986 Stanley Shapiro book.\n\n\"Lee Harvey Oswald\", the 1992 season opener for the TV series \"Quantum Leap\", finds Sam Beckett leaping into Oswald's body. At a critical moment, Al Calavicci prompts him to leap into Secret Service Agent Clint Hill. Hill attempts to reach the President's car before the shots are fired, but he fails to prevent Kennedy's death. Calavicci later reveals that he and Beckett have saved one life – that of Jackie Kennedy, whom Oswald had killed along with the President in the original timeline. This episode was written by series creator Donald P. Bellisario, in response to the Oliver Stone film \"JFK\". Bellisario (who served with Oswald in the Marine Corps) doesn't believe in a conspiracy; he used supporting evidence from the Warren Commission Report, and had Calavicci speculate that people find it comfortable to believe in a conspiracy, reasoning that if any one person can kill the President of the United States then nobody is safe.\n\nThe 1997 episode \"Tikka to Ride\" of the \"Red Dwarf\" comedy TV series, the characters accidentally knock Lee Harvey Oswald out of the fifth-floor window of the Book Depository when they travel back in time to 1963 by mistake, creating an alternate timeline where Kennedy is impeached in 1965 for sharing a mistress with a mafia boss. As a result, J. Edgar Hoover is blackmailed into running for President by the mob and allows Russia to establish nuclear missiles in Cuba, Kennedy's impeachment traumatising the nation and allowing the USSR to win the space race while the southern states flee due to the fear of missiles from Cuba. Fearing the repercussions of this timeline, but unwilling to kill Kennedy themselves - and with their attempt to redirect Oswald up to the sixth floor before their past selves arrive failing because his trajectory is now too steep for him to do more than wound Kennedy - the characters convince the alternate John F. Kennedy to go back in time and shoot his past self from the grassy knoll, arguing that this action will restore his historical position as a liberal icon (\"Timeslides\", an earlier episode of \"Red Dwarf\", also jokingly mentions the possibility of preventing the assassination).\n\nIn the 2002 film \"Timequest\", a time-traveler prevents Kennedy's assassination and history takes an alternate course, including the birth of a second son, James Kennedy, who was conceived on the night of November 22, 1963, when Kennedy and his wife return from Dallas. It also has Robert F. Kennedy becoming President in the late 1970s, with Martin Luther King Jr. as his Vice President, after both men were saved from their assassinations in 1968 by the same time traveler.\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's novel \"Voyage\" (1996), the Dallas assassination attempt only succeeds in crippling Kennedy, but Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy is killed. Kennedy is re-elected in 1964 and commits the United States to landing a manned vessel on Mars, which occurs in 1986. The novel uses the assassination attempt only as the impetus for an alternate history US space program.\n\nJeff Golden's 2008 novel \"Unafraid: A Novel of the Possible\" speculates on what would have happened had the assassination attempt been unsuccessful, with Kennedy serving two full terms as President. () Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle jams during the assassination attempt, leaving Kennedy wounded and Governor Connally dead.\n\nIn the \"\" graphic novel, \"Aftershock and Awe\" (2013), the events of the television series are set within an alternate history. That history diverged from our own when Kennedy escaped assassination by visiting Cape Canaveral instead of Dallas. His survival led to an accelerated space race and diminished Cold War tensions, although a limited nuclear exchange occurred between the United States and North Korea in 1987.\n\nIn the 2010 book, \"TimeRiders\", a training mission involves going back to November 22, 1963, to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK. This results in a new timeline in which a large space program sends a mission to Mars on September 10, 2001. The trainees learn that history corrects itself, and Oswald, who was originally a lone gunman, was no longer alone when he shot the President but was part of a conspiracy, thanks to their interference with the timestream.\n\nStephen King's novel \"11/22/63\", published in 2011, tells about a time traveler trying to stop the assassination. The novel was adapted into a TV series, \"11.22.63\", in 2016. In both versions, the protagonist succeeds in saving Kennedy, but returns to a dystopian future brought about by his actions, prompting him to return to the past to \"reset\" the results of his intervention.\n\nIn the 1992 anthology \"Alternate Kennedys\", edited by Mike Resnick, 25 science fiction authors imagine alternate histories involving the Kennedys, including speculating upon different outcomes of November 22, 1963.\n\nIn American Heroes Channel's \"What if? Armageddon 1962\", Richard Pavlick succeeds in assassinating President-elect Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson is sworn in on January 20, 1961. While the Bay of Pigs invasion goes as it historically did, the Cuban Missile Crisis is different. Having more confidence in his military advisers than Kennedy did, Johnson authorizes military air strikes to take out the missile sites. However, some missiles were hidden from sight and the United States, Cuba and the Soviet Union engage in a nuclear war.\n\nIn Ken Davenport's 2017 novel \"The Two Gates\", Kennedy survives with the Dallas shooting with the back-to-throat wound he actually received, but First Lady Jackie is killed by the fatal third shot. The novel deals with speculation as to how Kennedy would've deal with the Vietnam War had he lived.\n\nIn a 2018 episode of the TV series \"Timeless\", a young Kennedy is transported to 2018, and before he can be returned to 1934, he is warned not to go to Dallas in 1963. When the time travelers return to 2018, they are told he was killed in Austin, Texas after two years as president.\n\nThe card game Chrononauts, which simulates the cause-and-effects of changing history through time-travel, features Kennedy's assassination as a Linchpin card. When flipped (and Kennedy is injured rather than killed), it affects three later Ripple Points: the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), the Apollo 11 moon landing (1969), and Richard Nixon's resignation (1974).\n\n\"Reelect JFK\", in which Kennedy is a playable character, set in an alternative timeline, where he survives his assassination attempt, and attempts to seek reelection in 1964, while confronting key political issues such as Vietnam and the Civil Rights Movement, and discovering who was responsible for the assassination attempt on his life.http://www.giantbomb.com/reelect-jfk/3030-5633/\n\nThe 2004 video game \"JFK Reloaded\" puts the player in the role of Lee Harvey Oswald, where the player is then scored on how closely one's version of the assassination matches the report of the Warren Commission: first shot missed, second hit JFK and Governor Connally and third on JFK's head. According to the company, the primary aim of the game was \"to establish the most likely facts of what happened on 1963-11-22 by running the world’s first mass-participation forensic construction\", the theory being that a player could help prove that Lee Harvey Oswald had the \"means and the opportunity to commit the crime\", and thus help prove the Warren Commission's findings.\nThe 2010 video game \"\" gives hints that the main player character Alex Mason (Sam Worthington) is brainwashed by the Soviet Union into assassinating Kennedy within the context of the video game. An ending cutscene shows Mason was in the crowd of onlookers who watched Kennedy disembark from Air Force One in Lovefield.\n\nIn the post-credits scene of the 2016 video game \"Mafia III\", Lincoln Clay's former CIA handler in Vietnam and Lincoln's intelligence provider in order to take down the Marcano Crime Family, John Donovan, has been invited to a Senate Committee hearing in 1971 to testify his participation in Lincoln's revenge against the Marcanos, Donovan explains that he helped Lincoln was due to evidence that he uncovered that Sal, the boss of the Marcano Crime family, has been one of the conspirators of the assassination of Kennedy, and further evidence states that one of the senators presiding over the hearing as another conspirator, Donovan then later pulls his silenced pistol and kills the senator, stating that he will hunt down those responsible for the death of Kennedy.\n\n"}
{"id": "37006922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37006922", "title": "Bayonetta 2", "text": "Bayonetta 2\n\nBayonetta 2 is an action-adventure hack 'n' slash video game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Nintendo for Wii U and Nintendo Switch. It is the sequel to the 2009 game \"Bayonetta\", and was directed by Yusuke Hashimoto and produced by Atsushi Inaba and Nintendo's Hitoshi Yamagami, under supervision by series creator Hideki Kamiya.\n\n\"Bayonetta 2\" was announced in a Nintendo Direct presentation on September 13, 2012. Unlike the Sega-published \"Bayonetta\", which was a multiplatform release for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a publishing deal with Nintendo meant that \"Bayonetta 2\" released as a platform-exclusive for Wii U. The titular character, Bayonetta, sports a new costume and hairstyle and the game itself features a new two-player mode. The game is also the second \"Bayonetta\" product to receive Japanese voiceovers, using the same cast that voiced the \"\" anime film by Gonzo.\n\n\"Bayonetta 2\" was released in September 2014 in Japan and October 2014 for the rest of the world. The Special and First Print Editions of the game included a Wii U port of the original \"Bayonetta\" as a separate disc inside the case. The game received critical acclaim from many reviewers, praising the combat system and overall improvements from the first game.\n\nNintendo Switch ports of both games, and a sequel, \"Bayonetta 3\", were announced in December 2017 during The Game Awards 2017.\n\n\"Bayonetta 2\" carries on the action-style gameplay of its predecessor, in which players control the eponymous Bayonetta as she fights against various angelic and demonic forces using combinations of melee attacks and gunplay. Dodging enemy attacks at the last second activates 'Witch Time', slowing down enemies around Bayonetta and allowing players to easily retaliate and solve certain environmental puzzles. Players are also able to use special moves called Torture Attacks, trapping opponents in infernal devices for extra points. Weapon customization from the first game also returns, allowing players to equip combinations of new weapons on both Bayonetta's hands and feet. A large array of weapons can be equipped, including the character's signature guns, a bow, swords and other forms of projectile weapons. Players earn grades during combat, with the highest 'Pure Platinum' grade achieved by performing high numbers of combos, in the fastest time possible, without being damaged. As with the previous game, Bayonetta can use Torture Attacks on her enemies, conjured torture devices that finish off single enemies in gruesome ways and grant a bonus to the player.\n\n\"Bayonetta 2\" also adds a new gameplay element called Umbran Climax which can be activated when the player has a full magic gauge. Similar to the state of boss fights in the first game, this technique strengthens Bayonetta's attacks and combos with extra Wicked Weaves and Infernal Demon summons for a short period of time. This increases their overall range and damage and also replenishes Bayonetta's health when in use.\n\nMost of \"Bayonetta 2\" takes place on the fictional sacred mountain of Fimbulventr and the nearby town of Noatun, which are located in the Middle East. The main character Bayonetta (voiced by Hellena Taylor) travels to the mountain to find the Gates of Hell so that she can save her friend Jeanne (voiced by Grey DeLisle-Griffin).\n\nReturning characters include Rodin (voiced by Dave Fennoy), the bartender of \"Gates of Hell\" who supplies Bayonetta with powerful weapons; Luka (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal), a journalist who provides Bayonetta with valuable information; and Enzo (now voiced by John Kassir, replacing Chick Vennera), an informant who provides comic relief for the game. New characters include Loki (voiced by Mark Daughtery), an amnesiac boy who guides Bayonetta to the mountain; the Masked Lumen (voiced by Crispin Freeman), a powerful Sage who is Bayonetta's new rival; and Loptr (voiced by TJ Ramini), the mysterious Prophet who is apparently allied with the Masked Lumen.\n\nA few months after the first \"Bayonetta\", Bayonetta is in the middle of Christmas shopping with Enzo when a group of angels attack the city during a stuntplane flyover. Teaming up with fellow witch and friend Jeanne, she is on the verge of winning the battle until a demon summoning goes wrong. Despite Bayonetta being able to put down the demon, Jeanne is attacked, causing her soul to be claimed by the depths of Inferno. At the same time, a Lumen Sage is brought to the present day by a mysterious figure who promises him the chance for revenge.\n\nUpon a tip from her informant Enzo, Bayonetta heads to the sacred mountain of Fimbulventr. An entrance to the realm of Inferno, the Gates of Hell, is said to be inside and Bayonetta plans to use it to save her friend. Bayonetta arrives in Noatun, the city at the foot of the mountain, and meets a boy called Loki who is trying to reach Fimbulventr for reasons he cannot remember. The pair of them strike a deal to travel together as Loki claims his powers will be needed in order to reach the realm to Inferno. Though able to learn some information about Loki's lost memories thanks to Luka, the journey suffers setbacks from angel and demon attacks alike. Both Loki and Bayonetta are also hunted by the masked Lumen Sage and the mysterious Prophet who reveals that he knows Loki. The Prophet also shows Bayonetta a vision of the past that implies the Witch Hunts 500 years ago were not truly caused by Balder.\n\nAfter narrowly escaping their aggressors, Bayonetta reaches Inferno and travels into its depths to save Jeanne's soul. With the help of Rodin, Bayonetta is able to revive Jeanne's soul back to the human world. However, the masked Sage attacks again and finally reveals his true identity as a young Balder who is trying to hunt down Loki as part of his revenge. Even though she is able to save the boy from Balder's attacks, Loki suddenly loses control of his powers and sweeps both Bayonetta and Balder into a time rift that sends them 500 years into the past. Now in Vigrid during the Witch Hunts, Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa and the two witches work together to fight back against the onslaught of angels. When they become separated, Bayonetta encounters Loptr, a doppelgänger of Loki and the one who would eventually become the Prophet in the present day. Loptr claims that the Eyes of the World, one of which Bayonetta possesses, belong to him. Later meeting with the young Balder, Bayonetta arrives too late to stop Loptr from murdering Rosa. Bayonetta realizes that Loptr is the one that Balder should really be after instead of Loki and that Loptr had brought the Sage to the present day to use as a pawn. The two of them decide to work together and return to the present to stop Loptr's plans. Meanwhile, in the present day, Luka encounters Loki having now escaped from Inferno. Claiming that he now remembers everything, Loki pleads Luka to take him to Fimbulventr.\n\nWith the assistance of a revived Jeanne, Bayonetta and Balder reach the top of Fimbulventr and find Loptr having already captured Loki. Loptr explains that he and Loki were once the God of Chaos, Aesir, the true creator of the Eyes of the World. Aesir had split his power amongst humanity to create the Eyes, but had also split his very soul into two halves of good and evil in the process. Loki, the good half, was given the power to control the Eyes directly and Loptr promptly takes that power for his own. Despite their efforts, Loptr takes both of the Eyes from Balder and Bayonetta and transforms into Aesir with the intent to rule over humanity as their god. As the final clash takes place, Loki remembers that Aesir's true power is to erase anything he wants from the world. He uses that power to destroy the Eyes, weakening Loptr and making him easy fodder for the combined summoning Bayonetta, Balder, and Jeanne perform moments later. Loptr, with his body destroyed and only his soul remaining, attempts to escape to another time to try his plan again in an era where the Eyes still exist. Balder stops him and absorbs the evil soul, despite warnings from Loki that doing so will eventually poison his very core. Balder reveals he knows that Bayonetta is his daughter and asks her to stop him should Loptr's evil lead him astray. Realizing that her father's actions during their first meeting were not his own, Bayonetta can only watch as the Sage is returned to his own time. With Loptr and the Eyes gone, Loki says he plans to take a break from the world's affairs but that he and Bayonetta may meet again in the future. He wishes her goodbye and then fades away.\n\nA few days pass since the events at Fimbulventr. Bayonetta and Jeanne are taking advantage of the post holiday sales, watching with amusement at Luka being roped into advertising Rodin's bar. Bayonetta suddenly remembers that she forgot Enzo and promptly sees him crashing down the street in a plane with angels in pursuit. Despite her annoyance at having ruined another dress, Bayonetta teams up with Jeanne to take to battle once again.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Balder is shown returning to his time period, now corrupted by the evil of Loptr's soul. Donning his golden mask from the first game, he begins his plot to reunite the three realms, thus setting up the events of the first \"Bayonetta\".\n\nShortly after the release of \"Bayonetta\", Hideki Kamiya discussed with Yusuke Hashimoto ideas for sequels and spin-off games from the title. Despite these discussions, Kamiya believed they would never release a sequel. However, Kamiya's Twitter account later stated that he might release the sequel if \"Bayonetta\" sold well. \"Bayonetta 2\" was revealed during a Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2012. The reason for the game's Wii U exclusivity was because Nintendo stepped in with additional funding after it was shelved by Sega. PlatinumGames producer Atsushi Inaba, responding to complaints by fans of the original game, stated that \"Bayonetta 2\" would not exist if Nintendo had not partnered with the developer to make the game. Work on the game was based on feedback the staff received from the original \"Bayonetta\" to bring various improvements. Nintendo was not involved in the making of the game other than as an \"observer\" and the staff were pleased with their experience. One of the improvements made by staff was to the movements of enemies: in the first game, there was a single enemy movement when Bayonetta struck them, while in \"Bayonetta 2\", they have differing animations depending on the direction of Bayonetta's attack. The architecture for the main city environment, Noatun, was based on cities in Belgium and Italy, such as Bruges (church interiors), Brussels (the grand buildings), Florence (city streets and houses) and Venice (the canal network).\n\nIn a Wii U Direct from January 2013, PlatinumGames showed a development trailer for the game. They confirmed game development was going smoothly, but did not go into many gameplay details. A playable demo of the game was featured at Nintendo's booth during E3 2013, following the reveal of the game's first gameplay trailer. A multiplayer mode was also announced, along with the option of a touch-based control scheme and the confirmation that the game will support Off-TV Play. In the Nintendo Direct from February 2014, another trailer for the game was released, showing off the new environments players can expect as well as some of the basic story elements of the game. Further gameplay was also released, revealing the use of Japanese voice actors for the Japanese release, new weapons for Bayonetta to use as well as the use of the new youth character as being playable. As of the \"Bayonetta 2 Direct\", the game was released on September 20, 2014 in Japan and in October 2014 for the rest of the world. At E3 2014, it was announced the game would include a port of the original \"Bayonetta\", which would include exclusive Nintendo costumes, dual audio voice tracks, and touch controls. The original game would be a digital download via the Nintendo eShop and on a separate disc for retailers.\n\nThe music of \"Bayonetta 2\" was composed by a group of members led by Masami Ueda, many of whom returned after being featured on the soundtrack for the first game. Ueda states that he finds the score for \"Bayonetta 2\" much livelier than the one for \"Bayonetta\" and explains they attempted to create new elements in the music by switching out certain instruments for others.\n\nA key difference in the soundtrack between the games is the inclusion of dynamic music for boss fights based on the progression in \"Bayonetta 2\". Ueda states that the music is broken up into phases and are set off by triggers based on animations and other cues in the scene which allow for swells in the music to match up the action onscreen. A similar approach was done for the stage tracks as well, with as many as 10 shorter loops mixed together that transition based on the player's progress through the stage. Compared to the original \"Bayonetta's\" 150 tracks, \"Bayonetta 2\" has 183 tracks with higher audio quality.\n\nLike the original game, \"Bayonetta 2\" features a cover of an old song but remixed into the signature style of the games, \"Moon River\" by Andy Williams. Both the remixed version and the original are included in the game, much like how \"Fly Me To The Moon\" was used as the main theme song for \"Bayonetta\". The game's battle theme, \"Tomorrow is Mine\", was one of the first pieces of music revealed in its entirety during promotion of the game. Both of these songs were performed by Keeley Bumford. Also like the original game, \"Bayonetta 2\" received a five disc original soundtrack, which was released in Japan on October 29, 2014.\n\nTo market the release, Nintendo partnered with Playboy to set a photo shoot with Playmate Pamela Horton cosplaying Bayonetta.\n\n\"Bayonetta 2\" received critical acclaim. It received an aggregated score of 91/100 on Metacritic based on 80 reviews. The Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s four reviewers collectively awarded the game a score of 38 out of 40. \"Edge\" awarded \"Bayonetta 2\" a score of 10 out of 10. The magazine's reviewer described it as \"a riotous, spectacular work of the highest order of camp\" and praised the game for the extent of its customisability and for refining problematic elements from the first \"Bayonetta\", with tighter pacing and the removal of \"sudden, mid-cinematic, instafail QTEs\". The reviewer concluded, \"This is a game that you can complete in ten hours, but play and replay forever. … It is a masterclass in combat design, in videogame variety, in the balance between accessibility and depth.\" GameSpot reviewer Mark Walton said the game \"will be remembered as an absolute classic\" and awarded it a perfect 10/10, the seventh game in the site's history to receive that score. Chris Carter from Destructoid also rated it a 10/10, where he declared it as \"one of the finest action games of all time\", alongside \"Devil May Cry 3\".\n\nSeveral reviews agreed that the game was an improvement on its predecessor, despite acknowledgement that its combat mechanics were largely unchanged: Eurogamer<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Martin Robinson concluded, \"\"Bayonetta 2\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s biggest disappointment may be that it's an iterative sequel, but it's not such a problem when it's iterating on genius.\" IGN<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jose Otero commented that its art direction and pacing \"make \"Bayonetta 1\" look poor by comparison,\" while GameTrailers called it \"sharpened to a nearly flawless degree\" compared to its predecessor, praising the variety in addition to the style mixed with the gameplay, where the game \"thrives on throwing players into complete madness and letting them conquer it.\" Chris Carter at Destructoid stated \"Four years later and Platinum hasn't lost its edge with \"Bayonetta 2\". It's just as stylish and as fun as ever\"\n\nOf the game's new features, the co-operative online Tag Climax mode was welcomed by GameSpot<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Mark Walton and by Eurogamer<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Martin Robinson, who praised it for requiring the player to gain a deep understanding of the combo scoring system; however, IGN<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Otero commented that the fun it provides was restricted to short bursts, and Polygon<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Arthur Gies found the mode's co-operative mechanics at odds with its competitive focus on scoring. Otero and Robinson both criticized the game's optional touchscreen-based control system, intended to improve accessibility for new players, as very limited in comparison to the game's main control scheme.\n\nIn Japan, \"Bayonetta 2\" sold approximately 39,000 units in its first week of release, much fewer than were sold of the original \"Bayonetta\" in its debut week. After its third week of release, \"Bayonetta 2\" had sold approximately 50,000 units in Japan. The title was the seventh best-selling game in the UK in its first week of release, but was absent from the Top 40 best-seller list in its second week.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version of Bayonetta 2 sold 9,532 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, which placed it at number 14 on the all format sales chart. As of March 2018, the game has sold nearly 700,000 units worldwide, including approximately 400,000 on the Switch and nearly 300,000 on the Wii U.\n\nBayonetta appears as a playable fighter via downloadable content in the 2014 Nintendo fighting games \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\", after being one of the most requested characters by fans to be in the game. She fights using various methods including combos, Witch Time, and Bullet Arts abilities from her series, and has alternate costumes based on her designs in both \"Bayonetta\" and \"Bayonetta 2\". She was revealed on December 15, 2015 during the Super Smash Bros. Final Video Presentation, and was made available alongside a stage based on the Umbra Clock Tower from \"Bayonetta\" on February 3, 2016.\n"}
{"id": "3331541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3331541", "title": "Bernice Bobs Her Hair", "text": "Bernice Bobs Her Hair\n\n\"Bernice Bobs Her Hair\" is a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, written in 1920 and first published in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" in May of that year. It appeared shortly thereafter in the collection \"Flappers and Philosophers\".\n\nThe story was based on letters Fitzgerald sent to his younger sister, Annabel, advising her on how to be more attractive to young men. The original text was much longer, but Fitzgerald cut nearly 3000 words and changed the ending to make the story more attractive to publishers.\n\nThe story concerns Bernice, a wealthy girl from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, who goes to visit her cousin Marjorie for the month of August. Marjorie feels that Bernice is a drag on her social life, and none of the boys wants to dance with Bernice.\n\nBernice overhears a conversation between Marjorie and Marjorie's mother in which the younger girl complains that Bernice is socially hopeless. The next morning, Bernice threatens to leave town, but when Marjorie is unfazed, Bernice relents and agrees to let Marjorie turn her into a society girl. Marjorie teaches Bernice how to hold interesting conversations, how to flirt with even unattractive or uninteresting boys to make herself seem more desirable, and how to dance. Bernice's best line is teasing the boys with the idea that she will soon bob her hair, and they will get to watch. \n\nThe new Bernice is a big hit with the boys in town with her new attitude, especially with Warren, a boy Marjorie keeps around as her own but neglects. When it becomes clear that Warren has shifted his interest from Marjorie to Bernice, Marjorie sets about humiliating Bernice by tricking her into going through with bobbing her hair. When Bernice comes out of the barbershop with the new hairdo, her hair is flat and strange. The boys suddenly lose interest in her, and Bernice realizes that she was tricked.\n\nMarjorie's mother points out that Bernice's haircut, which was then seen only with \"liberated\" women, would cause a scandal at an upcoming party held in her and Marjorie's honor. Bernice, deciding it would be best to leave the town before the party the next day, packs her trunk in the middle of the night and decides to leave on a train at 1 a.m.\n\nBefore she goes, she sneaks into Marjorie's room and cuts off her cousin's two braids, taking them with her on her run to the station and throwing them onto Warren's front porch.\n\nThe name of the title character echoes that of Berenice II of Egypt, whose legendary sacrifice of her golden tresses resulted in the victory of her husband in war and the gods giving her an honor; her tresses being placed into the heavens, as the constellation Coma Berenices.\n\nThe story was made into a short production for PBS in 1976. It was directed by Joan Micklin Silver and starred Shelley Duvall as Bernice, Veronica Cartwright as Marjorie, and Bud Cort as Warren. The role of Draycott Deyo was played by Patrick Reynolds (then using the stage name Patrick Byrne) and Marjorie's mother was played by Polly Holliday.\n\nThe story was converted into a one-act play by D.D. Brooke for The Dramatic Publishing Company. It was adapted into a musical by Adam Gwon and Julia Jordan.\n\nThe Irish pop group The Divine Comedy turned the story into a song on its 1993 album \"Liberation\".\n\n"}

It tells the story of high school student Lane Myer who is suicidal after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas.\n\nIn the town of Greendale in northern California, high school student Lane Myer's two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth. Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps Lane for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin. Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a disabled 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running.\n\nLane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of \"almost 8\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from “How-to” books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from damaging his garage with thrown newspapers. Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane yelling \"I want my two dollars!\" Lane also regularly encounters two Korean drag racers, one of whom learned to speak English by listening to Howard Cosell.\n\nLane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar, (who in lieu of not being able to get \"real drugs\" in their small town, constantly inhales everyday substances like Jell-O, snow, and nitrous oxide in a whipped cream can) Lane tries to ski the K-12, the highest peak in town, in hopes of getting Beth back but wipes out. Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date. To top it all, he increasingly begins to suffer from neurotic hallucinations owing to the mounting frustrations in his life.\n\nAs Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique, who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane's overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith, who continually tries to force Monique into being a girlfriend for her socially backward son Ricky. The pair are so annoying that she pretends she cannot speak English. Monique, a Dodgers fan, turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier who helps Lane fix his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. Monique helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing one ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and, after besting Ricky (who attempts to keep Lane from rescuing Monique from the restraints of his mother) in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro. Lane and Monique are last seen kissing at home plate at Dodger Stadium, with Johnny bicycling towards them, while in a mid-credit scene Badger demolishes his house by launching a home-made space shuttle from his room.\n\nParts of the film were shot in Alta, Brighton, and Snowbird in Utah.A dream sequence was produced in stop-motion where hamburgers comes alive. \n\nSiskel & Ebert gave the film two thumbs down. Bill Cosford of \"The Miami Herald\" wrote, \"\"Better Off Dead\" has the body of a tired teen comedy but the soul of an inspired student film; it's the first movie in a long time to interrupt itself periodically with flights of animated fancy. At one point, romantic foreshadowing is accomplished by a \"clay-mation\" sequence featuring cheeseburgers in love. At another, a lovesick teen draws a cartoon picture of his faithless girlfriend, and the drawing tells him to get lost.\"\n\nAccording to Savage Steve Holland, Cusack did not like the film and walked out of a screening as both were making \"One Crazy Summer\", later confronting Holland saying \"Better Off Dead\" \"was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don't speak to me.\" Holland claimed that Cusack felt he had been made to look foolish and that his comments \"made me not care about movies anymore\". However, in a 2013 Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" chat, Cusack, when asked if he hated filming \"Better Off Dead\", responded, \"No, I just thought it could have been better, but I think that about almost all my films. I have nothing against the film... Glad people love it still.\"\n\nAs of October 2018, \"Better Off Dead\" holds a rating of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews with the consensus: \"\"Better Off Dead\" is an anarchic mix of black humor and surreal comedy anchored by John Cusack's winsome, charming performance.\"\n\nThe film's soundtrack was produced primarily by Rupert Hine.\n\nThe opening track, \"With One Look (The Wildest Dream)\", was produced by Hine and features Cy Curnin and Jamie West-Oram of The Fixx on lead vocals and guitars respectively. Hine had previously worked with Curnin and West-Oram, and also contributed vocals to the song. The following track, \"Arrested By You\", as well as \"Better Off Dub (Title Music)\" and \"Race The K-12 (Instrumental)\" were performed solely by Hine.\n\n\"Dancing in Isolation\" features Terri Nunn of Berlin on lead vocals. Hine produced the song and was reportedly under consideration to produce an album for Berlin.\n\n\"Come to Your Rescue\" was performed by Thinkman, a group formed by, and including, Hine for the purpose of restoring his solo career without the music press knowing about it. West-Oram also provided guitar work to this song, as well as the instrumental \"The Falcon Beat\".\n\nThe only two tracks on the CD without Hine's involvement are \"A Little Luck\" and \"One Way Love (Better Off Dead).\" \"Valley Girl\"'s Elizabeth Daily, credited on the soundtrack as E. G. Daily, sang lead vocals on both songs and also performed them in the film during the high school dance scene.\n\n\nA number of songs that appear in the film do not appear on the CD soundtrack, including Howard Jones' \"Like To Get To Know You Well\", Van Halen's \"Everybody Wants Some!!\", Neil Sedaka's \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\", Paul Simon's \"Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover\", Jimi Hendrix's \"Foxy Lady\", Frank Sinatra singing \"A Man Alone\" by Rod Mckuen, Hall & Oates' \"She's Gone\", and Muddy Waters' \"Mannish Boy.\"\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "7372027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7372027", "title": "Black Star (photo agency)", "text": "Black Star (photo agency)\n\nBlack Star, also known as Black Star Publishing Company, was started by refugees from Germany who had established photographic agencies there in the 1920s. Today it is a New York City-based photographic agency with offices in London and in White Plains, New York. It is known for photojournalism, corporate assignment photography and stock photography services worldwide. It is noted for its contribution to the history of photojournalism in the United States. It was the first privately owned picture agency in the United States, and introduced numerous new techniques in photography and illustrated journalism. The agency was closely identified with Henry Luce's magazines \"Life\" and \"Time\".\n\nBlack Star was formed in December 1935. The three founders were Kurt Safranski, Ernest Mayer and Kurt Kornfeld. In 1964, the company was sold to Howard Chapnick. The three founders; Safranski, Mayer and Kornfeld were German Jews who fled Berlin during the Nazi regime. They brought with them a wealth of knowledge and some new ideas for the American press.\nSafranski was a graphic designer and editor for the \"Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung\" \"(BIZ)\", which was part of the \"Ullstein\" publishing house. During the early 1930s, \"Ullstein Verlag\" was Germany's largest publisher of books, newspapers and magazines. \"BIZ's\" circulation was over one million. While an editor at \"BIZ\", Safranski was using two or more photos placed together to create a story which surpassed the need for text. Not only was this visually appealing, but it attracted more readers as well. \n\nThis drew the attention of the top American mass media publishers. William Randolph Hearst, a powerful media mogul of the day, was intrigued by the European advances in photography and printing. Hearst invited Safranski over to the United States to produce a dummy magazine using photos to tell the stories. Hearst liked the proposed idea but initially didn't move forward on it. Mayer then brought to idea to the experimental editorial department of Henry Luce, the largest publisher of the day, with periodicals such as \"Time\" and \"Fortune\". Luce collaborated with Black Star to produce a new weekly magazine called \"Life\". \"Life\" would use artistic photos in a new format. These pictures would be large and take up the majority of the page. They could capture not only a moment in time, but an emotion and story that would be paramount to the text. Prior to this, photojournalism in the U.S. was relegated to regional newspapers where text was more important than photos. Photos would sometimes be staged or posed or re-created to help a news article. But this all changed with the advent of the 35mm camera. The Leica, which was developed in Germany in 1925, was a small and easier to use camera. Advances in half-tone printing made using photographs in periodicals easier. Safranski and Mayer were already familiar with photographers who used this new technology to capture more candid moments.\n\nMayer owned the publishing company and photo agency, \"Mauritius\", in Berlin. Forced by the Nazis to sell his business, he brought negatives, and connections to European photographers with him to the United States. The contacts included the notable photographers and Fritz Goro. These contacts with European-based photographers, and the photographic negatives he brought with him, became the foundation for the new business. \n\nKornfeld was a literary agent back in his native Germany where he had a talent for bringing together authors and editors. Originally the idea for the company was to be a publishing house and a photo agency just like Mayer's \"Mauritius\". However, the publishing business never took off and more profit was to be found in selling photos. Even though he had no experience with photography, Kornfeld became Black Star's best picture agent. He had a talent for creating rapport between client and artist. Therefore, Kornfeld handled their most important client, \"Life\" magazine, providing up to 200 photos a week.\n\nAlthough \"Life\" was the agency's most high-profile client, Black Star also served other periodicals, newspapers, advertisers and publishers. Its stock of iconic photography represents a pictorial history of the 20th century beginning in the 1930s. This archive was anonymously donated to Ryerson University in 2005.\n\nNoted Black Star photographers include Robert Capa, Andreas Feininger, Germaine Krull, Philippe Halsman, Martin Munkácsi, Kurt Severin, W. Eugene Smith, Marion Post-Wolcott, Bill Brandt, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Charles Moore, James Nachtwey, Lee Lockwood, Mario Giacomelli and Spider Martin.\n\nIn 2003, Black Star's archive of 292,000 prints, created by more than 6,000 photographers was acquired by Jimmy Pattison, a Canadian businessperson. In 2005, he donated it to Ryerson University in Toronto. In 2012, the Ryerson Image Centre was opened to house the collection.\n\nCorporate assignment photography has become the largest segment of Black Star's business. The company claims to have captured more photographic images for more annual reports than any other photo agency or service.\n\n\n"}

Tipperary, in 1692. Joseph Comerford bought it and saved it from being melted down. Other similar antiquities (see: Golden hat) have been discovered elsewhere in Europe and have dated from the Bronze Age. \n\nThe crown weighed about five ounces, and may have been melted down for its intrinsic value during the Reign of Terror.\n\nThe eventual fate of the crown rescued by Comerford remains a mystery. The crown appears to have survived in safe hands for long time after his death. In his \"Histoire d’Irlande\" (1758), the Abbé MacGeoghegan, described this gold crown as being in the shape of a bonnet, and added: “This curious part of antiquity was sold to Joseph Comerford and must be preserved in the Castle of Anglure, where he had bought the estate.”\n\nSupporting the theory the crown survived the Reign of Terror is a contributor to the \"Dublin Penny Journal\" who in August 1832 claimed that the crown was then still preserved in the Château d’Anglure. However, Dr Czernicki, whose father bought the Chateau d’Anglure in 1832 from Monsieur Tissandier, said: “I never heard anyone speak about the piece of antiquity that you refer to.\"\n\nIt is therefore generally considered to have been lost and probably melted down during the French Revolution.\n"}

Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as lap dancing, topless dancing, and rave dancing.\n\n\"Tanzverbot\" is the German term for \"dancing ban\". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most state or canton governments. These occasions are certain Christian and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as Good Friday, All Saints' Day (from its association with All Souls' Day practices) or memorial days like Volkstrauertag. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.\n\nUntil 1999, an ordinance in Pound, Virginia required that dance hall permits not be granted \"to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character\". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.\n\nSince 1926, the New York City Cabaret Law has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. \n\nBetween 1985 and 2002, a Seattle, Washington law called the Teen Dance Ordinance enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.\n\nFrom the 1830s to 1950s, play parties became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.\n\nThe events of the 1984 film \"Footloose\" were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily Southern Baptist town of Elmore City, Oklahoma, which lasted until 1980.\nVarious Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of Mennonite, Hutterite, Baptist, Seventh-day Adventist, and Holiness movement sects. Jehovah's Witnesses disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol. Likewise, the Church of the Nazarene recommends against \"All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve.\" Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.\n\nIn contrast, some strains of Charismatic Christianity practice rituals in which the Holy Spirit is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. Mormonism has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.\nIn Islam, Salafists and Wahhabis consider dancing in general to be \"haram\" (forbidden). Conservative Islamic and Orthodox Jewish traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.\n\nIn contrast, Sufism encourages dancing, for example Sufi whirling and dancing to celebrate Mela Chiraghan. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the Taliban.\n\n"}

{"id": "53943626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53943626", "title": "Dialogic pedagogy", "text": "Dialogic pedagogy\n\nDialogic pedagogy is a theory and practice of teaching in which dialogue is central. Teachers and students are in an equitable relationship and listen to multiple points of view.\n\nAlthough modern interest in dialogic pedagogy seems to emerge only in the 1960s, it was a very old and probably widespread educational practice. Perhaps one of the best known examples of dialogic pedagogy in the Ancient times is the Socratic method described by his student Plato. However, dialogic practices and dialogic pedagogy existed in Ancient Greece, before, during, and after Socrates' time, possibly in other forms than those depicted by Plato. There has been a long tradition of dialogic pedagogy, called Chavruta/Chavrusa/Havruta, in Jewish Yeshivas, involving dialogic studies of Talmudic texts, that goes back to the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE). Economist Amartya Sen argues that dialogic pedagogy has been well situated within the Indian religious and civic traditions and spread across Asia with the rise of Buddhism.\n\nIn more recent times, Mikhail Bakhtin introduced the idea of dialogism, as opposed to \"monologism\", to literature. Paulo Freire's work, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" introduced these ideas to educational theory.\n\nThere are a number of formats of instruction, that have been recognized as \"dialogic\" (as opposed to \"monologic\").\n\nThere are a number of types of dialogic pedagogy, that is, where the form and the content is recognized as \"dialogic\".\n\nInstrumental dialogic pedagogy uses dialogue for achieving non-dialogic purposes, usually making students arrive at certain preset learning outcomes. For example, Nicolas Burbules defines dialogue in teaching instrumentally as facilitating new understanding, \"Dialogue is an activity directed toward discovery and new understanding, which stands to improve the knowledge, insight, or sensitivity of its participants\". \n\nThe teacher presets the endpoint of the lesson, for example, \"At the end of the lesson, the students will be able to understand/master the following knowledge and skills.\" However, the teacher's method of leading students to the endpoint can be individualised both in instruction techniques and in time taken. Different students are \"closer\" or further\" from the endpoint and require different strategies to get them there. Thus, for Socrates to manipulate Meno to the preset endpoint - what is virtue is not known and problematic - is not the same to manipulate Anytus to the same endpoint. It takes different and individualized instructional strategies.\n\nSocrates, Paulo Freire and Vivian Paley all strongly critique the idea of preset endpoints however in practice they often set endpoints. \n\nInstrumental dialogic pedagogy remains influential and important for scholars and practitioners of dialogic pedagogy field. Some appreciate its focus on asking good questions, attendance to subjectivity, use of provocations and contradictions, and the way it disrupts familiar and unreflected relations. However, others are concerned about the teacher's manipulation of the student's consciousness and its intellectualism.\n\nIn contrast to instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy, non-instrumental approaches to dialogic pedagogy view dialogue not as a pathway or strategy for achieving meaning or knowledge but as the medium in which they live. Following Bakhtin, meaning is understood as living in the relationship between a genuine question seeking for information and a sincere answer aiming at addressing this question. Non-instrumental dialogic pedagogy focuses on \"eternal damn final questions\". It is interested in the mundane only because it can give it the material and opportunity to move to the sublime. This is seen, for example, in the work of Christopher Phillips. \n\nThe non-instrumental \"epistemological dialogue\", a term introduced by Alexander Sidorkin, is a purified dialogue to abstract a single main theme, a development of a main concept, and unfold the logic. According to Sidorkin, ontological dialogic pedagogy priorities human ontology in pedagogical dialogue:\n\nSociolinguist Per Linell and educational philosopher Alexander Sidorkin evidence a non-instrumental ecological approach to dialogic pedagogy that focuses on the dialogicity of the mundane everyday social interaction, its non-constrained nature, in which participants can have freedom to move in and out of the interaction, and the absence or minimum of pedagogical violence. Using the metaphor of \"free-range kids\", Lenore Skenazy defines the participants in this ecological dialogue as free-range dialogic participants.\n\n"}

It was first used as the rallying cry of the rebel forces during the Federal War, and it was subsequently incorporated into the country's coat of arms after the conflict ended in 1863.\n\nAccording to an account by historian José Gil Fortoul, two French adventurers who had joined the forces of General Ezequiel Zamora near Barinas initially suggested that the customary \"...your humble servant\" valediction in written communications be replaced with \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\", which was finally modified to \"Dios y Federación\". The phrase subsequently became emblematic of the rebel movement.\n\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Coche in April 1863 and the establishment of the new government by the victorious rebels, General Juan Crisóstomo Falcón modified the official seal from 1836, replacing the word \"Liberty\" in the central ribbon with \"Dios y Federación\". The phrase would be used in subsequent redesigns of the seal until July 1930, when a decree replaced it with \"Estados Unidos de Venezuela\", in reference to the First Republic of Venezuela.\n\nAlthough without legal basis, the phrase has been traditionally considered the country's motto, even after it was officially abandoned. Today, its significance is more political than historical, since for many people in Venezuela it represents the desire to see a return to the decentralized federal system, away from the centralist and authoritarian regimes of recent years.\n\nThe motto is still featured in the coat of arms of the state of Barinas. It was part of the state flag of Falcón until 2006, and it is still used in official documents by the Judicial branch of Venezuela. \"Dios y Federación\" was also used occasionally in official communications by the government of Alta California in the 1820s.\n\n"}

{"id": "17241961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17241961", "title": "Face negotiation theory", "text": "Face negotiation theory\n\nFace-Negotiation Theory was a theory first proposed by Brown and Levinson (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits \"face\", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called \"facework\". Since people frame the situated meaning of \"face\" and enact \"facework\" differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine facework negotiation.\n\nFace-negotiation theory is primarily based on the research of Brown and Levinson. In this theory, \"face\" is a metaphor for self-image, which originates from two Chinese conceptualizations: lien and mien-tzu. Lien is the internal moral face that involves shame, integrity, debasement, and honor issues. Mien-tzu, on the other hand, is the external social face that involves social recognition, position, authority, influence and power.\n\nErving Goffman situated \"face\" in contemporary Western research and conceptualized the terms lien and mien-tzu as identity and ego.. He noted that face is a concern for one's projected image that is both immediate and spontaneous and is tied to the dynamics of social interaction. Correspondingly, \"facework\" denotes actions taken to maintain consistency between the self and public line. Further research by Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson on politeness suggests that the desire for face is a universal concern. Brown and Levinson further suggest that face can refer to two wants of the individual- the positive face that necessitates approval by others and the negative face that requires that one's actions or thoughts are unimpeded by others. Thus participants wants are of more importance than the interaction itself in face saving view of politeness. In fact, researchers Brown and Levinson posit that face is something that \"is emotionally invested, and can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction\".\n\nTing-Toomey expands this thinking and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context. Facework is defined as clusters of communicative behaviors that are used to enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.\n\nWith these concepts and frameworks, face-negotiation theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity. Content conflict refers to the substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval. In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the face-negotiation theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active facework management from the two interdependent conflict parties.\n\nThe theory has gone through multiple iterations since its creation. There is a 1988 version of seven assumptions and 12 propositions, a 1998 version of seven assumptions and 32 propositions, and most recent the 2005 version of seven assumptions and 24 propositions.\n\nFace and facework are universal phenomena. A Face-Negotiation Theory perspective stresses the impact of culture on the situated meaning of face and the enactment of facework. Thus, the theory assumes that:\n\nFace-negotiation theory primarily deals with five sets of themes: face orientation or concerns, face movements, facework interaction strategies, conflict communication styles, and face content domains. In the 2005 version of theory, the five thematic clusters are referred as \"core taxonomies\".\n\nThe orientation of face determines the focus with which the face negotiator will direct her or his attention and energy of the conflict messages. Because of different concerns, caused by different underlying cultural values, face negotiators may orient towards self-face (one's own image), other face (the other conflict party's image) or mutual face (both parties' image and/or the image of the relationship).\n\nFor example, in individualist cultures, such as the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, there is great value on personal rights, freedoms and the \"do it yourself\" attitude. In collectivist cultures such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more value is placed on \"we\" vs. \"I\". The needs of the group outweigh the needs of the individual. One-third of the world lives in an individualist society, while the other two thirds are identified with collectivist cultures.\n\nFace orientation also involves the concept of power distance. People from large power distance cultures accept unequal power distributions, are reliant on established hierarchy, and understand that rewards and sanctions are based on social position. People from small power distance cultures value equal power distributions, symmetric relations, and rewards and sanctions based on performance. The United States is an example of a small power distance culture, while Japan embodies a large power distance culture.\n\nDrawing on research of Geert Hofstede, face-negotiation theory notes that while individualism and power distance are two separate dimensions, they are correlated. Highly individualistic cultures tend to be low in power distance, and vice versa.\n\nFace movement refers to the options that a negotiator faces in choosing whether to maintain, defend and/or upgrade self-face versus other-face in a conflict episode. There are four opportunities a mediator has in regards to their concern for self-face, your personal image and other-face, the counterpart's image of themselves that define face movements:\n\nTing-Toomey asserts that several conditions must be perceived as severe in order for a negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved facework that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur. Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.\n\nIn an individualistic culture, the more self-face threatening the conflict, the more likely the individual will engage in an attack. In a collectivistic culture, where mutual-face concern is important, avoidance of conflict may prevail in order for the situation to be defused. Collectivistic communicators may also require a third-party negotiation to make progress in finding a resolution.\n\nOn a broad level, individualistic cultures operate with a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on verbal communication and nonverbal gestures for emphasis. Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties. There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating. Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image with the goal of winning the conflict. Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly. Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.\n\nAlong the face concern/orientation dimension, facework is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation. Preventative facework is an attempt to minimize face-loss before the threat occurs. Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers. Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures. Restorative facework attempts to repair face that was lost. Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies. Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative facework than collectivistic cultures.\n\nFacework differs from conflict styles by employing face-saving strategies which can be used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and can be used in a variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations. These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues. Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation. Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.\n\nConflict style consists of learned behaviors developed through socialization within one's culture. Rahim based his classification of conflict styles into two dimensions. The first dimension demonstrates the concern for self, how important it is for the individual to maintain their own face or that of their culture (this is rated on a high to low continuum) and the second is concern for others, how important is it to the individual to help them maintain their own face (also rated on a high to low continuum). The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other. \n\nIn 2000 Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, and Yee-Jung incorporated three additional conflict communication styles to the original five. These three have further enhanced conflict communication across cultures.\n\n\nOther researchers used a different way to group the conflict tactics. Ting-Toomey (1983) grouped strategies into three categories of tactics for handling conflict; integrative, distributive and passive-indirect.\n\nIntegrative conflict tactics incorporated integrating and compromising styles and is reflective of mutual-face and the need for a solution. Those who chose this tactic work with the other person involved in the conflict to get the best possible solution for both parties. Examples of Integrative tactics may include listening to the other, respecting their feelings, and providing their own personal viewpoints in a manner that assists in the negotiation.\n\nDistributive conflict tactics use the dominating style of handling conflict, and emphasizes the individuals own power over the other. This style reflects self-face. Passive-indirect conflict tactics are consistent with obliging and avoiding styles of handling conflict and reflects other-face.\n\nFace content domains refer to the different topics an individual will engage in facework on. Individuals have different face wants or face needs in a diverse range of communicative situations. There are six domains that an individual will operate in:\n\nThe heart of Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions. They are based on the seven assumptions and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies. They describe facework on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.\n\n\"Cultural-level propositions\"\n\n\n\"Individual-level propositions\"\n\n\n\"Situational-level propositions\"\n\n\nReflecting on the final assumption, intercultural facework competence consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. \nFacework competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns. To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive facework interaction skills.\n\nKnowledge here refers to the process of in-depth understanding of phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences. Building block concepts include: (1) individualism-collectivism, (2) power distance. (3) two contrastive \"self/face\" models, and (4) facework communication styles.\n\nMindfulness means attending to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses. To be mindful of intercultural facework differences, we have to learn to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context. Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.\n\nAs an intercultural communication theory, face-negotiation theory was first tested in and applied to the field of intercultural training and conflicts. However, researchers from other areas also find this theory applicable and relevant. Recent applications and examinations of the theory include following studies.\n\nOne direct application of face-negotiation theory is the design of intercultural conflict training frameworks. Part of the objective of face-negotiation theory, according to Ting-Toomey, is in fact to translate the theory into a viable framework for mindful intercultural conflict training.\n\nMore specifically, intercultural conflict training revolves around international business negotiation, intercultural conflict mediation, managing intercultural miscommunication, and developing intercultural conflict competencies. Adapting face-negotiation theory, and also in combination with various communication researches such as Critical Incident, Intergroup Negotiation Simulation etc., Ting-Toomey designed a detailed three-day training session. Agenda outline, along with in class activities, lecture themes, and exercises, is provided in her design as well.\n\nThis study by the author of the theory Stella Ting-Toomey and, Department of communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, John G. Oetzel was done in order to discover if face was indeed a factor in determining \"culture's influence on conflict behavior\" (Ting-Toomey & Oetzel, 2003). There were 768 people from four different countries who partook in the study. The cultures represented were China, Germany, Japan, and the United States. China and Japan representing the collectivist countries and Germany and the United States as the individualist countries. Each contributor was given a survey in which they were to explain interpersonal conflict.\nThe largest findings are as follows.\n\nThis study implemented by the author of this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how facework in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of \"facework\". The results are as follows.\n\nMotherhood of the Construction of \"Mommy Identity\" – Heisler & Ellis Face Negotiation Theory suggests that, \"USA culture simultaneously encourages connection and autonomy among individuals.\" Mothers do not want to be vulnerable so there is a \"face\" that is developed in the culture of mothers. Heisler and Ellis did a study on the \"face\" and reasons for face in motherhood. The results portrayed that the main reasons for keeping \"face\" in a culture of mothers are:\n\n\nMotherhood and \"face\": Results from the same study showed that mothers participate in \"Mommy face work.\" Depending on who they are talking to or interacting with. Mothers said to put on their highest face with friends, spouses, mothers and other family members.\n\nKristin Kirschbaum applied face-negotiation theory to the health communication context, and specifically in the operating room environment. In the research, a survey was administered to anesthesiologists and surgeons at a teaching hospital in the southwestern United States to measure three variables commonly associated with face-negotiation theory: conflict-management style, face concern, and self-construal.\nThe results strongly support the theory, and significant positive correlations were found between independent self-construal and self-face concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. Specific to this health communication context, the research shows differences between the two groups of operating-room physicians: surgeons are potentially more other-face oriented and that anesthesiologists are potentially more independently oriented. Further, both anesthesiologists and surgeons recognize the importance of collaboration as surgical team members.\n\nThe survey also finds that specific terms were contextually inappropriate for this population, e.g. the terms pride, dignity, or credibility demonstrated a need for error correlation. This suggests unique considerations of language. Along this line of thinking, the research recommends physician communication training to address both unique language considerations and different orientations to face concern and self-construal.\n\nGust Yep, noticing the potential vulnerability and emotional volatility of sexual interaction, applied face-negotiation theory to the safe sex negotiation context.\n\nThe study integrates various components of face-negotiation theory, and eight propositions are derived from empirical testing in intimate communication scenarios including East-West romantic dyads. The research is based on preliminary observations on personal interviews with two Asian women, aiming to predict intimate communication patterns between Asian women and Euro-American men. Specifically, low-high context and individualism-collectivism frameworks are used to draw the eight propositions.\n\nFace Saving in Business Request Emails\n\nA study conducted on the exchange of business emails between Chinese & American business associates presented how the structure of email requests affected the person's face & impacted how the associates viewed the request. It was observed that direct requests in an email threatened the face of the recipient & sender. It resulted in loss of face because the recipient was denied autonomy and acted in a socially unacceptable manner.\n\nA research was conducted to gauge how disabled persons interact with able bodied individuals with regards to protecting one’s face and self-identity. The study considered students with not only physical disability but also disabilities not visually identifiable such as heart conditions and hearing impairment. Those with disabilities were threatened by the way others treated them and hence they chose more face-saving strategies. For instance, communication apprehension was noted in students with a hearing impairment and they reported less disclosure in the conversation. In fact, the study found that disabled students viewed asking help from able bodied individuals as a face threatening act.\n\nA research in people’s reaction to unethical communication revealed that people use Face Threatening Acts in order to counter the apprehension in communication. According to Bisel et al. (2011), ‘denying unethical communication challenges both positive and negative face of the hearer”. An expression of disapproval threatens a person’s positive face which indicates the hearer’s need for approval and it impacts the person’s negative face because it affects the person’s autonomy. \n\nThe study put forth a research question of associating politeness strategies and unethical communication. The strategies considered were don’t’ do the face threatening act, negative politeness, positive politeness and bald on strategy. The unethical communication was classified as one that was either deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, intrusive or coercive. The ideal strategic responses have been highlighted in the figure.\n\nA research was conducted to study the use of face saving and face threatening acts in reviewing artwork. For the study, twelve reviews from the periodical Literatūra ir menas (Literature and Art) were randomly selected. The source for the research analysis was between 1970 -1975.\n\nIt was observed that reviewers generally had the face of the artist in mind before presenting their reviews. When presenting a negative review, reviewers threatened the positive face of the artist and hence also presented positive feedback in order to ‘save face’ of the artist.\n\nA study was conducted among 317 Chinese and American participants to determine how the cultural variation between the two affected the intention to apologize. The cultural norms were categorized as the individualistic and collectivist cultures. According to Hofstede (1980), an individualistic culture lays emphasis on the identity of the “I” while collectivist cultures place more importance on the “we” and the harmony in groups. \n\nApology, according to Goffman (1971), is the “offender’s device to remedy a social breach and to re-establish social harmony”. This study also took into account culture when trying to understand the intention to apologize. \n\nThe cultural differences were more prominent especially as the intention took into account if the member (whose face was threatened by an act and thus necessities an apology) was an in-group or an out-group member. The study thus found that Chinese participants had a greater intention to apologize especially if their act threatened the positive face of the other individual. On the other hand, the U.S participants had the intention to apologize when their act threatened the negative face of the person.\n\n\n"}

It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. \n\n\nDefining the term \"feminization\" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist Judith Butler, a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men, although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.\n\nFeminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset. Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. \n\nFeminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. Whole communities became known as the \"working poverty.\"\n"}

By that time she had become the mother of the Yule Lads. Terry Gunnell hypothesizes that the medieval custom of dressing as Grýla may be related to other visiting traditions such as Julebukk or the Yule Goat and that her name may mean \"threat\" or \"threatening\".\n\nShe has the ability to detect children who are misbehaving year-round. During Christmas time, she comes from the mountains to search nearby towns for her meal. She leaves her cave and hunts for the children. She devours children as her favorite snack.

{"id": "38005076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38005076", "title": "History of Western civilization before AD 500", "text": "History of Western civilization before AD 500\n\nWestern civilization describes the development of human civilization beginning in Ancient Greece, and generally spreading westwards. However, Western civilization in its more strictly defined European sphere traces its roots back to Rome and the Western Mediterranean. It can be strongly associated with nations linked to the former Western Roman Empire and with Medieval Western Christendom.\n\nThe civilizations of Classical Greece (Hellenic) and Roman Empire (Latin) as well as Ancient Israel (Hebraism) and early Christendom are considered seminal periods in Western history;. From Ancient Greece sprang belief in democracy, and the pursuit of intellectual inquiry into such subjects as truth and beauty; from Rome came lessons in government administration, martial organization, engineering and law; and from Ancient Israel sprang Christianity with its ideals of the brotherhood of humanity. Strong cultural contributions also emerged from the pagan Germanic, Celtic, Wendic, Finnic, Baltic and Nordic peoples of pre-Christian Europe. Following the 5th century Fall of Rome, Europe entered the Middle Ages, during which period the Catholic Church filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fallen Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) endured for centuries.\n\nThe opposition of a European \"West\" to an Asiatic \"East\" has its roots in Classical Antiquity, with the Persian Wars where the Greek city states (depicted as the west) were opposing the expansion of the Achaemenid Empire (depicted as the east). The Biblical opposition of Israel and Assyria from a European perspective was recast into these terms by early Christian authors such as Jerome, who compared it to the \"barbarian\" invasions of his own time (see also Assyria and Germany in Anglo-Israelism).\n\nThe \"East\" in the Hellenistic period was the Seleucid Empire, with Greek influence stretching as far as Bactria and India, besides Scythia in the Pontic steppe to the north. In this period, there was significant cultural contact between the Mediterranean and the East, giving rise to syncretisms like Greco-Buddhism. The establishment of the Byzantine Empire around the 4th century established a political division of Europe into East and West and laid the foundations for divergent cultural directions, confirmed centuries later with the Great Schism between Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholic Christianity.\n\nThe earliest civilizations which influenced the development of the West were those of Mesopotamia, the area of the Tigris–Euphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran: the cradle of civilization. An agricultural revolution began here around 10,000 years ago with the domestication of animals like sheep and goats and the appearance of new wheat hybrids, notably bread wheat, at the completion of the last Ice Age, which allowed for a transition from nomadism to village settlements and then cities like Jericho.\n\nThe Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians and Assyrians all flourished in this region. Soon after the Sumerian civilization began, the Nile River valley of ancient Egypt was unified under the Pharaohs in the 4th millennium BC, and civilization quickly spread through the Fertile Crescent to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Levant. The Phoenicians, Israelites and others later built important states in this region.\n\nThe ancient peoples of the Mediterranean heavily influenced the origins of Western civilisation. The Mediterranean Sea provided reliable shipping routes linking Asia, Africa and Europe along which political and religious ideas could be traded along with raw materials such as timber, copper, tin, gold and silver as well as agricultural produce and necessities such as wine, olive oil, grain and livestock. By 3100BC, the Egyptians were employing sails on boats on the Nile River and the subsequent development of the technology, coupled with knowledge of the wind and stars allowed naval powers such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans to navigate long distances and control large areas by commanding the sea. Cargo galleys often also employed slave oarsmen to power their ships and slavery was an important feature of the ancient Western economy.\n\nThus, the great ancient capitals were linked — cities such as: Athens, home to Athenian democracy, and the Greek philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Socrates; the city of Jerusalem, the Jewish capital, where Jesus of Nazareth preached and was executed around AD 30; and the city of Rome, which gave rise to the Roman Empire which encompassed much of Europe and the Mediterranean. Knowledge of Greek, Roman and Judeo-Christian influence on the development of Western civilization is well documented because it attached to literate cultures, however, Western history was also strongly influenced by less literate groups such as the Germanic, Scandinavian and Celtic peoples who lived in Western and Northern Europe beyond the borders of the Roman world. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean was the centre of power and creativity in the development of ancient Western civilisation. Around 1500 BC, metallurgists learned to smelt iron ore, and by around 800BC, iron tools and weapons were common along the Aegean Sea, representing a major advance for warfare, agriculture and crafts in Greece.\n\nThe earliest urban civilizations of Europe belong to the Bronze Age Minoans of Crete and Mycenaean Greece, which ended around the 11th century BC as Greece entered the Greek Dark Ages. Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the Archaic period of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. Classical Greece flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Under Athenian leadership, Greece successfully repelled the military threat of Persian invasion at the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae. The Athenian Golden Age ended with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.\n\nBy the 6th century BC, Greek colonists had spread far and wide — from the Russian Black Sea coast to the Spanish Mediterranean and through modern Italy, North Africa, Crete, Cyprus and Turkey. The Ancient Olympic Games are said to have begun in 776BC and grew to be a major cultural event for the citizens of the Greek diaspora, who met every four years to compete in such sporting events as running, throwing, wrestling and chariot driving. Trade flourished and by 670BC the barter economy was being replaced by a money economy, with Greeks minting coins in such places as the island of Aegina. Poultry arrived from India around 600BC and would grow to be a European staple. The Hippocratic Oath, historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically, is said to have been written by the Greek Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of western medicine, in Ionic Greek (late 5th century BC),\n\nThe Greek city states competed and warred with each other, with Athens rising to be the most impressive. Learning from the Egyptians, Athenian art and architecture shone from 520 to 420BC and the city completed the Parthenon around 447BC to house a statue of their city goddess Athena. The Athenians also experimented with democracy. Property owners assembled almost weekly to make speeches and instruct their temporary rulers: a council of 500, chosen by lot or lottery, whose members could only serve a total of 2 years in a lifetime, and a smaller, high council from whom one man was selected by lottery to preside from sunset to the following sunset.\n\nThus, the citizens' assembly shared power and prevented lifetime rulers from taking control. Military chiefs were exempt from the short term requirement however and were elected, rather than chosen by lot. Eloquent oratory became a Greek art form as speakers sought to sway large crowds of voters. Athenians believed in 'democracy' but not in equality and excluded women, slaves, the poor and foreign from the assembly. Notions of a general \"brotherhood of man\" were yet to emerge.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated into the Roman Empire. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics. Plato was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician and writer of philosophical dialogues. He was the founder of the Academy in Athens which was the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, Socrates, prior to his unjust execution that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\", Plato and his student, the political scientist Aristotle, helped lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Plato's sophistication as a writer is evident in his Socratic dialogues.\n\nIn classical tradition, Homer is the ancient Greek epic poet, author of the \"Iliad\", the \"Odyssey\" and other works. Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the western canon of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of fiction and literature in general.\nAlexander the Great (356BC-323BC) was a Greek king of Macedon and the creator of one of the largest empires in ancient history. He was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle and, as ruler, broke the power of Persia, overthrew the Persian king Darius III and conquered the Persian Empire. His Macedonian Empire stretched from the Adriatic sea to the Indus river. He died in Babylon in 323 BC and his empire did not long survive his death. Nevertheless, the settlement of Greek colonists around the region had long lasting consequence and Alexander features prominently in Western history and mythology.\n\nThe city of Alexandria in Egypt, which bears his name and was founded in 330BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the Western World. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician Euclid and anatomist Herophilus; constructed the great Library of Alexandria; and translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek (called the Septuagint for it was the work of 70 translators).\n\nThe ancient Greeks excelled in engineering, science, logic, politics and medicine. Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe, for which reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.\n\nAncient Rome was a civilization that grew out of a small agricultural community, founded on the River Tiber, on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 10th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea, and centered at the city of Rome, the Roman Empire became one of the largest empires in the ancient world. In its centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire. It came to dominate South-Western Europe, South-Eastern Europe/the Balkans and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.\nOriginally ruled by Kings who ruled the settlement and a small area of land nearby, the Romans established a republic in 509BC that would last for five centuries. Initially a small number of families shared power, later representative assemblies and elected leaders ruled. Rome remained a minor power on the Italian peninsula, but found a talent for producing soldiers and sailors and, after subduing the Sabines, Etruscans and Piceni began to challenge the power Carthage. By 240BC, Rome controlled the formerly Greek controlled island of Sicily. Following the 207BC defeat of the bold Carthaginian general Hannibal, who had led an army spearheaded by war elephants over the Alps into Italy, the Romans were able to expand their overseas empire into North Africa. Roman engineers built arterial roads throughout their empire, beginning with the Appian Way through Italy in 312BC. Along such roads marched soldiers, merchants, slaves and citizens to all corners of a flourishing mercantile empire. Roman engineering was so formidable that roads, bridges and aqueducts survive in impressive scale and quantity to the present day. According to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, the population of the Imperial capital was probably the first in the world to approach one million people. It eventually consisted of monumental public buildings, such as the Colosseum (dedicated to sport), the bathhouses (dedicated to leisure) and the Roman Forum dedicated to civic affairs. Slavery helped power the economy, but also created occasional tension — as in the slave rebellion led by Spartacus which was put down in 71BC.\nJulius Caesar (100BC-44BC) was a Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the gradual transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Conspirators who feared he was seeking to re-establish a monarchy assassinated him on the floor of the Roman Senate in 44BC. His anointed successor Augustus Caesar outmaneuvered his opponents to reign as a de facto emperor from 27BC. His successors became all-powerful and demanded veneration as gods. Rome entered its period of Imperial rule and stability (albeit often marred by occasional bouts of apparent insanity by various god-emperors) returned to the Empire.\n\nRoman civilization and history contributed greatly to the development of government, law, war, art, literature, architecture, technology, religion, and language in the Western world. Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church’s official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world to the contemporary world but the Classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. It was, for many centuries, the \"international lingua franca\" and Latin itself evolved into the Romance languages, while Ancient Greek evolved into Modern Greek. Latin and Greek continue to influence English, not least in the specialised vocabularies of science, technology and the law.\n\nJudaism claims a historical continuity spanning approximately 4000 years. Originally herders, who probably originated from the Persian Gulf or nearby deserts, the Hebrews (the name signified 'wanderer') formed one of the most enduring monotheistic religions, and the oldest to survive into the present day. Abraham is traditionally considered as the father of the Jewish people, and Moses the law giver, who, according to the Hebrew Bible, led them out of slavery in Egypt and delivered them to the \"Promised Land\" of Israel. While the historicity of these accounts is not considered precise, the stories of the Hebrew Bible have been an inspiration for vast quantities of Western art, literature and scholarship.\n\nAround 1000BC, the Israelites had a period of power under King David who captured Jerusalem. His son King Solomon constructed the first magnificent Temple at Jerusalem for the worship of God. The Jews rejected the polytheism common to that age and would worship only God, whose Ten Commandments instructed them on how to live. These commandments remain influential in the West and prohibited theft, lying and adultery; called for worship of only one God; and for respect and honour for parents and neighbours. The Jews observed Sabbath as a \"day of rest\" (called \"one of the first wide-ranging laws of social-welfare in the world\" by the historian Geoffrey Blainey). In 587BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the Temple and the Jewish leaders went into exile to return a century later to face a succession of foreign rulers: Persian and Greek. Judaism's texts, traditions and values play a major role in later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, Islam and the Baha'i Faith. Many aspects of Judaism have also influenced secular Western ethics and law.\n\nIn 63BC, Judea became part of the Roman Empire and, around 6BC Jesus was born to a Jewish family in the town of Nazareth, as a consequence of which, worship of the god of Israel would come to spread through, and later dominate, the Western World. Later the Western calendar would be divided into Before Christ (BC) (meaning before Jesus was born) and Anno Domini (AD).\n\nChristianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century arising out of the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. The life of Jesus is recounted in the New Testament of the Bible, one of the bedrock texts of Western Civilisation. According to the New Testament, Jesus was raised as the son of the Nazarenes Mary (called the \"Blessed Virgin\" and \"Mother of God\") and her husband Saint Joseph (a carpenter). Jesus' birth is commemorated in the festival of Christmas. Jesus learned the texts of the Hebrew Bible and like his contemporary John the Baptist, became an influential wandering preacher. He gathered Twelve Disciples to assist in his work. He was a persuasive teller of parables and moral philosopher. In orations such as his \"Sermon on the Mount\" and stories such as \"The Good Samaritan\" and his declaration against hypocrisy \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\", Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. He criticized the privilege and hypocrisy of the religious establishment which drew the ire of religious and civil authorities, who persuaded the Roman Governor of the province of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, to have him executed for subversion. In Jerusalem, around AD 30 Jesus was crucified (nailed alive to a wooden cross) and died. According to the Bible, his body disappeared from his tomb three days later, because he had been resurrected from the dead. The festival of Easter recalls this event.\n\nThe early followers of Jesus, including Saints Paul and Peter carried a new theology concerning him throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, sowing the seeds of such institutions as the Catholic Church, of which Saint Peter is remembered as the first Pope. Saint Paul, in particular, emphasised the universality of the faith and the religion moved beyond the Jewish population of the Empire and Asia Minor. Later Jesus was called \"Christ\" (meaning \"anointed one\" in Greek), and thus his followers became known as \"Christians\". Christians often faced persecution from authorities or antagonistic populations during these early centuries, particularly for their refusal to join in worshiping the emperors. The Emperor Nero famously blamed them for the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 and condemned them to \"Damnatio ad bestias\", a form of capital punishment in which people were maimed to death by animals in the circus arena.\n\nNevertheless, carried through the synagogues, merchants and missionaries across the known world, the new religion quickly grew in size and influence. Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in AD 313 ended the persecutions and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history. In AD 325, Constantine conferred the First Council of Nicaea to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The council composed the Nicean Creed which outlined a profession of the Christian faith. Constantine instigated Sunday as Sabbath and \"day of rest\" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers).\n\nThe population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and the division of Europe into a Western (Latin) and an Eastern (Greek) part was prefigured in the division of the Empire by the Emperor Diocletian in AD 285. Around 330, Constantine established the city of Constantinople as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Possessed of mighty fortifications and architectural splendour, the city would stand for another thousand years as a \"Roman Capital\". The Hagia Sophia Cathedral (later converted to a mosque following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453) is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture, with its vast dome and interior of mosaics and marble pillars, it was so richly decorated that the Emperor Justinian, the last emperor to speak Latin as a first language, is said to have proclaimed upon its completion in 562: \"Solomon, I have surpassed thee!\".\n\nThe city of Rome itself never regained supremacy and was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 and the Vandals in 455. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the history of Christianity and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final Great Schism separating Roman and Eastern Christianity in 1054.\n\nWhen the Western Roman Empire was starting to disintegrate, St Augustine was Bishop of Hippo Regius. He was a Latin-speaking philosopher and theologian who lived in the Roman Africa Province. His writings were very influential in the development of Western Christianity and he developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual City of God (in a book of the same name), distinct from the material Earthly City. His book Confessions, which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography written in the canon of Western Literature. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview.\n\nIn 476 the western Roman Empire, which had ruled modern-day Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and England for centuries, collapsed due to a combination of economic decline, and drastically reduced military strength which allowed invasion by barbarian tribes originating in southern Scandinavia and modern-day northern Germany. Historical opinion is divided as to the reasons for the fall of Rome, but the societal collapse encompassed both the gradual disintegration of the political, economic, military, and other social institutions of Rome as well as the barbarian invasions of Western Europe.\n\nIn England, several Germanic tribes invaded, including the Angles and Saxons. In Gaul (modern-day France, Belgium and parts of Switzerland) and Germania Inferior (The Netherlands), the Franks settled, in Iberia the Visigoths invaded and Italy was conquered by the Ostrogoths.\n\nThe slow decline of the Western Empire occurred over a period of roughly three centuries, culminating in 476, when Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was deposed by Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of this date, and not simply because Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by the East Roman Empire, continued to live in Salona, Dalmatia, until he was assassinated in 480. More importantly, the Ostrogoths who succeeded considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman traditions and, as the historian Edward Gibbon noted, the Eastern Roman Empire continued until the Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29685329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29685329", "title": "Homestuck", "text": "Homestuck\n\nHomestuck is a webcomic written, illustrated, and animated by American author and artist Andrew Hussie, and is the fourth overall webcomic published on \"MS Paint Adventures\" (\"MSPA\"). The webcomic centers on a group of teenagers who unwittingly bring about the end of the world through the installation of a beta copy of an upcoming computer game.\n\nThe comic consists of a combination of static images, animated GIFs and instant message logs, as well as animations and games made with Adobe Flash. It has been noted for its complex plot and considerable length: over 8000 pages and 800,000 words.\n\n\"Homestuck\" begins when thirteen-year-old John Egbert receives a beta copy of an upcoming computer game, \"Sburb\", in the mail. Installing and running the game on his computer triggers a meteor storm to fall on his house in real life, which he survives only by being transported to a planet in another dimension known as the Incipisphere. As John's friends Rose Lalonde, Dave Strider, and Jade Harley join him in the game, they learn that they have unwittingly triggered the destruction of Earth, and that it is their duty to play the game to create a new universe.\n\nAs they begin to explore the world of \"Sburb\", John and his friends are harassed by a group of twelve Internet trolls who have played a version of the game before. Further contact with the trolls reveals that they are not human at all, but an alien species actually called \"trolls\". As the trolls gradually become more important to the story, the narrative shifts to a side story arc exploring the nature of troll society and the specific sequence of events that led to this group to enter the troll version of \"Sburb\". The trolls' arc concludes with them winning their game and originally creating the humans' universe.\n\nAs the story returns to focus on the humans, the two species start to cooperate to salvage the kids' doomed game session. As the kids' actions accidentally bring about an unbeatable enemy called Jack Noir, they learn about a game mechanism called the \"scratch\" with which the humans can reset their session.\n\nBy executing the Scratch, the kids create a reset version of their universe, in which their places have been swapped with those of their ancestors. As a result, John's grandmother, Jane Crocker, who had died before the story began, is fifteen years old and the protagonist of the new arc. She leads her three friends Roxy Lalonde, Dirk Strider, and Jake English — the mother, brother, and grandfather of Rose, Dave, and Jade, respectively — through their own session of the game, while the original humans and surviving trolls journey to the new session over the course of three years.\n\nUpon uniting in the new session, the kids and trolls enact a plan to finally create a new universe and to defeat Lord English, a purportedly-invincible villain threatening all of reality. Their plan is opposed by the Condesce, the sinister former empress of the trolls now in service to Lord English, as well as the still-dangerous Jack Noir who also escaped from the original doomed session. Matters complicate further as John develops new powers allowing him to retcon previous events within the \"Homestuck\" narrative.\n\nThe plan fails, and only John, Roxy, and one of the trolls, Terezi, survive. Under Terezi's guidance, John retcons key events in the narrative, preventing events leading to the plan's failure from occurring. In the retconned narrative, the kids and trolls defeat the Condesce and Jack Noir and create the new universe. The comic ends with Lord English facing off against an army of ghosts and with the kids and trolls about to enter the newly created universe. Illustrations in the closing credits feature Snapchat stories of the kids in their roles as rulers of a new universe, the last of which involves twenty-year-old John smashing his phone's screen with a hammer in response to a Snapchat from the adolescent Lord English.\n\nThe basic premise of the comic has been described as inspired by games like \"The Sims\", \"Spore\" and \"EarthBound\". As in Hussie's prior webcomic \"Problem Sleuth\", the adventure is characterized by time travel, mystery, a complex fictional universe, and frequent references to pop culture and previous adventures. Changes from previous stories include an emphasis on contemporary society, such as online gaming and Internet culture, which contrasts with the historical settings of \"MS Paint Adventures\" comics \"Bard Quest\" and \"Problem Sleuth\". Additionally, this adventure introduced complex Flash animations and Flash and HTML5 games, many making use of music and assets contributed by other artists. This represented a step-up from previous adventures which exclusively used GIF images for animation.\n\nThe initial style of the webcomic was developed to be advanced by fan contributions, with the fans deciding what actions the characters would take. However, once the fan base had grown significantly by 2010. Hussie moved away from this style because the fan input method had grown \"too unwieldy and made it difficult ... to tell a coherent story.\" While Hussie now controlled the main plot of the story and the characters' actions, he still \"visit[ed] fan blogs and forums\" to figure out small things to add into \"Homestuck\".\n\nHussie first launched an early version of \"Homestuck\", the \"Homestuck\" Beta, on April 10, 2009. The \"Homestuck\" Beta was made using Flash and ran from April 10–12.\n\nAlthough the majority of \"Homestuck\" was posted serially, with pages irregularly added over the course of each day, Hussie decided in 2013 to add the final acts in one update. He named the time period he was taking to finish the story a \"Gigapause\". Hussie explained that he wanted to have the ability to tell the remainder of the story in a nonlinear fashion by writing and illustrating the storyline and then revising the chronology. Various large pauses have happened since.\n\nOn April 13, 2016 — exactly seven years after \"Homestuck\" began — Hussie released the final chapter of the webcomic: a nine-minute-long animated short titled \"[S] ACT 7\". Hussie stated that an epilogue to the webcomic may be released at some point in the future. On October 25, 2016, the comic updated with a credit sequence and more panels in the form of a Snapchat story.\n\nA significant amount of merchandise has been sold through Hussie's shop, company, and record label What Pumpkin, including \"T-shirts, hoodies, pins, books\" and fan art prints. Fans have also been \"recruited\" to make music for the webcomic. The music has been bundled into albums, with ten major soundtrack albums having been released thus far, in addition to eighteen side albums. On April 13, 2014, the fifth anniversary of \"Homestuck\", \"Paradox Space\", an anthology spin-off webcomic, was launched.\n\nEarly in \"Homestuck\", Hussie introduced a webcomic contained within the main story titled \"Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff\". The webcomic, drawn within \"Homestuck\" by character Dave Strider, is intentionally poorly made. The comic strips have become independent of \"Homestuck\": a mockup of the website on which Dave Strider hosts the comic is available on the MSPaintAdventures website. TopatoCo produced a print publication collecting the strips. The press release from TopatoCo described \"Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff\" as \"the worst comic strip ever\".\n\nIn 2017, TopatoCo announced a second \"Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff\" book, co-written by Dril, co-drawn by KC Green, and funded through Kickstarter.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, Hussie announced a Kickstarter to raise funds to develop a \"Homestuck\" video game with a (then-unannounced) game studio (later revealed to be The Odd Gentlemen). Development began in 2013, with the finished product expected in 2014. \"Kotaku\" noted that the project had raised \"more than $275,000 in hours\". More than 80% of the $700,000 goal was pledged in the first day. The game reached the full $700,000 of funding in fewer than 32 hours. The campaign also reached certain \"stretch goal\" amounts, whereupon Hussie added Mac and Linux support onto the proposed game. \"Digital Trends\" writer Graeme McMillan commented that the campaign was approaching, at the time, the record for most successful comics-related Kickstarter campaign, which was previously held by \"The Order of the Stick\" campaign with $1,254,120. The Kickstarter eventually raised $2,485,506, making it the \"fifth game on Kickstarter to pull in a full seven figures\" and the third highest funded video game in Kickstarter history at the time. An additional PayPal-based fundraiser was created to accommodate those who could not donate via Kickstarter's available methods.\n\nThe special contribution items for the campaign included digital and hard copy versions of the game and the game soundtrack, along with \"exclusive sticker sheets and T-shirts, plush dolls of in-series plushes like Senator Lemonsnout and Pyralspite Plushie and primo appearances in the final product.\"\n\nThe size of \"Homestuck\"'s fan community is in the millions, with around a million unique visitors coming to the site daily. At one point, one of \"Homestuck\"'s Flash animations caused Newgrounds to crash when it was uploaded, due to the strain the number of views put on the servers. Actor Dante Basco is noted as a fan of the webcomic, having been urged to read it by friends telling him that the character Rufio, which he played as in the 1991 film \"Hook\", is featured in it. This interest in the webcomic led to a friendship with Andrew Hussie and resulted in the creation of a new character, Rufioh, with Basco's \"typing quirks and personality\".\n\nWhen a temporary hiatus was announced in early July 2012, fans of the webcomic began creating a multitude of fake screenshots of a fictional anime version of \"Homestuck\", with some including subtitles and logos of various Japanese TV channels.\n\nLauren Rae Orsini, in an interview with Andrew Hussie, asked Hussie whether, because of the immense size of \"Homestuck\" and its fandom, with more than 5,000 pages and 128 characters, Hussie considered himself in control of the comic. Hussie responded that he felt \"Homestuck\" was \"still under my control\", but that the background of \"Homestuck\" as a movement \"is not under my control, and never really was.\" Orsini also suggested, in a separate article, that the effort put forward by people who finish \"Homestuck\" is an example of effort justification.\n\n\"Homestuck\" was compared to James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" by PBS' Idea Channel due to the webcomic's length and complexity. Lori Henderson of the \"School Library Journal\" described \"Homestuck\" as being \"mostly black and white with splashes of color and a minimal amount of animation\", but said that it worked for the webcomic, and that because the \"characters are a little goofy-looking and are often shown without arms\", it only \"adds to the charm\". Mordicai Knode of Tor Books explained that \"Homestuck\" has to be discussed separately between what it is as a webcomic and what its plot actually is. Comparing it to hypertext fiction and the genre's attempted use in physical novels like \"Pale Fire\" and \"House of Leaves\", Knode concluded that \"\"Homestuck\" is the first great work of genuinely hypertext fiction. If that puts it in the same breath as \"Ulysses\", then so be it.\"\n\nBryan Lee O'Malley, creator of the graphic novel series \"Scott Pilgrim\", described \"Homestuck\" as a \"massive undertaking of deftly-handled long-term serialized storytelling. It's well-written and thoughtful. It has things to say\".\n\nIn 2011, TopatoCo began publishing Homestuck in book form. Only the first three acts were ultimately published.\nIn October 2017, Andrew Hussie announced that Homestuck would be collaborating with Viz Media to release the entire webcomic in book form.\n\n"}
{"id": "40832263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40832263", "title": "Janet Bennion", "text": "Janet Bennion\n\nJanet Benson Bennion (born October 2, 1964) is Professor of Anthropology at Lyndon State College, Vermont, United States. She specializes in gender dynamics in Mormon fundamentalist communities which practice polygamy. Bennion is one of the world’s leading ethnographers of North American plural marriage. She has raised the question of decriminalization of plural marriage in a variety of radio and television forums and several international scholar venues at Brandeis University and the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.\n\nBorn in Vernon, Utah, Bennion received her B.A. in Anthropology at the Utah State University, an M.A. in Social Organization at Portland State University, and her Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology at the University of Utah. She splits her time between her home in Vermont and a cabin in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana.\n\nIn 1994, Bennion received a Dean’s Scholarship Award for her ethnography, published by Oxford University Press, \"Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny\". At the time of book's publication, Bennion was an assistant professor of anthropology at the Utah Valley University. With her appointment to Lyndon State College, in Northeast Vermont, she received the Vermont Women in Higher Education Scholarship and the Carol E. Moore Merit Award. Most recently, she was recognized as an individual of distinction for her latest comprehensive look at polygamy, \"Polygamy in Primetime\", published in 2012 with Brandeis University Press. The book covers twenty years of ethnographic work, examining the variability within fundamentalist polygamist societies in the Intermountain West.\n\nUntil the last decade, North American polygamy was seriously examined by only a handful of scholars, including Bennion. In her first book, \"Women of Principle\", she recorded the experiences of female converts in the Montana Allredite order, finding that many women are attracted to polygamy because of the socioeconomic support it offers, replacing a rather difficult life in the mainstream where their status as divorcees, single mothers, widows, and \"unmarriageables\" limited their access to good men and the economic and spiritual affirmation that comes from a community of worship. In addition to using polygamy as a tool for marginalized women to marry and improve their social standing, she found that women in some communities hold positions of religious or political power in the community, often exercising considerable independent power. They can raise their children with minimal oversight by their husband, manage their household, and work in the all-important female support networks. Finally, Mormon fundamentalism balances the deprivations and difficulties of the lives of polygamous wives with a promise of an afterlife as queens and priestesses. In \"Desert Patriarchy\", Bennion examines the lives of women in the LeBaron polygamous group, located in northern Mexico, where she finds an interplay of the desert and the unique social traditions and gender dynamics embedded in Anglo patriarchal fundamentalism. Bennion identifies the variability in all four major polygamous movements in the West in her latest volume, \"Polygamy in Primetime\" (2012), finding that some Mormon women experience more individual satisfaction within the dynamics of a polygamous family than they could in any other marital form. \"Polygamy in Primetime\" responds to [polygamy’s] new visibility [in the media] with an overview of the subject that, despite occasional academic language, will appeal to general readers seeking more details than the soap operatics of \"Big Love\" can provide.\n\nIn her early work, she produced the first ethnography of modern-day Mormon polygyny in her masters' thesis. For her dissertation, she explored the factors contributing to female conversion patterns and investigating the intimacies between co-wives in the holy wedding ceremony which bonds women to each other and to one man. She also contributed to several chapters in books. Her examination of the atrocities following the Texas raid on the YFZ Ranch, where 460 children were removed from their homes is found in Cardell Jacobson's anthology and in her Mellen book. Her analysis of O'Dea's shortcomings in evaluating the experiences of women can be found in another of Cardell Jacobson's works. Bennion also evaluating the factors causing sexual molestation among Mormon polygynists in an Oxford work.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7807770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7807770", "title": "Kiehl's", "text": "Kiehl's\n\nKiehl's LLC is an American cosmetics brand retailer that specializes in premium skin, hair, and body care products. It started as a single pharmacy in Manhattan at Third Avenue and East 13th Street in 1851. Kiehl's was purchased by the L'Oréal Group in 2000 and currently has more than 250 retail stores worldwide, and over 1,000 points of sale supplemented by sales in high-end department stores, select airport locations, as well as independent stockists. In contrast to its market competitors, Kiehl's is distinguished for its unorthodox marketing approach, exceptionally large male clientele base, and its products' simple and straightforward packaging .\n\nFounded in 1851 by John Kiehl, Kiehl's began as a homeopathic pharmacy located at 3rd Avenue and 13th Street in the East Village of New York City. In 1921, Irving Morse, a former apprentice and Russian Jewish émigré who had studied pharmacology at Columbia University, purchased the store. Morse was involved in the development of many Kiehl's products that are still popular today, including Blue Astringent Herbal Lotion and Creme de Corps.\n\nIrving's son, Aaron Morse, who also studied pharmacology at Columbia University and was a former World War II pilot, took over the store in the 1960s. The younger Morse was credited for propelling Kiehl's from obscurity in the 1950s to international recognition as an upscale natural cosmetics shop in the 1980s. Aaron transitioned the store from the traditional pharmaceuticals his father preferred to develop skin care lines. After he died in 1995, his desk and some of his vintage motorcycles were prominently showcased in the store.\n\nBy then, Aaron's daughter, Jami Morse Heidegger, had been operating the business since 1988. Described as \"a clever marketer,\" she relied on word of mouth and extensive free samples and gifts to market Kiehl's products, rather than traditional advertising.\n\nIn April 2000, the French beauty and cosmetics company L'Oréal acquired Kiehl's for between $100–$150 million. L'Oréal had pursued the purchase of the company for more than two years but the real catalyst for a deal came when Kiehl's had difficulty handling the growing volume of orders due to the company's growing popularity. Morse Heidegger, then president of Kiehl's, said, \"We took a long hard look at the situation, and we felt that in order to keep up with the demand, in order to not be out of stock, in order to fulfill our destiny, if you will, we needed to take on a partner.\"\n\nWith the purchase, L'Oréal stated it planned \"to increase the brand's presence but maintain it as a luxury line rather than a mass-market one.\" Kiehl's would also be expanded internationally. At the same time, Kiehl's newly appointed president Michelle Taylor said, \"The thing most important to me is to keep Kiehl's true to what it is. Respect for old-fashioned values is really who we are.\"\n\nFor the first 150 years of the company, Kiehl's only ran one store with its products also selling in high-end department stores such as Neiman Marcus, Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Harvey Nichols. Following its acquisition by L'Oréal though, the company expanded from its one Manhattan flagship store to more than 30 stores today. Kiehl's sales have also more than quadrupled, increasing from $40 million in 2000 to past $200 million in 2009.\n\nKiehl's original store, located at 3rd Avenue and 13th Street in the East Village of Manhattan, occupies the same space as when it was founded in 1851. The site of Kiehl's location is known as \"Pear Tree Corner\" for the pear tree Peter Stuyvesant, governor of the Dutch colony New Amsterdam, planted there in 1647. A wagon collision felled the tree in 1867; it was then known as \"the oldest living thing in the city of New York.\" In November 2003, Kiehl's initiated the replanting of a new pear tree in its spot. Today, the store has evolved into a neighborhood institution; \"Frommer's\" 2010 New York City travel guide states \"Kiehl's is more than a store, it's a virtual cult.\" Distinguishing features of the store include its window display of vintage druggist relics, and the collection of classic Harley-Davidson and Indian motorcycles housed within its doors.\n\nCompared to its competitors, Kiehl's states that it spends three to five more times on its upscale natural cosmetic products. At the same time, Kiehl's merchandise is \"priced at the lower end of prestige skin care\" while being distinguished for its simple and straightforward packing \"which speaks to the old apothecary concept.\" To this day, Kiehl's signature products, such as its night cream, calendula toner, Facial Fuel Blue Astringent, Creme de Corps and Original Musk Oil, continue to remain customer favorites.\n\nTo market its products, Kiehl's applies a non-traditional marketing approach that \"relies heavily on free product samples, word of mouth endorsements from existing customers, and innovative marketing techniques.\" Particularly known for its generous sampling policy, \"Kiehl's gave away more than 12 million samples a year, which represents 80 percent of their total marketing budget\" according to Lynn Upshaw in \"Truth: The New Rules for Marketing in a Skeptical World\". Upshaw writes, \"The Kiehl's way of 'selling' is not to sell at all… They believe the products will do what they do and no hype will change that.\" Donations, most prominently in charity event gift bags, also attract customers.\n\nOn a local store level, Kiehl's works to understand each new location and develop a unique approach for that market. For example, for the opening a new store in New York's Upper West Side, Kiehl's supported improvements to a local playground in Central Park, a hot community topic at the time. Within the stores, Kiehl's is known for its focus on customer service and its \"retail brand experience.\" Their lab-coated staff undergoes an \"intensive four-week residency schooling that drills them in the chemistry, use and application of Kiehl's products.\"\n\nAllan Mottus, the editor of the cosmetics industry magazine \"The Informationist\", stated, \"The Kiehl's store always attracted a cutting-edge younger-crowd.\" Compared to other cosmetics stores, Kiehl's is also known for appealing to an exceptionally large male clientele, which represents 30 to 40 percent of the company's customer base. In cities like New York and Los Angeles, nearly half of all customers are men. According to Wendy Liebmann, chief executive of New York research firm WSL Strategic Retail, \"Kiehl's changes the paradigm with a health and wellness approach that demystifies cosmetics. There's no intimidating hocus-pocus. It feels authentic and fun.\"\n\nKiehl's is recognized for its philanthropic activities. More than 40 years ago, Aaron Morse wrote the \"Mission of Kiehl's,\" a 137-word statement which committed the company to the objective of \"making for better citizens, better firms, and better communities.\" Today, the cosmetics retailer is focused on three primary philanthropic causes: AIDS research and prevention, children's well-being and the environment. Kiehl's stores have also begun to regularly host pet adoption events. In August 2010, the company launched its inaugural \"Kiehl's Liferide for amfAR\" (The Foundation for AIDS Research). At the end of the six-day charitable motorcycle ride up the coast of California, Chris Salgardo, the President of Kiehl's USA who led the group on his own Harley-Davidson, presented an $85,000 check to amfAR.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "217494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217494", "title": "Land of the Free (anthem)", "text": "Land of the Free (anthem)\n\n\"Land of the Free\" is the national anthem of Belize. The words were written by Samuel Alfred Haynes and the music by Selwyn Walford Young in 1963. It was officially adopted in 1981.\n\nChorus:\n\nHaynes participated in World War I as part of the colonial effort for Great Britain and encountered much abuse and ridicule along with his fellow workers. On his return to Belize he became a part of workers' movements in Belize and is readily identified with the 1919 Ex-Servicemen's Riot that began on 22 July. After that riot was suppressed, Haynes began organising Belize's branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and facilitated the visit of its head Marcus Garvey of Jamaica. Garvey recruited Haynes to work with him in the U.S., a move that rendered the UNIA in Belize leaderless for much of the 1920s and that indirectly contributed to the Isaiah Morter controversy. Haynes most likely wrote the anthem as an answer to colonialism's stifling of Belizeans' identity. The lofty language and uplifting lyrics referenced Belize's former status as a slave society indebted to profits from forestry, cleverly linking it to the end of Belize's colonial period, a process that culminated on 21 September 1981. The song was originally titled \"Land of the Gods\", a salute to the proliferation of organised religion in Belize.\n\nWith the arrival of the nationalist movement led by the People's United Party, the search was on for new symbols of Belizean identity. The PUP had defied the colonial order by singing \"God Bless America\" instead of the royal anthem \"God Save the King\" (or Queen). At independence, the ruling PUP named \"Land of the Free\" Belize's official anthem and played it at emotional independence ceremonies on 21 September. Most Belizeans agreed with the choice but lamented that it had not been put to a vote of Belizean residents.\n\nThe anthem has come under fire from critics who charge that its language is archaic and does not appeal to a new generation of Belizeans who are in any case too young to remember Samuel Haynes.\n\nSome have argued that the anthem is too male-centric. Lyrics such as \"Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty\" suggest the song was originally intended to be sung only by men. \"Amandala\" correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that \"manhood\" be replaced by \"honour\" so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women. It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men. A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked how important it was to include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered \"most important\", 19.7% answered \"somewhat important\", and 63.4% answered \"not very important\".\n\nNationalist writers have argued that the anthem's references to the Baymen ignore the multi-cultural diversity of Belize today and have proposed a number of replacements. The most recent complaint of this nature was leveled by Maya-Mestizo-born correspondent Clinton Luna, who suggested that the phrase \"sons of the Belizean soil\" should replace \"sons of the Baymen's clan\" in the chorus in recent issues of the \"Amandala\" weekly newspaper. The newspaper itself has previously argued to the same effect. However, \"Amandala\" contributor Henry Gordon countered in a later issue that nothing in the anthem represents any sort of bias to any ethnic group in Belize.\n\nBelizeans speak a wide range of languages including English, Spanish, three different Mayan dialects, as well as native languages spoken by its diverse Chinese-speaking people, Garinagu, East Indian population, Mennonite community. The anthem, in formal English, has been memorised by generations of children, but not necessarily understood. Because Kriol is the language that binds all Belizeans together, regardless of the origin of their first language, Leela Vernon translated the song into Kriol in 2011 with the hope that the meaning behind the words would be better understood.\n\n\n"}

As of July 2018, twenty-two properties have been inscribed on the World Heritage List: seventeen cultural sites and four natural sites. A further eight sites and one site extension have been submitted for future inscription and are currently on the Tentative List as of 2017.\n\nThe Tentative List consists of sites previously nominated, but not yet inscribed.\nAs in other countries, several World Heritage sites in Japan have been marked by controversy. The Hashima (Gunkanjima/Battleship Island) former coal mine has been the subject of the most controversy because of the Japanese government's refusal to acknowledge its wartime history of forced labor by Korean and Chinese prisoners. Recent academic research has questioned the Japanese government's compliance with UNESCO regulations and requirements with respect to the Hashima site. In 2005, UNESCO designated Shiretoko a World Heritage Site, advising to develop the property jointly with the Kuril Islands of Russia as a transboundary \"World Heritage Peace Park\". However, Shiretoko's listing as Natural Heritage was seen by the Indigenous Ainu as contradicting the long history of Ainu settlement in the park area..Controversies over the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region have also been widely discussed. After two professors at the Mt. Fuji World Heritage Centre, Shizuoka were controversially forced to quit their jobs due to academic and racial harassment by officials of Shizuoka prefecture government in March 2018, comments on social media called for the cancellation of Mt. Fuji's World Heritage inscription.。\n\n\n"}

It is a subset and an art historical term in the context of the more established kinetic art, which in turn is a subset of new media art. The historian of art Frank Popper views the evolution of this type of art as evidence of \"aesthetic preoccupations linked with technological advancement\" and a starting-point in the context of high-technology art. László Moholy-Nagy (1895–1946), a member of the Bauhaus, and influenced by constructivism can be regarded as one of the fathers of Lumino kinetic art. Light sculpture and moving sculpture are the components of his \"Light-Space Modulator\" (1922–30), One of the first Light art pieces which also combines kinetic art.\n\nThe origins of the term itself are multiple. There was an early cybernetic artist, Nicolas Schöffer, who developed walls of light, prisms, and video circuits under the term in the 50s. Artist/engineer Frank Malina came up with the Lumidyne system of lighting (CITE), and his work \"Tableaux mobiles\" (moving paintings) is an example of Lumino Kinetic art of that period. Later, artist Nino Calos worked with the term \"Limino-kinetic paintings. (CITE). Artist György Kepes was also experimenting with lumino-kinetic works. Ellis D Fogg is also associated with the term as a \"lumino kinetic sculptor\".\nIn the 1960s various exhibits involved Lumino Kinetic art, inter alia \"Kunst-Licht-Kunst\" at the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven in 1966, and \"Lumière et mouvement\" at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1967.\n\nLumino Kinetic art was also aligned with Op art in the late 60s because the moving lights were spectacular and psychedelic.\n\nFrank Popper views it as an art historical term in the context of kinetic art; he states that \"there is no lumino kinetic art after the early 70s; it stands as a precursor to other contemporary cybernetic, robotic, new media-based arts, and is limited to a very small number of (male) European avant-garde artists (part of the New Tendencies movement)\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The magazine is published by the Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso and is based in Rome. Its editor is Paolo Flores d'Arcais.\n\nDuring the first years, the magazine had a subtitle: \"le ragioni della sinistra\" (\"the reasons of the Left\"). Later this subtitle was removed. Each number has now a different title, inspired by a discussion theme.\n\nGiven its format, which includes long essays and articles, the journal tends to cater to an intellectual elite. Journalist Marco Travaglio is one of its better known contributors. Many philosophers, social scientists and men and women of science and other leading figures have written on this paper, including Massimo Cacciari, Joseph Ratzinger, Bruno Forte, Michele Santoro, Gianni Vattimo, Leszek Kołakowski, Marcel Gauchet, Margherita Hack and Walter Veltroni.\n\nThe magazine was issued monthly from 20 February to 20 April 2006, then weekly (over an eight-week period) during the 2006 Italian political campaign.

A number of surveys over the years have found that majorities of Muslims oppose attacks against civilians, and some have found greater support in specific countries and situations.\n\nIn the article \"Why are there no condemnations from Muslim sources against terrorists?\" Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance summarizes:\n\nSome Muslims have spoken out against 9/11.\n\nA 2007 Pew Research Center study of several nations throughout the Muslim world showed that opposition to suicide bombing in the Muslim world is increasing, with a majority of Muslims surveyed in 10 out of the 16 of the countries responding that suicide bombings and other violence against civilians is \"never\" justified, though an average of 38% believe it is justified at least rarely. Opposition to Hamas was the majority opinion in only 4 out of the 16 countries surveyed, as was opposition to Hezbollah. The Pew Research Study did not include Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria in the survey, although densely populated Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh were included.\n\nA YouGov survey for the Daily Telegraph, published two weeks after the July 2005 bombings in the London Underground, showed that 88% of British Muslims were opposed to the bombings, while 6% (about 100,000 individuals) fully supported them, and one British Muslim in four expressed some sympathy with the motives of the bombers. A 2007 poll found that one Muslim in four thought the Government had staged the bombings and framed the Muslims convicted. A 2011 study by Pew Research showed that 64% of Muslim Americans thought that there was not much or no support among them for extremism, while 6% thought there was a great deal, and 15% thought there was a fair amount. A 2015 survey showed that most Muslims in many Muslim-majority countries view the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria unfavorably; these views were especially common in Jordan and Lebanon. In Pakistan, 62% of Muslims polled offered no opinion on ISIS. The same survey showed that most Muslims consider violence against nonbelievers to be \"rarely or never justified.\"\n\nIn 2010 Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri issued the Fatwa on Terrorism, endorsed by Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nIn 2008 the 9 killed Mumbai militants who perpetrated the 2008 Mumbai attacks were refused an Islamic burial by influential Muslim Jama Masjid Trust who stated 'People who committed this heinous crime cannot be called Muslim'.\n\nThe bombing attempt on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was condemned by Muslim groups. In Canada, a group of Canadian and U.S. Islamic leaders issued a fatwa, or religious edict, condemning any attacks by extremists or terrorists on the United States or Canada and declaring that an attack by extremists on the two countries would constitute an attack on Muslims living in North America. \"In our view, these attacks are evil, and Islam requires Muslims to stand up against this evil,\" said the fatwa signed by the 20 imams associated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada. It concludes that Muslims \"must expose any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, who would cause harm to fellow Canadians or Americans\". One of the imams was reported saying: \"it is religious obligation upon Muslims, based upon the Qur'anic teachings, that we have to be loyal to the country where we live\". The fatwa also indicated that religious leaders have a duty to show others around the world that Muslims in Canada and the U.S. \"have complete freedom to practice Islam\" and that \"any attack on Canada and the United States is an attack on the freedom of Canadian and American Muslims.\"\n\nAs gesture of solidarity with the country's Coptic Christian minority, Egyptian Muslims showed up at churches on the eve of the Coptic Christmas on 6 January 2011 during mass service forming a \"human shield\" against any possible further attacks. \nIn the days before the mass, Muslims and Copts joined together in a show of solidarity that included street protests, rallies, and widespread Facebook unity campaigns calling for an \"Egypt for All\". In Lebanon, separate condemnations came from the Sunni Mufti of the Republic Mohammad Qabbani and Deputy Head of the Shiite Supreme Council Abdul Amir Qabalan. Hamas has also condemned the bombing in Alexandria, assigning the blame to hidden hands that do not wish well for Egypt and its Muslim and Christian people and seek to inflame sectarian strife. Hamas in its statement sent condolences to Egypt and the victims' families, and hoped that facts would be disclosed the soonest and that those responsible would be brought to justice.\n\nIn response to the attacks, Amr Khaled, an influential Egyptian Muslim preacher, launched a campaign to fight sectarian incitement made on the internet, which he believed to be a cause of the violence witnessed on New Year's Eve.\n\nIn November 2010, thousands of Yemeni tribesmen vowed to back the government's efforts in its battles against Al-Qaeda and promised to fight alongside the troops. Chieftain Naji bin Abdul-Aziz al-Shaif of the northern powerful Bakeel tribe and the organizer of the rally stated: \"We will fight against al-Qaida group as it harmed the reputation of the country, Yemeni tribes and Muslims...We expressed our sorrow to all countries and people who were harmed by al-Qaida and we demanded President Ali Abdullah Saleh to handle the situation and we will stand by him.\"\n\nIranian Ayatollah Ozma Seyyed Yousef Sanei issued a fatwa (ruling) that suicide attacks against civilians are legitimate only in the context of war.\n\nAbdelrahman al-Rashid, a Muslim and the managing director of Arab news channel Al-Arabiya, stated that \"It is a certain fact that not all Muslims are terrorists, but it is equally certain, and exceptionally painful, that almost all terrorists are Muslims\" and blamed radical clerics for hijacking the peace-loving and tolerant religion of Islam. Statistics compiled by the United States government's Counterterrorism Center present a more complicated picture. 21% of fatalities of known and specified terrorist incidents in 2006 were attributed to Islamic extremists. A majority of over-all incidents were considered of either \"unknown/unspecified\" or a secular political nature. The vast majority of the \"unknown/unspecified\" terrorism fatalities did however happen in Islamic regions such as Iraq, Afghanistan and India.\n\nAccording to the \"Country Reports on Terrorism 2011\" published in 2012 by the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), \"Sunni extremists accounted for the greatest number of terrorist attacks and fatalities for the third consecutive year. More than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists, accounting for nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent of all fatalities.\" The report said that in 2011, a total of 10,283 terrorism attacks across the world killed 12,533 people. Terrorism was also blamed for 25,903 injuries and 5,554 kidnappings. According to the NCTC, of the 12,533 terrorism-related deaths worldwide, 8,886 were perpetrated by \"Sunni extremists\", 1,926 by \"secular/political/anarchist\" groups, 1,519 by \"unknown\" factions, 170 by a category described as \"other\", and 77 by \"Neo-Nazi/Fascist/White Supremacist\" groups.\n\nUpon Osama bin Laden's death, some Muslims in the UK came out on the streets in support of bin Laden, praising him as an Islamic hero and condemned the role of the US and the West in killing him. The protest was organised by the activist Anjem Choudary, who earlier praised both 7/7 and the September 11 attacks, and was later jailed for his support of ISIS.\n\nA Gallup poll published in 2011, \"suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians.\" The results of the survey suggested that \"human development and governance - not piety or culture\" were the strongest factors in explaining the public's view of violence toward civilians. In a Gallup World Poll in 2011, residents of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states were less likely to justify the targeting and killing of civilians than residents of non-OIC states:\n\n\nIn a regional breakdown, Gallup found that North Americans were most likely to justify military attacks on civilians, while residents of the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region were most likely to oppose them. When asked about whether it is justifiable for the military to target and kill civilians:\n\n\nIn another 2011 Gallup poll, they surveyed Americans, and found that Muslim Americans were less likely to justify the targeting and killing of civilians than other Americans.\n\nJohn Esposito, using poll data from Gallup, wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians. He also found that those Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not. A later 2011 Gallup World Poll found that, in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, \"those who reject military and individual attacks on civilians are more likely to say religion is an important part of their daily lives.\"\n\nAccording to an ICM Research poll in 2006, 20% of British Muslims felt sympathy with the July 7 terrorist bombers' \"feelings and motives\", although 99 per cent thought the bombers were wrong to carry out the attack. In another poll by NOP Research in 2006, almost one in four British Muslims believe that the 7/7 attacks on London were justified.\n\nIn a Pew Research study from 2006, at least 1 in 4 respondents in the Muslim nations surveyed, except Turkey, had at least some confidence in Bin Laden. Confidence in Bin Laden was 16% or less among Muslims in the four European nations surveyed.\n\nIn a 2007 Pew Research poll in response to a question on whether suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian targets to defend Islam could be justified,\nin Europe:\nIn mainly Muslim countries:\n\nA 2010 Zogby poll reported that 69% of American Muslims supported stronger laws to fight terrorism.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Center poll asked Muslims around the world whether attacks on civilians were justified. Globally 72% of Muslims said violence against civilians is never justified, and in the US, 81% of Muslims opposed such violence. About 14% of Muslims in the nations surveyed (and 8% of Muslims in the US) said violence against civilians is \"often\" or \"sometimes\" justified. 26% of Muslims in Bangladesh believe attacks are either somewhat justified or often justified, 18% in Malaysia, 7% in Iraq, 15% in Jordan, 29% in Egypt, 39% in Afghanistan and 40% in the Palestinian territories. The survey did not include some Muslim nations, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, but did include densely populated Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and Indonesia.\nAccording to a 2007 poll conducted by the PolicyExchange think tank in Britain, nearly 60% said they would prefer to live under British law, while 37% of 16- to 24-year-olds said they would prefer sharia law, against 17% of those over 55. Also 36% of 16- to 24-year-olds British Muslims believed that those converting to another religion should be executed. Less than a fifth of those over 55 think so.\n\nIn 2004, a year after the invasion of Iraq, Pew Research Center survey found that suicide bombings against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq were seen as \"justifiable\" by many Jordanians (70%), Pakistanis (46%), and Turks (31%). At the same time, the survey found that support for the U.S.-led War on Terror had increased.\n\nA 2005 Pew Research study, that involved 17,000 people in 17 countries showed support for terrorism was declining in the Muslim world along with a growing belief that Islamic extremism represents a threat to those countries. A 2005 \"Daily Telegraph\" survey showed that 88% of Muslims said the July 2005 bombings in the London Underground were unjustified, while 6% disagreed. However it also found that 24% of British Muslims showed some sympathy with the people who carried out the attacks.\n\nPolls taken by Saudi owned Al Arabiya and Gallup suggested moderate support for the September 11 terrorist attacks within the Arab world, with 36% of Arabs polled by Al Arabiya saying the 9/11 attacks were morally justified, 38% disagreeing and 26% of those polled being unsure. A 2008 study, produced by Gallup, found similar results with 38.6% of Muslims questioned believing the 9/11 attacks were justified. Another poll conducted, in 2005 by the Fafo Foundation in the Palestinian Authority, found that 65% of respondents supported the September 11 attacks.\n\nMichael Scott Doran wrote in the journal \"Foreign Affairs\" that Islam seemed to be polarised between pro-Western and pro-jihadi mentalities, enabling a clear divide between opponents and proponents of violent action. The International Crisis Group wrote in their 2005 report \"Understanding Islamism\" that Islamic ideological and political spectrums were far more diverse than this idea suggests. American policy is unpopular among some Muslims, the report argued, yet this hostility did not directly translate to support for or participation in global jihad, and for political Islamists who support non-violent measures it could not be assumed that they are in agreement with Western agendas. Researchers have studied the condemnation of terrorism by European Muslim representatives, committees, and umbrella organizations, but also the everyday resistance to violent extremism in various Muslim communities.\n\n"}

His father, the village mukhtar, or headman, fled with his family and the other villagers, on the creation of the Israeli state in the spring of that year. The Sirhan family went to the Dehaisha Refugee Camp, set up in fields south of Bethlehem. Omar’s father rented a home and Omar continues to lease the same stone house.\n\nOmar attended Damascus University and became involved in student politics. It was at University that he met Khamis Zeydan, a young Palestinian nationalist and a refugee from the coastal town of Jaffa, who later became police chief in Bethlehem. Omar’s adherence to the Pan-Arab Ba'ath Party earned him the suspicion of the Jordanian regime. In early 1967 Omar was arrested by Jordanian police in Bethlehem and accused of murder. Omar later said the charges were false and that he had been jailed by political opponents eager to smear him (\"A Grave in Gaza\", Soho Crime, New York, February 2008).\n\nWhile traveling home at the end of the university semester in 1968, Omar met Maryam Hassan. Maryam was an educated young woman from a prominent family in the village of Mash’had outside Nazareth. She had relatives in the Bethlehem area and was on her way to visit them, when she encountered Omar in a taxi near the West Bank town of Jenin. They were married the following year.\n\nOn his return from university, Omar abandoned politics in favor of a quiet career as a history teacher. He taught at the school run by the Freres of St. John de la Salle in Bethlehem until the early 1990s. The school’s pupils were drawn from the local Muslim and Christian populations. He was forced out of the school after a confrontation with a local schools inspector who considered Omar too critical of the new Palestinian Authority. Omar took a job at the United Nations Relief and Works Basic School for Girls in Dehaisha camp. The job was a step down in prestige from the Freres School, but it drew Omar into closer contact with the poorest refugees of Bethlehem and alerted him to their sufferings. Eventually this led him to reject the quiet life he had led and to attempt to confront the corruption and violence that engulfed his town.\n\nOmar and Maryam have three sons. Ramiz, the eldest, runs a cellphone business in Bethlehem. He’s married to Sara and has three children, Nadia (Omar’s favorite grandchild), Little Omar, and Reem. Omar’s second son, Zuheir, lives in Britain, where he teaches Islamic history at the University of Wales. The youngest son, Ala, is a computer salesman in New York.\n\nSince his student days, Omar had been a heavy drinker and a compulsive smoker. Health problems in his mid-forties forced him to quit both. He continues to be in poor health, however, with shaking hands and arthritic joints.\n\n\nThe Collaborator of Bethlehem (Soho Crime, New York 2007) \n\nLe collaborateur de Bethléem (Albin Michel, Paris 2007) \n\nIl Maestro di Betlemme (Cairo, Milano 2007) \n\nThe Bethlehem Murders (Atlantic, London 2007) \n\nThe first of the Omar Yussef Mysteries is \"The Collaborator of Bethlehem\" (published in the UK as \"The Bethlehem Murders\"), which was published in English in 2007.\n\nIt was published in the U.S. by Soho Press, in hardback in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth by Atlantic Books and elsewhere. The New York Times called \"The Collaborator of Bethlehem\", the first of the Omar Yussef books, “an astonishing first novel.” The Independent (London) hailed Omar as “the next big sleuth in crime fiction.” Le Figaro called the book “a masterpiece.” The books have sold in 14 different countries and 12 different languages.\n\nThe second Omar Yussef novel is \"A Grave in Gaza\" (published in the UK as \"The Saladin Murders\" by Atlantic Books in January 2008).\n\nThe third, The Samaritan's Secret, a set in Nablus, was published in the UK by Atlantic Books and in the US by SoHo Press in February 2009.\n\nAs of 2009, one or more of the novels had been published in 22 countries, and translations were available in languages including French, German, Italian and Indonesian.\n\n"}

It is believed to have been pre-built in the 1890s in France and was destined to be placed in Madagascar via boat. Instead, the building ended-up in Angola's Skeleton Coast after the ship carrying it was drifted by the notorious Benguela currents. Portuguese rulers of the colony then claimed the ship along with all its contents, including the palace.\n\nDuring the Portuguese era, the building had a great deal of prestige and it was used as an art center. But after the independence of Angola, the palace was left in neglect with its surrounding area eventually ending up as a parking lot. It was also heavily damaged during the Angolan Civil War leaving some of its structures in a rusted and rotting condition.\n\nCurrently, the building is undergoing a renovation funded by profits from Angola's oil boom with the help of Brazilian construction companies, as many of the reclaimed iron balustrades and floor tiles were individually renovated in Rio de Janeiro.

{"id": "11347455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11347455", "title": "Phenomenography", "text": "Phenomenography\n\nPhenomenography is a qualitative research methodology, within the interpretivist paradigm, that investigates the qualitatively different ways in which people experience something or think about something. It is an approach to educational research which appeared in publications in the early 1980s. It initially emerged from an empirical rather than a theoretical or philosophical basis.\n\nWhile being an established methodological approach in education for several decades, phenomenography has now been applied rather extensively in a range of diverse disciplines such as environmental management, computer programming, workplace competence, and internationalization practices. \nPhenomenography's ontological assumptions are subjectivist: the world exists and different people construct it in different ways and from a non-dualist viewpoint (viz., there is only one world, one that is ours, and one that people experience in many different ways). Phenomenography's research object has the character of knowledge; therefore its ontological assumptions are also epistemological assumptions.\n\nIts emphasis is on description. Its data collection methods typically include close interviews with a small, purposive sample of subjects, with the researcher \"working toward an articulation of the interviewee’s reflections on experience that is as complete as possible\". Description is important because our knowledge of the world is a matter of meaning and of the qualitative similarities and differences in meaning as it is experienced by different people.\n\nA phenomenographic data analysis sorts perceptions which emerge from the data collected into specific \"categories of description.\" The set of these categories is sometimes referred to as an \"outcome space.\" These categories (and the underlying structure) become the phenomenographic essence of the phenomenon. They are the primary outcomes and are the most important result of phenomenographic research. Phenomenographic categories are logically related to one another, typically by way of hierarchically inclusive relationships, although linear and branched relationships can also occur. That which varies between different categories of description is known as the \"dimensions of variation.\"\n\nThe process of phenomenographic analysis is strongly iterative and comparative. It involves continual sorting and resorting of data and ongoing comparisons between the data and the developing categories of description, as well as between the categories themselves.\n\nA phenomenographic analysis seeks a \"description, analysis, and understanding of . . . experiences\". The focus is on variation: variation in both the perceptions of the phenomenon, as experienced by the actor, and in the \"ways of seeing something\" as experienced and described by the researcher. This is described as phenomenography's \"theory of variation.\" Phenomenography allows researchers to use their own experiences as data for phenomenographic analysis; it aims for a collective analysis of individual experiences.\n\nPhenomenographic studies usually involve contextual groups of people and data collection involves individual description of understanding, often through interview. Analysis is whole group orientated since all data is analysed together with the aim of identifying possible conceptions of experience related to the phenomenon under investigation, rather than individual experiences. There is emphasis on detailed analysis of description which follows from an assumption that conceptions are formed from both the results of human action and from the conditions for it. Clarification of understanding and experience depends upon the meaning of the conceptions themselves. The object of phenomenographic study is not the phenomenon per se but the relationship between the actors and the phenomenon.\n\nPhenomenography is not phenomenology. Phenomenographers, on the other hand, adopt an empirical orientation and they investigate the experiences of others. The focus of interpretive phenomenology is upon the essence of the phenomenon, whereas the focus of phenomenography is upon the essence of the experiences and the subsequent perceptions of the phenomenon.\n\n"}

Typically quibbles are used in legal bargains and, in fantasy, magically enforced ones. When used in a real life argument, it is termed a Loki's Wager.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare used a quibble in \"The Merchant of Venice\". Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh, but no blood, and therefore Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood, which is not physically possible.\n\nA pact with the Devil commonly contains clauses that allow the devil to quibble over what he grants, and equally commonly, the maker of the pact finds a quibble to escape the bargain.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Loki, having bet his head with Brokk and lost, forbids Brokk to take any part of his neck, saying he had not bet it; to avenge himself Brokk instead sews Loki's lips shut.\n\nThe Savoy Operas by Gilbert and Sullivan frequently feature quibbles; W. S. Gilbert had read law and had practised briefly as a barrister, and regarded the minor technicalities of the law that typically gave rise to quibbles to be highly characteristic of the legalistic Victorian British society satirized in his works. For instance, in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", Frederick's terms of indenture bind him to the pirates until his twenty-first birthday; the pirates point out that he was born on February 29 (a leap year) and will not have his twenty-first birthday until he is eighty-four, and so compel him to rejoin them.\n\nWhen the hero of the Child ballad \"The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward\" is forced to trade places with an impostor and swear never to reveal the truth to anyone, he tells his story to a horse while he knows that the heroine is eavesdropping. In the similar fairy tale \"The Goose Girl\", the princess pours out her story to an iron stove, but not knowing that the king is listening.\n\nIn Piers Anthony's fantasy world Xanth, the law forbids reigning queens, thereby excluding a Sorceress from ruling. But when in \"Night Mare\" one Magician after another falls to an invasion's hostile magic and it appears that no more Magicians exist to take the throne, the last Magician king observes that although the law forbids reigning queens, it nowhere states that the post of king is reserved to males. Hence, several Sorceresses reign as King.\n\nQuibbles are the theme of \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"The Man in the Bottle\". A genie freed from a bottle grants a couple four wishes, warning that every wish has consequences. One of the man's wishes is to be in a position of great power, the leader of a modern and powerful country who cannot be voted out of office. The genie turns him into Adolf Hitler during his final days in World War II.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"\", Captain Sisko is ordered to evacuate the titular station against his better judgment. However, he notices that his superiors did not specify the extent of the evacuation, so he orders a complete evacuation of all their equipment, which will take far longer and necessitate some officers staying on the station in the face of an impending siege, giving them a chance to fight back. Likewise, \"\", Sisko is forbidden to tell the Cardassians about an imminent invasion of their empire by the Klingons. However, if the Klingons take Cardassia, the Federation and Bajor will be put at risk, so he calls in the station's resident Cardassian tailor/spy to measure him for a suit while he discusses the imminent invasion with his senior officers.\n\nIn \"The Shadow Thieves\", by Anne Ursu, Hades, attempting to banish the traitorous Philonecron, uses the words \"You may never set foot in the Kingdom of the Dead again.\" Philonecron later gets around Hades's binding proclamation by having servants carry him into the Underworld.\n\nIn the 2002 film \"Spider-Man\", Peter Parker faces professional wrestler Bonesaw McGraw after seeing a newspaper advertisement specifying \"$3000 for 3 minutes in the ring.\" Though Parker wins the match in two minutes, the promotion's crooked promoter only pays him $100 citing that since Parker did not last three minutes in the ring, Parker did not fulfil the required conditions and was therefore unable to receive the full $3000.\n\nIn 2003’s \"\", the main antagonist Hector Barbossa demonstrates this multiple times throughout the film. The most notable instance is mid-way through the film, where the main protagonists are forced to walk the plank despite Barbossa agreeing to set them free. Barbossa explains this by clarifying that Will Turner “failed to specify when or where”.\n\nIn \"A Game of Thrones\", drawing a sword or spilling blood is forbidden in the city of Vaes Dothrak. However, killing someone is not explicitly forbidden. This is evident when Khal Drogo melts some of his gold medallions, has his men restrain Viserys, and pours the molten gold on him, killing him without drawing a sword or spilling blood.\nV\nIn \"Mark of Athena\", a group of Eidolons are forced to swear to never possess the protagonists. Instead, they possess other people and objects nearby to trap three of them.\n\nWhen Croesus consulted the Pythia, he was told that going to war with Cyrus the Great would destroy a great empire. Croesus assumed that the seer meant that the Persian Empire would be destroyed and Croesus would triumph. He proceeded to attack the Persians, believing victory was assured. In the end, however, the Persians were victorious, and the empire destroyed was not Cyrus's but Croesus's.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", Macbeth believes that he is invincible because the Three Witches give him the prophecy that \"none of woman born shall harm [him].\" In the final battle of the play, Macduff is able to kill Macbeth, because Macduff reveals that he was \"from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd\" — born via a Caesarean section. In a second prophecy, Macbeth is told that he has nothing to fear until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. He feels safe since he knows that forests cannot move, but is overcome when the English army, shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, advances on his stronghold at Dunsinane.\n\nIn \"The Lord of the Rings\", the Elf Glorfindel's prophecy states that \"not by the hand of man will the Witch-king of Angmar fall.\" The Witch-king is slain by Éowyn, a woman, during the battle of the Pelennor Fields. She is aided by Merry, a male hobbit who distracted him by stabbing him with a Numenorean blade, as the Ring Wraiths are harmed by such swords.\n\nIn \"Ruddigore\", the baronets are cursed to die if they do not commit a horrible crime every day, but failing to commit such a crime is committing suicide, a horrible crime (a realization that brings them all back to life).\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's \"Moving Pictures\", a book is said to inflict terrible fates on any man opening it, but causes only mild annoyance to the Librarian, who is in fact an orangutan.\n\nIn \"The Return of Jafar\", the sequel to Disney's film \"Aladdin\", the main villain Jafar, after becoming a genie, is unable to use his powers to directly kill living beings. However, he is able to use his powers to create situations that \"could\" kill or harm his enemies, including possibly torture as Jafar darkly suggests, \"you would be surprised what you can live through.\" Jafar also frames Aladdin for the death of the Sultan and even impersonates Princess Jasmine ordering his execution by proxy.\n\nJack Sparrow (from the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies) promised to be Davy Jones' slave for 100 years in exchange for receiving the \"Black Pearl\" (a ship) and being made captain of that ship, for thirteen years. When Jones reminds Sparrow of his debt, Jack argues that he wasn't captain during those thirteen years, for a mutiny quickly occurred and he was abandoned on an island by his crew. To that, Davy Jones replies that regardless of this, he still owes him his soul, for he has been introducing himself as \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow during those thirteen years (and indeed, it is a running gag in the movies that each time he is called \"Jack Sparrow\", Jack will correct the other by saying \"\"Captain\" Jack Sparrow\").\n\nIn \"Death Note\", the Shinigami Ryuk warns the protagonist Light Yagami to \"Don't think that a human who's used the Death Note can go to heaven or hell\". At the end of the series it is revealed that there's no heaven or hell and that all humans, no matter what they did in life, are equal in death. When a human dies, the human goes to \"Mu\" (Nothingness), or rather ceases to exist. What Ryuk tried to say to Light at the beginning of the series was that not even a human who's used the Death Note can go to heaven or hell; like all other humans, when that human dies, it will cease to exist.\n\nIn Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo, it's impossible to kill anyone intentionally in Foo; Sabine gets around this by causing third parties to take action which, unknown to them, will kill his intended victims.\n"}
{"id": "25423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25423", "title": "Rock music", "text": "Rock music\n\nRock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.\n\nBy the late 1960s \"classic rock\" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.\n\nRock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.\n\nThe sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar, which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularity of rock and roll. Also, it was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists. The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar, which pioneered in jazz music in the same era, and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments, particularly keyboards such as the piano, the Hammond organ, and the synthesizer. The basic rock instrumentation was derived from the basic blues band instrumentation (prominent lead guitar, second chordal instrument, bass, and drums). A group of musicians performing rock music is termed as a rock band or a rock group. Furthermore, it typically consists of between three (the power trio) and five members. Classically, a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles, including vocalist, lead guitarist, rhythm guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer, and often keyboard player or other instrumentalist.\n\nRock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 meter(This can be seen in Common Crisis' hit song \"Sling Your Hook\"), with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four. Melodies often originate from older musical modes such as the Dorian and Mixolydian, as well as major and minor modes. Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel perfect fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions. Since the late 1950s and particularly from the mid 1960s onwards, rock music often used the verse-chorus structure derived from blues and folk music, but there has been considerable variation from this model. Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock. Because of its complex history and its tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that \"it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition.\"\nUnlike many earlier styles of popular music, rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes, including romantic love, sex, rebellion against \"The Establishment\", social concerns, and life styles. These themes were inherited from a variety of sources such as the Tin Pan Alley pop tradition, folk music, and rhythm and blues. Music journalist Robert Christgau characterizes rock lyrics as a \"cool medium\" with simple diction and repeated refrains, and asserts that rock's primary \"function\" \"pertains to music, or, more generally, noise.\" The predominance of white, male, and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted, and rock has been seen as an appropriation of black musical forms for a young, white and largely male audience. As a result, it has also been seen to articulate the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics. Christgau, writing in 1972, said in spite of some exceptions, \"rock and roll usually implies an identification of male sexuality and aggression\".\n\nSince the term “rock” started being used in preference to “rock and roll” from the late-1960s, it has usually been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics, but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre's history and development. According to Simon Frith, rock was “something more than pop, something more than rock and roll” and “[r]ock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere\". In the new millennium, the term \"rock\" has occasionally been used as a blanket term including forms like pop music, reggae music, soul music, and even hip hop, which it has been influenced with but often contrasted through much of its history.\n\nThe foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and western. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed \"race music\") for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase \"rock and roll\" to describe the music.\n\nDebate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record. Contenders include Goree Carter's \"\" (1949); Jimmy Preston's \"Rock the Joint\" (1949), which was later covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952; and \"Rocket 88\" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (in fact, Ike Turner and his band the Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in 1951. Four years later, Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1955) became the first rock and roll song to top \"Billboard\" magazine's main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture.\nIt has also been argued that \"That's All Right (Mama)\" (1954), Elvis Presley's first single for Sun Records in Memphis, could be the first rock and roll record, but, at the same time, Big Joe Turner's \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\", later covered by Haley, was already at the top of the Billboard R&B charts. Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and crooners, such as Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, and Patti Page, who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.\n\nRock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with \"hillbilly\" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley. In contrast doo wop placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 1940s African American vocal groups. Acts like the Crows, the Penguins, the El Dorados and the Turbans all scored major hits, and groups like the Platters, with songs including \"The Great Pretender\" (1955), and the Coasters with humorous songs like \"Yakety Yak\" (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.\n\nThe era also saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar, and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore. The use of distortion, pioneered by electric blues guitarists such as Guitar Slim, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s, was popularized by Chuck Berry in the mid-1950s. The use of power chords, pioneered by Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s, was popularized by Link Wray in the late 1950s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the trad jazz and folk movements brought visiting blues music artists to Britain. Lonnie Donegan's 1955 hit \"Rock Island Line\" was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of skiffle music groups throughout the country, many of which, including John Lennon's Quarrymen, moved on to play rock and roll.\n\nCommentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.\n\nThe term \"pop\" has been used since the early 20th century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. From about 1967, it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible. In contrast rock music was seen as focusing on extended works, particularly albums, was often associated with particular sub-cultures (like the counterculture of the 1960s), placed an emphasis on artistic values and \"authenticity\", stressed live performance and instrumental or vocal virtuosity and was often seen as encapsulating progressive developments rather than simply reflecting existing trends. Nevertheless, much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content.\nThe period of the later 1950s and early 1960s has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll. More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible. While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early 1960s, mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker.\n\nCliff Richard had the first British rock and roll hit with \"Move It\", effectively ushering in the sound of British rock. At the start of the 1960s, his backing group the Shadows was the most successful group recording instrumentals. While rock 'n' roll was fading into lightweight pop and ballads, British rock groups at clubs and local dances, heavily influenced by blues-rock pioneers like Alexis Korner, were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts.\n\nAlso significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force. Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re-injection of gospel music and pop, led by pioneers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke from the mid-1950s, by the early 1960s figures like Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were dominating the R&B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts, helping to accelerate their desegregation, while Motown and Stax/Volt Records were becoming major forces in the record industry. Some historians of music have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the elaborate production methods of the Wall of Sound pursued by Phil Spector.\n\nThe instrumental rock and roll of performers such as Duane Eddy, Link Wray and the Ventures was developed by Dick Dale, who added distinctive \"wet\" reverb, rapid alternate picking, and Middle Eastern and Mexican influences. He produced the regional hit \"Let's Go Trippin'\" in 1961 and launched the surf music craze, following up with songs like \"Misirlou\" (1962). Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and Eddie & the Showmen. The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with \"Pipeline\" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's \"Wipe Out\", by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the \"Billboard\" charts in 1965.\n\nSurf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of the Beach Boys, formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock (among them covers of music by Dick Dale) and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the Four Freshmen. Their first chart hit, \"Surfin'\" in 1962 reached the \"Billboard\" top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon. The surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964.\n\nBy the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like The Beatles, Gerry & the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman's Hermits and the Hollies from Manchester. They drew on a wide range of American influences including soul, rhythm and blues and surf music, initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers. Bands like the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast, and particularly those from London like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music. Soon these groups were composing their own material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat. Beat bands tended towards \"bouncy, irresistible melodies\", while early British blues acts tended towards less sexually innocent, more aggressive songs, often adopting an anti-establishment stance. There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies. By 1963, led by the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.\n\n\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was the Beatles' first number 1 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, spending 7 weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. Their first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on 9 February 1964, drawing an estimated 73 million viewers (at the time a record for an American television program) is often considered a milestone in American pop culture. During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, including the entire top five. The Beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed into the US charts by numerous British bands. During the next two years British acts dominated their own and the US charts with Peter and Gordon, the Animals, Manfred Mann, Petula Clark, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, the Rolling Stones, the Troggs, and Donovan all having one or more number one singles. Other major acts that were part of the invasion included the Kinks and the Dave Clark Five.\n\nThe British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll, opening the door for subsequent British (and Irish) performers to achieve international success. In America it arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music, vocal girl groups and (for a time) the teen idols, that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and 1960s. It dented the careers of established R&B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts, including Elvis. The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music, and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters.\n\nGarage rock was a raw form of rock music, particularly prevalent in North America in the mid-1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in the suburban family garage. Garage rock songs often revolved around the traumas of high school life, with songs about \"lying girls\" being particularly common. The lyrics and delivery tended to be more aggressive than was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming. They ranged from crude one-chord music (like the Seeds) to near-studio musician quality (including the Knickerbockers, the Remains, and the Fifth Estate). There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas. The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound.\nThe style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958. \"Tall Cool One\" (1959) by The Wailers and \"Louie Louie\" by the Kingsmen (1963) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages. By 1963, garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers, including Paul Revere and the Raiders (Boise), the Trashmen (Minneapolis) and the Rivieras (South Bend, Indiana). Other influential garage bands, such as the Sonics (Tacoma, Washington), never reached the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe British Invasion greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many (often surf or hot rod groups) to adopt a British influence, and encouraging many more groups to form. Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits. Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels, most were commercial failures. It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966. By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college, work or the draft. New styles had evolved to replace garage rock.\n\nAlthough the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American blues, including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly, who was a major influence on the Skiffle craze, and Robert Johnson. Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often centered on the electric guitar, based on the Chicago blues, particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958, which prompted Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to form the band Blues Incorporated. The band involved and inspired many of the figures of the subsequent British blues boom, including members of the Rolling Stones and Cream, combining blues standards and forms with rock instrumentation and emphasis.\nThe other key focus for British blues was John Mayall; his band, the Bluesbreakers, included Eric Clapton (after his departure from the Yardbirds) and later Peter Green. Particularly significant was the release of \"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano)\" album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States. Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos, followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the mainstream. Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre. In the late 1960s Jeff Beck, also an alumnus of the Yardbirds, moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. The last Yardbirds guitarist was Jimmy Page, who went on to form \"The New Yardbirds\" which rapidly became Led Zeppelin. Many of the songs on their first three albums, and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs.\n\nIn America, blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist Lonnie Mack, but the genre began to take off in the mid-1960s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included Paul Butterfield (whose band acted like Mayall's Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), Canned Heat, the early Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, the J. Geils Band and Jimi Hendrix with his power trios, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade. Blues rock bands from the southern states, like the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and ZZ Top, incorporated country elements into their style to produce distinctive Southern rock.\n\nEarly blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock. From about 1967 bands like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience had moved away from purely blues-based music into psychedelia. By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues rock and hard rock \"were barely visible\", as bands began recording rock-style albums. The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood and Pat Travers, but, particularly on the British scene (except perhaps for the advent of groups such as Status Quo and Foghat who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock), bands became focused on heavy metal innovation, and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.\n\nBy the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement, utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments. In America the genre was pioneered by figures such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and often identified with progressive or labor politics. In the early sixties figures such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan had come to the fore in this movement as singer-songwriters. Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"Masters of War\" (1963), which brought \"protest songs\" to a wider public, but, although beginning to influence each other, rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with mutually exclusive audiences.\n\nEarly attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the Animals' \"House of the Rising Sun\" (1964), which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation and the Beatles \"I'm a Loser\" (1964), arguably the first Beatles song to be influenced directly by Dylan. The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with The Byrds' recording of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" which topped the charts in 1965. With members who had been part of the cafe-based folk scene in Los Angeles, the Byrds adopted rock instrumentation, including drums and 12-string Rickenbacker guitars, which became a major element in the sound of the genre. Later that year Dylan adopted electric instruments, much to the outrage of many folk purists, with his \"Like a Rolling Stone\" becoming a US hit single. Folk rock particularly took off in California, where it led acts like the Mamas & the Papas and Crosby, Stills and Nash to move to electric instrumentation, and in New York, where it spawned performers including The Lovin' Spoonful and Simon and Garfunkel, with the latter's acoustic \"The Sounds of Silence\" (1965) being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits.\n\nThese acts directly influenced British performers like Donovan and Fairport Convention. In 1969 Fairport Convention abandoned their mixture of American covers and Dylan-influenced songs to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments. This British folk rock was taken up by bands including Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band, which in turn prompted Irish groups like Horslips and Scottish acts like the JSD Band, Spencer's Feat and later Five Hand Reel, to use their traditional music to create a brand of Celtic rock in the early 1970s.\n\nFolk rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967–68, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Dylan and the Byrds, who began to develop country rock. However, the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music, bringing in elements of psychedelia, and helping to develop the ideas of the singer-songwriter, the protest song and concepts of \"authenticity\".\n\nPsychedelic music's LSD-inspired vibe began in the folk scene. The first group to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock were the 13th Floor Elevators from Texas. The Beatles introduced many of the major elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period, such as guitar feedback, the Indian sitar and backmasking sound effects. Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California's emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds's shift from folk to folk rock from 1965. The psychedelic life style, which revolved around hallucinogenic drugs, had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. The Jimi Hendrix Experience's lead guitarist, Jimi Hendrix did\nextended distorted, feedback-filled jams which became a key feature of psychedelia. Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade. 1967 saw the Beatles release their definitive psychedelic statement in \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", including the controversial track \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", the Rolling Stones responded later that year with \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\", and the Pink Floyd debuted with \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\". Key recordings included Jefferson Airplane's \"Surrealistic Pillow\" and the Doors' \"Strange Days\". These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts.\n\nProgressive rock, a term sometimes used interchangeably with art rock, moved beyond established musical formulas by experimenting with different instruments, song types, and forms. From the mid-1960s the Left Banke, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, had pioneered the inclusion of harpsichords, wind, and string sections on their recordings to produce a form of Baroque rock and can be heard in singles like Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" (1967), with its Bach-inspired introduction. The Moody Blues used a full orchestra on their album \"Days of Future Passed\" (1967) and subsequently created orchestral sounds with synthesizers. Classical orchestration, keyboards, and synthesizers were a frequent addition to the established rock format of guitars, bass, and drums in subsequent progressive rock.\nInstrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy and science fiction. The Pretty Things' \"SF Sorrow\" (1968), and the Kinks' \"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)\" (1969) introduced the format of rock operas and opened the door to concept albums, often telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme. King Crimson's 1969 début album, \"In the Court of the Crimson King\", which mixed powerful guitar riffs and mellotron, with jazz and symphonic music, is often taken as the key recording in progressive rock, helping the widespread adoption of the genre in the early 1970s among existing blues-rock and psychedelic bands, as well as newly formed acts. The vibrant Canterbury scene saw acts following Soft Machine from psychedelia, through jazz influences, toward more expansive hard rock, including Caravan, Hatfield and the North, Gong, and National Health.\n\nGreater commercial success was enjoyed by Pink Floyd, who also moved away from psychedelia after the departure of Syd Barrett in 1968, with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973), seen as a masterpiece of the genre, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. There was an emphasis on instrumental virtuosity, with Yes showcasing the skills of both guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, while Emerson, Lake & Palmer were a supergroup who produced some of the genre's most technically demanding work. Jethro Tull and Genesis both pursued very different, but distinctly English, brands of music. Renaissance, formed in 1969 by ex-Yardbirds Jim McCarty and Keith Relf, evolved into a high-concept band featuring the three-octave voice of Annie Haslam. Most British bands depended on a relatively small cult following, but a handful, including Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Jethro Tull, managed to produce top ten singles at home and break the American market. The American brand of progressive rock varied from the eclectic and innovative Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart and Blood, Sweat & Tears, to more pop rock orientated bands like Boston, Foreigner, Kansas, Journey, and Styx. These, beside British bands Supertramp and ELO, all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s, heralding the era of \"pomp\" or \"arena rock\", which would last until the costs of complex shows (often with theatrical staging and special effects), would be replaced by more economical rock festivals as major live venues in the 1990s.\n\nThe instrumental strand of the genre resulted in albums like Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\" (1973), the first record, and worldwide hit, for the Virgin Records label, which became a mainstay of the genre. Instrumental rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy \"krautrock\", along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock. With the advent of punk rock and technological changes in the late 1970s, progressive rock was increasingly dismissed as pretentious and overblown. Many bands broke up, but some, including Genesis, ELP, Yes, and Pink Floyd, regularly scored top ten albums with successful accompanying worldwide tours. Some bands which emerged in the aftermath of punk, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ultravox, and Simple Minds, showed the influence of progressive rock, as well as their more usually recognized punk influences.\n\nIn the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues rock, psychedelic and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. AllMusic states that the term jazz-rock \"may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation.\" Jazz rock \"...generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s\", including the singer-songwriter movement. Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce of the Eric Clapton-fronted band Cream, had emerged from the British jazz scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York-based the Free Spirits with \"Out of Sight and Sound\" (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like Electric Flag, Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago, to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nBritish acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included Nucleus and the Graham Bond and John Mayall spin-off Colosseum. From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine, who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with Miles Davis, particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album \"Bitches Brew\" (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Weather Report. The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience, but acts like Steely Dan, Frank Zappa and Joni Mitchell recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music.\n\nRoots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly country and folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock. In 1966 Bob Dylan went to Nashville to record the album \"Blonde on Blonde\". This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend were the Canadian group the Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George, and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones' \"Beggar's Banquet\" (1968) and the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" (1970).\nIn 1968, Gram Parsons recorded \"Safe at Home\" with the International Submarine Band, arguably the first true country rock album. Later that year he joined the Byrds for \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" (1968), generally considered one of the most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers who helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career. Bands in California that adopted country rock included Hearts and Flowers, Poco, New Riders of the Purple Sage, the Beau Brummels, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers; one-time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band; and Neil Young. The Dillards were, unusually, a country act, who moved towards rock music. The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with artists including the Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles (made up of members of the Burritos, Poco, and Stone Canyon Band), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included \"Hotel California\" (1976).\n\nThe founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from blues rock, but incorporating elements of boogie, soul, and country in the early 1970s. The most successful act to follow them were Lynyrd Skynyrd, who helped establish the \"Good ol' boy\" image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s' guitar rock. Their successors included the fusion/progressive instrumentalists Dixie Dregs, the more country-influenced Outlaws, jazz-leaning Wet Willie and (incorporating elements of R&B and gospel) the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like .38 Special, Molly Hatchet and the Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nGlam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of and reaction against those trends. Musically diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art rock of Roxy Music, and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical subgenre. Visually it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamor, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war Cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics. It was prefigured by the showmanship and gender-identity manipulation of American acts such as the Cockettes and Alice Cooper.\n\nThe origins of glam rock are associated with Marc Bolan, who had renamed his folk duo to T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme \"Top of the Pops\" in December 1970 wearing glitter, to perform what would be his first number 1 single \"Ride a White Swan\". From 1971, already a minor star, David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act. These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, Sweet, Slade, Mott the Hoople, Mud and Alvin Stardust. While highly successful in the single charts in the UK, very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States; Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as \"glitter rock\" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts. In the UK the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and his support musicians the Glitter Band, who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1976. A second wave of glam rock acts, including Suzi Quatro, Roy Wood's Wizzard and Sparks, dominated the British single charts from about 1974 to 1976. Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including Rod Stewart, Elton John, Queen and, for a time, even the Rolling Stones. It was also a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including Kiss and Adam Ant, and less directly on the formation of gothic rock and glam metal as well as on punk rock, which helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976. Glam has since enjoyed sporadic modest revivals through bands such as Chainsaw Kittens, the Darkness and in R n' B crossover act Prince.\n\nFrom the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor. It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late 1970s with acts like Billy Joel, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose \"Rumours\" (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade. In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was played louder and with more intensity. It often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like the Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the Jeff Beck Group. Hard rock-influenced bands that enjoyed international success in the later 1970s included Queen, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, AC/DC, and Van Halen.\n\nFrom the late 1960s the term \"heavy metal\" began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity, first as an adjective and by the early 1970s as a noun. The term was first used in music in Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" (1967) and began to be associated with pioneer bands like San Francisco's Blue Cheer, Cleveland's James Gang and Michigan's Grand Funk Railroad. By 1970 three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre. Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues-rock, Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony, helping to produce a \"darker\" sound. These elements were taken up by a \"second generation\" of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s, including: Judas Priest, UFO, Motörhead and Rainbow from Britain; Kiss, Ted Nugent, and Blue Öyster Cult from the US; Rush from Canada and Scorpions from Germany, all marking the expansion in popularity of the subgenre. Despite a lack of airplay and very little presence on the singles charts, late-1970s heavy metal built a considerable following, particularly among adolescent working-class males in North America and Europe.\n\nRock, mostly the heavy metal genre, has been criticized by some Christian leaders, who have condemned it as immoral, anti-Christian and even demonic. However, Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s, particularly out of the Jesus movement beginning in Southern California, and emerged as a subgenre in the 1970s with artists like Larry Norman, usually seen as the first major \"star\" of Christian rock. The genre has been particularly popular in the United States. Many Christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary Christian music scene, while other bands and artists are closely linked to independent music. Since the 1980s Christian rock performers have gained mainstream success, including figures such as the American gospel-to-pop crossover artist Amy Grant and the British singer Cliff Richard. While these artists were largely acceptable in Christian communities the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles by bands like Petra and Stryper, who achieved considerable mainstream success in the 1980s, was more controversial. From the 1990s there were increasing numbers of acts who attempted to avoid the Christian band label, preferring to be seen as groups who were also Christians, including P.O.D and Collective Soul.\n\nPunk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.\n\nBy late 1976, acts such as the Ramones and Patti Smith, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and the Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive clothing styles and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and Oi! had become the predominant mode of punk rock. This has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk, such as D-beat (a distortion-heavy subgenre influenced by the UK band Discharge), anarcho-punk (such as Crass), grindcore (such as Napalm Death), and crust punk. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to New wave, post-punk and the alternative rock movement.\n\nAlthough punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales (being distributed by small specialty labels such as Stiff Records), or American radio airplay (as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album-oriented rock). Punk rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate, arty approach, such as Talking Heads and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene; in some quarters the description \"new wave\" began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands. Record executives, who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement, recognized the potential of the more accessible new wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave. Many of these bands, such as the Cars and the Go-Go's can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave; other existing acts, including the Police, the Pretenders and Elvis Costello, used the new wave movement as the springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers, while \"skinny tie\" bands exemplified by the Knack, or the photogenic Blondie, began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1985, influenced by Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, David Bowie and Gary Numan, British new wave went in the direction of such New Romantics as Spandau Ballet, Ultravox, Japan, Duran Duran, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, Talk Talk and the Eurythmics, sometimes using the synthesizer to replace all other instruments. This period coincided with the rise of MTV and led to a great deal of exposure for this brand of synth-pop, creating what has been characterised as a second British Invasion. Some more traditional rock bands adapted to the video age and profited from MTV's airplay, most obviously Dire Straits, whose \"Money for Nothing\" gently poked fun at the station, despite the fact that it had helped make them international stars, but in general, guitar-oriented rock was commercially eclipsed.\n\nIf hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 1980s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New York-based no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as James Chance and the Contortions, DNA and Sonic Youth. Early contributors to the genre included the US bands Pere Ubu, Devo, the Residents and Talking Heads.\n\nThe first wave of British post-punk included Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, who placed less emphasis on art than their US counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music. Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, the Cure, and the Sisters of Mercy, moved increasingly in this direction to found Gothic rock, which had become the basis of a major sub-culture by the early 1980s. Similar emotional territory was pursued by Australian acts like the Birthday Party and Nick Cave. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively. Another early post-punk movement was the industrial music developed by British bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, and New York-based Suicide, using a variety of electronic and sampling techniques that emulated the sound of industrial production and which would develop into a variety of forms of post-industrial music in the 1980s.\n\nThe second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including the Fall, the Pop Group, the Mekons, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes, tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes. Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland's U2, who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world. Although many post-punk bands continued to record and perform, it declined as a movement in the mid-1980s as acts disbanded or moved off to explore other musical areas, but it has continued to influence the development of rock music and has been seen as a major element in the creation of the alternative rock movement.\n\nAmerican working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, blue-collar American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll. It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South. Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and New Wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison, and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the Rolling Stones.\n\nExemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty, along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism. The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including John Mellencamp, Steve Earle and more gentle singer-songwriters such as Bruce Hornsby. It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel, Kid Rock and the Killers.\n\nHeartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works. Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri's Bottle Rockets and Illinois' Uncle Tupelo, often find themselves labeled alt-country.\n\nThe term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed \"alternative\" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements. Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies, and in the UK the Cure, New Order, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Smiths. Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth. They rejected the dominant synth-pop of the early 1980s, marking a return to group-based guitar rock.\n\nFew of these early bands achieved mainstream success, although exceptions to this rule include R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Cure. Despite a general lack of spectacular album sales, the original alternative rock bands exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the U.S. during the 1980s included jangle pop, associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as 10,000 Maniacs and the Feelies. In the UK Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade indie or dream pop like Primal Scream, Bogshed, Half Man Half Biscuit and the Wedding Present, and what were dubbed shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse, and the Boo Radleys. Particularly vibrant was the Madchester scene, produced such bands as Happy Mondays, the Inspiral Carpets, and Stone Roses. The next decade would see the success of grunge in the United States and Britpop in the United Kingdom, bringing alternative rock into the mainstream.\n\nDisaffected by commercialized and highly produced pop and rock in the mid-1980s, bands in Washington state (particularly in the Seattle area) formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music of the time. The developing genre came to be known as \"grunge\", a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who actively rebelled against the over-groomed images of other artists. Grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback. The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock.\n\nBands such as Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins and Skin Yard pioneered the genre, with Mudhoney becoming the most successful by the end of the decade. Grunge remained largely a local phenomenon until 1991, when Nirvana's album \"Nevermind\" became a huge success, containing the anthemic song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". \"Nevermind\" was more melodic than its predecessors, by signing to Geffen Records the band was one of the first to employ traditional corporate promotion and marketing mechanisms such as an MTV video, in store displays and the use of radio \"consultants\" who promoted airplay at major mainstream rock stations. During 1991 and 1992, other grunge albums such as Pearl Jam's \"Ten\", Soundgarden's \"Badmotorfinger\" and Alice in Chains' \"Dirt\", along with the \"Temple of the Dog\" album featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, became among the 100 top-selling albums. Major record labels signed most of the remaining grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of acts moved to the city in the hope of success. However, with the death of Kurt Cobain and the subsequent break-up of Nirvana in 1994, touring problems for Pearl Jam and the departure of Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley in 1998, the genre began to decline, partly to be overshadowed by Britpop and more commercial sounding post-grunge.\n\nBritpop emerged from the British alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands particularly influenced by British guitar music of the 1960s and 1970s. The Smiths were a major influence, as were bands of the Madchester scene, which had dissolved in the early 1990s. The movement has been seen partly as a reaction against various U.S.-based, musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon and as a reassertion of a British rock identity. Britpop was varied in style, but often used catchy tunes and hooks, beside lyrics with particularly British concerns and the adoption of the iconography of the 1960s British Invasion, including the symbols of British identity previously utilised by the mods. It was launched around 1992 with releases by groups such as Suede and Blur, who were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass and Elastica, who produced a series of top ten albums and singles. For a while the contest between Blur and Oasis was built by the popular press into \"The Battle of Britpop\", initially won by Blur, but with Oasis achieving greater long-term and international success, directly influencing a third generation of Britpop bands, including The Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast. Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement known as Cool Britannia. Although its more popular bands, particularly Blur and Oasis, were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement had largely fallen apart by the end of the decade.\n\nThe term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and subsequent hiatus of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound. Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, pop-punk, alternative metal or hard rock. The term post-grunge originally was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an \"authentic\" rock movement. Originally, grunge bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and were suspected of emulating the grunge sound were pejoratively labelled as post-grunge. From 1994, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's new band, the Foo Fighters, helped popularize the genre and define its parameters.\n\nSome post-grunge bands, like Candlebox, were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like Los Angeles' Audioslave, and Georgia's Collective Soul and beyond the US to Australia's Silverchair and Britain's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the late 1990s. Although male bands predominated post-grunge, female solo artist Alanis Morissette's 1995 album \"Jagged Little Pill\", labelled as post-grunge, also became a multi-platinum hit. Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands like Creed and Nickelback emerged. Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including Shinedown, Seether, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd.\n\nThe origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like the Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid, Pennywise, Weezer and Green Day. In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album \"Dookie\", which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous début from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US. This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band the Offspring with \"Smash\" (1994). This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day's \"Nimrod\" (1997) and The Offspring's \"Americana\" (1998).\n\nA second wave of pop punk was spearheaded by Blink-182, with their breakthrough album \"Enema of the State\" (1999), followed by bands such as Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and Sum 41, who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk. Later pop-punk bands, including All Time Low, 5 Seconds Of Summer, the All-American Rejects and Fall Out Boy, had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving commercial success.\n\nIn the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably. By the mid-1990s, as elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge and pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning. Those bands following the less commercial contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie. They characteristically attempted to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying on touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion. Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands like the Cranberries and Superchunk, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. It has been noted that indie rock has a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of feminist-informed Riot Grrrl music. Many countries have developed an extensive local indie scene, flourishing with bands with enough popularity to survive inside the respective country, but virtually unknown outside them.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s many recognisable subgenres, most with their origins in the late 1980s alternative movement, were included under the umbrella of indie. Lo-fi eschewed polished recording techniques for a D.I.Y. ethos and was spearheaded by Beck, Sebadoh and Pavement. The work of Talk Talk and Slint helped inspire both post rock, an experimental style influenced by jazz and electronic music, pioneered by Bark Psychosis and taken up by acts such as Tortoise, Stereolab, and Laika, as well as leading to more dense and complex, guitar-based math rock, developed by acts like Polvo and Chavez. Space rock looked back to progressive roots, with drone heavy and minimalist acts like Spacemen 3, the two bands created out of its split, Spectrum and Spiritualized, and later groups including Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Quickspace. In contrast, Sadcore emphasised pain and suffering through melodic use of acoustic and electronic instrumentation in the music of bands like American Music Club and Red House Painters, while the revival of Baroque pop reacted against lo-fi and experimental music by placing an emphasis on melody and classical instrumentation, with artists like Arcade Fire, Belle and Sebastian and Rufus Wainwright.\n\nAlternative metal emerged from the hardcore scene of alternative rock in the US in the later 1980s, but gained a wider audience after grunge broke into the mainstream in the early 1990s. Early alternative metal bands mixed a wide variety of genres with hardcore and heavy metal sensibilities, with acts like Jane's Addiction and Primus utilizing progressive rock, Soundgarden and Corrosion of Conformity using garage punk, the Jesus Lizard and Helmet mixing noise rock, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails influenced by industrial music, Monster Magnet moving into psychedelia, Pantera, Sepultura and White Zombie creating groove metal, while Biohazard and Faith No More turned to hip hop and rap.\nHip hop had gained attention from rock acts in the early 1980s, including The Clash with \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1980) and Blondie with \"Rapture\" (1980). Early crossover acts included Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. Detroit rapper Esham became known for his \"acid rap\" style, which fused rapping with a sound that was often based in rock and heavy metal. Rappers who sampled rock songs included Ice-T, The Fat Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and Whodini. The mixing of thrash metal and rap was pioneered by Anthrax on their 1987 comedy-influenced single \"I'm the Man\".\n\nIn 1990, Faith No More broke into the mainstream with their single \"Epic\", often seen as the first truly successful combination of heavy metal with rap. This paved the way for the success of existing bands like 24-7 Spyz and Living Colour, and new acts including Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers, who all fused rock and hip hop among other influences. Among the first wave of performers to gain mainstream success as rap rock were 311, Bloodhound Gang, and Kid Rock. A more metallic sound\"nu metal\"was pursued by bands including Limp Bizkit, Korn and Slipknot. Later in the decade this style, which contained a mix of grunge, punk, metal, rap and turntable scratching, spawned a wave of successful bands like Linkin Park, P.O.D. and Staind, who were often classified as rap metal or nu metal, the first of which are the best-selling band of the genre.\n\nIn 2001, nu metal reached its peak with albums like Staind's \"Break the Cycle\", P.O.D's \"Satellite\", Slipknot's \"Iowa\" and Linkin Park's \"Hybrid Theory\". New bands also emerged like Disturbed, Godsmack and Papa Roach, whose major label début \"Infest\" became a platinum hit. Korn's long-awaited fifth album \"Untouchables\", and Papa Roach's second album \"Lovehatetragedy\", did not sell as well as their previous releases, while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and MTV began focusing on pop punk and emo. Since then, many bands have changed to a more conventional hard rock, heavy metal, or electronic music sound.\n\nFrom about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), particularly the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces, with American influences, including post-grunge. Drawn from across the United Kingdom (with several important bands emerging from the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centered on British, English and London life and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height. This, beside a greater willingness to engage with the American press and fans, may have helped some of them in achieving international success.\nPost Britpop bands have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative. Post Britpop bands like the Verve with \"Urban Hymns\" (1997), Radiohead from \"OK Computer\" (1997), Travis from \"The Man Who\" (1999), Stereophonics from \"Performance and Cocktails\" (1999), Feeder from \"Echo Park\" (2001), Muse from \"Absolution\" (2003) and particularly Coldplay from their debut album \"Parachutes\" (2000), achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s, arguably providing a launchpad for the subsequent garage rock or post-punk revival, which has also been seen as a reaction to their introspective brand of rock.\n\nPost-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in the Chicago and Washington, DC areas, in the early to mid-1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.\n\nEmo also emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s Washington, D.C., initially as \"emocore\", used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive, barking style. The early emo scene operated as an underground, with short-lived bands releasing small-run vinyl records on tiny independent labels. Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World's \"Bleed American\" (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's \"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most\" (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term emo expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. By 2003 post-hardcore bands had also caught the attention of major labels and began to enjoy mainstream success in the album charts. A number of these bands were seen as a more aggressive offshoot of emo and given the often vague label of screamo.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock, emerged into the mainstream. They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or new wave revival. Because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through New Wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed. There had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s and by 2000 scenes had grown up in several countries.\n\nThe commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: the Strokes, who emerged from the New York club scene with their début album \"Is This It\" (2001); the White Stripes, from Detroit, with their third album \"White Blood Cells\" (2001); the Hives from Sweden after their compilation album \"Your New Favourite Band\" (2001); and the Vines from Australia with \"Highly Evolved\" (2002). They were christened by the media as the \"The\" bands, and dubbed \"The saviours of rock 'n' roll\", leading to accusations of hype. A second wave of bands that gained international recognition due to the movement included Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Killers, Interpol and Kings of Leon from the US, the Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, Editors, Franz Ferdinand and Placebo from the UK, Jet from Australia and the Datsuns and the D4 from New Zealand.\n\nIn the 2000s, as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet, and new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding. These techniques also began to be used by existing bands and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indie electronic, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave.\n\nDifferent subgenres of rock were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of sub-cultures. In the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, British youths adopted the Teddy Boy and Rocker subcultures, which revolved around US rock and roll. The counterculture of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock. The mid-1970s punk subculture began in the US, but it was given a distinctive look by British designer Vivienne Westwood, a look which spread worldwide. Out of the punk scene, the Goth and Emo subcultures grew, both of which presented distinctive visual styles.\nWhen an international rock culture developed, it supplanted cinema as the major sources of fashion influence. Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance. Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods, as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender, and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom. Rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use, including the amphetamines taken by mods in the early to mid-1960s, through the LSD, mescaline, hashish and other hallucinogenic drugs linked with psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s; and sometimes to cannabis, cocaine and heroin, all of which have been eulogised in song.\n\nRock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up African-American culture to white audiences; but at the same time, rock has been accused of appropriating and exploiting that culture. While rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced Western audiences to different musical traditions, the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of cultural imperialism. Rock music inherited the folk tradition of protest song, making political statements on subjects such as war, religion, poverty, civil rights, justice and the environment. Political activism reached a mainstream peak with the \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" single (1984) and Live Aid concert for Ethiopia in 1985, which, while successfully raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid, have also been criticised (along with similar events), for providing a stage for self-aggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved.\n\nSince its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early rock and roll's rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counterculture's rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk's rejection of all forms of social convention, however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.\n\nProfessional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal. According to Schaap and Berkers, \"playing in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based ... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks. They note that rock music \"is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture\". In popular music, there has been a gendered \"distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation\" in music. \"several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities\". \"Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricatedhence, inferiorpop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians\". One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that \"bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidaritysocial bonds between people of the same sex...plays a crucial role\". In the 1960s rock music scene, \"singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument ... simply wasn't done\".\n\n\"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the womenoften, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teensin rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...\". Philip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\". In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"...at least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"...exceptions such as Girlschool\". However, \"...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\", \"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.\" When Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, \"no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader\". According to Auslander, she was \"kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female \"musician\" ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys\".\n\nAn all-female band is a musical group in genres such as rock and blues which is exclusively composed of female musicians. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "113616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113616", "title": "Roland", "text": "Roland\n\nRoland (Frankish: \"*Hrōþiland\"; Latin: \"Hruodlandus\", \"Rotholandus\"; Italian: \"Orlando\", \"Rolando\"; died 15 August 778) was a Frankish military leader under Charlemagne who became one of the principal figures in the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. The historical Roland was military governor of the Breton March, responsible for defending Francia's frontier against the Bretons. His only historical attestation is in Einhard's \"Vita Karoli Magni\", which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard killed by rebellious Basques in Iberia at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.\n\nThe story of Roland's death at Roncevaux Pass was embellished in later medieval and Renaissance literature. The first and most famous of these epic treatments was the Old French \"Chanson de Roland\" of the eleventh century.\n\nTwo masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the \"Orlando Innamorato\" and \"Orlando Furioso\" (by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto), are further detached from history than the earlier \"Chansons\", similarly to the later \"Morgante\" by Luigi Pulci. Roland is poetically associated with his sword Durendal, his horse Veillantif, and his oliphant horn.\n\nThe only historical mention of the actual Roland is in the \"Vita Karoli Magni\" by Charlemagne's courtier and biographer Einhard. Einhard refers to him as \"Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus\" (\"Roland, prefect of the borders of Brittany\"), indicating that he presided over the Breton March, Francia's border territory against the Bretons. The passage, which appears in Chapter 9, mentions that \"Hroudlandus\" (a Latinization of the Frankish \"*Hrōþiland\", from \"*hrōþi\", \"praise\"/\"fame\" and *\"land\", \"country\") was among those killed in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass:\nRoland was evidently the first official appointed to direct Frankish policy in Breton affairs, as local Franks under the Merovingian dynasty had not previously pursued any specific relationship with the Bretons. Their frontier castle districts such as Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine, south of Mont Saint-Michel, are now divided between Normandy and Brittany. The distinctive culture of this region preserves the present-day Gallo language and legends of local heroes such as Roland. Roland's successor in \"Brittania Nova\" was Guy of Nantes, who like Roland, was unable to exert Frankish expansion over Brittany and merely sustained a Breton presence in the Carolingian Empire.\n\nAccording to legend, Roland was laid to rest in the basilica at Blaye, near Bordeaux, on the site of the citadel.\n\nRoland was a popular and iconic figure in medieval Europe and its minstrel culture. Many tales made him a nephew of Charlemagne, and turned his life into an epic tale of the noble Christian killed by Islamic forces, which forms part of the medieval Matter of France.\n\nThe tale of Roland's death is retold in the eleventh-century poem \"The Song of Roland\", where he is equipped with the olifant (a signalling horn) and an unbreakable sword, enchanted by various Christian relics, named Durendal. The \"Song\" contains a highly romanticized account of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and Roland's death, setting the tone for later fantastical depiction of Charlemagne's court.\n\nIt was adapted and modified throughout the Middle Ages, including an influential Latin prose version \"Historia Caroli Magni\" (latterly known as the \"Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle\"), which also includes Roland's battle with a Saracen giant named Ferracutus who is only vulnerable at his navel. The story was later adapted in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic \"L'Entrée d'Espagne\" (c.1320) and in the 14th-century Italian epic \"La Spagna\", attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350–1360.\n\nOther texts give further legendary accounts of Roland's life. His friendship with Olivier and his engagement with Olivier's sister Aude are told in \"Girart de Vienne\" by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube. Roland's youth and the acquisition of his horse Veillantif and sword are described in \"Aspremont\". Roland also appears in \"Quatre Fils Aymon\" where he is contrasted with Renaud de Montauban against whom he occasionally fights.\n\nIn Norway, the tales of Roland are part of the 13th century \"Karlamagnús saga\".\n\nIn the \"Divine Comedy\" Dante sees Roland, named Orlando as it is usual in Italian literature, in the Heaven of Mars together with others who fought for the faith.\n\nRoland appears in \"Entrée d'Espagne\", a 14th-century Franco-Venetian chanson de geste (in which he is transformed into a knight errant, similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances) and \"La Spagna\", a 14th-century Italian epic.\n\nFrom the fifteenth century onwards, he appears as a central character in a sequence of Italian verse romances as \"Orlando\", including \"Morgante\" by Luigi Pulci, \"Orlando Innamorato\" by Matteo Maria Boiardo, and \"Orlando furioso\" by Ludovico Ariosto. (See below for his later history in Italian verse.) The \"Orlandino\" of Pietro Aretino then waxed satirical about the \"cult of personality\" of Orlando the hero. The Orlando narrative inspired several composers, amongst whom were Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel, who composed an Italian-language opera with \"Orlando\".\n\nIn Germany, Roland gradually became a symbol of the independence of the growing cities from the local nobility. In the late Middle Ages many cities featured defiant statues of Roland in their marketplaces. The Roland in Wedel was erected in 1450 as symbol of market and Hanseatic justice, and the Roland statue in front of Bremen City Hall (1404) has been listed together with the city hall itself on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 2004.\n\nIn Aragón there are several placenames related to Roldán or Rolando: la Breca de Roldán (in Spanish la Brecha de Roldán, in French La Brèche de Roland) and Salto d´o Roldán (in Spanish El Salto de Roldán).\n\nIn Catalonia Roland (or \"Rotllà\", as it is rendered in Catalan) became a legendary giant. Numerous places in Catalonia (both North and South) have a name related to \"Rotllà\". In step with the trace left by the character in the whole Pyrenean area, Basque \"Errolan\" turns up in numerous legends and place-names associated with a mighty giant, usually a heathen, capable of launching huge stones. The Basque word \"erraldoi\" (giant) stems from \"Errol(d)an\", as pointed out by the linguist Koldo Mitxelena.\n\nIn the Faroe Islands Roland appears in the ballad of \"Runtsivalstríðið\" (Battle of Roncevaux)\n\nA statue of Roland also stands in the city of Rolândia in Brazil. This city was established by German immigrants, many of whom were refugees from Nazi Germany, who named their new home after Roland to represent freedom.\n\nThe English expression, \"to give a Roland for an Oliver\", meaning either to offer a \"quid pro quo\" or \"to give as good as one gets\", recalls the \"Chanson de Roland\", and Roland's companion Oliver.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27514641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27514641", "title": "Science of team science", "text": "Science of team science\n\nThe science of team science (SciTS) field encompasses both conceptual and methodological strategies aimed at understanding and enhancing the processes and outcomes of collaborative, team-based research. It is useful to distinguish between team science (TS) initiatives and the science of team science (SciTS) field. Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena. The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science. Its principal units of analysis are the research, training, and community-based translational initiatives implemented by both public and private sector organizations.\n\nThe SciTS field focuses on understanding and enhancing the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science initiatives, including their scientific discoveries, educational outcomes, and translations of research findings into new practices, patents, products, technical advances, and policies.\n\nSince the 1990s, there has been a growing interest and investment in large-scale, team-based research initiatives to address complex and multifaceted problems that require cross-disciplinary collaboration. The rise in team science parallels the increase in specialization among scientists. The rapid growth and accumulation of specialized knowledge in multiple fields has created a substantial need to establish partnerships among scientists and practitioners drawn from several different fields in order to address complex environmental, social, and public health problems.\n\nThe interdiscipline of SciTS initially emerged from practical concerns on the part of funding agencies, which needed to gauge the performance of team science, understand its added value, determine the return on investment of large research initiatives, and inform science policy The term \"science of team science\" was first introduced in October, 2006, at a conference called The Science of Team Science: Assessing the Value of Transdisciplinary Research, hosted by the National Cancer Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland. The emerging SciTS field was further developed in a supplement to the \"American Journal of Preventive Medicine\", published in July 2008. Two years later, the First Annual International Science of Team Science (SciTS) Conference was held on April 22–24, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois, organized by the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. The Chicago conference brought together team science investigators and practitioners from a broad range of disciplines, including translational research; organizational behavior; social, cognitive, and health psychology; communications; complex systems; evaluation science; technology; and management.\n\nAs a nascent field of inquiry, the terminology, methodologies, and outcomes of SciTS are still being debated and defined, and new hypotheses regarding the most effective strategies for implementing and sustaining team science are beginning to be tested and the results published. While the SciTS literature base is currently limited, the field is founded on a substantial body of knowledge of team research conducted by scholars in diverse fields such as organizational science, community health promotion, and social psychology, as well as from groups outside academia, including business and the military. SciTS research findings are starting to be translated into evidence-based tools and support structures that aim to improve the efficiency and success of team science initiatives.\n\nIn 2013, the National Academy of Sciences established a National Research Council Committee on the Science of Team Science to evaluate the current state of knowledge and practice in the SciTS field. A Committee report was published in 2015.\n\nThe methods and measures used to evaluate team science are complex and evolving with the interdiscipline of SciTS. The definition of a successful team may be different depending on the stakeholder. For example, funding agencies may be more interested in performance measures related to the translation of team research findings to practical applications, whereas team researchers may use the number of publications produced and amount grant funding obtained to gauge the success of a team science endeavor. In addition, the method of evaluation and metrics of success may vary at different points during the team research project. Short-term measures may include indicators of synergistic output, whereas long-term measures may be related to the impact of the research on the evolution of a discipline or the development of public policy.\n\nSciTS uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the antecedent conditions, collaborative processes, and outcomes associated with team science, as well as the organizational, social, and political context that influences team science. These methods include approaches such as surveys, ethnographic observation, case studies, and interviews of members of science teams; social network, mapping and visualization techniques (e.g., graphical representations of collaboration formation and dissolution, geographic distribution of collaborators, funding patterns, patent awards, time to production and commercialization, etc.); and bibliometric analyses (e.g., assessment of co-authored papers and grants).\n\nThe field would benefit from science agencies and associated policies to put into place advanced computational infrastructures, which will enable the analysis of terabytes of data to identify the factors that contribute to or hinder the success of science teams. Ideally, evaluation of team science initiatives is performed in real time, during active collaborations, so that the information results can be fed back to the scientific team to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nScientists engaged in team science collaborations have traditionally relied on heuristics to make team science work. Through only their own experiences—what might be called the art of team science—they have tried to discern what facilitates team science and what obstacles stand in the way of a collaboration’s success. By studying the practice of team science, SciTS researchers aim to develop a set of evidence-based tools and recommendations that can then be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of team science initiatives. For example, SciTS researchers may identify approaches to facilitate the formation and function of successful collaborative science teams, remove inter-institutional barriers to team science, support effective collaboration among researchers who work together within a team, and develop team science training programs.\n\nProgress is being made on a few fronts toward the development of practical tools and recommendations to support the team science process. The SciTS research community is working toward the creation of an evidence base for the development of a set of \"effective practices\", which can be incorporated into team science training to ensure that the next generation of scientists develops the skills necessary to engage in effective team science. Several groups are developing team science \"toolboxes\" or \"toolkits\" that provide resources that can assist researchers with the collaborative science process, including guiding questions that support discussion on collaborative goals and common metrics of success and assigning individual tasks and responsibilities; guidelines for developing a shared \"language\" that can be used among researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds; models for communications infrastructure that can support geographically dispersed collaborations; tools for assessing team members' readiness to collaborate; curricula for training team members in skills for team science; and model \"prenuptial agreements\" for collaborators that can help to establish agreement on rights to authorship and patents that result from scientific collaborations. Other groups are developing online social networking tools to help scientists identify potential collaborators, and creating centralized databases of measures and instruments that can be used by SciTS researchers, program evaluators, or those who are engaged in team science to assess the processes and outcomes of team science initiatives.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "264117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264117", "title": "Shirt", "text": "Shirt\n\nA shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).\n\nOriginally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a \"dress shirt\", a specific type of \"collared shirt\"). A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.\n\nThe World's Oldest preserved garment, discovered by Flinders Petrie, is a \"highly sophisticated\" linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at Tarkan, c. 3000 BC: \"the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.\"\n\nThe shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear, until the twentieth century. Although the women's chemise was a closely related garment to the men's, it is the men's garment that became the modern shirt. In the Middle Ages, it was a plain, undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks, the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as shepherds, prisoners, and penitents. In the seventeenth century, men's shirts were allowed to show, with much the same erotic import as visible underwear today. In the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men \"relied on the long tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers. Eighteenth-century costume historian Joseph Strutt believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent. Even as late as 1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper.\n\nThe shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs. In the sixteenth century, men's shirts often had embroidery, and sometimes frills or lace at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth century long neck frills, or jabots, were fashionable. Coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen in the paintings of George Caleb Bingham. They were considered casual wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century. For a gentleman, \"to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace event.\"\n\nEuropean and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the Garibaldi shirt, a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under Giuseppe Garibaldi, was popularized by Empress Eugénie of France. At the end of the nineteenth century, the \"Century Dictionary\" described an ordinary shirt as \"of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable\".\n\nThe first documented appearance of the expression “To give the shirt off one’s back,” happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. Tired of constantly washing her husband’s entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that collar stays became popular, although these early accessories resembled tie clips more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place \n\nMany terms are used to describe and differentiate types of shirts (and upper-body garments in general) and their construction. The smallest differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group. Recently, (late twentieth century, into the twenty-first century) it has become common to use tops as a form of advertisement. Many of these distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as coats and sweaters.\n\nShirts may:\n\nShirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the cuffs:\n\n\n\n\n\nSome combinations are not applicable, e.g. a tube top cannot have a collar.\nThe main measures for a jacket are :\n\n\nThere are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based).\nSome natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, finishing can be applied to the fabric.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, fascists wore different coloured shirts:\n\nIn addition, red shirts have been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups, including Garibaldi's Italian revolutionaries, nineteenth century American street gangs, and socialist militias in Spain and Mexico during the 1930s.\n\nDifferent colored shirts signified the major opposing sides that featured prominently in the 2008 Thai political crisis, with red having been worn by the supporters of the populist People's Power Party (PPP), and yellow being worn by the supporters of the royalist and anti-Thaksin Shinawatra movement the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD). Each side is commonly referred to as the 'red shirts' and 'yellow shirts' respectively, though the later opponents of the later Thaksin supporting groups have largely ceased wearing yellow shirts to protest rallies.\n\nIn the UK, the Social Credit movement of the thirties wore green shirts.\n\n\n"}

Though written in Hebrew script, the dialect was mutually intelligible with the Occitan spoken by non-Jews (Banitt 1963, Pansier 1925, Guttel & Aslanov 2006:560).\n\nShuadit is known from documents dating to as early as the 11th century in France, and after suffering drastic declines beginning with the charter of the Inquisition in France, it finally died out with its last known speaker in 1977.\n\nShuadit writings came in two distinct varieties, religious texts and popular prose, and they were written by adapting the Hebrew script.\n\nReligious texts contained a significantly higher incidence of loanwords from Hebrews and reflected an overall more \"educated\" style, with many words also from Old French, Franco-Provençal, Greek, Aramaic and Latin. The texts include a fragment of a 14th-century poem lauding Queen Esther, and a woman's siddur containing an uncommon blessing, found in few other locations (including medieval Lithuania), thanking God, in the morning blessings, not for making her \"according to His will\" (שעשני כרצונו \"she'asani kirtzono\") but for making her as a woman.\n\nThe extant texts comprising the collections of popular prose used far fewer borrowings and were essentially Occitan written with the Hebrew script. This may have simply reflected Jews' then-prevalent avoidance of the Latin alphabet, which was widely associated with oppressive Christian régimes. The texts demonstrate the extent to which the Jewish community of Provence was familiar with Hebrew as well as the extent to which the community was integrated into the larger surrounding Christian culture of the region.\n\nShuadit had a number of phonological characteristics unlike all other Jewish languages. The name \"Shuadit\" literally means \"Jewish\" and is the Occitan pronunciation of the Hebrew word \"Yehudit\" (initial *j became , and *h was often elided between vowels).\n\nIn words inherited from Hebrew and Aramaic, the letters \"samekh\", \"sin\" and \"thav\" were all pronounced , the same as \"fe\". The conjecture is that the first two phonemes merged with the phoneme, which then merged with the phoneme . That observation gives particular validity to the theory that Shuadit is an outgrowth of a much older Judaeo-Latin language, rather than an independent development within southern France, as the second step also occurred during the development of Latin from Proto-Italic.\n\nIn words derived from Latin, there was a tendency to diphthongise after plosives and to delateralize to . Also, both and , as well as and , merged to the single phoneme . Thus, the Provençal words \"plus\", \"filho\", and \"juge\" were respectively \"pyus\", \"feyo\", and \"šuše\" in Shuadit.\n\nA fundamental source for inferring information about the phonology of Shuadit is the comedy \"Harcanot et Barcanot\". (See \"Pansier\" in the References section.)\n\nEmperor Pedro II of Brazil recorded a number of bilingual Hebrew-Shuadit religious poems.\n\nIn 1498, the French Jews were formally expelled from France. Although the community was not finally compelled to depart until 1501, much of the community had by then become dispersed into other regions, notably Genoa, and the underdeveloped regions of Germany. However, the Comtat Venaissin was then under the direct control of the Pope, and a small Jewish community continued to live there in relative isolation. From the time of the French Revolution, when French Jews were permitted to live legally anywhere in France as full citizens, the status of Shuadit began to decline rapidly. The last known native speaker, Armand Lunel, died in 1977.\n\n"}

It was dramatized based on the incident 'Revenge of Soga Brothers'. The story is often known as \"The (illustrated) Tale of the Soga Brothers\" or \"The revenge of the Soga brothers\". It is sometimes written as \"Soga Monogatari Zue\" (\"The Tale of the Soga brothers in pictures\"). It is regarded by some as the last of the \"Gunki monogatari\" or great \"war tales\".\n\nThe brothers are Soga Jūrō and Soga Gorō. Jūrō being the older of the two. When the boys were younger they were known as Ichimanmaru and Hakoomaru. In Japanese the Soga brothers are described as Soga kyodai. Their names are also written as Soga no Gorō and Soga no Jūrō. The name Soga is the name of their stepfather, which became their surname after their mother remarried. The name of their biological father was Kawazu-Saburō.\n\n\"The Tale of the Soga Brothers\" origin cannot be traced to a single creator. Like most of these historical stories, it is the result of the compounding of (often differing) versions passed down through an oral or other tradition. The origin of the story may be true, but the story is probably romanticised. In some versions of the story it is only revealed at the end that the main character is actually one of the brothers.\n\n\"The Tale of the Soga Brothers\" is an example of \"blood revenge\", similar to a vendetta.\n\nEvents take place in Japan in the 12th century. The general accepted version is that the father of the two boys was killed (the reasons differ, but it was probably an argument over land rights) when they were infants. As adults they became skilled fighters intent on avenging their father and retrieving his sword Tomokirimaru. The villain is usually Kudō Suketsune, a retainer of the \"shōgun\" (probably Minamoto no Yoritomo). Jūrō is killed in the fighting as is Kudō Suketsune. Gorō dies later (by execution).\n\nThe story has been the subject of many Noh, kabuki and bunraku performances. There are also updated versions such as Sukeroku (\"The Flower of Edo\") (an 18th century kabuki play, which is regarded as one of the \"Kabuki Jūhachiban\"). It is also said that the Soga tales in \"Kōwakamai\" are based on this tale.\n\nThe story and its performers have been popular subjects for woodblock prints, netsuke and okimono.\n\nThe story has also been the subject of a number of films.\n\nIn Japan there are many statues of the brothers (such as the famous statue in the Hachiman Jinja in Kawazu, Shizuoka). According to tradition they were buried at the foot of Mount Fuji, there is a sculpture of their tombs among the stone statues in Hakone.\n\nOtodome Falls is one of the locations in a version of the tale from the Kamakura period.\n\nThere is no relation with the Soga clan.\n\nThe story was translated by Thomas J. Cogan. This translation was reviewed by Laurence Kominz in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies.\n\n"}
{"id": "441357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441357", "title": "Somali language", "text": "Somali language\n\nSomali ( ) is an Afroasiatic language belonging to the Cushitic branch. It is spoken as a mother tongue by Somalis in Greater Somalia and the Somali diaspora. Somali is an official language of Somaliland, Somalia, a national language in Djibouti, and a working language in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. It is used as an adoptive language by a few neighboring ethnic minority groups and individuals. The Somali language is written officially with the Latin alphabet.\n\nSomali is classified within the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family; specifically, as Lowland East Cushitic along with Afar and Saho. Somali is the best-documented Cushitic language, with academic studies of the language dating back to the late 19th century.\n\nSomali is spoken by Somalis in Somalia, Somaliland, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Yemen, Kenya, and by the Somali diaspora. It is also spoken as an adoptive language by a few ethnic minority groups and individuals in these areas.\n\nSomali is the second most widely spoken Cushitic language after Oromo.\n\nAs of 2006, there were approximately 16.6 million speakers of Somali, of which around 8.3 million resided in Somalia. The language is spoken by an estimated 95% of the country's inhabitants, and also by a majority of the population in Djibouti.\n\nFollowing the start of the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s, the Somali-speaking diaspora increased in size, with newer Somali speech communities forming in parts of the Middle East, North America and Europe.\n\nConstitutionally, Somali and Arabic are the two official languages of Somalia. Somali has been an official national language since January 1973, when the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) declared it the Somali Democratic Republic's primary language of administration and education. Somali was thereafter established as the main language of academic instruction in forms 1 through 4, following preparatory work by the government-appointed Somali Language Committee. It later expanded to include all 12 forms in 1979. In 1972, the SRC adopted a Latin orthography as the official national alphabet over several other writing scripts that were then in use. Concurrently, the Italian-language daily newspaper \"Stella d'Ottobre\" was nationalized, renamed to \"Xiddigta Oktoobar\" (\"The October Star\"), and began publishing in Somali. The state-run Radio Mogadishu has also broadcast in Somali since 1943. Additionally, the regional public networks the Puntland TV and Radio and Somaliland National TV, as well as Eastern Television Network and Horn Cable Television, among other private broadcasters, air programs in Somali.\n\nSomali is recognized as an official working language in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. Although it is not an official language of Djibouti, it constitutes a major national language there. Somali is used in television and radio broadcasts, with the government-operated Radio Djibouti transmitting programs in the language from 1943 onwards.\n\nThe Somali language is regulated by the Regional Somali Language Academy, an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 in Djibouti City by the governments of Djibouti, Somalia and Ethiopia. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.\n\nAs of 2013, Somali is also one of the featured languages available on Google Translate.\n\nSomali linguistic varieties are broadly divided into three main groups: Northern, Benadir and Maay. Northern Somali (or Nsom) forms the basis for Standard Somali. It is spoken by more than 60% of the entire Somali population, with its speech area stretching from northern Somalia to parts of the eastern and southwestern sections of the country. This widespread modern distribution is a result of a long series of southward population movements over the past ten centuries from the Gulf of Aden littoral. Lamberti subdivides Northern Somali is into three dialects: Northern Somali proper (spoken in the northwest; he describes this dialect as Northern Somali in the proper sense), the Darod group (spoken in the northeast and along the eastern Ethiopia frontier; greatest number of speakers overall), and the Lower Juba group (spoken by northern Somali settlers in the southern riverine areas). \n\nBenadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the central Indian Ocean seaboard, including Mogadishu. It forms a relatively large group. The dialect is fairly mutually intelligible with Northern Somali.\n\nMaay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle (Rahanweyn or Sab) clans in the southern regions of Somalia. Its speech area extends from the southwestern border with Ethiopia to a region close to the coastal strip between Mogadishu and Kismayo, including the city of Baidoa. Maay is not mutually comprehensible with Northern Somali, and it differs in sentence structure and phonology. It is also not generally used in education or media. However, Maay speakers often use Standard Somali as a lingua franca, which is learned via mass communications, internal migration and urbanization.\n\nMaay is closely related with the Jiddu, Dabarre, Garre and Tunni varieties that are also spoken by smaller Rahanweyn communities. Collectively, these languages present similarities with Oromo that are not found in mainstream Somali. Chief among these is the lack of pharyngeal sounds in the Rahanweyn/Digil and Mirifle languages, features which by contrast typify Somali. Although in the past frequently classified as dialects of Somali, more recent research by the linguist Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi has shown that these varieties, including Maay, constitute separate Cushitic languages. The degree of divergence is comparable to that between Spanish and Portuguese. Of the Digil varieties, Jiddu is the most incomprehensible to Benadir and Northern speakers. Despite these linguistic differences, Somali speakers collectively view themselves as speaking a common language.\n\nSomali has 22 consonant phonemes.\nThe consonants often weaken to intervocalically. The retroflex plosive may have an implosive quality for some speakers, and intervocalically it can be realized as the flap . Some speakers produce with epiglottal trilling. is often epiglottalized.\n\nThe language has five basic vowels. Each has a front and back variation as well as long or short versions. This gives a distinct 20 pure vowel sounds. It also exhibits three tones: high, low and falling. Vowels harmonize within a harmonic group, so all vowels within the group must either be front or back. The Somali orthography does not distinguish between the front and back variants of vowels, however, as there are few minimal pairs.\n\nThe syllable structure of Somali is (C)V(C). Root morphemes usually have a mono- or di-syllabic structure.\n\nPitch is phonemic in Somali, but it is debated whether Somali is a pitch accent or tonal language. Andrzejewski (1954) posits that Somali is a tonal language, whereas Banti (1988) suggests that it is a pitch accent language.\n\nSomali is an agglutinative language, and also shows properties of inflection. Affixes mark many grammatical meanings, including aspect, tense and case.\n\nSomali has an old prefixal verbal inflection restricted to four common verbs, with all other verbs undergoing inflection by more obvious suffixation. This general pattern is similar to the stem alternation that typifies Cairene Arabic.\n\nChanges in pitch are used for grammatical rather than lexical purposes. This includes distinctions of gender, number and case. In some cases, these distinctions are marked by tone alone (e.g. \"Ínan\", \"boy\"; \"inán\", \"girl\").\n\nSomali has two sets of pronouns: independent (substantive, emphatic) pronouns and clitic (verbal) pronouns. The independent pronouns behave grammatically as nouns, and normally occur with the suffixed article -ka/-ta (e.g. \"adiga\", \"you\"). This article may be omitted after a conjunction or focus word. For example, \"adna\" meaning \"and you...\" (from \"adi\"-\"na\"). Clitic pronouns are attached to the verb and do not take nominal morphology. Somali marks clusivity in the first person plural pronouns; this is also found in a number of other East Cushitic languages, such as Rendille and Dhaasanac.\n\nAs in various other Afro-Asiatic languages, Somali has gender polarity whereby plural nouns usually take the opposite gender agreement of their singular forms. For example, the plural of the masculine noun \"dibi\" (\"bull\") is formed by converting it into feminine \"dibi\". Somali is unusual among the world's languages in that the object is unmarked for case while the subject is marked, though this feature is found in other Cushitic languages such as Oromo.\n\nSomali is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language. It is largely head final, with postpositions and with obliques preceding verbs. These are common features of the Cushitic and Semitic Afroasiatic languages spoken in the Horn region (e.g. Amharic). However, Somali noun phrases are head-initial, whereby the noun precedes its modifying adjective. This pattern of general head-finality with head-initial noun phrases is also found in other Cushitic languages (e.g. Oromo), but not generally in Ethiopian Semitic languages.\n\nSomali uses three focus markers: \"baa\", \"ayaa\" and \"waxa(a)\", which generally mark new information or contrastive emphasis. \"Baa\" and \"ayaa\" require the focused element to occur preverbally, while \"waxa(a)\" may be used following the verb.\n\nSomali loanwords can be divided into those derived from other Afroasiatic languages (mainly Arabic), and those of Indo-European extraction (mainly Italian).\n\nSomali's main lexical borrowings come from Arabic, and are estimated to constitute about 20% of the language's vocabulary. This is a legacy of the Somali people's extensive social, cultural, commercial and religious links and contacts with nearby populations in the Arabian peninsula. Arabic loanwords are most commonly used in religious, administrative and education-related speech (e.g. \"aamiin\" for \"faith in God\"), though they are also present in other areas (e.g. \"kubbad-da\", \"ball\"). Soravia (1994) noted a total of 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985, a prominent 40,000-entry Somali dictionary. Most of the terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical borrowings may have been more extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work. In addition, the majority of personal names are derived from Arabic.\n\nThe Somali language also contains a few Indo-European loanwords that were retained from the colonial period. Most of these lexical borrowings come from English and Italian and are used to describe new objects or modern concepts (e.g. \"telefishen-ka\", \"television\"; \"raadia-ha\", \"radio\"). There are as well 300 directly Romance loans, such as \"garawati\" for \"tie\" (from the Italian \"\").\n\nIndeed the most used loanwords from the Italian are \"ciao\" as a friendly salute, \"dimuqraadi\" from Italian \"democratico\" (democratic), \"mikroskoob\" from \"microscopio (microscope), \"Jalaato\" from \"gelato\" (ice cream), \"baasto\" from \"pasta\" (pasta), \"bataate\" from \"patate\" (potato), \"bistoolad\" from \"pistol\" (pistol), \"fiyoore\" from \"fiore\" (flower) and \"injinyeer\" from \"ingegnere\" (engineer). Somalis call their calendar months as Soon, soonfur, siditaal, carafa...but these changed recently. Furthermore, all the months in Somalian language are now loaned words from the Italian, like \"Febraayo\" that comes from \"febbraio\" (February).\n\nAdditionally, Somali contains lexical terms from Persian, Urdu and Hindi that were acquired through historical trade with communities in the Near East and South Asia (e.g. \"khiyaar\" \"cucumber\" from \"khiyār\"). Some of these words were also borrowed indirectly via Arabic.\n\nAs part of a broader governmental effort to ensure and safeguard the primacy of the Somali language, the past few decades have seen a push in Somalia toward replacement of loanwords in general with their Somali equivalents or neologisms. To this end, the Supreme Revolutionary Council during its tenure officially prohibited the borrowing and use of English and Italian terms.\n\nArchaeological excavations and research in Somalia uncovered ancient inscriptions in a distinct writing system. In an 1878 report to the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain, scientist Johann Maria Hildebrandt noted upon visiting the area that \"we know from ancient authors that these districts, at present so desert, were formerly populous and civilised[...] I also discovered ancient ruins and rock-inscriptions both in pictures and characters[...] These have hitherto not been deciphered.\" According to Somalia's Ministry of Information and National Guidance, this script represents the earliest written attestation of Somali.\n\nBesides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing the Somali language include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad writing. According to Bogumił Andrzejewski, this usage was limited to Somali clerics and their associates, as sheikhs preferred to write in the liturgical Arabic language. Various such historical manuscripts in Somali nonetheless exist, which mainly consist of Islamic poems (qasidas), recitations and chants. Among these texts are the Somali poems by Sheikh Uways and Sheikh Ismaaciil Faarah. The rest of the existing historical literature in Somali principally consists of translations of documents from Arabic.\n\nSince then a number of writing systems have been used for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the Somali Latin alphabet, officially adopted in 1972, is the most widely used and the official. The script was developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except \"p\", \"v\" and \"z\". There are no diacritics or other special characters except the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop, which does not occur word-initially. There are three consonant digraphs: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished.\n\nWriting systems developed in the twentieth century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare alphabets, which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare, respectively.\n\nwaabariis\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are most frequently used in pulp magazines, comic books, science fiction, television programs, and films as the key attribute of a superhero. The concept originated in American comic books and pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, and has gradually worked its way into other genres and media.\n\nThere is no rigid definition of a \"superpower.\" In popular culture, it may be used to describe anything from minimal exaggeration of normal human traits to magic, flight, super strength, projection of destructive energy beams and force fields, invulnerability, telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, super speed, or weather control.\n\nGenerally speaking, exceptional-but-not-superhuman fictional characters like Batman, Iron Man, Green Arrow, and the Punisher may be classified as superheroes even though they do not have any actual superhuman abilities. Similarly, characters with superhuman abilities derived from artificial, external sources, like the Six Million Dollar Man's bionic limbs, Green Lantern's power ring, and Tony Stark's Iron Man armor, may be described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.\n\nIn fiction, seemingly impossible superpowers are often given scientific, quasi-scientific, pseudoscientific, or supernatural explanations. Superpowers based on possible current or future technology, such as mechanized suits, rockets, bionics and genetic manipulation, are typically explained using science and science fiction. Superpowers based on psychic and paranormal phenomena, for example, are typically explained using supernatural/otherworldly ideas, parapsychology, or even pseudoscience. Other superpowers may be explained using mythology.\n\nThe 1970s brought the development of role-playing games like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Superhero-themed games soon followed, but within the game mechanics of role-playing game systems, issues such as the name or visible effects of a form of attack became apparent. The \"Champions\" role-playing game handled this by describing powers by their effects rather than their causes; for example, a laser and a lightning bolt were both considered to be forms of a ranged attack. Another issue was that some powers were simply more useful than others in terms of gameplay; \"Champions\" handled this as well by assigning each power a \"value\" in a point system, with more powerful or useful abilities costing more points to \"buy.\" \"Champions\" also gave players options to modify their characters' powers, allowing each character's abilities to be unique. This system has influenced many other similar games since.\n\nIn the 1980s, Marvel Comics began publishing their \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\" series, in which the powers of their characters were explained in great detail, often using scientific and pseudo-scientific terms. Issues of persecution in relation to the possession of superpowers have also been expanded upon; an example of this is the persecution of mutants in the \"X-Men\" series.\n\nSuperpowers are a commonly used concept in manga and anime, particularly in the shonen genre. They are often featured in popular manga and anime such as Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, HunterxHunter, Naruto, and Code Geass. The types of powers featured vary from anime to anime. Some anime, such as Dragon Ball Z, feature many different characters who have the same types of powers; others, such as One Piece, feature characters with a wide range of different powers, with many powers being unique to only one or a few characters.\n\n\n"}

Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. \n\nIrving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a $500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. \n\nAt the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he will be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of Noah Dietrich, a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions.\n\nAs work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President Richard Nixon. He believes that Hughes sent the package and convinces himself that Hughes wants this damaging material included in the book, as a sign he supports the work. \n\nAs the publication date draws near, Irving elaborates his hoax, staging an \"aborted\" meeting between Hughes and the publishers. Hughes has officially denied that he was involved in the work, but the McGraw-Hill executives are convinced it is genuine. They begin to think it will be a bestseller and Irving works to gain larger payments for himself and (purportedly) Hughes. Irving and Edith concoct a scheme for her to deposit Hughes' check, payable to H. R. Hughes, into a Swiss bank account, using a forged passport with the name Helga R. Hughes.\n\nThe continuing drama makes Irving increasingly paranoid. He has alcohol-fueled fantasies about being kidnapped by Hughes' people. His affair with Van Pallandt continues, and the pressure of keeping up a pretense of fidelity with his wife adds to his stress. In what is implied to be a favor to Nixon, Hughes goes public via a televised conference call and denies any knowledge of Irving or the book. Irving is arrested and agrees to cooperate if Edith is granted immunity. At a press conference, a government spokesman announces Irving, Edith, and Suskind have received short jail sentences.\n\nAn overheard radio report details a sudden wave of legal decisions in favor of Hughes. Irving believes this indicates that his book had been used to place the president in debt to Hughes. A fleeting scene set inside the Nixon White House suggests that Nixon's preoccupation with Hughes led directly to the burglary and wiretapping of Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. Historians and political analysts dispute this.\n\n\nPortions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California. Irving was hired by the producers as technical adviser. The screenplay was changed considerably from the book, and Irving was unhappy with the result. He said, \"after reading the final script I asked that my name be removed from the movie credits.\"\n\nA.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" said the film was \"for the most part a jumpy, suspenseful caper, full of narrow escapes, improbable reversals and complicated intrigue. But it has a sinister, shadowy undertow, an intimation of dread that lingers after Irving’s game is up.\"\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film was \"an unexpectedly satisfying fantasia of reality and imagination, a meditation on the nature of lies and deception, on how we come to embrace not the truth but what it suits us to believe ... sharply written ... and gracefully directed.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" rated the film 3 1⁄2 out of four stars and described it as a \"devilish and devastating satire.\" He added, \"Gere gives 'em the old razzle-dazzle with his roguish charm and sharp comic timing. The surprise is the unexpected feeling he brings to this challenging role.\"\n\nDeborah Young of \"Variety\" describe the film as a \"breezy, fast-paced, somewhat loose-ended account [that] offers a surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice.\"\n\nThe film was ranked as one of the Top 10 of the year by the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"Newsweek.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an 85% positive rate, based on 151 reviews, while on Metacritic, the film scored 70 out of 100, based on 37 reviews.\n\n\"The Hoax\" was given a limited opening in 235 theaters in the United States and Canada on April 6, 2007 and earning $1,449,320 on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $7,164,995 in the US and Canada and $4,607,188 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $11,772,183.\n\nThe London Film Critics Circle nominated Alfred Molina for British Supporting Actor of the Year, and Richard Gere was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nWhile the major events portrayed did take place, the film takes several dramatic liberties. It eliminates all scenes from the book set in Ibiza, where Irving owned a farmhouse and wrote much of the book. \n\nThe author described the film as \"a historically cockeyed story\" and decried its characterizations as inaccurate. He was unhappy with being portrayed as \"desperate and humorless, a washed-up hack writer who lives in a conservative New York suburb.\" Irving observed, \"The movie misses the point that the Howard Hughes hoax was a live-action adventure story concocted by two middle-aged hippie expat writers and a Swiss heiress. Edith, my then-wife, a woman of great zest, is portrayed as a dull hausfrau, and Nina van Pallandt, my Danish mistress, as barely one level above a New York hotel hooker. Dick Suskind, witty friend and co-conspirator, is offered to the public as a self-righteous, sweaty buffoon. The scenes that deal with Movie Clifford feuding with Movie Dick, getting him drunk and hiring a bargirl to seduce him, are totally fictional. The Hughes people mailing the package of files to me is also made up.\"\n\n\n"}

It is the final novel in \"The Strain Trilogy\" beginning with \"The Strain\" and continuing with \"The Fall\".\n\nTwo years have passed since the vampires, led by the Master, used atomic weapons to create a nuclear winter, which blocked the sun and allowed the vampires to move freely, except for a few hours a day. The vampires restructured society as a police state. The strongest and the most influential humans were exterminated and those who were spared were made slaves. The weak were forced into camps to harvest their blood.\n\nA few survivors manage to resist the vampire occupation. Epidemiologist Dr Ephraim Goodweather grows distant from his friends. The Master, occupying the body of rock star Gabriel Bolivar, adopted Goodweather's son Zach as his protégé and is grooming the boy to be his next host body. Goodweather's lover, Dr Nora Martinez, left him for exterminator Vasiliy Fet. Following the death of his friend Abraham Setrakian, Fet struggles to decipher the \"Occido Lumen\", a tome holding the key to defeating the Master. He is aided by Mr Quinlan, the vengeful half-vampire who was created when the Master infected his then-pregnant human mother.\n\nFlashbacks to biblical times reveal the origins of the vampire race. The seven Ancients, including the Master, arose from Ozryel - the archangel of death. Ozryel was one of the three angels that God sent to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness. Ozryel was overpowered by blood lust while he destroyed the cities, being particularly enthralled by blood itself. When committing other atrocities necessary for cleansing the world he had not actually glimpsed blood prior to destroying these cities. Soon after, he betrayed and attacked Michael, in order to drink his fellow archangel's blood. Appalled by Ozryel's actions, God punished him by having the other archangels cut his body into seven pieces and scattering them across the Earth. Over time, Ozryel's blood leaked from the burial sites and became sentient, spawning the Ancient Ones. The Master was the last to spawn, from Ozryel's throat.\n\nGoodweather deciphers the \"Occido Lumen\" and determines that the Master originated on one of the Thousand Islands located in Lake Ontario. The survivors detonate a nuclear weapon on the island, killing Goodweather, Zach, Mr Quinlan, and the Master. After the explosion, Nora and Vasily witness a reunion of the purified Ozryel with Gabriel and Michael, who had come to take Ozryel back to Heaven. The return was only made possible by Mr Quinlan, who brought the Ancients' ashes with him after following the instructions he read in the Lumen. After the Master's death, the remaining vampires disintegrate and the surviving humans are able to rebuild society.\n\nStephen King wrote: \"Although there is a certain amount of dispensable hugger-mugger about vampires in Rome and archangels located in Sodom,the main attractions here is the resistance fighters' fierce dedication to their cause. Heroes of tragic dimension are rare in popular fiction, but Goodweather fills the void perfectly. [...] The action is non-stop and the fantasy element is anchored in enough satisfying detail to make it believable. [... ] There's something about seeing vampires massing for an attack in a Wendy's parking lot, an act making them more real.\" The \"San Francisco Chronicle\"s Alan Cheuse wrote: \"The novel comes to us in a weird, loose style in which multiple view points proliferate, constantly shifting and re-forming the story, resembling nothing less than montage of fear-making moments that we love to hate.\"\n\nWriter David Lapham and artist Mike Huddleston adapted the novel into an 11-issue story arc for the eponymous comic-book series from Dark Horse Comics.\n\nExecutive producer and showrunner Carlton Cuse adapted the novel into the eponymous television series from FX.\n"}
