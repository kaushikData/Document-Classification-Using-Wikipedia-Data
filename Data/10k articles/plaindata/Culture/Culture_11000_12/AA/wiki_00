Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, auditions, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.\n\nThere are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill. \nSpecialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is Dewar Studios in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.\n\n"}

An example would be the threat \"Get out, or else—!\" This device often portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or modesty. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation, an em dash (—) or an ellipsis (…) may be used.\n\n<poem>\n\"hinc mihi prima malis labes, hinc semper Vlixes\"\n\"criminibus terrere nouis, hinc spargere uoces\"\n\"in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma.\"\n\"nec requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministro—\"\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nThis was the time when the first onslaught of ruin began for me.\nUlixes kept terrifying me with new accusations,\nkept spreading ambiguous rumors among the people,\nand kept looking for quarrel.\nNor did he in fact ever stop, until with the help of Calchas—\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nNo, you unnatural hags,\nI will have such revenges on you both,\nThat all the world shall— I will do such things,—\nWhat they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\nThe terrors of the earth.

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! \n\nIn syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the \"if\" clause (protasis) of a condition is stated without an ensuing \"then\" clause, or apodosis. Because an aposiopesis implies a trailing off of thought, it is never directly followed by a period, which would effectively result in four consecutive dots.\n\n"}

{"id": "1198160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1198160", "title": "Cabinet of curiosities", "text": "Cabinet of curiosities\n\nCabinets of curiosities (also known in German loanwords as Kunstkabinett, Kunstkammer or Wunderkammer; also Cabinets of Wonder, and wonder-rooms) were encyclopedic collections of objects the categorical boundaries of which were, in Renaissance Europe, yet to be defined. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings), and antiquities. \"The Kunstkammer was regarded as a microcosm or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron's control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction.\" Of Charles I of England's collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, \"The \"Kunstkabinett\" itself was a form of propaganda.\" Besides the most famous, best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums.\n\nThe term \"cabinet\" originally described a room rather than a piece of furniture. The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. The Kunstkammer of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the Hradschin at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided a solace and retreat for contemplation that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates. Rudolf's uncle, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, also had a collection, with a special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle in Austria.\n\nThe earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in Ferrante Imperato's \"Dell'Historia Naturale\" (Naples 1599) (\"illustration, left\"). It serves to authenticate its author's credibility as a source of natural history information, in showing his open bookcases at the right, in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his herbarium. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a \"studiolo\" with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens. Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.\n\nIn 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised Christian I of Saxony that three types of item were indispensable in forming a \"Kunstkammer\" or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly \"curious items from home or abroad\"; and thirdly \"antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals\". When Albrecht Dürer visited the Netherlands in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the East Indies. The highly characteristic range of interests represented in Frans II Francken's painting of 1636 (\"illustration, left\") shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the \"Adoration of the Magi\") intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely amber, which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculpture both classical and secular (the sacrificing \"Libera\", a Roman fertility goddess) on the one hand and modern and religious (\"Christ at the Column\") are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark's tooth): portrait miniatures, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia chiaroscuro woodcuts or drawings, and a small still-life painting leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.\n\nTwo of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of Ole Worm, known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (\"illustration, above right\"), and Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork automata; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently mythical creatures. Worm's collection contained, for example, what he thought was a Scythian Lamb, a woolly fern thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the narwhal's tusk as coming from a whale rather than a unicorn, as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Belsazar Hacquet (c. 1735–1815) operated in Ljubljana, then the capital of Carniola, a natural history cabinet () that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, the Russian grand duke Paul and Pope Pius VI, as well as by famous naturalists, such as and . It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the Idrija mine, a \"herbarium vivum\" with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an anatomical theatre.\n\nCabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm's collection, published as the \"Museum Wormianum\" (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm's speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.\n\nCabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many monarchs, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the Studiolo of Francesco I, the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. Frederick III of Denmark, who added Worm's collection to his own after Worm's death, was another such monarch. A third example is the Kunstkamera founded by Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from Albertus Seba and Frederik Ruysch. The fabulous Habsburg Imperial collection included important Aztec artifacts, including the feather head-dress or crown of Montezuma now in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna. \nSimilar collections on a smaller scale were the complex \"Kunstschränke\" produced in the early seventeenth century by the Augsburg merchant, diplomat and collector Philipp Hainhofer. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1632, which is kept in the Museum Gustavianum in Uppsala. The curio cabinet, as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.\n\nThe juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp's analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.\n\nA late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the Grünes Gewölbe, the \"Green Vaults\" formed by Augustus the Strong in Dresden to display his chamber of wonders. The \"Enlightenment Gallery\" in the British Museum, installed in the former \"Kings Library\" room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.\n\nIn seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a \"cabinet\" came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly objects of \"virtù\" or curiosities, such as a \"virtuoso\" would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, Michael Bernhard Valentini published an early museological work, \"Museum Museorum\", an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.\n\nSome strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial freak shows and sideshows.\n\nSir Hans Sloane (1660–1753) was an English physician, a member of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians, and the founder of the British Museum in London. He began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the Duke of Albemarle offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, \"Natural History of Jamaica\", published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g., snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.\n\nSloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. Herman Boerhaave gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave's gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased Leonard Plukenet's collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715), left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend Adam Buddle gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Englebert Kaempfer's volume of Japanese plants and James Petiver's virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. Mark Catesby gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. Philip Miller gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the Chelsea Physic Garden.\n\nSloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Eskimos, South America, the Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.\n\"These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain James Cook in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the British Empire.\"\nUpon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, George II's royal library was added to Sloane’s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.\n\nJohn Tradescant the elder (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, John Tradescant the younger (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to Powhatan, father of Pocahontas. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g., the dodo from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g., wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g., a mermaid's hand, a dragon's egg, two feathers of a phoenix's tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant's Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.\n\nElias Ashmole (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, Freemason, and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in astrology, alchemy, and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of \"Musaeum Tradescantianum\", a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the University of Oxford, provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole’s donation formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.\n\nCabinets of Curiosities can now be found at Snowshill Manor and Wallington Hall. The concept has been reinterpreted at The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History.\n\nCabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular curiosities of their curators but as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be \"the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic,\" or the less grandiose, \"the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes.\" Evans goes on to explain that \"no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design\".\n\nIn addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the Royal Society, whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, it is important to note that the Fellows in this period supported the idea of “learned entertainment,” or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.\n\nPlaces of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was “a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the English Civil War and Interregum [sic].” This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which “[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.” A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as “something much more like a gentleman’s club,” an idea supported by John Evelyn, who depicts the Royal Society as “an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty’s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.”\n\nThomas Dent Mütter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The Mütter Museum began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including Benjamin Rush's medical chest and Florence Nightingale's sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, Joseph Hyrtl (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the \"soap lady\"; the conjoined liver and death cast of Chang and Eng Bunker, the Siamese twins; and in 1893, Grover Cleveland's jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.\n\nP. T. Barnum took over Barnum's American Museum on five floors in New York, \"perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum's famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, \"THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!\" at the exit door\".\n\nIn 1908, New York businessmen formed the Hobby Club, a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their \"cabinets of wonder\" and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and incunable; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.\n\n\nThe Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato's Dell'Historia Naturale. In Los Angeles, the modern-day Museum of Jurassic Technology anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused. In Spring Green, Wisconsin, the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as House on the Rock, can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In Bristol, Rhode Island, Musée Patamécanique is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by Pataphysics. The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, \"Cabinet\" magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how \"amazement\" is manifested within today's artistic discourse. The May of 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called \"Wunder Kammer\", the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.\n\nSeveral internet bloggers describe their sites as a wunderkammern either because they are primarily made up of links to things that are interesting, or because they inspire wonder in a similar manner to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). The researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as YouTube as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions \"just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century.\"\n\n\n\nHistoric cabinets\n\nModern \"cabinets\"\n"}

{"id": "3708604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3708604", "title": "Cheriyal scroll painting", "text": "Cheriyal scroll painting\n\nCheriyal Scroll Painting is a stylized version of Nakashi art, rich in the local motifs peculiar to the Telangana. They are at present made only in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The scrolls are painted in a narrative format, much like a film roll or a comic strip, depicting stories from Indian mythology, and intimately tied to the shorter stories from the Puranas and Epics. Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, Cheriyal scrolls must have been popular across Telangana in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the Cheriyal town.\n\nScroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.\n\nIn India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its \"Pabuji ki Pad\", \"Devenarayana katha\" as also stories from the legend of \"Dhola and Maru\". Goa evolved the \"Dasavathara\", as Maharashtra did \"Pinguli\" and the \"Chitra Katha\" traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the \"Prasasti Patra\". Orissa and Bengal are famous for their \"Patachitra\" traditions.\n\nWhile the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the Cheriyal paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the Telangana region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the Kalamkari tradition across Telangana in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.\n\nTo quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - \"Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from Tirupati that is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in Patanjali's \"Mahabhashya\" (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in Panini's grammar, the \"Ashtadhyayi\" (c. 5th century BC), Patanjali takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, \"yamapattaka\", seem to have been particularly popular.\"\n\nThe Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of Telangana also made dolls, much like the Kinnal dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of Telangana. As these paintings are now confined to Cheriyal village, they are called Cheriyal scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (\"Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali\") the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies. It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.\n\nAt present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing by\nthe families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Venkataramana,\nD.Pavan Kumar.\nDhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work\nfrom his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at\nthe age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is\nliving at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of\n20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started\ndoing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,\nRakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and\ncertificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.\n\nToday the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as \"Kaki Padagollu\". They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the Puranas and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.\n\nIn a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.\n\nThe scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about \nthree feet in width and went up to 40 – 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.\n\nBy virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics Cheriyal Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.\n\nThe making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The Khadi cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.\nOnce the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.\nThe colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.\nDolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.\n\nCheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:\n\n• Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical Tanjore painting and Mysore painting. For example, the artist hardly bothers about perspective in Cheriyal paintings and sets out the narrative by placing the relevant figures in appropriate order and position in the relevant background. The iconography of even the major deities like Shiva, Vishnu, etc. has a strong local idiom.\n\n•The subjects of these scroll paintings are easy to relate to – as the themes and stories are familiar – drawn from ancient literary, mythological and folk traditions. The common themes are from the Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shiva Puranam, Markandeya Puranam interspersed with the ballads and folk-stories of communities like Gauda, Madiga and so on.\n\n• The main narrative is spiced up with scenes from simple rural life - Women doing chores in the kitchen, men working in the paddy fields or boozing away in merry abandon, festival scenes, etc. are endearingly depicted.\n\n• The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.\n\n• Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc. However more often than not, the proportion of individual characters is determined by their relative importance in that particular scene, with the most important character being the largest and most detailed and the lesser characters being smaller and less detailed.\n\nCheriyal scroll painting received Intellectual Property Rights Protection or Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2007.\n\n\n"}

The convention entered into force in 2006, after thirtieth instruments of ratification by UNESCO Member States. As of September 2018, 178 states have ratified, approved or accepted the convention.\n\nThe Convention contains following provisions:\n\nI. General Provisions\n\nII. Organs of the Convention\n\nIII. Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the national level\n\nIV. Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the international level\n\nV. International cooperation and assistance\n\nVI. Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund\n\nVII. Reports\n\nVIII. Transitional clause\n\nIX. Final clauses\n\nUnlike other UNESCO conventions, this convention begins with stating its purposes, which are;\nIntangible cultural heritage refers to \"traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts\". The Convention defines it as follows:\n\nThe Convention works on both national and international levels.\nAt the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‘take necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.” These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on. Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must “endeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management”.\n\nAt the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes “the exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance” to other State Parties.\n\nLists\n\nThe Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are\n\nIntangible Cultural Heritage Fund\n\nThe Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.\n\nOne of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982. This Conference defined cultural heritage as including “both tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,” and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage.\n\nIn 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage. This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful. However, in the late 90's, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.\n\nIn 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.\n\nAccording to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard.\n\nIn 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ’heritage in all forms’. This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.\n\nAs a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also at times used indiscriminately and pejoratively against any person of white background. However, it is sometimes used in a neutral or positive context or self-descriptively with pride in reference to a native of Florida or Georgia (see Florida cracker and Georgia cracker).\n\nA 1783 pejorative use of \"crackers\" specifies men who \"are descended from convicts that were transported from Great Britain to Virginia at different times, and inherit so much profligacy from they ancestors, that they are the most abandoned set of men on earth\". Benjamin Franklin, in his memoirs (1790), referred to \"a race of runnagates and crackers, equally wild and savage as the Indians\" who inhabit the \"desert[ed] woods and mountains\".\n\nThe term could have also derived from the Middle English \"cnac\", \"craic\", or \"crak\", which originally meant the sound of a cracking whip but came to refer to \"loud conversation, bragging talk\". In Elizabethan times this could refer to \"entertaining conversation\" (one may be said to \"crack\" a joke) and \"cracker\" could be used to describe loud braggarts; this term and the Gaelic spelling craic are still in use in Ireland, Scotland and Northern England. It is documented in Shakespeare's \"King John\" (1595): \"What cracker is this same that deafs our ears with this abundance of superfluous breath?\" This usage is illustrated in a letter to the Earl of Dartmouth which reads: \n\nThe compound \"corn-cracker\" was used of poor white farmers (by 1808), especially of Georgians, but also extended to residents of northern Florida, from the cracked kernels of corn which formed the staple food of this class of people.\nThis possibility is cited in the 1911 edition of \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", but the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"cracker\", definition 4) says a derivation of the 18th-century simplex \"cracker\" from the 19th-century compound \"corn-cracker\" is doubtful.\n\nIt has been suggested that white slave foremen in the antebellum South were called \"crackers\" owing to their practice of \"cracking the whip\" to drive and punish slaves. Whips were also cracked over pack animals, so \"cracker\" may have referred to whip cracking more generally.\n\n\"Cracker\" has also been used as a proud or jocular self-description. With the huge influx of new residents from the North, \"cracker\" is used informally by some white residents of Florida and Georgia (\"Florida cracker\" or \"Georgia cracker\") to indicate that their family has lived there for many generations. However, the term \"white cracker\" is seldom used self-referentially and remains a \"slur\" for Caucasians.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, a prominent landscape architect from Connecticut, visited the South as a journalist in the 1850s and wrote that \"some crackers owned a good many Negroes, and were by no means so poor as their appearance indicated.\"\n\nIn \"On the Origin of Species\", Charles Darwin quotes a Professor Wyman as saying, \"one of the 'crackers' (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, 'we select the black members of a litter [of pigs] for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living.\"\n\nIn 1947, the student body of Florida State University voted on the name of their athletic symbol. From a list of more than 100 choices, Seminoles was selected. The other finalists, in order of finish, were \"Statesmen\", \"Rebels\", \"Tarpons\", \"Fighting Warriors\", and \"Crackers\".\nBefore the Milwaukee Braves baseball team moved to Atlanta, the Atlanta minor league baseball team was known as the \"Atlanta Crackers\". The team existed under this name from 1901 until 1965. They were members of the Southern Association from their inception until 1961, and members of the International League from 1961 until they were moved to Richmond, Virginia in 1965. However, it is suggested the name was derived from players \"cracking\" the baseball bat and this origin makes sense when considering the Atlanta Negro League Baseball team was known as the \"Atlanta Black Crackers\".\n\nSinger-songwriter Randy Newman, on his socio-politically themed album \"Good Old Boys\" (1974) uses the term \"cracker\" on the song \"Kingfish\" (\"I'm a cracker, You one too, Gonna take good care of you\"). The song's subject is Huey Long, populist Governor and then Senator for Louisiana (1928–1935). The term is also used in \"Louisiana 1927\" from the same album, where the line \"Ain't it a shame what the river has done to this poor cracker's land\" is attributed to President Coolidge.\n\nIn 2008, former President Bill Clinton used the term \"cracker\" on \"Larry King Live\" to describe white voters he was attempting to win over for Barack Obama: \"You know, they think that because of who I am and where my politic[al] base has traditionally been, they may want me to go sort of hustle up what Lawton Chiles used to call the 'cracker vote' there.\"\n\nCrackin' Good Snacks (a division of Winn-Dixie, a Southern grocery chain) has sold crackers similar to Ritz crackers under the name \"Georgia Crackers\". They sometimes were packaged in a red tin with a picture of The Crescent, an antebellum plantation house in Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nThe Florida Cracker Trail is a route which cuts across southern Florida, following the historic trail of the old cattle drives.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, in the trial of George Zimmerman, a Hispanic, concerning the shooting of Trayvon Martin, a witness under examination (Rachel Jeantel) testified that Martin said (on the phone) to her that a \"creepy ass cracker is following me\" minutes before the altercation between Martin and Zimmerman occurred. Zimmerman's attorney then asked her if \"creepy ass cracker\" was an offensive term, to which she responded \"no\". That testimony and response brought about both media and public debate about the use of the word \"cracker\". A CNN report referenced the regional nature of the term, noting both that \"some in Florida use the term in a non-derogatory, colloquial sense\" and that it is sometimes regarded as a \"sharp racial insult that resonates with white southerners even if white northerners don't get it\".\n\nIn his 1964 speech \"The Ballot or the Bullet\", Malcolm X used the term \"cracker\" in reference to white people in a pejorative context. In one passage, he remarked, \"It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights.\"\n\nOn November 29, 1993, in a speech given at Kean College in New Jersey, Nation of Islam spokesman Khallid Abdul Muhammad called Pope John Paul II \"a no good cracker\".\n\nIn 2012, Michael Dunn shot and killed Jordan Davis in an argument over loud music coming from a car. Dunn claimed he had heard \"something something cracker\" and \"I should fucking kill that mother fucker\".\n\n\nSpecific\nGeneral\n\n"}

The name is the Latin-language borrowing of the Greek word meaning \"bearing two knives\" ( \"dual\" + \"knife\"). \n\nThe dimachaeri were popular during the 2nd-4th centuries AD, and were probably considered to be \"insidious\" by many Romans. Both written and pictorial records on dimachaeri are scant and rather indeterminate. Thus, an inscription from Lyon, France, mentions such a type of gladiator, here spelled \"dymacherus\". \n\nDepictions of dimachaeri and their equipment vary in pictorial sources, so it is difficult to say exactly how, and how uniformly, they were equipped. Some pictorial sources depict dimachaeri wearing extremely minimal armour such as a balteus and leather wrappings or none at all, save a \"subligaculum\" (loin cloth). Other show a slightly more heavily armored dimachaerus, variously equipped with scale armor, mail shirts, visored helmets in the fashion of murmillos, greaves and leg wrappings, both barefoot and in sandals. It is a mistake to suppose that dimachaeri were always identically equipped, or even similarly equipped, apart from wielding two blades. It is also entirely possible that the dimachaerus was not a separate class of gladiator at all, but a sub-discipline within a class, or even a cross-discipline practiced by multiple classes. In the late Roman Empire, when references to dimachaeri first appear, many novelties and new gladiator types were being introduced to the arena, and sub-classes had appeared within many gladiator types.\n\nThe dimachaeri were equipped for close-combat fighting. A dimachaerus used a pair of siccae (curved scimitar) or gladius and used a fighting style adapted to both attack and defend with his weapons rather than a shield, as he was not equipped with one. Little else is known about this class of gladiator, but due to the difficulty of wielding two swords it can be inferred that dimachaeri were highly skilled and experienced fighters, and were probably relatively exalted as a class of gladiator. Dimachaeri would have been ideally suited to fight heavily armored opponents and they may have fought other dimachaeri, as well. They are known to have been paired against the hoplomachus and are also referred to as fighting against a gladiator class called an oplomachus, which, according to Justus Lipsius, was a putative variant of the Samnite.\n"}

People are born at the age of one (instead of \"zero\"), and on Chinese New Year or New Year's Day one year is added to their age. Since age is incremented at the beginning of the lunar or solar year, rather than on the anniversary of a birthday, people may be one or two years older in Asian reckoning than in the international age system.\n\nUnder the traditional reckoning in China, age changes on the lichun. In Japan and South Korea, New Year's Day is used as the date of change of age for the traditional system.\n\nIn either the traditional or modern age system the word \"sui\" (), meaning \"years of age\", is used for age counting. When a person's age is given in a publication, it is often specified whether it is his or her:\nOf the three, only 周歲/周岁 (Chinese), \"zhōusuì\" (pinyin) = \"round age\" may be used as a count word.\n\nWhen a child has survived one month of life (29 days if lunar month reckoning) a \"mun yuet\" () celebration can be observed, in which duck or chicken eggs dyed red are distributed to guests to signify fertility.\n\nThe traditional Japanese system of age reckoning, or \"kazoedoshi\" (, lit. \"counted years\"), which incremented one's age on New Year's Day, was rendered obsolete by law in 1902 when Japan officially adopted the modern age system, known in Japanese as \"man nenrei\" (). However, the traditional system was still commonly used, so in 1950 another law was established to encourage people to use the modern age system.\n\nToday the traditional system is used only by the elderly and in rural areas. Elsewhere its use is limited to traditional ceremonies, divinations, and obituaries.\n\nJapanese uses the word \"sai\" ( or ) as a counter word for both the traditional and modern age system.\n\nKoreans who use the traditional system refer to their age in units called \"sal\" (살), using Korean numerals in ordinal form. Thus, a person is one \"sal\" (\"han sal\", 한살) during the first calendar year of life, and ten \"sal\" during the tenth calendar year.\n\nThe 100th-day anniversary of a baby is called \"baegil\" (, ) which literally means \"a hundred days\" in Korean, and is given a special celebration, marking the survival of what was once a period of high infant mortality. The first anniversary of birth named \"dol\" (돌) is likewise celebrated, and given even greater significance. South Koreans celebrate their birthdays, even though every South Korean gains one 'sal' on New Year's Day. Because the first year comes at birth and the second on the first day of the New Year, children born, for example, on December 29 will reach two years of age on the New Year's Day, when they are only days old. Hence, everyone born on the same calendar year effectively has the same age and can easily be calculated by the formula: Age = (Current Year − Birth Year) + 1\n\nIn modern South Korea the traditional system is used alongside the international age system which is referred to as \"man-nai\" (만나이) in which \"man\" (만) means \"full\" or \"actual\", and \"nai\" (나이) meaning \"age\". For example, \"man yeol sal\" means \"full ten years\", or \"ten years old\" in English. The Korean word \"dol\" means \"years elapsed\", identical to the English \"years old\", but is only used to refer to the first few birthdays. \"Cheotdol\" or simply \"dol\" refers to the first Western-equivalent birthday, \"dudol\" refers to the second, and so on.\n\nThe traditional system has not been used in modern North Korea since the 1980s.\n\nThe Korean Birthday Celebrations by the lunar calendar is called \"eumnyeok saeng-il\" (음력 생일, 陰曆生日) and \"yangnyeok saeng-il\" (양력 생일, 陽曆生日) is the birthday by Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor official government uses, documents, and legal procedures, the international system is used. Regulations regarding age limits on beginning school, as well as the age of consent, are all based on this system (\"man-nai\"). The age limit for tobacco, alcohol use are after January 1 of the year one's age turns to 19.\n\nIn Eastern Mongolia, age is traditionally determined based on the number of full moons since conception for girls, and the number of new moons since birth for boys.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18984987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18984987", "title": "Eastern world", "text": "Eastern world\n\nThe term Eastern world refers to various cultures or social structures and philosophical systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of Asia or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and Arab world, specifically in historical (pre-modern) contexts, and in modern times in the context of Orientalism. \n\nThe term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.\n\nThe term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the Old World, contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the \"Occident\" or Western world). Traditionally, this includes all of Central, North and East Asia (the Far East), Greater Middle East, Southeast Asia and South Asia (the Indian subcontinent). \n\nConceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which Australia is typically grouped in the \nWest, while Islamic nations and much of the former Soviet Union are, regardless of location, grouped in the East. Other than Asia and some parts of Africa, Europe has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the Americas into the Western world, Turkey, the Philippines,\nIsrael, and Japan, which are geographically located in the Eastern world, are considered at least partially westernized due to the cultural influence of Europe.\n\nAlthough the concept of a united Asian people and not mean Asian race is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like Western Asia that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the Arab nations of Western Asia, Israel, Turkey, Iran, and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian. \n\nAnother reason why a Pan-Asian identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of nationalistic, cultural, and ethnic individualism many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in colonial times and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.\n\nThe division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European Christendom and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the European colonization of the Americas the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, \"Indian\" (Indies) or \"Oriental\" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and Indology. An intriguing fact to be noted is that Orientalism has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the term \"Eastern world\" was sometimes used as an extension of Eastern bloc, connoting the Soviet Union, China and their communist allies, while the term \"Western world\" often connoted the United States and its NATO allies such as the United Kingdom.\n\nThe concept is often another term for the Far East – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of Buddhism and Hindu Yoga is partly responsible for this.\n\nEastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:\n"}
{"id": "387248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387248", "title": "Eyak language", "text": "Eyak language\n\nEyak is an extinct Na-Dené language historically spoken by the Eyak people, indigenous to south-central Alaska, near the mouth of the Copper River. The name Eyak comes from a Chugach Sugpiaq name (\"Igya'aq\") for an Eyak village at the mouth of the Eyak River. It was the first Alaskan language to go extinct in recent history.\n\nThe closest relatives of Eyak are the Athabaskan languages. The Eyak–Athabaskan group forms a basic division of the Na-Dené language family, the other being Tlingit.\n\nNumerous Tlingit place names along the Gulf Coast are derived from names in Eyak; they have obscure or even nonsensical meanings in Tlingit, but oral tradition has maintained many Eyak etymologies. The existence of Eyak-derived Tlingit names along most of the coast towards southeast Alaska is strong evidence that the prehistoric range of Eyak was once far greater than it was at the time of European contact. This confirms both Tlingit and Eyak oral histories of migration throughout the region.\n\nMarie Smith Jones (May 14, 1918 – January 21, 2008) of Cordova was the language's last native speaker, and the last full-blooded Eyak. Because of the dying off of its native speakers, Eyak became a symbol in the fight against language extinction.\n\nThe spread of English and suppression of aboriginal languages are not the only reasons for the decline of the Eyak language. The northward migration of the Tlingit people around Yakutat in precontact times encouraged the use of Tlingit rather than Eyak along much of the Pacific Coast of Alaska. Eyak was also under pressure from its neighbors to the west, the Alutiiq people of Prince William Sound, as well as some pressure from the people of the Copper River valley. Eyak and Tlingit culture began to merge along the Gulf Coast, and a number of Eyak-speaking groups were absorbed by the Gulf Coast Tlingit populations. This resulted in the replacement of Eyak by Tlingit among most of the mixed groups after a few generations, as reported in Tlingit oral histories of the area.\n\nIn June 2010, the Anchorage Daily News published an article about Guillaume Leduey, a French college student with an unexpected connection to the Eyak language. Beginning at age 12, he had taught himself Eyak, utilizing print and audio instructional materials he obtained from the Alaska Native Language Center. During that time, he never traveled to Alaska or conversed with Marie Smith Jones, the last native speaker.\n\nThe month that the article was published, he traveled to Alaska and met with Dr. Michael Krauss, a noted linguist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Dr. Krauss assisted Leduey with proper Eyak phonological pronunciation and assigned further instruction in grammar and morphology—including morphemic analyses of traditional Eyak stories.\n\nIn June 2011, Leduey returned to Alaska to facilitate Eyak language workshops in Anchorage and Cordova. He is now regarded as a fluent speaker, translator, and instructor of Eyak. Despite his fluency, Eyak remains classified as \"dormant\" as there are no native speakers. On the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS) Eyak is graded a 9 (dormant); the language serves as a reminder of heritage identity for an ethnic community, but no one has more than symbolic proficiency. Currently, Leduey provides instruction and curriculum assistance to the Language Project from France.\n\nThe Eyak Preservation Council received an Alaska Humanities Forum Grant that enabled them to start a website devoted to the preservation of the Eyak Language. Other funding supports the annual Eyak Culture Camp every August in Cordova. The Project provides countless language resources including immersion workshops, an online dictionary with audio samples, and a set of eLearning lessons, among others.\n\nIn June 2014, the Eyak Language Revitalization Project announced an online program called \"dAXunhyuuga'\", which means \"the words of the people.\"\n\nEyak is a part of the Eyak-Athabaskan language family and Na-Dené larger grouping, which includes Eyak-Athabaskan and Tlingit with a controversial but possible inclusion of Haida. The Athabaskan family covers three distinct geographic areas, forming three subgroups: Northern Athabaskan in Alaska and the Yukon; Pacific Coast Athabaskan in California and Oregon; and Southern Athabaskan, also called Apache, spoken mainly in the American Southwest, which includes Navajo. There has been extensive comparative reconstruction of a Proto-Athabaskan-Eyak (PAE). A recent proposal of a Dené–Yeniseian stock has been widely well received by linguists, linking the Dené languages to the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia. If it proves correct, it will be the first validated genetic link between Old and New World languages. Far less accepted is a possible Dené–Caucasian stock that has been pursued for decades.\n\nThe following charts are based on the material in Krauss (1965); IPA equivalents are shown in square brackets. The orthography used by Krauss and the Eyak people is the same, substituting only A, L, and X for respective [ə], [ł], and [x̣].\n\nThe nasals [n] and [m] occur in loanwords; in native words, Krauss (1965) suggests that they can be interpreted as /l/ and /w/ (respectively) followed by a nasalized vowel. /b/ and /ŋ/ occur only in loanwords. Aspirated stops contrast with unaspirated stops only before vowels.\n\nAll consonants may be found stem-initially, except /h/, which is interpreted as zero. /h/ has the allophone [h] only word-initially or directly following a vowel.\n\nIn Krauss's terminology, vowels can be oral or nasal, with further modification by glottalization, aspiration, length, or a combination of glottalization and length. The only unmodified vowels are /i/, /A/ and /u/. Unmodified /A/ varies morphophonemically between [æ] and [e], so /ə/ serves as the basic form of both vowels. When orally modified, the nucleus of /e/ varies between [ɛ] and [æ], the nucleus of /a/ between [a] and [ɔ]. \nAll vowels, regardless of their oral modification, are nasalized following /n/, with the exception of /e/ which is never nasalized.\nIn written Eyak, length is denoted by double letters and glottalization by ’, as in chi:shg \"sand\" or qi’GA’e’d \"bed\".\n\nAll syllables begin with an onset, so that no two vowels may occur consecutively. Syllables can be counted exactly by number of vowels.\n\nEyak is not tonal, unlike many of the Athabascan languages to which it is related; nor does it have distinctive pitch. Stems are heavy syllables, whereas affixes tend to be light. Stress usually falls on stems and heavy syllables. In sequences of heavy syllables, the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, as in q'ahdi'lah \"goodbye\".\n\nEyak is an agglutinative, polysynthetic language.\n\nWith few exceptions, Eyak nouns are morphophonemically invariable. Kinship and anatomical stems are the only noun stems that may take pronominal possessive prefixes, which are as follow:\n\nPreverbals in Eyak are the category of words made up of preverbals and postpositions. The two are grouped together because one morpheme may often be used as the stem in both categories. Preverbals are individual words that occur in conjunction with the verb. These combinations may almost be said to form lexemes, especially due to the fact that preverbals are rarely if ever used in isolation in natural speech. Preverbals are nearly always unbound and are phonologically separate from the verb, contrasting with the corresponding class in Athabaskan which may be incorporated or not. One preverbal is most common, but combinations of two are equally possible, as in ’uya’ ’Adq’Ach’ k’udAdAGu’ \"hot water bottle\" (in it onto self something/someone is kept warm). There are more than 100 Eyak basic preverbal morphemes.\n\nPostpositions relate directly to an object outside of the verb. Current analysis by Krauss has been phonological rather than semantic, but there is at least one semantically grouped category of postpositions to consider, that of comparatives. This grouping includes P-ga’ \"like P\", P-’u’X \"less than P\", and P-lAX \"more than P\" where P is any postpositional phrase. Eyak lacks conjunctions and many postpositions assume a similar function, creating subordinate clauses. These postpositions attach to the verb, the most common example being -da:X \"and\" or \"if, when\".\n\nEyak verb stems take many affixes: there are nine prefix positions before the verb (many of which may be subdivided) and four suffix positions after. All positions may be filled with zero, except the stem, which can be filled by any of several hundred morphemes but not zero.\n\n\nAn artificial but grammatical example presents near-maximum affixal positions filled: dik’ lAXi:qAqi’dAxsLXa’Xch’gLG \"I did not tickle your (plural, emphatically) feet.\" This gives:\n\nThere are two moods, optative and imperative, and two aspects, perfective and imperfective. Verbs may be inceptive, 'active,' or 'neuter', such that the possibilities are as follows:\n\nMorphemes in prefix position 2 modify the inceptive imperfective; in position 6 the perfective, optative, and imperative in inceptive, active and neuter; in position 8 the inceptive optative, active perfective and optative, and neuter perfective, imperfective, optative, and imperative; in suffix position 2 the inceptive, active, and neuter perfective; and in suffix position 3, negativity.\n\nThere are also three derivational modes, a repetitive, a customary, and a progressive. The infinitive takes approximately the same form as the imperative, with some variation.\n\nThe majority of the Eyak corpus is narrative, with very little spontaneous conversation (and that only when embedded in the narratives). There is a better understanding therefore of the syntax of Eyak narrative style and performance than of natural speech. The basic word order of Eyak is subject-object-verb, or SOV, as in \"Johnny ’uyAqa’ts’ sALxut’L\" \"Johnny shot his (own) hand.\" Relatively few sentences, however, follow this exact pattern; it is far more common to find SV or OV. The full word order of a transitive sentence is I S O <nowiki>[[C P] V]</nowiki>:\n\nThe subject and object categories can consist of a [[noun]], a [[noun phrase]], or a [[demonstrative]] phrase. All constituents may be filled by zero, excepting the verb.\n\nThere is extreme ambiguity in Eyak syntax, due in large part to homophony (as in the English loss of subjunctive) and lack of distinction (there is the same ambiguity in third-person singular as in English).\n\n\n[[Category:Extinct languages of North America]]\n[[Category:Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]\n[[Category:Indigenous languages of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Na-Dene languages]]\n[[Category:Non-tonal languages in tonal families]]\n[[Category:Northern Northwest Coast Sprachbund (North America)]]\n[[Category:Northwest Coast Sprachbund (North America)]]\n[[Category:2008 disestablishments in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Languages extinct in the 2000s]]"}

Since 2014, Geek Picnic has been held in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 2016, the first Geek Picnic was held in Israel.\n\nThe first Geek Picnic took place, at the New Holland Island in Saint Petersburg, on August 6, 2011. It presented several scientific shows, including 3D printing and robotics, as well as indoor and outdoor activities like modern game consoles, monocycles, jumping stilts, gaming zone and sports ground. The festival attracted more than 1500 visitors.\n\nThe second Geek Picnic was held at the same location on August, 3rd. It featured a wide variety of events including robot exhibition, a number of lectures in the format of TEDx and masterclasses by recognized experts from Russian IT companies (Gaidar Magdanurov, Grachik Adzhamian, Alexey Voinov, Filipp Katz, Kirill Shichanov and Yury Lifshits), a job fair for programmers and a dedicated Windarium Windows education site. The recreational zone offered open library, gaming space, sports and a picnic. Around 7000 people have visited the event.\n\nIn 2013, Geek Picnic was a two-day festival held at Yelagin Island. The territory was divided into 4 zones dedicated to technology, science, art and picnic. The festival featured a display of most recent inventions in robotics and 3d printing, interactive science museum, meteorite exhibition and Fab lab. Event schedule included lectures by cosmonaut Alexander Volkov, historian , a known polyglot, language teacher and television presenter , engineer Anatoly Wasserman, and Nigel Ackland, known to be the world’s first person to receive a bionic prosthetic arm, and numerous entrepreneurs, scientists and academics. The Russian quadcopter racing championship took place during the festival. Recreational areas included food court, playground and open-air exhibitions. Visitor count exceeded 15000 through 2 days.\n\nThe winter session of 2014 Geek Picnic took place in VDNKh , Moscow, on January 25–26. Theme zones dedicated to technology, science and art, entertainment, lectorium and a playground for children were set up in a 15 thousand square meters pavilion. A number of speakers including Anatoly Wasserman and futurologist Dmitry Gluchovskiy gave lectures, and the founder of the Venus project Jacque Fresco held a skype conference call. The festival featured musical performance by Alexander Robotnick and the Desert Planet band. The displays included the world’s biggest Tesla coil, 3D bioprinter prototype, quadcopter show, sculptures of Transformers characters and a robot show featuring Exoatlet hauler and InMoove android. The event had 30000 visitors.\n\nThe summer Geek Picnic was held at Yelagin Island, Saint-Petersburg, in August. The event schedule included over 60 lectures and 30 masterclasses and workshops, drone and robot operation competitions, programming contest. Festival featured DIY-zones, robotics and 3D printing exhibition as well as 3D printed fashion show by Larisa Katz, Pia Hinze and Joshua Harker and had a total of 18000 visitors.\n\nThat year, both Moscow and Saint Petersburg festivals took place in summer. The Geek Picnic in Moscow was held in park and featured 6 theme zones named 'Technology', 'Science', 'Art', 'Piknic', 'Expo' and 'Market'. A huge convention of people with bionic implants and prosthetics was the core event of the festival. Bebionic pioneer [Nigel Ackland], Actress [Angel Guiffria],'cyborg' activist Neil Harbisson, Jens Naumann whose vision is partially restored by brain implant, drummer Jason Barnes with robotic arm, and model and singer Viktoria Modesta, were among the participants. The musicians who played on the 3D-printed instruments also performed on the Picnic. 2015 Moscow Geek Picnic schedule also included music show performed on 3D printed instruments, fireworks, drone championship, lectures by Anatoly Wasserman, space test pilot Sergey Ryazansky and painter Boryana Rossa, and a communication session with Gennady Padalka and Mikhail Kornienko from aboard the ISS. The festival in Moscow had 22000 visitors.\n\nThe Saint Petersburg 2015 Geek Picnic was held at Yelagin Island on June, 20th and 21st and had an event schedule similar to earlier Moscow festival. The visitors were greeted by a 6-ton robotic arm. The educational part of festival featured talks by the head of the Pushkin Museum , artistic director of the Bolshoi Drama Theater Andrey Moguchy, musician , ‘Mediaculture’ laboratory head Andrey Svibovich and other science and art workers joined by ‘cyborgs’ Nicolas Huchet and Viktoria Modesta. Pecha Kucha took place during the events. The festival had approximately 25000 visitors.\n\nThe first Israeli Geek Picnic, attended by more than 35 thousand people, took place in the Sacher Park in the center of Jerusalem on April 25-27. There were about 150 exhibition stands, of which about 75% were represented by Israeli teams..\n\nhe Moscow festival was held on June 18-19 in the Kolomenskoye Museum, in St. Petersburg – on June 25-26 on Elagin Island. Jamie Hyneman, the \"MythBusters\" presenter, became the headliner of Russian festivals. More than 40 people gave lectures, including scientific journalist , sculptor Andrey Bartenev, political analyst Anatoly Vasserman, space exploration popularizer Vitaly Egorov, space pilot and hero of the Russian Federation Anton Shkaplerov and others. Traditionally the festival was divided into zones \"Science\", \"Technology\", \"Art\" and \"Picnic\". ITMO University had its own section at the Petersburg festival, the Polytechnic University – at the Moscow festival. There was a Mars rover presented by St. Petersburg State University of Telecommunications and a five-meter high robot \"Dragon\", created in Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry.\n\nIn 2016 Geek Picnic beat the record for attendance: 29,000 people visited the St. Petersburg festival, the Moscow event attracted 27,000 spectators.\n\nIn 2017, Moscow's Geek Picnic is scheduled for June 17-18 and will be held on the territory of the Kolomenskoye Museum. The festival in St. Petersburg will be held on June 24-25, in Pulkovo Park in the south of the city. The main theme of the festivals in 2017, co-organized by Kaspersky Lab, is \"mind games\". Among more than 20 invited researchers are , Petr Levich, Ilya Zakharov, Daniel Laman and Vasily Klyucharev.

{"id": "5763817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5763817", "title": "Germanophile", "text": "Germanophile\n\nA Germanophile, Teutonophile or Teutophile is a person who is fond of German culture, German people and Germany in general or who exhibits German nationalism in spite of not even being either an ethnic German or a German citizen. The love of the \"German way\", called \"Germanophilia\" or \"Teutonophilia\", is the opposite to Germanophobia.\n\nThe term was especially in use in the 19th to 20th centuries after the creation of the German nation-state and the rise of the German Empire. It is used not only politically but also culturally; for example, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the famous influential German philosopher, interpreted the geographic triad of Europe as comprising England (utilitarian pragmatism), France (revolutionary hastiness) and Germany (reflective thoroughness).\n\nIn 19th-century romanticism in Britain, the term's antonym was Scandophile, expressing a dichotomy of associating Anglo-Saxon culture either with continental West Germanic culture or with North Germanic (Scandinavian) culture (the \"Viking revival\"). The term was also used in opposition to Hellenophile, an affinity to \"Teutonic\" or Germanic culture and worldview as opposed to a predilection for Classical Antiquity.\n\nIn 19th-century Continental Europe, the dichotomy was rather between Germany and France, the main political players of the period, and a Germanophile would choose to side with Germany against French or \"Romance\" interests taken to heart by a Francophile. The corresponding term relating to England is Anglophile, an affinity, in turn, often observed in early 20th-century Germans choosing to side against France.\n\nThis term was also popularly used in the 20th century to refer to the German educational system formed by Wilhelm von Humboldt, which was leading at that time and served as a model for many elite universities around the world from Oslo to Harvard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20856587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20856587", "title": "Herman Rosenblat", "text": "Herman Rosenblat\n\nHerman A. Rosenblat ( 1929 – February 5, 2015) was a Polish-born American mythomaniac, who wrote a fictitious Holocaust memoir titled \"Angel at the Fence\", purporting to tell the true story of a girl who passed him food through the barbed-wire fence at the Schlieben sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp in World War II. The book was planned to be published in 2009 by Berkely Books, but was cancelled after it turned out that many elements of his memoir were fabricated and some were contrary to verifiable historical facts. Rosenblat later admitted to lying on purpose with the intention of bringing joy.\n\nBefore the fabrication became public, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25 million by Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures. Other fans of the story include Oprah Winfrey who has described it as the single greatest love story she heard in over 22 years of hosting her show.\n\nThe story behind the Rosenblat's story is being developed as an independent feature film. In June 2010 Atlantic Overseas Pictures and producer Harris Salomon signed a co-production agreement with Castel Film Studios, a well known studio in Central and Eastern Europe and the studio for \"Cold Mountain\" and \"\" as well as 3rd-i films in London, to produce a feature film about the Herman Rosenblat affair based on an original screenplay by award-winning screenwriter Ivo Marloh entitled \"The Apple\", scheduled for production in 2015.\n\nRosenblat, a Polish Jew, lived in the town of Piotrków Trybunalski before World War II. Following the invasion of Poland, the Nazis rounded up his family in 1939 along with thousands of others when the Piotrków Trybunalski Ghetto was set up. His father had previously died of typhus. Two years later, when Rosenblat was 12 years old, his mother was separated from him and put on a Holocaust train to Treblinka extermination camp during one of the ghetto liquidation actions. About 90% of the inhabitants of the ghetto were sent to Majdanek and Treblinka death camps. He later wrote that he lied to the Germans about his age because the Nazis used older boys for slave labor, and sent younger ones for extermination. In July 1944, with the front lines approaching, he was deported with his three older brothers to Schlieben sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, until February 1945. He claimed in his memoir that his future wife Roma, a nine-year-old Jewish girl hiding in the town of Schlieben with her family, threw him apples and bread over the electrified, guarded fence of the camp on a daily basis throughout the seven months' period.\n\nShortly before liberation he was brought to the Theresienstadt camp. After being liberated from the concentration camps, Rosenblat and his brothers were brought to the UK in a group of 730 orphans to start a new life. Rosenblat says he lived in London for four years, where he learned the electrical trade at the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training school. He then moved to the United States in 1950 and was drafted into the United States Army in 1951. After serving for two years, he says he moved to New York and opened his own TV repair shop in Brooklyn. He met Roma Radzicki in the United States on a blind date in 1957, and married her. He later claimed that during the date he had recognized her as the girl who threw apples to him over the fence and proposed on the spot.\n\nIn 1992 Rosenblat and his wife had run into serious financial problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him. According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it.\n\nRosenblat told the apple story for the first time in late 1995, and he won Oprah's contest in 1996. Oprah Winfrey interviewed Rosenblat in two different programs, in 1996 and 2007, and she called his story \"the single greatest love story, in 22 years of doing this show, we’ve ever told on the air.\"\n\nBerkley Books, an imprint of the Penguin Group, signed Rosenblat up to publish his memoir \"Angel at the Fence\", with Andrea Hurst working as Rosenblat's literary agent. Producer Harris Salomon, of Atlantic Overseas Pictures, made plans to adapt the story into a $25 million movie called \"The Flower at the Fence\", and he had earlier registered a screenplay based on the story with the Library of Congress in 2003.\n\nHolocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt had already denounced the story in her personal blog in December 2007. Other Holocaust survivors like Peter Kubicek also denounced the implausibility of the story. Jewish-American blogger Danny Bloom started emailing several historians for help, one of them being Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer.\n\nWaltzer had been interviewing survivors for a new book, and he had been told that the story was probably false. In November 2008 Waltzer contacted forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick and started investigating the matter. He found out that the prisoners of that concentration camp were prohibited from approaching a camp's fence on pain of death, nor was anyone allowed to approach a fence from the outside. Such perimeter fences were electrified and watched 24/7 by armed guards stationed on guard towers, ready to shoot anyone who approached the fence from either side. The SS barracks were near to the only fence that faced outwards, and prisoners approaching the barracks would have been executed. Waltzer also discovered that Herman's future wife Roma was never in the town of Schlieben, but that she lived throughout that period in a German farm away, near Breslau. Another survivor of the same camp, Ben Helfgott, told him that Rosenblat had never told the story before the mid-1990s. Waltzer started questioning the publisher and the agent about the authenticity of the story, with little success. Some people actively resisted and tried to shut down his investigation.\n\nOn December 25 and 26, 2008, several scholars and family members published multiple critical articles in \"The New Republic\", the first article using Waltzer's research, and the second adding their own research on top of Waltzer's. On December 27 Rosenblat finally confessed the truth to the producer of his movie, Harris Solomon, and his literary agent, Andrea Hurst. He stated that the apple-tossing part of his backstory was something he only imagined, while stating that the rest of his Holocaust experiences were accurate, however other falsehoods and discrepancies in his remaining story have been discovered since then. Rosenblat has apologized and claimed that \"It was my imagination, and in my mind, I believed it. Even now, I believe it.\", and he also said that he did it to bring happiness and hope to people.\n\nHis family knew about the hoax and tried to convince Rosenblat not to tell it. This caused a division in Rosenblat's family. His last surviving brother, Sam, had hesitated talking to him and he died in 2007. Herman's two children were very uncomfortable with the matter. Despite not agreeing with Rosenblat, the family never revealed the truth to the media or Rosenblat's publishers or producers. The other orphans from Buchenwald knew that the story was very implausible but decided not to say anything. As time passed, the persons knowing about the hoax grew more uncomfortable about keeping silent about it and there was a growing consensus that the truth had to be told.\n\nOn December 27, 2008, the same day of Rosenblat's confession, Berkley Group cancelled the book publication, saying that it had received \"new information\" from Rosenblat's agent. A spokesman said that they would be asking for the money back that they had advanced, and the company has declined making any more comments on the matter. A children's edition of the book, written by a third party, Laurie Friedman of Miami, titled \"Angel Girl\", had been released in September 2008. When Lerner Books learned that the book was based on Rosenblat's falsehoods they said that they wouldn't make any reprint and that they would refund any returned copy. About 2,000 copies were sold.\n\nProducer Harris Salomon wasn't aware of Rosenblat's hoax when he started working on his movie of the Rosenblat story, but still intends to produce it, as he had always planned a \"loose and fictionalised adaptation\" and \"the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide.\" He had been working with Rosenblat over a six-year period as the original feature film was being developed. According to Salomon, the script for the feature was completed in October 2009 with casting to commence by Celestia Fox in London. Producers Abi Sirokh, Gabor Koltai, Lew Rywin and Thierry Potok contributed to the project. The new motion picture tells the story of Herman Rosenblat, with a style similar to the movie \"The Insider\". After the revelation of the hoax, the focus of the film was changed to a psychological love story examining why a Holocaust survivor would make up a story about the Holocaust and the love for his wife while driven by greed, fame and the memory of the Holocaust. Salomon has asked Rosenblat to donate all the earnings of the film to Holocaust survivor charities but Rosenblat refused.\n\nOprah posted a disclaimer on her website, and in February 2009 she said that she was \"disappointed\", but she denied having been duped by Rosenblat and that she was \"minding my own business.\" Gayle King, a friend of Oprah's, pointed out that a lot of other people had also been duped and that she was being scapegoated.\n\nIn July 2009 a new video was disseminated by the gawker.com web site. Rosenblat is re-enacting his Holocaust love story, specifically the throwing of apples over the perimeter fence of the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, long after that part of his story had been discredited as fake.\n\nOn September 1, 2009, York House Press published a paperback book titled \"The Apple\", written by Penelope Holt. It tells Rosenblat's life story. Peter Kubicek, an outspoken critic of the original book, reportedly advised the author and is thanked in the preface of the book.\n\nHolocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer said that it was disturbing that so few people had noticed and inquired about the obvious holes in his history over a decade of time. Waltzer and others have said that Rosenblat didn't need to embellish his story, which was already powerful enough by itself. Waltzer places part of the blame in all those \"culture makers\" that profited from the diffusion of the story and never doubted even the most implausible parts of it. It appears that the veracity of story was not questioned either by the book publisher or by Oprah Winfrey, and that no fact-checking was done to ensure the authenticity of the memoir prior to endorsing it soundly.\n\nDeborah Lipstadt and others have harshly criticized Rosenblat for embellishing his story, since this could cause people to doubt the truth of the Holocaust, and encourage Holocaust deniers.\n\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, one of Waltzer's collaborators, such hoaxes could be avoided if the publishers spent a few thousand dollars in early fact-checking with historians and genealogists, before deciding to spend huge sums of money for the story.\n\nAmong a number of other false elements in Rosenblat's story, he claimed that he was scheduled to be gassed at 10am on May 10, 1945, and that the liberation saved him by just two hours. The war ended officially on May 8, and the entire camp had been handed over to the International Red Cross a week earlier.\nTheresienstadt had no gas chambers and, as noted by Deborah Lipstadt, Holocaust historian: \"Jewish prisoners were not told ahead of time that they were going to be gassed\"\n\n\n"}

The intent may be to demonstrate dominance over the deceased, such as scalp-taking or forming necklaces of human ears or teeth, or to commemorate the deceased, such as the veneration of the relics of saints. It can be done to prove one's success in battle, or to show off one's power to others. Murderers' collection of their victims' body parts have also been described as a form of trophy-taking; the FBI draws a distinction between souvenirs and trophies in this regard.\n\nWhile older customs generally included the burial of human war trophies along with the collector, such items have been sold in modern times.\n\nHeadhunting has been practiced across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania for millennia. One analysis of the practice in early North American societies linked it to social distance from the victim. \n\nIn North America, it was common practice before, during or after the lynching of African-Americans for those involved to take souvenirs such as body parts, skin, bones, etc.\n\n\"Well, these white guys would sometimes take the dog-tag chain and fill that up with ears.

M.Arch. degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as \"M.Arch. I\" and \"M.Arch. II\" to distinguish them. All M.Arch. degrees are professional degrees in architecture. There are, however, other master's degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.\n\nMany schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education. Including study at the bachelor's and master's level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that there is another route to becoming an architect: the continuous 5-year professional degree program. In such a program, after five years of study, students are awarded with a professional degree in architecture. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) or an M.Arch. In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch. Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the Architectural Registration Exam, the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect's license in the U.S.. One disadvantage of the B.Arch. degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions). Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch. choose to pursue a 3-semester master's degree (not an M.Arch.) to obtain further academic qualification.\n\nGraduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, building science, structural engineering, architectural history, theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or digital media. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.\n\nImportant to consider in choosing the school(s) for an architectural education is their overall \"focus\". Architectural schools usually, by virtue of the history of the school and the interests of the faculty, will approach the instruction of architecture from a technical, historical, or artistic bent—or a combination thereof. This is not something that will be spelled out in the school's literature, but will be more or less apparent in the lists of classes offered and the study areas of the faculty. While it may not seem important at first, in retrospect it will probably be a major factor.\n\nAn architectural thesis is the culmination of a student’s research. Submission of the thesis represents the completion of the final requirement for the degree and may be presented as graphic representations, a written work, or physical forms. According to \"Architectural Research Methods\" by Linda N. Groat and David Wang, the scope of the research inquiry must not be too broad or too narrow. A good topic will clearly and simply identify a body of literature to which the topical question can be referred. Additionally, a thesis question must have significance to not only the student, but his or her peers, and to the field of architecture.\n\nIn the United States, The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from a NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture.\n\nAgain, first time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch. degree can also qualify for registration, without obtaining a master's degree. Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they are earning their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.\n\nIn Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC).\n\nAs of March 2006, there were eighty-four accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico. In Canada, there were ten accredited programs.\n\nColleges and universities in the United States with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below.\n\n\nColleges and universities in Canada with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below:\n\nUniversities in Australia and New Zealand with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below :\n\nThe only 2 universities offering HKIA (Hong Kong Institute of Architects), CAA (Commonwealth Association of Architects) & RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) accredited Master of Architecture for architect professional registration.\n\n\n\nIn Mexico, an officially recognized Bachelor of Architecture is sufficient for practice.\n\n\nSome universities in India with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below:\nSchool of Architecture, Bharath University\n\nSome universities in Iran with accredited Master of Architecture degree programs are listed below:\n\nFour United States schools are candidates for accreditation, meaning that their newly created programs may be accredited to offer the M.Arch. degree upon proof of meeting NAAB standards.

{"id": "2172629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172629", "title": "Mehregan", "text": "Mehregan\n\nMehregān ( or Jašn-e Mehr \"Mithra Festival\") is a Zoroastrian and Persian festival celebrated to honor the yazata Mithra (), which is responsible for friendship, affection and love. It is also widely referred to as the Persian Festival of Autumn.\n\nAccording to \"The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism\" (2015), it was originally a feast honoring the Zoroastrian \"yazata\" Mithra. By the 4th century BCE, it was observed as one of the name-day feasts, a form it retains in today. Still, in a predominantly Muslim Iran, it is one of the two pre-Islamic festivals that continue to be celebrated by the public at large: Mehrgān, dedicated to Mithra (modern \"Mehr\"), and Tirgan, dedicated to Tishtrya (modern \"Tir\").\n\nName-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. The Mehr day in the Mehr month corresponded to the day farmers harvested their crops. They thus also celebrated the fact God had given them food to survive the coming cold months.\n\nIrrespective of which calendar is observed, Mehrgān falls on the 196th day of the calendar year. For details on how this date is calculated, see basis for the date, below. For calendars that have March 21 as Nowruz or New Year's Day (i.e. in the \"Fasili\" and \"Bastani\" variants of the Zoroastrian calendar as well as in the Iranian civil calendar), Mehrgān falls on October 2. For the \"Shahanshahi\" variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, which in 2006–2007 has New Year's Day on August 20, Mehrgān fell on March 3 of the following Gregorian year. For the \"Kadmi\" variant, which has New Year's Day 30 days earlier, Mehrgān falls on February 1.\n\nIn al-Biruni's eleventh-century \"Book of Instructions in the Elements of the Art of Astrology\" (233), the astronomer observed that \"some people have given the preference to Mihragān [over Nowruz, i.e. New Year's day/Spring Equinox] by as much as they prefer autumn to spring.\"\n\nAs Biruni also does for the other festival days he mentions, he reiterates a local anecdotal association for his description of Mehrgan (\"ha al-mirjan\" in the author's Arabic parlance) with a fragment of a tale from Iranian folklore: On this day, Fereydun vanquished the evil Zahhak and confined him to Mount Damavand. This fragment of the legend is part of a greater cycle that ties Mehrgan with Nowruz; Dahak vanquished Jamshid (who the legends have as the one establishing Nowruz or New Year's Day), and Fereydun vanquishes Dahak, so restoring the balance. The association of Mehrgan with the polarity of spring/autumn, sowing/harvest and the birth/rebirth cycle did not escape Biruni either, for as he noted, \"they consider Mihragān as a sign of resurrection and the end of the world, because at Mihragān that which grows reaches perfection.\"\n\nMehrgān was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king all contributing to a lively festival.\n\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic Iran, Mehrgān was celebrated with the same magnificence and pageantry as Nowruz. It was customary for people to send or give their king, and each other, gifts. Rich people usually gave gold and silver coins, heroes and warriors gave horses while others gave gifts according to their financial power and ability, even as simple as an apple. Those fortunate enough would help the poor with gifts.\n\nGifts to the royal court of over ten thousand gold coins were registered. If the gift-giver needed money at a later time, the court would then return twice the gift amount. Kings gave two audiences a year: one audience at Nowruz and other at Mehregān. During the Mehregān celebrations, the king wore a fur robe and gave away all his summer clothes.\n\nAfter the Mongol invasion of Iran, the feast celebration of Mehrgān lost its popularity. Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kermān continued to celebrate Mehrgān in an extravagant way.\n\nFor this celebration, the participants wear new clothes and set a decorative, colorful table. The sides of the tablecloth are decorated with dry marjoram. A copy of the Khordeh Avesta (\"little Avesta\"), a mirror and a \"sormeh-dan\" (a traditional eyeliner or kohl) are placed on the table together with rosewater, sweets, flowers, vegetables and fruits, especially pomegranates and apples, and nuts such as almonds or pistachios. A few silver coins and lotus seeds are placed in a dish of water scented with marjoram extract.\n\nA burner is also part of the table setting for \"kondor\"/\"loban\" (frankincense) and \"espand\" (seeds of \"Peganum harmala\", Syrian rue) to be thrown on the flames.\n\nAt lunch time when the ceremony begins, everyone in the family stands in front of the mirror to pray. Sharbat is drunk and then—as a good omen—\"sormeh\" is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of wild marjoram, lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown over one another's heads while they embrace one another.\n\nIn 1960s the Postal Service in Tehran issued a series of stamps to commemorate Mehrgan Festival.\n\nAs noted above, Mehrgān is a name-day feast. These name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. Indeed, Zoroastrian Persians before Islam had 30-days months, which means that each day in a month had a different name, with 12 of the days also being names of the 12 months. The day whose name corresponded to the name of the month was celebrated. It was a celebration of life, seasons changing, God, and joy. In Zoroastrianism, happiness is very important and is considered as a holy virtue that must be attracted. Thus, this religion has always had many feasts and celebrations.\n\nWhat that day corresponds to in another calendar is subject to which variant of the Zoroastrian calendar is followed:\n\nThe \"Bastani\" calendar is used primarily in Greater Iran and by Persians of the diaspora, while Zoroastrians of India (subject to calendrical faction) use one of the other three variants.\n\nNon-Zoroastrian Iranians do not observe any variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, but instead use Iranian calendars. When introduced in 1925, the Zoroastrian festival days were pegged to the \"Bastani\" variant of the Zoroastrian calendar. The first six months of the civil calendar had 31 days each, while all Zoroastrian calendar months have 30 days each. So by the 7th month (Mehr) there is a difference of 6 days between the two. Thus, October 8, which in the \"Bastani\"/\"Fasili\" calendar is the 16th day of Mehr month, is in the Persian civil calendar the 10th day (Aban) of the same month.\n\nThe relationship between Mehregān and the various calendars is perhaps better understood relative to Nowruz. When (relative to another calendar) the first day of the year occurs is subject to interpretation, but independent of when it occurs, Mehregān is celebrated 195 days after that, that is on the 196th day of the year.\n\n\nhttp://Mehrgan.nipoc.org/\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14116843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14116843", "title": "Multiverse (DC Comics)", "text": "Multiverse (DC Comics)\n\nThe Multiverse, within DC Comics publications, is a \"cosmic construct\" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a space and fate in common, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics.\n\nThe concept of a universe and a multiverse in which the fictional stories take place was loosely established during the Golden Age. With the publication of \"All-Star Comics\" #3 in 1940, the first crossover between characters occurred with the creation of the Justice Society of America (JSA), which presented the first superhero team with characters appearing in other publications (comic strips and anthology titles) to bring attention to less-known characters. This established the first shared \"universe\", as all these heroes now lived in the same world. Prior to this publication, characters from the different comic books seemingly existed in different worlds.\n\nLater, \"Wonder Woman\" #59 (May 1953) presented DC Comics's first story depicting a parallel \"mirror\" world. Wonder Woman is transported to a twin Earth where she meets Tara Terruna who is exactly like her. Tara Terruna means \"Wonder Woman\" in the native language of that world. Wonder Woman describes this world as being a twin world existing alongside Earth with duplicates of everyone but with a different development. The concept of different versions of the world and its heroes was revisited in the pages of \"Wonder Woman\" a few times later.\n\nLed by editor Julius Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox, DC Comics's super heroes were given a \"reboot\" with the publication of \"Showcase\" #4 in 1956, where a new version of the Flash made his first appearance. The success of this new Flash led the creation of new incarnations of the Golden Age characters who only shared the names and powers but had different secret identities, origins and stories. Later, new versions of other heroes, Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, were also restarted by retelling their origins but keeping their secret identities.\nGardner Fox, who worked before in the creation of the JSA, where other heroes met for the first time, created the story \"Flash of Two Worlds\" in \"The Flash\" #123, where Barry Allen, the new Flash, is transported to the Earth where the original Flash, Jay Garrick, existed. To Allen, Jay Garrick's world was a work of fiction as it was in the real world. This story not only presented the encounter of two worlds and the existence of the Multiverse for the first time, it also presented key features of the Multiverse: all the universes vibrate at a specific frequency which keeps them separated; these \"barriers\" could be trespassed by \"tuning\" to that vibration. Because people could also \"tune-in\" these worlds in dreams, some people wrote comic books with the stories from those worlds they dreamed, which explained why Barry Allen knew about Jay Garrick as a fictional character.\n\nThe success of this story led to the first team crossover between the new Justice League of America (JLA) and the Golden Age JSA, in the stories \"Crisis on Earth-One\" (\"Justice League of America\" #21) and \"Crisis on Earth-Two\" (\"Justice League of America\" #22). This story arc started the tradition of a yearly crossover between the JLA and the JSA, and established firmly the concept of a Multiverse and the designation of names, Earth-One being the JLA reality and Earth-Two the JSA reality. The success of these crossovers spawned publications telling the further stories of the Golden Age heroes in the present day parting from many of the stories told, thus, establishing a more defined continuity for every Universe.\n\nThis concept of parallel Earths with differences in locations, persons and historical events became a very important ingredient within DC Comics' publications. It helped (among other things) to explain continuity errors, to retell and retcon stories, and to incorporate foreign elements that could actively interact with everything else and allow them to have an \"existence\". Continuity flaws between the established Earth-Two and several stories from the Golden Age were given separate Earths. \"Imaginary\" stories and some time divergences of Earth-One were given also separate realities (such as Earth-B and Earth-A). In addition to the stories appearing mainly in the pages of \"JLA\" that created new Earths, the acquisition of other comic book companies and characters by DC Comics incorporated these new properties as Earths in the Multiverse which would interact several times with the \"main\" Earths, One and Two; two of the most notable being Earth-S for the Fawcett Comics characters, and Earth-X for the Quality Comics characters. By the 1970s, everything that was published or related officially to DC Comics' titles could become part of the Multiverse, although much of it remained largely uncatalogued.\n\nThe names of the worlds were usually in the format \"Earth, hyphen, spelled numeral/letter/name\". In the case of worlds with numerals, the \"rule\" of spelling the number was not always followed, even within the pages of the same issue.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of DC Comics drew near, major events were proposed for the celebration: an encyclopedia (\"Who's Who in the DC Universe\") and a crossover of the ages, characters, and worlds appearing in DC's comics. As told in the letter section of \"Crisis On Infinite Earths\" #1, as the research started in the late 1970s, it became evident that there were many flaws in continuity. The way used to circumvent some of these errors was the \"Multiple Earths\", which also showed a chaotic nature that brought even more continuity problems that were not easily explained or were simply left unexplained. Examples of this included: 1) Black Canary of Earth-One being the daughter of the original Black Canary of WWII even though the original Black Canary was a resident of Earth-Two, and 2) the existence of Golden Age comic books on Earth-One and the people not noticing that some of the characters in those comic books existed in \"real-life\". In addition, many universes had multiple alternate timelines, such as Kamandi and the Legion of Super-Heroes, both being from Earth-One.\n\nWriter Marv Wolfman took this crossover event as an opportunity to reform all the fictional universe of DC Comics to avoid further continuity errors and update the DC characters to modern times. The whole Multiverse is destroyed except for five Earths (Silver Age Earth-One, Golden Age Earth-Two, Charlton Comics' Earth-Four, Fawcett Comics' Earth-S and Quality Comics' Freedom Fighters' Earth-X). Later, the universe is recreated as one single universe from those five.\n\nThe \"Convergence\" (2015) crossover event officially retconned the events of \"Crisis\" after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.\n\nAfter the conclusion of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the concept of a single Universe containing most elements of the \"surviving Earths\" was established and heavily enforced to avoid the continuity problems of the Multiverse. However, alternate realities that affected the new DC Universe appeared very quickly. In \"Superman\" Vol. 2 #8, a Universe inside the Universe was revealed to have been created to preserve the Legion of Super Heroes' 30th century in New Earth. This world was used to allow crossovers with certain characters of the Legion of Super-Heroes and recreate characters that otherwise could not exist in the new continuity (such as Kryptonians, as in the New Earth Superman was the only survivor of Krypton). Alternate timelines were also used, the most notable event being \"Armageddon 2001\" in 1991. An Antimatter Universe existed as well, which had some \"reversed\" events in a similar way as the former Earth-Three. The Earth within this Universe was called \"Earth 2\". In addition, there was a Limbo, where some heroes and characters that could not be brought back to \"existence\" after the Crisis on Infinite Earths lived outside the Universe.\n\nAn important rule in the new DC Universe was that there could only be one timeline, so any change caused by time travelers caused the destruction of their timelines of origin. Changes in the past were often \"fixed\" or have to comply with the present to prevent continuity errors.\n\nNonetheless, continuity errors appeared. The retold origin of Hawkman presented errors regarding the existence of the Golden Age version (Carter Hall) and the Silver Age version (Katar Hol) in the same continuity without a good explanation. The interaction of \"possible timelines\" also created continuity holes. This led to a new crisis to address the problem: the . The resulting universe had a slightly re-written story with no continuity errors even though it was acknowledged that reality-shattering events did happen (including the Crisis on Infinite Earths). This Universe kept the concept of one universe, one timeline. Such timeline was \"mapped\" from beginning to present (1994) at the back cover of \"Zero Hour\" #0, that also included certain key dates in the future.\n\nThe need to publish stories outside the strict DC Universe continuity led to the creation of certain DC imprints. Stories that set DC characters in different situations after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, were published by DC Comics under the Elseworlds imprint. None of these stories were ever intended to be included in the \"real\" continuity of the DC Universe.\n\nCertain characters were reinvented in a mature context and were published under the Vertigo imprint. Most of the times, the characters depicted within the Vertigo imprint had no relation to the original DC Universe's versions, nor did the events have influence over the new Universe.\n\nLater, under a special publishing deal with Milestone Media, DC Comics published a new series of comic books that told the stories of the heroes living in Dakota City, formed mostly by African-American superheroes and other minorities. These characters lived in a universe separated from the DC Universe (known as the Dakotaverse or Milestone Universe). The event known as \"Worlds Collide\" presented one of the first modern intercompany crossovers within the established continuity of the Universes instead of being \"imaginary\" and showed that there could be other universes or even multiverses outside the new DC Universe.\n\nIn a similar way to \"Worlds Collide\", the crossover event \"DC vs. Marvel\" showed another in-continuity crossover with another reality completely separated from the DC Universe and that has a Multiverse of its own: the universe of Earth-616 of the Marvel Multiverse.\n\nThe universes were rarely referred to with specific names within the stories but were named in the \"Real World\" (both officially and unofficially) using the name of the editorial, imprint or even an element in particular. While in the comic books the concept of a \"real\" Multiverse was avoided, the Multiverse played an important role in cartoon series and live-action shows (see Other versions).\n\nIn summary, from 1986 to 1999, everything not happening in the \"mainstream\" continuity appearing in DC comics was either an \"apocryphal\" story or happened in a completely different and separate reality/universe/multiverse.\n\nIn 1999, the unexpected and overwhelming success of Elseworlds's \"Kingdom Come\" and other stories, led to the creation of the concept known as Hypertime in order to publish crossovers with those characters and the mainstream continuity. This structure gave \"existence\" to alternate timelines, stories in Elseworlds, appearances in other media and any other appearance of DC characters in the past. The main timeline or \"Central Timeline\" was like a river and all of the alternate stories were branches of it. Hypertime was similar to the former Multiverse as it allowed each and every reality ever published to co-exist and interact as most branches tend to return to the original stream (explaining some retcons as well as crossovers). However, all realities existed within only one Universe.\n\nOriginally, the stories appearing in WildStorm Productions' comic books occurred in a Universe that was part of the Image Universe along with other characters appearing in Image Comics publications. It was separated from it during the event called Shattered Image consolidating the separate WildStorm Universe which had its own multiversal structure. After the purchase of WildStorm by DC Comics, crossovers occurred with the new DC Universe, which were still separated just like Milestone and Marvel.\n\nIn 2005, a new universal crisis story arc was published as a way to update once more the super heroes of DC Comics, bring together other \"realities\" (namely, Milestone and Wildstorm) and bring back the Multiverse, this time with a limited number of Earths instead of infinite.\n\nDuring the event \"Infinite Crisis\", the Universe was \"splintered\" and the original Multiverse was restored briefly, showing that the entire Hypertime and many other appearances of the DC characters were part of the original Multiverse, including Tangent Comics which were published 12 years after the Multiverse was no more. In the end of \"Infinite Crisis\", the multiverse is merged back as a New Earth with a new continuity with many stories re-written and many others from the Modern Age still happening.\n\nIn parallel, \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\" tells the story of how Captain Atom of the DC Universe causes the recreation of the Wildstorm Universe upon its destruction (and possibly its Multiverse as well). The recreated universe became part of the newly recreated DC Universe.\n\nThe aftermath of \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\" (\"52\", \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" and \"Final Crisis\") showed that a new Multiverse was created. The new Multiverse consisted of 52 positive matter universes, an Antimatter Universe and a Limbo. The main continuity still occurred in New Earth (also called Earth-0), Earths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 resembled Earths One, Two, Three, Four, S, and X of the original Multiverse respectively. Earths 13 and 50 were Vertigo and the rebooted Wildstorm Universe, while Earth-17 became the world of a revived post-apocalypse Atomic Knights after a mid-80s World War III once more. Many important stories from the Elseworlds imprint were later also given their own alternate Earths within this new Multiverse.\n\nIn the miniseries, \"Milestone Forever\", in a similar fashion as \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\", the events that led to the end of the Dakotaverse and its integration to the new DC continuity are revealed. Most of the stories that were told in Milestone Comics publications now occurred in New Earth and the Dakotaverse ceased to exist as a separated Universe.\n\nA naming convention was established and followed this time in the format \"Earth, hyphen, numeral\", from Earth-0 to Earth-51.\n\nEven with a new Multiverse, not every published or related work had an \"Earth\" within the 52 and there were no in-continuity intercompany crossovers.\n\nTaking advantage of the fact that many of these universes were mostly unchronicled or merely glimpsed and that \"Final Crisis\" also changed the Multiverse slightly, many stories featuring alternate worlds and their interactions were published, which led certain inconsistencies and retcons to appear, such as Earth-1 being originally a \"mirror\" of Earth-One and later being the reality of J. Michael Straczynski's \"\" or Earth-16 being the home of an alternate Superman/Christopher Kent, the home of the \"Super-Sons\", and later the reality of the \"Young Justice\" TV series. Also, some universes appearing in the new continuity were never given a proper place within the 52 Universe, such as Prime-Earth.\n\nThe new restored universe with only 52 worlds opened myriad possibilities for new stories and crossovers with different versions of heroes interacting with the main versions of heroes as well as the stories resulting from the new integrated characters from Milestone and Wildstorm. However, it became chaotic in just five years. Many stories and situations of other Universes were not followed well. The number designations could be completely disregarded from story to story and some universes were recreated over and over. In addition, as most of the history of the Modern Age was still being the main continuity, younger readers could not follow the stories of the mainstream versions of the DC heroes, just as had happened prior to the original \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n\nIn order to overcome these new problems, a new event was created to restart the DC Comics's Universe. In the \"Flashpoint\" miniseries (May–September 2011), the Flash alters the timeline of Earth-0 creating a ripple effect that affected several past events, Earth-13 (Vertigo Universe) and Earth-50 (new Wildstorm Universe). Similar to the end result of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", a new mainstream Earth is created from the former three, with a whole new history. Most of the stories have been retold anew but certain events of New Earth remain (such as Batgirl being crippled by the Joker). Since it was established after \"Infinite Crisis\" that if something ever happened to the main Universe, the whole Multiverse could be affected as well, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was also recreated. This new Multiverse is called \"The New 52\".\n\nThis time, not all universes were revealed right away, only a couple were revealed in the first two years of \"The New 52\". In addition, in a similar fashion as the Elseworlds logo would appear in comics that did not occur in the \"real\" continuity, the logo \"THE NEW 52!\" would only appear in publications with stories occurring in the new continuity, while those taking place outside of this new continuity (such as \"Smallville: Season 11\" or the \"Batman Beyond\" universe) would not bear this distinction. At first it seemed that there was not going to be a naming convention for the Earths as it happened with the 52. The mainstream continuity was known as Prime Earth, although it was not a similar world to the real world as Earth-Prime was. J. Michael Straczynski's re-envisioning of classic Batman and Superman stories was released as part of a series called \"Earth One\". In Grant Morrison's \"The Multiversity\" (2014–2015), the Earths are named in the same format as in the former 52 Multiverse (Earth-6, Earth-7, Earth-8 etc.) Morrison intended for \"The Multiversity\" to reveal remaining universes of The New 52 multiverse, and the underlying structure for the multiverse was revealed in a detailed map in the back of several comic books, for which an interactive online version is being maintained and updated on the DC Comics website. In addition, the sixth issue of \"The Multiversity\" constituted a 'guidebook' to the worlds of the current DC multiverse and was published in January 2015.\n\nOn October 2, 2011, Dan DiDio posted on his Facebook page that in The New 52, the three previous \"crises\" did not occur in this new continuity, but other events such as \"Zero Hour\" still happened, without ending in a crisis/reboot. However, writers continued to make references to the crises, and the full history of the structure of the DC Multiverse, detailing previous crisis events, was given in Grant Morrison's \"The Multiversity\" (2014–2015) limited series.\n\nThe \"Convergence\" (2015) crossover event later explored this concept within the DCU. This miniseries brought back several heroes from the ages of DC Comics that were obliterated by the crisis events. They were trapped by a godlike incarnation of Brainiac outside of time (or Vanishing Point as this \"place\" is called). At the end of the crossover, Brainiac sent these heroes back to their own timelines, and also successfully sent \"Zero Hour\" Hal Jordan, pre-\"Flashpoint\" Superman and other heroes back to the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" so that the collapse of the Multiverse could be averted.\n\nFrom July 2015 onwards, The New 52 marking ended with the continuation of several publications and new others that did not necessarily take place within \"The New 52\" multiverse. Advertised as \"DC YOU\" (a pun of DCU or DC Universe and the phrase \"it's about you, the fans\" appearing in the advertisements), DC now has an \"open doors\" policy to continuity, granting writers greater freedom to explore stories set outside the established New 52 Multiverse continuity, as well as to revisit other characters and concepts from DC's history as the conclusion of \"Convergence\" suggested that although the core 52 universe that now exists is the evolution of the multiverse, all the worlds still exist in some form. This was confirmed by \"Convergence\" writer Jeff King, as he stated that the reconstituted DC Multiverse is now infinite and there might be more than one Multiverse.\n\nThe 2016 \"DC Rebirth\" initiative returned the original Wally West to Earth from the Speed Force and reveals that time has been stolen from his friends' memories, and the Superman of the pre-\"Flashpoint\" world, stranded in the new timeline following \"Convergence\", assumes the role of that Earth's Superman. In \"Action Comics\" #976, the pre-\"Flashpoint\" and \"New 52\" Supermen's histories are merged. Peter J. Tomasi explains that \"The events of \"Action\" #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them.\"\n\nAs told in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #7, the DC Universe was a single positive matter Universe until a scientist named Krona from the planet Oa altered the very moment of the creation of the Universe, causing it to split into countless similar universes and an antimatter universe. Oa, however, had no duplicates in the Multiverse but did have a twin in the antimatter universe: Qward. A satellite on each of these planets was created in the cataclysm and it was there where the embodiments of the Multiverse were born: the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor. The two battled to a standstill and eventually rendered one another comatose.\n\nThe Multiverse had countless duplicates of planet Earth. Every Earth had a different history from one another but they always developed heroes and inspired heroic ages (which, according to Harbinger, it somehow made them a focal point among all the worlds in every universe). Some of the heroes of Earth knew about other Earths and their own counterparts and fought side by side on many occasions.\n\nLater, a scientist from one universe named Kell Mossa (known initially only as Pariah) created another device that would allow him to attempt the same thing Krona had attempted before. His actions accidentally awakened the Anti-Monitor, who then devoured Pariah's entire universe (aside from Pariah himself) and began to do the same to other universes (Pariah originally believes that the opposite is true; that his experiment destroyed the universes, which awakened the Anti-Monitor, until the truth is revealed to him). The time period of Earth when this takes place or the name of this Earth are never revealed.\n\nThe Monitor is awakened by the destruction of the positive matter universes and starts a plan to save the Multiverse but his efforts, and later those of his protégé, Harbinger, with the help of the heroes of the Multiverse, only manage to save five universes. In a desperate effort to save all existence, heroes and villains unite in order to stop Krona from splitting the Universe and stop the Anti-Monitor from altering the moment of creation and make the Antimatter Universe the only one. They succeed in saving all existence but in the process, the Multiverse, its countless duplicate worlds and its history ceased to exist. The five universes that were saved were folded together into a single universe, placing all the heroes and villains into a single timeline. For example, Justice Society of Earth-Two instead became a team active in the 1940s that inspired the Justice League to form decades later. And in the event of any duplicate characters, the original Earth-One version would take precedence.\n\nAll the universes existed within the same space but had a unique vibration that kept them separated. Only by \"tuning\" to the specific frequency of a universe could a person leap to another Earth, as Barry Allen discovered as he tried to perform a disappearing act by vibrating his molecules at super speed (\"Flash\" #123). The \"speedster\" later developed a machine called the \"Cosmic Treadmill\", which, when it was used by people who controlled the Speed Force, it allowed the users to trespass the \"vibrational barriers\". Magic and cosmic incidents also made many people to travel to other universes.\n\nEvery universe could have its own dimensions, such as the Fifth Dimension (where Mr. Mxyztplk (Earth-Two), Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite (both Earth-One) came from), alternate timelines (Kamandi and the 30th Century of Earth-One) and realms (Hell, Heaven, Gemworld, etc.). In addition to the unique Antimatter Universe, the dimension of the New Gods (the Fourth World) was also believed unique, although there is evidence that there could have been alternate versions of them (as those appearing in Earth-17 and Earth-Crossover).\n\nEven though the interaction between multiple Earths was common in the 20th century with relative safety and ease, most of the population of Earth was unaware of the Multiverse until the Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nThe following is a short list of the most notable universes in the Multiverse.\n\n15 billion years ago, a single universe with a single timestream was created. 4.4 billion years ago, Krona, the renegade Maltusian (a race of highly evolved beings) creates the Antimatter Universe and releases entropy in the universe by linking the beginning and the end of the timeline in his attempts to reveal the secrets of the creation of the universe.\n\nIn this single universe, the timeline was destroyed in the early 1990s by Hal Jordan (possessed by Parallax) and created a slightly changed timeline (\"Zero Hour\", 1994). It was later revealed that this \"Central Timeline\" was like a river with branches. These branches were like different realities, the history of Earth was different in every branch and everything could be possible in them. They could affect the Central Timeline as they return to the mainstream and the heroes could encounter with different versions of themselves. However, they were somewhat ephemeral as the Central Timeline is the only one that could prevail (\"The Kingdom\", 1999).\n\nAfter \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", there was no place for alternate realities, although they could exist in the form of ephemeral timelines (Hypertime), dimensions (such as the fifth dimension or the Fourth World) or universes inside the Universe (such as the Legion of Super-Heroes' pocket universe or the Amalgam Universe).\n\nHowever, there was contact with realities that existed outside the Universe such as those from Marvel, Milestone and Wildstorm. The collection of universes, multiverses and others that are unrelated, is most of the time called the Megaverse. Some also call it the Omniverse, but tend to include the Real World when using this denomination.\n\nThe contact of these worlds usually brought cataclysms, the one being the most common, amalgamation. Traveling between these realities was extremely hard, only two characters were capable of doing so with natural abilities: Rift, who existed in both the DC and Milestone Universes, and Access, who had the task of keeping the DC and Marvel Universes separated to prevent amalgamation.\n\nMost of the time, these events were either forgotten (as shown in the \"Unlimited Access\" miniseries as Access has the power to annul or restore the memories of heroes) or believed to be \"dreams\" (as shown in \"DC/Milestone: Worlds Collide\" and \"DC/Wildstorm: Dreamwar\"), which in the end left few traces of the events in the respective continuities.\n\nThe Wildstorm Universe was part of a larger multiverse but was separated after a multiversal cataclysm, forming a multiverse of its own (\"Shattered Image\"). Organizations known as Planetary and the Authority were capable of traveling across the Multiverse and were also able to map it. Its structure was described as a web of 196,833 universes arranged in a pattern resembling a snowflake, each universe separated from its neighbors by a medium called the Bleed. The Bleed prevented the Universes from colliding and was inhabited by \"fauna\" that despised all different Earths.\n\nAlexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth-Prime grew tired of their exile. After successfully escaping their prison, they seek to restore their worlds and search for a perfect new world, as they believe the happenings at New Earth after the Crisis make it a flawed reality. The whole Multiverse is restored, but with great instability that could cause the end of all existence (\"Infinite Crisis\"). Parallel to these events, Captain Atom arrives in a different multiverse, jeopardizing its very existence. Void destroys the now-corrupted universe in order to recreate it (\"Captain Atom: Armageddon\").\n\nThe heroes of Earth manage to merge back the Multiverse into a single universe, but it could not hold so much energy. 52 identical worlds are created to liberate such energy. Mister Mind, finally in his ultimate form, has the power to devour parts of the time continuum, literally eating parts of the Earths' history and creating major differences between each other (\"52\").\n\nIn the Universe where the city of Dakota existed, a man known as Dharma foresaw the final demise of Earth and searched for a way to avert it. His very efforts were responsible for the apocalypse he tried to prevent. He managed to salvage the remains of his Earth by merging them to the main Earth of the new Multiverse that was reformed after the death of the New Gods (\"Milestone Forever\", \"Final Crisis\").\n\nThis Multiverse consisted of only 52 worlds, 51 resting upon Earth-0. According to Rip Hunter in \"52 #52\", every universe occupied the same space, each on a different vibrational plane (as it was in the original Multiverse). However, it was stated later that the universes were also separated by a fluid known as the Bleed (just like in the former Wildstorm Universe). The Bleed is interconnected to the Source Wall (which separates existence from the force that created it or \"the Source\") and the Multiversal Nexus, where the 52 Monitors watched over the Multiverse and had the task of avoiding contacts between the universes that could cause cataclysms. If Earth-0 should be destroyed, it would cause a chain reaction, destroying the rest of the 51 universes and leaving the opposite Antimatter Universe solely in existence. Each of the alternate universes have their own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc., branching off them. The Monitors originated in a world called Nil and were a sort of descendants of the original Monitor, who was created by Overvoid, a limitless intelligence who investigated the Multiverse at the beginning of time. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 erased the Monitors, as they self-proclaimed themselves the judges of what happened in the worlds of the Multiverse.\n\nThe Flash wakes up in an altered timeline. As he tries to find the cause, he discovers that he was responsible for the alteration and attempts to fix it. In doing so, it is revealed that the timelines of Earth-0, Earth-13 and Earth-50 were originally one, but were splintered. The result is a new timeline formed by those three and along with it came a new history for the other 52 worlds within the Multiverse (\"Flashpoint\", 2011). It is later revealed that, in actuality, the current timeline was created when a mysterious being (implied to be Doctor Manhattan from \"Watchmen\") entered the Multiverse while the timeline was resetting due to Barry Allen preventing the Flashpoint event and extracted ten years from continuity (\"DC Universe: Rebirth\", 2016)\n\nYears later, the Harbinger Program at the House of Heroes gathers several superheroes of the \"Orrery of Worlds\" to fight against a force known as the \"Gentry\" who has already decimated Earth-7 and threatens the rest of the worlds of the Multiverse. As the story unfolds, Earths within the Orrery are visited and reveal the new nature of them after the Flashpoint event. Also, mysterious comic books published by DC and Major Comics appear and are believed to be cursed or to be messages from parallel Earths (\"The Multiversity\" (2014)).\n\nSeveral stories and even the structure of the entire Multiverse have been retold after the events of \"Flashpoint\". As it has been revealed so far, most of the 52 worlds suffered drastic changes such as Earth-2 which is now a reboot in the present day of the heroes that formed the Justice Society or Earth-3 which reverted to be the opposite of the main Earth (Earth-0 in this case), instead of the opposite of Earth-Two. Others retain most of what they were in the 52 multiverse such as Earth-5, Earth-10, or Earth-23. In addition, seven Earths remain undisclosed in composition or purpose, other than their creation by the Monitors for unknown reasons-Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49.\n\nThe Monitors are now described as a race of countless members and only 52 remained after the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" event, suggesting that there were Monitors for every world in the original Multiverse instead of just one. Several elements that have appeared across the history to what now is DC Comics have also been actively incorporated in the new structure, such as the Source Wall (\"The New Gods\"), the Bleed (Wildstorm's \"The Authority\"), the Speed Force and the vibrational barriers (\"The Flash\") and the Rock of Eternity (\"Shazam!\").\n\nThis new Multiverse has a sphere-like structure with several levels (or vibrational realms) as described in the map:\n\n\nAn infinitely powerful and god-like version of Brainiac abducted multiple superheroes and their core cities from various alternate Earths and eras of the Multiverse and pitted them against one another. Because of the heroes' efforts for the survival of reality during this event, the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and \"Zero Hour\" were averted and there is once more an infinite Multiverse beyond the core 52 universes which have made up the local Multiverse since \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"Flashpoint\". The original Multiverse coexists along with the collapsed Earth, the core 52 worlds, and all other versions of the Multiverse that have ever existed.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, it is revealed that each reality of the Multiverse has a negative counterpart created by the fears of a universe's people. These Dark Universes are explained to be temporary realities, which motivate the Dark Knights to invade the Multiverse so that they can save their dying realities. Forthcoming \"Dark Multiverse\" stories will revisit this realm, with mutated versions of Superman, Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane.\n\nContact between the universes (or stories set on the other Earths) have been reprinted in the following graphic novels.\n\nIn the animated television series \"Super Friends\", the superhero team has encounters with other universes, including the world of Qward. In the episode \"Universe of Evil\", a freak accident causes Superman to switch places with his evil counterpart.\n\nThe DC animated universe (DCAU) has depicted the Multiverse many times. Several characters from the main DCAU have visited parallel universes that were similar to the DCAU.\n\n\nIn \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\", the show's primary protagonists, Lois Lane and Clark Kent, encountered an alternative version Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the episodes \"Tempus, Anyone?\" and \"Lois & Clarks\". In the episode \"Tempus, Anyone?\", the dimension included these differences:\n\n\nThe primary version of Lois, who was abducted by the villain Tempus and taken to this dimension, helped the alternate Clark become Superman, only to have Tempus expose his secret identity to the world on television. Despite Clark's alien origin, the world embraces him as their champion.\n\nLater in the episode \"Lois & Clarks\", the alternate Clark visits the primary \"L&C\" dimension to aid Lois in stopping Tempus while the Clark Kent of her world is trapped in a time vortex. After Tempus' defeat, it is implied that the alternate Clark would travel to the past with H.G. Wells and take his reality's Lois Lane to his own time thus, under a predestination paradox, explaining her disappearance.\n\n\nThe WildStorm comic book series \"Planetary\" also introduced the concept of a multiverse, drawing upon the mathematical concept known as the Monster group for inspiration. The multiverse is described as \"a theoretical snowflake existing in 196,833 dimensional space\", a reference to the visualization method used by some mathematicians when describing the Monster group.\n\nThe live-action television series \"Smallville\" also featured the Multiverse concept. In the season 5 episode \"Lexmas\", Lex Luthor visits an alternate timeline where Lionel cuts Lex out of the family fortune while Lex is married to Lana and has a son named Alexander. Clark Kent is a reporter with the Daily Planet, Chloe is publishing a book exposing LuthorCorp with Lex's help, and Jonathan Kent is a state senator.\n\nIn the season 7 episode \"Apocalypse,\" Clark is taken to an alternate timeline where his counterpart had not arrived in Smallville and is killed by Brainiac. In that dimension, Clark Kent encounters another version of himself who is a human biological son of Martha and Jonathan and never met Lana Lang (who is a cheerleader with a different group of friends). Also in this dimension, Chloe Sullivan is engaged, Lana Lang is a married woman living in Paris, Sheriff Nancy Adams left Smallville and works as a member of the government, and Lex Luthor became President of the United States. While this dimension's Earth is destroyed by President Luthor, Clark travels back in time and sends his infant self to Earth, thus restoring his timeline.\n\nIn the season 10 episode \"Luthor\", Clark Kent travels to an alternate universe dubbed Earth-2 with the help of a Kryptonian mirror box. There, Lionel Luthor is his adopted father instead of Jonathan Kent. Clark is a bloodthirsty tyrant whose persona is Ultraman. He has a relationship with his adopted sister, Tess. Clark Luthor killed his adoptive brother Lex. When Clark Kent travels to the alternate earth, his counterpart, Clark Luthor, travels to his. Lois Lane is engaged to Oliver Queen, who bought land in Smallville for its kryptonite. Lionel lures Clark into Oliver's kryponite trap and beats him. With the help of Oliver (who closes the kryponite portal), Clark uses the mirror box and returns to his world. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel comes with him.\n\nEarth-2 is featured again later in the season in the episode \"Kent\", as Clark Luthor returns to his counterpart's world once more, and Clark Kent meets Earth-2's Jonathan Kent. After Clark Kent interacts with his deceased adoptive father's counterpart, he returns to his own world and lures Clark Luthor to the Fortress of Solitude, where he sends his counterpart back to his world.\n\nIn the fourth issue of the television series' comic book continuation \"Smallville Season 11\", an alternative version of Chloe Sullivan from Earth-2 arrives to Clark Kent's world and reveals that her universe is destroyed before her death. In issue #11, it is reveals that the Monitors are responsible for Earth-2's destruction.\n\nAcross this multiverse, there are other Earths featured in the series including:\n\n\nIn \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\", a kind of \"multiverse\" is referenced in the episodes \"Deep Cover for Batman!\" and \"Game Over for Owlman!\", which feature several references to alternate incarnations of DC Comics heroes and villains, including the Batman and the Owlman. The Multiverse is briefly revisited in \"Night of the Batmen!\", with a large group of Batmen gathered from across various Earths coming together to help an injured Bruce Wayne protect Gotham. The army of Multiverse Batmen contained various iterations of the Batman from different media adaptions, such as from \"The Batman\", the DC Animated Universe, the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series, and \"Batman Beyond\".\n\nThe direct-to-video feature \"Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths\" deals with the Multiverse as part of its story. The main story deals with a good Lex Luthor from his Earth (based on the Pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Three) coming to the Earth where the Justice League are located to help fight their counterparts, the Crime Syndicate. While the two Earths inhabited by the Justice League and Crime Syndicate are not named, names of other Earths are mentioned. These names are not from the official Pre-\"Crisis\" nor post-\"Infinite Crisis\" Multiverse, but are nods to a degree. Examples include: \"Gamma F-1\", \"Theta-Alpha\", \"Zeta-Pi\", which are all Greek numbers. Earth-Prime is featured in the film, but is not the same Earth-Prime from the comics, where it was \"our\" Earth. In the film, Earth-Prime is shown to be the cornerstone of all reality, and that decisions made by humankind on this world caused alternate Earths where the opposite decision was made to come into being. This world is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though the Owlman reasons that it was mankind who destroyed itself. There was also an unnamed Earth that is mostly covered in ice. It was destroyed when the Owlman allowed the bomb to detonate with himself still on it.\n\nIn the video game \"DC Universe Online\", Brainiac decides to conquer New Earth in order to know the secret of the multiverse. After he was defeated, the heroes have to face the Council of Luthors, who wants to take control of the Nexus of Reality and rule existence through the achievement of ultimate power. But the Council of Batmen wishes to stop the Luthors and undo the damage that has been done.\n\nThe storyline of \"\" features an alternate reality where the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear explosion. This tragedy completely ruins Superman's moral compass to the point of no return and the Kryptonian murders the Joker in retaliation. As time passes, he establishes a new world order, with himself as the High Councilor. Soon enough, Superman's iron-fisted rule triggers a war between the Regime and those allied with the Batman's Insurgency. High Councilor Superman begins a relationship with Wonder Woman who becomes one of his most devoted followers. Damian Wayne eventually sides with Superman against his father and kills Victor Zsasz. Cyborg also joins the Regime due to sharing his anger over the destruction of Metropolis. Dick Grayson is accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, which creates an even further rift between himself and his father, who mourns the death of his adopted son while Damian eventually adopts Dick's mantle of Nightwing. Harley Quinn leads a group called the Joker Gang who idolizes the Joker and fights alongside the Insurgency against the Regime. Both Black Adam and Billy Batson (Shazam) join the Regime. Hal Jordan becomes Yellow Lantern after joining the Sinestro Corps. which has allied itself with Superman's Regime against the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Arrow is killed by the Regime, leaving behind the Black Canary who is pregnant with their son Connor. The Black Canary is saved by Doctor Fate who transports her to an alternate Earth where Oliver Queen is still alive, though he has lost his Black Canary. Five years into the war, the Insurgency discovers an alternate universe where the Joker's plan did not succeed and transports several of its superheroes (Wonder Woman, the Batman, Aquaman, the Green Arrow, and Green Lantern) to their world in order to help them defeat the Regime. Unfortunately, the Joker of this universe is brought to the Regime universe and is killed. Also in this universe, Lex Luthor never becomes a criminal and instead he is a selfless businessman, best friend of this world's Superman and cares for the people of Metropolis, though he secretly sides with the Batman against the tyrannical Superman, only to be killed in battle. Together with the alternate universe Justice League and the Regime Flash, who defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam when he objects to Superman's plans to attack cities, the Regime Superman is defeated and imprisoned in the Red Son prison along with fellow Regime members Cyborg and Damian Wayne (Nightwing). Hal Jordan and Sinestro are imprisoned on Oa by the Guardians. The Flash allows himself to be taken into custody to face charges for his role in the Regime. After the Regime's fall, Bruce Wayne works to rebuild the world after the fall of the Regime. The alternate Justice League return to their universe.\n\nThe \"Injustice\" universe is featured at the beginning of \"Convergence\" as one of the many realities affected by Telos' Blood Moon.\n\nIn \"Injustice 2\", it is revealed that Krypton in this universe was attacked by Brainiac who collects the city of Kandor and destroys Argo City, which Kara Zor-El barely survives. Her mother saves her from Brainiac's Betas and reveals that Brainiac has destabilized the planet's core. Kara is tasked with watching over her baby cousin Kal-El and flees Krypton in a spaceship at the behest of her mother; however, her ship is damaged and knocked off course by the planet's explosion, which puts her into suspended animation. She is later found drifting through space by Black Adam, who takes her to Kahndaq where he and Wonder Woman have been hiding out since Superman was imprisoned. Black Adam and Wonder Woman train her in the hopes that her strength will give them the edge to free Kal-El. A flashback shows how Robin (Damian Wayne) joins Superman after killing the remorseless serial killer Victor Zsasz (which retcons the nature and timing of Damain's murder of Zsasz from the \"Injustice\" prequel comics). In the present, Damian Wayne and Cyborg are also incarcerated with Superman, while Aquaman has distanced himself away from the Regime to protect Atlantis. Meanwhile, Bruce is busy with the rebuilding the world after the Regime, forcing him to enlist other heroes such as the Black Canary, her husband the Green Arrow (from the alternate universe that the Black Canary was sent to by Doctor Fate), Firestorm and the Blue Beetle/Jaime Reyes as well as Harley Quinn, the Flash (who had been pardoned due to his role in taking down the Regime after the murder of Billy Batson by Superman) and Hal Jordan, who was reinstated as Green Lantern by the Guardians of the Universe, who managed to rehabilitate him. The Batman also constructs Brother Eye to monitor Earth for the Regime, the Society, and other potential threats. The Batman tasks the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and Harley to deal with the Society, a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd after the fall of the Regime. During their confrontation with the Society in Gorilla City, they learn of an even greater threat posed by Brainiac which leads to the three being captured, though Harley escapes thanks to the intervention of the Catwoman, who had infiltrated the Society as an undercover mole. Brainiac hacks into Brother Eye and demands that Superman be handed over to him, though Bruce suits up and flees from the Batcave. Supergirl informs Wonder Woman and Black Adam of the threat posed by Brainiac and tells them they must get to her cousin before it is too late. This leads Kara and the Regime to break into the Red Son prison to free Superman, Cyborg, and Damian Wayne. However, the Blue Beetle and Firestorm protect the prison, but they are overwhelmed. Firestorm plans to destroy the Regime with a nuclear explosion, but the Batman tells him to stand down and decides that the threat posed by Brainiac is too great, leading the Insurgency and Regime to join forces to battle a common enemy. However, Supergirl begins to question what she had been told when Wonder Woman stabs Harley for trying to stop her from killing the Cheetah. Kara manages to save Harley's life, confronts her cousin and realizes that he has become a ruthless dictator like General Zod. After a brief battle with Robin, Black Adam, and Superman after her attempts to reason with Superman fail, they are interrupted by Brainiac's attack and Superman tells his cousin she must choose a side when it is over. During the battle with Brainiac's Skull Ship, Metropolis is destroyed again and Superman apparently killed. The Batman consoles Kara and tells her about how Superman was his friend once and refuses to accept Brainiac's proposal that he will spare Earth if Kara is handed over to him. She later joins the Batman in infiltrating Brainiac's ship, but Kara is captured, though Superman is revealed to be alive and he teams up with the Batman to stop Brainiac and save Kara. However, after Brainiac's defeat (which frees Kara) and Superman stopping the Skull Ship from crashing, the Regime and Insurgency clashes over how to deal with Brainiac as the Insurgency believes that if they spare Brainiac they will discover how to restore the collected cities and free their inhabitants, while Superman plans to kill Brainiac and restore the Regime, though Supergirl sides with the Insurgency, understanding that the Regime was planning to betray the Insurgency as soon as Brainiac was defeated. The story has two different endings.\n\n\nThe video game \"Infinite Crisis\" (which is unrelated to the comic book of the same name) features a multiverse with 52 different worlds. This multiverse is threatened by a sudden assault and all realities stand on the brink of annihilation. Now, the last hope for Earth lies in the powers of the DC legends.\n\nDuring the events of the tie-in comic book \"Infinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse\", it is said that the Monitors were a race of beings native to the world of Nil that resided outside all realities in the Overvoid. Their existence came following the creation of the Multiverse and the Bleed where they watched the infinite Earths and sought to protect the infinite strands of creation. It was claimed that they were a people that cared little about the existence of the inhabitants of these universes and more for the preservation of their grand order. Such was their existence, until one of their kind turned against the others and became the Anti-Monitor. A Crisis emerged as a result whereby many universes were destroyed, but the Anti-Monitor was defeated at the cost of almost the entire Monitor race. From this Crisis, there existed only 52 universes left in the Multiverse that were kept in perfect balance. The only survivor of their race was Nix Uotan, who detected a new Crisis emerging from an unknown menace who made use of corrupted Monitor technology and struck at Earth-48. Nix Uotan returned to his people's home world in order to reactivate the machinery to help contain the damage from the Crisis. As a result, he began to seek out champions and even villains to help combat this menace from across the Multiverse. These individuals would be charged with recovering artifacts from across the many Earths that were being taken by the mysterious enemy to aid in their assault. Among his agents was a human female from Earth-48 who went by the name of Harbinger.\n\nThe featured alternate Earths are those of the New 52 DC Multiverse.\n\n\nSuperman, Supergirl, Poison Ivy, the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Catwoman, Wonder Woman, the Batman and Robin are featured as player possibilities, each with alternate versions amongst the six featured alternate Earth scenarios.\n\nIn this reality, the Monitors had access to energy constructs that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light and served as a guide across the alternate universes as well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines that could be used to help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.\n\nIn July 2014, DC CCO Geoff Johns confirmed that the universe present in the publisher's television series, \"Arrow\" and \"The Flash\", is separate from the one being built in their films with \"Man of Steel\" and \"\". In October 2014, Johns explained DC's difference in approach to Marvel, saying \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through...It's just a different approach.\"\n\nThe Multiverse concept is explored during the second season of \"The Flash\", which is pivotal to the conflicts between Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) and rogue speedster Hunter Zolomon (Teddy Sears). The access points to the Multiverse are portals that were created as a result of an exploding singularity over Central City during the season 2 premiere \"The Man Who Saved Central City\". In the episode \"Enter Zoom\", it is revealed that Earth-2's version of the Green Arrow is Robert Queen (Jamey Sheridan) instead of his son Oliver (Stephen Amell), who presumably died on the boat accident. In the season 2 finale \"The Race of His Life\", Zoom reveals that the universe in which that of \"Arrow\", \"The Flash\" and \"Legends of Tomorrow\" sets is positioned in the Multiverse's center, and from there one could travel to any of the other infinite numbers of Earths. After Jay Garrick is rescued from Zoom, he reveals that he is from yet another Earth, designated Earth-3. In the Season 3 episode \"The New Rogues\", the Flash team explore the multiverse in search of a Harrison Wells doppelganger to replace the Earth-2 version. They encounter four others from various Earths, two of which are named Earth-17 and Earth-19, from which their new recruit, Harrison \"H.R.\" Wells, originates.\n\nThe television series \"Supergirl\" exists as another alternate universe separate from the main Arrowverse continuity. This is confirmed in the \"Supergirl\" episode \"Worlds Finest\", when the Flash appears on Supergirl's universe and names heroes from his world (the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, the Atom, Firestorm) that Supergirl does not recognize. In addition, the Flash's allies Dr. Harrison Wells, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon do not exist in Supergirl's universe, and S.T.A.R. Labs was not founded due to Wells' absence. Barry Allen does note that they do share celebrities, such as singer Mariah Carey and writer Alexandre Dumas, who wrote \"The Three Musketeers\". Supergirl's universe is coined Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon. Subsequent episodes from \"Legends of Tomorrow,\" \"Supergirl,\" and \"The Flash\" reveal that both Supergirl and Barry's universes also share the existences of the alien races of Thanagarians and Dominators.\n\nThe 2017 crossover event \"Crisis on Earth-X\"- which sees the heroes from all four shows face an invasion from the titular 'Earth-X', as a world where the Nazis won World War II- establishes that there are 52 known alternate Earths, with the titular 'Earth-X' being the fifty-third Earth, described by Harrison \"Harry\" Wells of Earth-2, that those who aware of the multiverse as being so dark and horrific that no interdimensional traveler would dare to journey there. Its history is basically the same as Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-38's, except the outcomes of World War II and Adolf Hitler continued his reign worldwide until his death in 1994. Its inhabitants include counterparts of people from these Earths as well, including Oliver Queen's doppelgänger, who is Hitler's successor as Führer and the villainous archer the Dark Arrow.\n\nBelow are the known Multiverse worlds in the Arrowverse:\n\nIssue #48 introduces its own multiverse. Each world pays references to various incarnation of the Teen Titans. The worlds shown are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded, stitched, or layered. Papermaking by hand is also an important paper craft. Painting and calligraphy though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.\n\nPaper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people. \n\nIn addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the education of children. Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals. It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials. Paper crafts may also be used in therapeutic settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.\n\nThe word \"paper\" derives from papyrus, the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in Egypt as far back as the third millennium B.C. Indeed, the earliest known example of \"paper folding\" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern road map. However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers. \n\nThe first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D. In much of the West, the term origami is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in Japan. Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi (Chinese paper folding), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and paper planes.\n\nPapel picado, as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while Chinese paper cutting uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. Wycinanki and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.\n\nImages built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. Chuck Close, Lynn Sures are among contemporary artist developing this medium. Paper pulp craft is widely used in rural India for making kitchen utility baskets.\n\n\n"}

Even if the bust, waist and hip circumferences are appropriate, the sleeve lengths, leg inseam lengths and vertical torso measurements (such as the back length and bust-waist length) must be altered significantly to fit well. Non-petite size dresses cannot be easily altered to produce the equivalent petite size, since, in general, these lengths (particularly the critical torso measurements) cannot be altered without introducing an unsightly seam. Significant errors in the torso measurements will make a well-fitted look impossible, e.g., if the bust-point darts are off by three inches.\n\nIn addition to its measurements, a petite-size garment may have a different \"design\" from those intended for taller women. For example, style elements may be added to give a longer, slimmer look, e.g., vertical stripes, princess seams, short skirts, large patterns or patterns arranged helically around the whole body. Unfortunately, many modern \"petite\" sizes are actually renamed half sizes intended for large women and, as a result, tend to be boxy and unfashionable for small-framed women. Designs for taller women may also have style lines that appear to shorten the figure, such as horizontal lines (e.g., clamdigger pants or midcalf skirts); hence, even if the measurements are adjusted correctly, a petite-size version of a regular-size garment may be unflattering.\n\nThe average height of an American woman is roughly (5'4\"), with a standard deviation of roughly . Thus, 40% of all American women are or shorter (formula_1) and roughly one-quarter (25%) are or shorter (formula_2). \n\nIn the UK and throughout much of Europe and Australasia, the average height varies from to . The old clothes sizes tended to correspond to the UK's 1951 size survey, which took as average height, and also took a slim, hour glass figure as standard. In the 1990s the Size UK project examined 16,000 people and changed the measurements for the 'average' size. This was widely reported, but stores responded to the headline (people getting bigger) rather than the facts (height rising only slightly but many individuals fatter). The fashion industry provides most of its merchandise in \"standard sizes\", which encompasses women sizes 4-14, 5'4\" to 5'8\" in height (European sizes 34-44 and 1.6256-1.7272 m), because this is the most profitable ready-to-wear market.\n\nAdults: U.S. Population, 1999–2002 - Page 20, Table 19.\n"}
{"id": "24971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24971", "title": "Preacher (comics)", "text": "Preacher (comics)\n\nPreacher is an American comic book series published by Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics. The series was created by writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon with painted covers by Glenn Fabry.\n\nThe series consists of 75 issues in total - 66 regular, monthly issues, five one-shot specials and a four-issue \"Preacher: Saint of Killers\" limited series. The entire run has been collected in nine trade paperback editions. The final monthly issue, number 66, was published in October 2000.\n\n\"Preacher\" tells the story of Jesse Custer, a preacher in the small Texas town of Annville. Custer is accidentally possessed by the supernatural creature named Genesis, the infant of the unauthorized, unnatural coupling of an angel and a demon. The incident flattens Custer's church and kills his entire congregation.\n\nGenesis has no sense of individual will, but since it is composed of both pure goodness and pure evil, its power might rival that of God Himself, making Jesse Custer, bonded to Genesis, potentially the most powerful being in the universe.\n\nDriven by a strong sense of right and wrong, Custer journeys across the United States attempting to literally find God, who abandoned Heaven the moment Genesis was born. He also begins to discover the truth about his new powers. They allow him, when he wills it, to command the obedience of those who hear and comprehend his words. He is joined by his old girlfriend Tulip O'Hare, as well as a hard-drinking Irish vampire named Cassidy.\n\nDuring the course of their journeys, the three encounter enemies and obstacles both sacred and profane, including The Saint of Killers, an invincible, quick-drawing, perfect-aiming, come-lately Angel of Death answering only to \"He who sits on the throne\"; a disfigured suicide attempt survivor turned rock-star named Arseface; a serial-killer called the 'Reaver-Cleaver'; The Grail, a secret organization controlling the governments of the world and protecting the bloodline of Jesus; Herr Starr, ostensible Allfather of the Grail, a megalomaniac with a penchant for prostitutes, who wishes to use Custer for his own ends; several fallen angels; and Jesse's own redneck 'family' — particularly his nasty Cajun grandmother, her mighty bodyguard Jody, and the 'animal-loving' T.C.\n\nGarth Ennis, feeling \"Preacher\" would translate perfectly as a film, sold the film rights to Electric Entertainment. Rachel Talalay was hired to direct, with Ennis writing the script. Rupert Harvey and Tom Astor were set as producers. By May 1998, Ennis completed three drafts of the script, based largely on the \"Gone to Texas\" story arc. The filmmakers found it difficult financing \"Preacher\" because investors found the idea religiously controversial. Ennis approached Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier to help finance the film under their View Askew Productions banner. Ennis, Smith and Mosier pitched \"Preacher\" to Bob Weinstein at Miramax Films.\n\nWeinstein was confused by the characterization of Jesse Custer. Miramax also did not want to share the box office gross with Electric Entertainment, ultimately dropping the pitch. By May 2000, Smith and Mosier were still attached to produce with Talalay directing, but Smith did not know the status of \"Preacher\", feeling it would languish in development hell. By then, Storm Entertainment, a UK-based production company known for their work on independent films, joined the production with Electric Entertainment. In September 2001, the two companies announced \"Preacher\" had been greenlighted to commence pre-production, with filming to begin in November and Talalay still directing Ennis' script. The production and start dates were pushed back because of financial issues of the $25 million projected budget.\n\nJames Marsden was cast in the lead role as Jesse Custer sometime in 2002. He explained, \"It was something I never knew anything about, but once I got my hands on the comic books, I was blown away by it.\" In a March 2004 interview, Marsden said the filmmakers were hoping for filming to start the following August. With the full-length film adaptation eventually abandoned with budgetary concerns, HBO announced in November 2006 that they commissioned Mark Steven Johnson and Howard Deutch to produce a television pilot. Johnson was to write with Deutch directing. Impressed with Johnson's pilot script, HBO had him write the series bible for the first season. Johnson originally planned \"to turn each comic book issue into a single episode\" on a shot-for-shot basis. \"I gave [HBO] the comics, and I said, 'Every issue is an hour'. Garth Ennis said 'You don't have to be so beholden to the comic'. And I'm like, 'No, no, no. It's got to be like the comic'.\"\n\nJohnson also wanted to make sure that one-shots were included as well. Johnson changed his position, citing new storylines conceived by Ennis. \"Well, there would be nothing new to add if we did that, so Garth [Ennis] and I have been creating new stories for the series,\" he said. \"I love the book so much and I was telling Garth that he has to make the stories we are coming up with as comics because I want to see them.\" By August 2008, new studio executives at HBO decided to abandon the idea, finding it too stylistically dark and religiously controversial. Columbia Pictures then purchased the film rights in October 2008 with Sam Mendes planned to direct. Neal H. Moritz and Jason Netter would have produced the film. The previous scripts written by Ennis would not have been used.\n\nOn November 16, 2013, it was announced that AMC would be shooting a pilot for \"Preacher\". On November 18, 2013, \"BleedingCool\" confirmed that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg had developed the series pilot with Sam Catlin, and that it would be distributed by Sony Pictures Television. On February 7, 2014 it was made public that AMC was officially developing the series to television based on the pilot written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Rogen has no plans to co-star in the series. On May 9, 2014, AMC announced that \"Preacher\" was picked up to series. \"Preacher\" was slated to premiere mid to late 2015, as announced by Seth Rogen, with the script for the series complete and the pilot ordered by the studio. Comic creators Steve Dillon and Garth Ennis will work on this project as co-executive producer. On April 17, 2015, Seth Rogen tweeted that Dominic Cooper was cast in the role of Jesse Custer, Joseph Gilgun as Cassidy, Ruth Negga as Tulip O'Hare, Ian Colletti as Arseface, and W. Earl Brown as Sheriff Hugo Root. On September 9, 2015, Seth Rogen announced via Twitter that the series ordered to a ten-episode season and was due to premiere in mid-2016. The series premiered on AMC on Sunday, May 22, 2016. In 2017 a second season, with thirteen episodes, aired. In 2018, a ten-episode third season aired.\n\nStephen King has said that his comic book series \"\" was influenced by \"Preacher\".\n\nThe character Yorick from \"\", has a Zippo lighter with the words \"Fuck Communism\" engraved, identical to the one owned by Jesse Custer in \"Preacher\". When asked about it he says it's \"from this book I read once... a graphic novel. You know, like a comic book.\" The phrase originated as a 1963 satirical poster produced by \"The Realist\" magazine's Paul Krassner. This lighter appears later in the series when Yorick and Agent 355 are being held by Russian agents at gunpoint, who find the lighter and take offense to it. Also, in volume 4 \"Safeword\", Yorick says \"pardners\", which is used several times in \"Preacher\", in lieu of \"partners\".\n\nIGN declared Preacher the third-greatest Vertigo comic, after \"Saga of the Swamp Thing\" and \"Sandman\".\n\nJesse Custer was ranked the 11th Greatest Comic Book Character by \"Empire\" magazine. The Saint of Killers was ranked at number 42 on the same list.\n\n"}

Four art books were also released: \"Rozen Maiden: Erinnerung\" published by SoftBank Creative, by Ichijinsha, \"Peach-Pit Art book (Rozen Maiden)\" and , both by Shueisha.\n\nMany merchandise has been released based on the \"Rozen Maiden\" franchise such as dolls, clothing and accessories, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nTokyopop's localized volumes appeared on ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The \"Rozen Maiden\" manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always being able to evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about \"Rozen Maiden\"s lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while \"Rozen Maiden\" was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying dark side of the plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.\n\nIn 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a \"Top 100\" online web poll and the \"Rozen Maiden\" anime adaptation placed 50th. In the subsequent year, \"Rozen Maiden: Träumend\" ranked 7th in a \"Top 20\" poll conducted by Japanese anime magazine \"Animage\". Active Anime had several reviewers for the anime series \"Rozen Maiden\" and its sequel \"Rozen Maiden: Träumend\". Christopher Seaman wrote several praises for the anime: the high quality visuals and the detail in the dolls' designs; the soundtrack which complements the visuals; and the story which he considered to be engaging, fast-paced, and comedic. Sandra Scholes described the series as a lavish production and that while it is battle oriented during fight scenes, it also offers emotional moments that cater to girls. Davey C. Jones commented the series is something \"Chobits\" fans would enjoy and that \"Rozen Maiden: Träumend\"s ending is not a \"feel good\" ending. Rachel Bentham however, was critical of the plot. Bentham described Jun's antisocial personality and friendship with the dolls to be disturbing and criticized the \"there can be only one\" competition between the dolls calling it misogynistic in nature.\n\nMania initially expressed skepticism of the show's combination of gothic lolita, dolls, magic, and comedy but later calls it a successful experiment and praised the character interactions and the dolls' designs. In their \"Rozen Maiden: Träumend\" review, Mania praised the visuals and characters but criticized the unbalanced comic and dark comments and described the revelations and finale as rushed. Anime News Network's review of \"Rozen Maiden: Träumend\" were mostly negative and addressed several points: the failed attempts at serious drama which were considered cliché and resulted in cheesy and melodramatic dialogue; the recycled background music; and the ending which was described as inconclusive and slapdash.\n\nAnime News Network's reviews of \"Rozen Maiden: Zurückspulen\" was generally positive. Carl Kimlinger described the characterization of the adult Jun as a \"highly believable mixture of bruised pride, desperate loneliness, and downtrodden numbness\" and praised how relatable the character is compared to his younger self. He also praised the scripting for Jun's life and the scene where Jun's personality is being dissected by his boss to be intelligently written. Bamboo Dong praised \"Zurückspulen\"s introduction for revitalizing the series. Both reviewers praised the art and dolls' designs and expressed concerns about the confusing plot.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "197179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197179", "title": "Sexual dimorphism", "text": "Sexual dimorphism\n\nSexual dimorphism is the condition where the two sexes of the same species exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. The condition occurs in many animals and some plants. Differences may include secondary sex characteristics, size, weight, color, markings, and may also include behavioral and cognitive differences. These differences may be subtle or exaggerated, and may be subjected to sexual selection. The opposite of dimorphism is \"monomorphism\".\n\nCommon and easily identified types of dimorphism are ornamentation and coloration, though not always apparent. A difference in coloration of sexes within a given species is called sexual dichromatism, which is commonly seen in many species of birds and reptiles. Sexual selection leads to the exaggerated dimorphic traits that are used predominantly in competition over mates. The increased fitness resulting from ornamentation offsets its cost to produce or maintain suggesting complex evolutionary implications, but the costs and evolutionary implications vary from species to species.\n\nExaggerated ornamental traits are used predominantly in the competition over mates, implying sexual selection. Ornaments may be costly to produce or maintain, which has complex evolutionary implications but the costs and implications differ depending on the nature of the ornamentation (such as the colour mechanism involved).\n\nThe peafowl constitute conspicuous illustrations of the principle. The ornate plumage of peacocks, as used in the courting display, attracts peahens. At first sight one might mistake peacocks and peahens for completely different species because of the vibrant colours and the sheer size of the male's plumage; the peahen being of a subdued brown coloration. The plumage of the peacock increases its vulnerability to predators because it is a hindrance in flight, and it renders the bird conspicuous in general. Similar examples are manifold, such as in birds of paradise and argus pheasants.\n\nAnother example of sexual dichromatism is that of the nestling blue tits. Males are chromatically more yellow than females. It is believed that this is obtained by the ingestion of green lepidopteran larvae, which contain large amounts of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. This diet also affects the sexually dimorphic colours in the human-invisible UV spectrum. Hence, the male birds, although appearing yellow to humans actually have a violet-tinted plumage that is seen by females. This plumage is thought to be an indicator of male parental abilities. Perhaps this is a good indicator for females because it shows that they are good at obtaining a food supply from which the carotenoid is obtained. There is a positive correlation between the chromas of the tail and breast feathers and body condition. Carotenoids play an important role in immune function for many animals, so carotenoid dependent signals might indicate health.\n\nFrogs constitute another conspicuous illustration of the principle. There are two types of dichromatism for frog species: ontogenetic and dynamic. Ontogenetic frogs are more common and have permanent color changes in males or females. Litoria lesueuri is an example of a dynamic frog that has temporary color changes in males during breeding season. Hyperolius ocellatus is an ontogenetic frog with dramatic differences in both color and pattern between the sexes. At sexual maturity, the males display a bright green with white dorsolateral lines. In contrast, the females are rusty red to silver with small spots. The bright coloration in the male population serves to attract females and as an aposematic sign to potential predators.\n\nFemales often show a preference for exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics in mate selection. The sexy son hypothesis explains that females prefer more elaborate males and select against males that are dull in color, independent of the species’ vision.\n\nSimilar sexual dimorphism and mating choice are also observed in many fish species. For example, male guppies have colorful spots and ornamentations while females are generally grey in color. Female guppies prefer brightly colored males to duller males.\n\nIn redlip blennies, only the male fish develops an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. During parental care, males rub their anal-urogenital regions over their nests' internal surfaces, thereby protecting their eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes for mortality in young fish.\n\nMost flower plants are hermaphroditic but approximately 6% have separate males and females (dioecy). Males and females in insect-pollinated species generally look similar to one another because plants provide rewards (e.g. nectar) that encourage pollinators to visit another similar flower, completing pollination. \"Catasetum\" orchids are one interesting exception to this rule. Male \"Catasetum\" orchids violently attach pollinia to euglossine bee pollinators. The bees will then avoid other male flowers but may visit the female, which looks different from the males.\n\nVarious other dioecious exceptions, such as \"Loxostylis alata\" have visibly different genders, with the effect of eliciting the most efficient behaviour from pollinators, who then use the most efficient strategy in visiting each gender of flower instead of searching say, for pollen in a nectar-bearing female flower.\n\nSome plants, such as some species of \"Geranium\" have what amounts to serial sexual dimorphism. The flowers of such species might for example present their anthers on opening, then shed the exhausted anthers after a day or two and perhaps change their colours as well while the pistil matures; specialist pollinators are very much inclined to concentrate on the exact appearance of the flowers they serve, which saves their time and effort and serves the interests of the plant accordingly. Some such plants go even further and change their appearance again once they have been fertilised, thereby discouraging further visits from pollinators. This is advantageous to both parties because it avoids damage to the developing fruit and avoids wasting the pollinator's effort on unrewarding visits. In effect the strategy ensures that the pollinators can expect a reward every time they visit an appropriately advertising flower.\n\nFemales of the aquatic plant \"Vallisneria americana\" have floating flowers attached by a long flower stalk that are fertilized if they contact one of the thousands of free floating flowers released by a male. Sexual dimorphism is most often associated with wind-pollination in plants due to selection for efficient pollen dispersal in males vs pollen capture in females, e.g. \"Leucadendron rubrum\".\n\nSexual dimorphism in plants can also be dependent on reproductive development. This can be seen in \"Cannabis sativa\", a type of hemp, which have higher photosynthesis rates in males while growing but higher rates in females once the plants become sexually mature.\n\nIt also should be borne in mind that every sexually reproducing extant species of vascular plant actually has an alternation of generations; the plants we see about us generally are diploid sporophytes, but their offspring really are not the seeds that people commonly recognise as the new generation. The seed actually is the offspring of the haploid generation of microgametophytes (pollen) and megagametophytes (the embryo sacs in the ovules). Each pollen grain accordingly may be seen as a male plant in its own right; it produces a sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.\n\nInsects display a wide variety of sexual dimorphism between taxa including size, ornamentation and coloration. The female-biased sexual size dimorphism observed in many taxa evolved despite intense male-male competition for mates. In \"Osmia rufa\", for example, the female is larger/broader than males, with males being 8–10 mm in size and females being 10–12 mm in size. In the hackberry emperor females are similarly larger than males. The reason for the sexual dimorphism is due to provision size mass, in which females consume more pollen than males. \n\nIn some species, there is evidence of male dimorphism, but it appears to be for the purpose of distinctions of roles. This is seen in the bee species \"Macrotera portalis\" in which there is a small-headed morph, capable of flight, and large-headed morph, incapable of flight, for males. \"Anthidium manicatum\" also displays male-biased sexual dimorphism. The selection for larger size in males rather than females in this species may have resulted due to their aggressive territorial behavior and subsequent differential mating success. Another example is\" Lasioglossum hemichalceum\", which is a species of sweat bee that shows drastic physical dimorphisms between male offpsring. Not all dimorphism has to have a drastic difference between the sexes. \"Andrena agilissima\" is a mining bee where the females only have a slightly larger head than the males.\n\nWeaponry leads to increased fitness by increasing success in male-male competition in many insect species. The beetle horns in \"Onthophagus taurus\" are enlarged growths of the head or thorax expressed only in the males. \"Copris ochus\" also has distinct sexual and male dimorphism in head horns. These structures are impressive because of the exaggerated sizes. There is a direct correlation between male horn lengths and body size and higher access to mates and fitness. In other beetle species, both males and females may have ornamentation such as horns.\nGenerally, insect sexual size dimorphism (SSD) within species increases with body size.\n\nSexual dimorphism within insects is also displayed by dichromatism. In butterfly genera \"Bicyclus\" and \"Junonia\", dimorphic wing patterns evolved due to sex-limited expression, which mediates the intralocus sexual conflict and leads to increased fitness in males. The sexual dichromatic nature of \"Bicyclus anyana\" is reflected by female selection on the basis of dorsal UV-reflective eyespot pupils (Robertson & Monteiro, 2005). The common brimstone also displays sexual dichromatism; males have yellow and iridescent wings, while female wings are white and non-iridescent. Naturally selected deviation in protective female coloration is displayed in mimetic butterflies.\n\nSize dimorphism shows a correlation with sexual cannibalism, which is prominent in spiders (it is also found in insects such as praying mantises). In the size dimorphic wolf spider, food-limited females cannibalize more frequently. Therefore, there is a high risk of low fitness for males due to pre-copulatory cannibalism, which led to male selection of larger females for two reasons: higher fecundity and lower rates of cannibalism. In addition, female fecundity is positively correlated with female body size and large female body size is selected for, which is seen in the family Araneidae. All \"Argiope\" species, including \"Argiope bruennichi\", use this method. Some males evolved ornamentation including binding the female with silk, having proportionally longer legs, modifying the female's web, mating while the female is feeding, or providing a nuptial gift in response to sexual cannibalism. Male body size is not under selection due to cannibalism in all spider species such as \"Nephila pilipes\", but is more prominently selected for in less dimorphic species of spiders, which often selects for larger male size.\n\nRay finned fish are an ancient and diverse class, with the widest degree of sexual dimorphism of any Animal class. Fairbairn notes that \"females are generally larger than males but males are often larger in species with male-male combat or male paternal care ... [sizes range] from dwarf males to males more than 12 times heavier than females\"\n\nThere are cases where males are substantially larger than females. An example is \"Lamprologus callipterus\", a type of cichlid fish. In this fish, the males are characterized as being up to 60 times larger than the females. The male's increased size is believed to be advantageous because males collect and defend empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds. Males must be larger and more powerful in order to collect the largest shells. The female's body size must remain small because in order for her to breed, she must lay her eggs inside the empty shells. If she grows too large, she will not fit in the shells and will be unable to breed. Another example is the dragonet, in which males are considerably larger than females and possess longer fins.\n\nThe female's small body size is also likely beneficial to her chances of finding an unoccupied shell. Larger shells, although preferred by females, are often limited in availability. Hence, the female is limited to the growth of the size of the shell and may actually change her growth rate according to shell size availability. In other words, the male's ability to collect large shells depends on his size. The larger the male, the larger the shells he is able to collect. This then allows for females to be larger in his brooding nest which makes the difference between the sizes of the sexes less substantial. Male-male competition in this fish species also selects for large size in males. There is aggressive competition by males over territory and access to larger shells. Large males win fights and steal shells from competitors. Sexual dimorphism also occurs in hermaphroditic fish. These species are known as sequential hermaphrodites. In fish, reproductive histories often include the sex-change from female to male where there is a strong connection between growth, the sex of an individual, and the mating system it operates within. In protogynous mating systems where males dominate mating with many females, size plays a significant role in male reproductive success. Males have a propensity to be larger than females of a comparable age but it is unclear whether the size increase is due to a growth spurt at the time of the sexual transition or due to the history of faster growth in sex changing individuals. Larger males are able to stifle the growth of females and control environmental resources.\n\nSocial organization plays a large role in the changing of sex by the fish. It is often seen that a fish will change its sex when there is a lack of dominant male within the social hierarchy. The females that change sex are often those who attain and preserve an initial size advantage early in life. In either case, females which change sex to males are larger and often prove to be a good example of dimorphism.\n\nIn other cases with fish, males will go through noticeable changes in body size, and females will go through morphological changes that can only be seen inside of the body. For example, in sockeye salmon, males develop larger body size at maturity, including an increase in body depth, hump height, and snout length. Females experience minor changes in snout length, but the most noticeable difference is the huge increase in gonad size, which accounts for about 25% of body mass.\n\nSexual selection was observed for female ornamentation in \"Gobiusculus flavescens\", known as two-spotted gobies. Traditional hypotheses suggest that male-male competition drives selection. However, selection for ornamentation within this species suggests that showy female traits can be selected through either female-female competition or male mate choice. Since carotenoid-based ornamentation suggests mate quality, female two-spotted guppies that develop colorful orange bellies during the breeding season are considered favorable to males. The males invest heavily in offspring during the incubation, which leads to the sexual preference in colorful females due to higher egg quality.\n\nIn amphibians and reptiles, the degree of sexual dimorphism varies widely among taxonomic groups. The sexual dimorphism in amphibians and reptiles may be reflected in any of the following: anatomy; relative length of tail; relative size of head; overall size as in many species of vipers and lizards; coloration as in many amphibians, snakes, and lizards, as well as in some turtles; an ornament as in many newts and lizards; the presence of specific sex-related behaviour is common to many lizards; and vocal qualities which are frequently observed in frogs.\n\nAnole lizards show prominent size dimorphism with males typically being significantly larger than females. For instance, the average male \"Anolis sagrei\" was 53.4 mm vs. 40 mm in females. Different sizes of the heads in anoles have been explained by differences in the estrogen pathway. The sexual dimorphism in lizards is generally attributed to the effects of sexual selection, but other mechanisms including ecological divergence and fecundity selection provide alternative explanations. The development of color dimorphism in lizards is induced by hormonal changes at the onset of sexual maturity, as seen in Psamodromus algirus, Sceloporus gadoviae, and S. undulates erythrocheilus.\n\nMale painted dragon lizards, \"Ctenophorus pictus\". are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but male color declines with aging. Male coloration appears to reflect innate anti-oxidation capacity that protects against oxidative DNA damage. Male breeding coloration is likely an indicator to females of the underlying level of oxidative DNA damage (a significant component of aging) in potential mates.\n\nSexual dimorphism in birds can be manifested in size or plumage differences between the sexes. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case, e.g. birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex. Such differences have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes. This difference produces a stronger female choice since they have more risk in producing offspring. In some species, the male's contribution to reproduction ends at copulation, while in other species the male becomes the main caregiver. Plumage polymorphisms have evolved to reflect these differences and other measures of reproductive fitness, such as body condition or survival. The male phenotype sends signals to females who then choose the 'fittest' available male.\n\nSexual dimorphism is a product of both genetics and environmental factors. An example of sexual polymorphism determined by environmental conditions exists in the red-backed fairywren. Red-backed fairywren males can be classified into three categories during breeding season: black breeders, brown breeders, and brown auxiliaries. These differences arise in response to the bird's body condition: if they are healthy they will produce more androgens thus becoming black breeders, while less healthy birds produce less androgens and become brown auxiliaries. The reproductive success of the male is thus determined by his success during each year's non-breeding season, causing reproductive success to vary with each year's environmental conditions.\n\nMigratory patterns and behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms. This aspect also stems back to the size dimorphism in species. It has been shown that the larger males are better at coping with the difficulties of migration and thusly are more successful in reproducing when reaching the breeding destination. When viewing this in an evolutionary standpoint many theories and explanations come to consideration. If these are the result for every migration and breeding season the expected results should be a shift towards a larger male population through sexual selection. Sexual selection is strong when the factor of environmental selection is also introduced. The environmental selection may support a smaller chick size if those chicks were born in an area that allowed them to grow to a larger size, even though under normal conditions they would not be able to reach this optimal size for migration. When the environment gives advantages and disadvantages of this sort, the strength of selection is weakened and the environmental forces are given greater morphological weight. The sexual dimorphism could also produce a change in timing of migration leading to differences in mating success within the bird population. When the dimorphism produces that large of a variation between the sexes and between the members of the sexes multiple evolutionary effects can take place. This timing could even lead to a speciation phenomenon if the variation becomes strongly drastic and favorable towards two different outcomes.\n\nSexual dimorphism is maintained by the counteracting pressures of natural selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European sparrowhawks in Denmark. Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation. Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come at the cost of suppressed immune function. So long as the reproductive benefits of the trait due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural selection, then the trait will propagate throughout the population. Reproductive benefits arise in the form of a larger number of offspring, while natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means that even if the trait causes males to die earlier, the trait is still beneficial so long as males with the trait produce more offspring than males lacking the trait. This balance keeps the dimorphism alive in these species and ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these traits that are attractive to the females.\n\nSuch differences in form and reproductive roles often cause differences in behavior. As previously stated, males and females often have different roles in reproduction. The courtship and mating behavior of males and females are regulated largely by hormones throughout a bird's lifetime. Activational hormones occur during puberty and adulthood and serve to 'activate' certain behaviors when appropriate, such as territoriality during breeding season. Organizational hormones occur only during a critical period early in development, either just before or just after hatching in most birds, and determine patterns of behavior for the rest of the bird's life. Such behavioral differences can cause disproportionate sensitivities to anthropogenic pressures. Females of the whinchat in Switzerland breed in intensely managed grasslands. Earlier harvesting of the grasses during the breeding season lead to more female deaths. Populations of many birds are often male-skewed and when sexual differences in behavior increase this ratio, populations decline at a more rapid rate. Also not all male dimorphic traits are due to hormones like testosterone, instead they are a naturally occurring part of development, for example plumage.\n\nSexual dimorphism may also influence differences in parental investment during times of food scarcity. For example, in the blue-footed booby, the female chicks grow faster than the males, resulting in booby parents producing the smaller sex, the males, during times of food shortage. This then results in the maximization of parental lifetime reproductive success.\n\nSexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season, some species of birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off breeding season. This occurs because the species is more focused on survival than reproduction, causing a shift into a less ornate state. \n\nConsequently, sexual dimorphism has important ramifications for conservation. However, sexual dimorphism is not only found in birds and is thus important to the conservation of many animals. Such differences in form and behavior can lead to sexual segregation, defined as sex differences in space and resource use. Most sexual segregation research has been done on ungulates, but such research extends to bats, kangaroos, and birds. Sex-specific conservation plans have even been suggested for species with pronounced sexual segregation.\n\nThe term sesquimorphism (the Latin numeral prefix \"sesqui\"- means one-and-one-half, so halfway between \"mono\"- (one) and \"di\"- (two)) has been proposed for bird species in which \"both sexes have basically the same plumage pattern, though the female is clearly distinguishable by reason of her paler or washed-out Examples include Cape sparrow (\"Passer melanurus\"), rufous sparrow (subspecies \"P. motinensis motinensis\"), and saxaul sparrow (\"P. ammodendri\").\n\nIn a large proportion of mammal species, males are larger than females. Just like in birds, the brains of many mammals, including humans, are significantly different for males and females of the species. Both genes and hormones affect the formation of many animal brains before \"birth\" (or hatching), and also behaviour of adult individuals. Hormones significantly affect human brain formation, and also brain development at puberty. A 2004 review in \"Nature Reviews Neuroscience\" observed that \"because it is easier to manipulate hormone levels than the expression of sex chromosome genes, the effects of hormones have been studied much more extensively, and are much better understood, than the direct actions in the brain of sex chromosome genes.\" It concluded that while \"the differentiating effects of gonadal secretions seem to be dominant,\" the existing body of research \"support the idea that sex differences in neural expression of X and Y genes significantly contribute to sex differences in brain functions and disease.\"\n\nMarine mammals show some of the greatest sexual size differences of mammals, because of sexual selection. The mating system of pinnipeds varies from polygyny to serial monogamy. Pinnipeds are known for early differential growth and maternal investment since the only nutrients for newborn pups is the milk provided by the mother. For example, the males are significantly larger than the females at birth in sea lion pups. The pattern of differential investment can be varied principally prenatally and post-natally. \"Mirounga leonina\", the southern elephant seal, is one of the most dimorphic mammals.\n\nSexual dimorphism in elephant seals is associated with the ability of a male to defend territories, which correlates with polygynic behavior. The large sexual size dimorphism is due to sexual selection, but also because females reach reproductive age much earlier than males. In addition the males do not provide parental care for the young and allocate more energy to growth. This is supported by the secondary growth spurt in males during adolescent years.\n\nIn humans, biological sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of gonads, the sex hormones, the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females), and the external genitalia. Generally, the five factors are either all male or all female. Sexual ambiguity is rare in humans, but wherein such ambiguity does occur, the individual is biologically classified as intersex.\n\nSexual dimorphism among humans includes differentiation among gonads, internal genitals, external genitals, breasts, muscle mass, height, the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects. Human sexual differentiation is effected primarily at the gene level, by the presence or absence of a Y-chromosome, which encodes biochemical modifiers for sexual development in males. According to Clark Spencer Larsen, modern day \"Homo sapiens\" show a range of sexual dimorphism, with average body mass difference between the sexes being roughly equal to 15%.\n\nThe average basal metabolic rate is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females tend to convert more food into fat, while males convert more into muscle and expendable circulating energy reserves. Aggregated data of absolute strength indicates that females have, on average, 40–60% the upper body strength of males, and 70–75% the lower body strength. The difference in strength relative to body mass is less pronounced in trained individuals. In Olympic weightlifting, male records vary from 5.5× body mass in the lowest weight category to 4.2× in the highest weight category, while female records vary from 4.4× to 3.8×, a weight adjusted difference of only 10–20%, and an absolute difference of about 30% (i.e. 472 kg vs 333 kg for unlimited weight classes)(see Olympic weightlifting records). A study, carried about by analyzing annual world rankings from 1980–1996, found that males' running times were, on average, 11% faster than females'.\n\nFemales are taller, on average, than males in early adolescence, but males, on average, surpass them in height in later adolescence and adulthood. In the United States, adult males are, on average, 9% taller and 16.5% heavier than adult females. There is no comparative evidence of differing levels of sexual selection having produced sexual size dimorphism between human populations.\n\nMales typically have larger tracheae and branching bronchi, with about 30 percent greater lung volume per body mass. On average, males have larger hearts, 10 percent higher red blood cell count, higher hemoglobin, hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have higher circulating clotting factors (vitamin K, prothrombin and platelets). These differences lead to faster healing of wounds and higher peripheral pain tolerance.\n\nFemales typically have more white blood cells (stored and circulating), more granulocytes and B and T lymphocytes. Additionally, they produce more antibodies at a faster rate than males. Hence they develop fewer infectious diseases and succumb for shorter periods. Ethologists argue that females, interacting with other females and multiple offspring in social groups, have experienced such traits as a selective advantage.\n\nConsiderable discussion in academic literature concerns potential evolutionary advantages associated with sexual competition (both intrasexual and intersexual) and short- and long-term sexual strategies. According to Daly and Wilson, \"The sexes differ more in human beings than in monogamous mammals, but much less than in extremely polygamous mammals.\" One proposed explanation is that human sexuality has developed more in common with its close relative the bonobo, who have similar sexual dimorphism and which are polygynandrous and use recreational sex to reinforce social bonds and reduce aggression.\n\nIn the human brain, a difference between sexes was observed in the transcription of the PCDH11X/Y gene pair unique to \"Homo sapiens\". Sexual differentiation in the human brain from the undifferentiated state is triggered by testosterone from the fetal testis. Testosterone is converted to estrogen in the brain through the action of the enzyme aromatase. Testosterone acts on many brain areas, including the SDN-POA, to create the masculinized brain pattern. Brains of pregnant females carrying male fetuses may be shielded from the masculinizing effects of androgen through the action of sex-hormone binding globulin.\n\nThe relationship between sex differences in the brain and human behavior is a subject of controversy in psychology and society at large. Many females tend to have a higher ratio of gray matter in the left hemisphere of the brain in comparison to males. Males on average have larger brains than females; however, when adjusted for total brain volume the gray matter differences between sexes is almost nonexistent. Thus, the percentage of gray matter appears to be more related to brain size than it is to sex. Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Haier \"et al.\" found in a 2004 study that \"men and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance\". (See the sex and intelligence article for more on this subject.) Strict graph-theoretical analysis of the human brain connections revealed that in numerous graph-theoretical parameters (e.g., minimum bipartition width, edge number, the expander graph property, minimum vertex cover), the structural connectome of women are significantly \"better\" connected than the connectome of men. It was shown that the graph-theoretical differences are due to the sex and not to the differences in the cerebral volume, by analyzing the data of 36 females and 36 males, where the brain volume of each man in the group was smaller than the brain volume of each woman in the group.\n\nSexual dimorphism was also described in the gene level and shown to be extend from the sex chromosomes. Overall, about 6500 genes have been found to have sex-differential expression in at least one tissue. Many of these genes are not directly associated with reproduction, but rather linked to more general biological features. In addition, it has been shown that genes with sex specific expression undergo reduced selection efficiency, which lead to higher population frequencies of deleterious mutations and contributing to the prevalence of several human diseases\n\nPhenotypic differences between sexes are evident even in cultured cells from tissues. For example, female muscle-derived stem cells have a better muscle regeneration efficiency than male ones. There are reports of several metabolic differences between male and female cells and they also respond to stress differently.\n\nIn theory, larger females are favored by competition for mates, especially in polygamous species. Larger females offer an advantage in fertility, since the physiological demands of reproduction are limiting in females. Hence there is a theoretical expectation that females tend to be larger in species that are monogamous.\nFemales are larger in many species of insects, many spiders, many fish, many reptiles, owls, birds of prey and certain mammals such as the spotted hyena, and baleen whales such as blue whale. As an example, in some species, females are sedentary, and so males must search for them. Fritz Vollrath and Geoff Parker argue that this difference in behaviour leads to radically different selection pressures on the two sexes, evidently favouring smaller males. Cases where the male is larger than the female have been studied as well, and require alternative explanations.\n\nOne example of this type of sexual size dimorphism is the bat \"Myotis nigricans\", (black myotis bat) where females are substantially larger than males in terms of body weight, skull measurement, and forearm length. The interaction between the sexes and the energy needed to produce viable offspring make it favorable for females to be larger in this species. Females bear the energetic cost of producing eggs, which is much greater than the cost of making sperm by the males. The fecundity advantage hypothesis states that a larger female is able to produce more offspring and give them more favorable conditions to ensure their survival; this is true for most ectotherms. A larger female can provide parental care for a longer time while the offspring matures. The gestation and lactation periods are fairly long in \"M. nigricans\", the females suckling their offspring until they reach nearly adult size. They would not be able to fly and catch prey if they did not compensate for the additional mass of the offspring during this time. Smaller male size may be an adaptation to increase maneuverability and agility, allowing males to compete better with females for food and other resources.\n\nSome species of anglerfish also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are more typical in appearance to other fish, whereas the males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male must find a female and fuse with her: he then lives parasitically, becoming little more than a sperm-producing body in what amounts to an effectively hermaphrodite composite organism. A similar situation is found in the Zeus water bug \"Phoreticovelia disparata\" where the female has a glandular area on her back that can serve to feed a male, which clings to her (note that although males can survive away from females, they generally are not free-living). This is taken to the logical extreme in the Rhizocephala crustaceans, like the Sacculina, where the male injects itself into the female's body and becomes nothing more than sperm producing cells, to the point that the superorder used to be mistaken for hermaphroditic.\n\nSome plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss \"Dicranum\" and the liverwort \"Sphaerocarpos\". There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females.\n\nAnother complicated example of sexual dimorphism is in \"Vespula squamosa\", the southern yellowjacket. In this wasp species, the female workers are the smallest, the male workers are slightly larger, and the female queens are significantly larger than her female worker and male counterparts.\n\nSexual dimorphism by size is evident in some extinct species such as the velociraptor. In the case of velociraptors the sexual size dimorphism may have been caused by two factors: male competition for hunting ground to attract mates, and/or female competition for nesting locations and mates, males being a scarce breeding resource.\n\nIn 1871, Charles Darwin advanced the theory of sexual selection, which related sexual dimorphism with sexual selection.\n\nIt has been proposed that the earliest sexual dimorphism is the size differentiation of sperm and eggs (anisogamy), but the evolutionary significance of sexual dimorphism is more complex than that would suggest. Anisogamy and the usually large number of small male gametes relative to the larger female gametes usually lies in the development of strong sperm competition, because small sperm enable organisms to produce a large number of sperm, and make males (or male function of hermaphrodites) more redundant. This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the evolution of other sexual dimorphism in many species, especially in vertebrates including mammals. However, in some species, the females can be larger than males, irrespective of gametes, and in some species females (usually of species in which males invest a lot in rearing offspring and thus no longer considered as so redundant) compete for mates in ways more usually associated with males.\n\nIn many non-monogamous species, the benefit to a male's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit to a female's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent. In these species, there is a selection pressure for whatever traits enable a male to have more matings. The male may therefore come to have different traits from the female.\nThese traits could be ones that allow him to fight off other males for control of territory or a harem, such as large size or weapons; or they could be traits that females, for whatever reason, prefer in mates. Male-male competition poses no deep theoretical questions but mate choice does.\n\nFemales may choose males that appear strong and healthy, thus likely to possess \"good alleles\" and give rise to healthy offspring. In some species, however, females seem to choose males with traits that do not improve offspring survival rates, and even traits that reduce it (potentially leading to traits like the peacock's tail). Two hypotheses for explaining this fact are the sexy son hypothesis and the handicap principle.\n\nThe sexy son hypothesis states that females may initially choose a trait because it improves the survival of their young, but once this preference has become widespread, females must continue to choose the trait, even if it becomes harmful. Those that do not will have sons that are unattractive to most females (since the preference is widespread) and so receive few matings.\n\nThe handicap principle states that a male who survives despite possessing some sort of handicap thus proves that the rest of his genes are \"good alleles\". If males with \"bad alleles\" could not survive the handicap, females may evolve to choose males with this sort of handicap; the trait is acting as a hard-to-fake signal of fitness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name of Shahmaran comes from Persian words \"Shah\" and \"Maran\". Shah is the title for a king, primarily the leader of the Iranians and their land and \"mar\" means snake. In plural \"Mar-an\" means snakes. Shahmaran is known as the queen of the serpents. This story can be traced from the Middle East to India with different variations, one version is also found in the Arabian Night Tales as the story of Jemlia - the Sultan of Underground.\n\nThe Shahmaran is often depicted as a wise, intelligent woman, having female features above the waist and those of a serpent below. She is described as the queen of the snakes. When the Shahmaran dies, it is said that her spirit will pass to her daughter. There are different versions to the legend, as follows:\n\nOnce there existed a wise snake woman, Shahmaran, who loved a traveler named Tasmasp. He was in love with her. He listened to her wisdom and stories. But when he thought she had no more stories to tell, he decided to return to his country, however he took Shahmaran with him and hid her. When Tasmasp returned to his land, the king had become very ill. One of the king's advisers exclaimed that the only way to recover was to eat Shahmaran. They took people, one by one, into the hamam to see if snake scales would come up, and when Tasmsp went, he was forced to tell where Shahmaran was hiding. When they found her, she said, \"whomsoever takes a bite from my snake scales will gain the secrets of the world, but whomever takes a bite of my head will die instantly.\" Tasmasp took a bite of the head and the evil helper took a bite of the scales, but the helper died, and Tasmasp was not affected at all. Shahmaran had helped her lover while simultaneously killing her enemy.\n\nIn Turkey, Shahmaran is believed to live in the Mediterranean town of Tarsus. A similar legend is told in the Mardin region. In this region her legend is commonly evoked, with her image still depicted in embroidery, fabrics, and jewelry.\n\nThousands of years ago, there were wise snakes living in the underground. Their names in Iranian are \"maran\" and they are extraordinarily intelligent and caring. They live in peace. The queen of the marans is called Shahmaran. She is all-knowing, beautiful, and leads with grace. According to legend, a young wood-seller named Cemshab is the first human to see the marans. As the story goes, he is exploring a cave full of honey with friends; but they abandon him in order to take more honey. Alone, Cemshab sees an unusually light-filled hole in the back of the cave. He pulls away the rocks and finds deep within the cave is a magnificent garden. He crawl in, and is surrounded with light, flowers, and snakes. One of the snakes is coloured milky-white, Shahmaran, she is the most beautiful. He gains her trust, staying to live for many years in the underground garden. Shahmaran tells Cemshab that he was able to find her, and only him alone because of his pure heart and his Ajna (third eye), which allows him to see past the physical world and into the other worldly realm. One day after many years, he decides he would like to see his family again. So Shahmaran helps him leave, provided that he promises not to tell anyone about the maran cave. He keeps his word for many, many years. \n\nBut one day The Sultan of land get very sick. The Vizier (the high official of the land) says that only cure is eating meat of Shahmaran, to acquire her youth and wisdom. Word gets out that Cemshab knows where to find her. He resists, but then is forced to show them the way, under the threat of pressure by the governing authority to lead them to Shahmaran or Cemshab's loved ones will be killed. Betrayed, the wise Shahmaran says to Cemshab: \"make me boil in an earthenware dish. Let the sultan eat my meat and make The Vizier drink my boiled water.\" When that happens, the Vizier dies, and the Sultan keep living. Meanwhile, Cemshab become Vizier. \n\nThe Morality of the story looks to Cemshab who is mesmerised by the almighty Shahmaran, and his good intentions and good heart aren't to be overlooked when his family is under duress of death. It is said that Shahmaran sent a message to Cemshab before her death, in his sleep with her highly developed consciousness to tell him that he should bring the authorities to Shahmaran's cave. She is remembered as being the peaceful queen of the snakes, with a pure heart of kindness and selflessness, and also creates the message of not to judge those who live and walk among us. Snakes have a bad and evil connotation in almost every culture, this story focuses on the ideal that “looks can be deceiving”, where although Shahmaran is a snake, she is a kind, intelligent, gentle, peaceful, beautiful and extraordinarily caring creature from beyond our own understanding and from another dimension, where only one with Ajna can actually find, meet and connect with her. \n\nA 1944 fairy tale book called \"The Ring of Shah Maran, A Story from the Mountains of Kurdistan\" by Raphael Emmanuel tells the folk story of a boy that shares bread with animals and earns the respect of Shahmaran.\n\n"}

In the American Deaf community, there are some special cultural rules around sign names; for example, they must be agreed upon by the named person and the broader Deaf community. This ensures that no one else in the community already has the same sign name or that the same sign has a different meaning. Until a person receives a sign name, the person's name is usually fingerspelled.\n\nDifferent deaf cultures appear to have different customs around sign names. For example, in the Deaf American community, sign names are usually subdivided into two naming systems: descriptive (DNS) and arbitrary (ANS). The DNS system manually illustrates physical features, and the ANS system is the first letter of their English name applied to one or more locations. An ANS sign is usually just a unique sign without other meaning, but there may be family patterns, like all the children in a family having names signed at the chin. \n\nIn Swedish Sign Language and French Sign Language, it is the DNS system that dominates. In British Sign Language and Japanese Sign Language, people may be named with a lexical sign for something related to them. In Japanese Sign Language, sign names for males tend to be articulated with the thumb prominent, and those for females gave the pinky tending to be prominent, corresponding to the general use of those digits in signs denoting males and females respectively.\n\nThe practice has a counterpart in North American Indian practices in which (spoken) names were also acquired by a personality trait, a physical feature, or especially a defining memorable event, and in which a name might also change if a still more significant occasion seemed to call for it.\n\n"}

The script for \"\" stated that Spock \"kayoes\" Captain Kirk's duplicate, but Nimoy—who opposed the Vietnam War and supported Eugene McCarthy—felt that such a brutal action would be undignified for a Vulcan. He therefore invented an alternative by suggesting that Vulcans have the ability to project telepathic energy from their fingertips similar to \"the Vulcan Mind Meld\", which, if applied to a nerve cluster correctly, could render a human unconscious. Allegedly, the director of the episode did not understand the idea when Nimoy explained it to him, but William Shatner understood immediately and reacted in exactly the way Nimoy had hoped when they executed the move during filming, explaining that it would be similar to \"feeling an electrical charge.\" From then on, the pinch was referred to as the \"FSNP\", for \"Famous Spock Nerve Pinch\", in \"Star Trek\"'s scripts.\n\nSince Spock, various other characters in the \"Star Trek\" spin-offs have used the technique; however, the fact that some of these have included non-Vulcan characters creates some confusion about the above explanation as to how the nerve pinch is achieved – likely among writers and production-staff, since in the episode \"The Omega Glory\" Kirk tells Spock \"Pity you can't teach me that\" (i.e. the Vulcan Nerve Pinch), and Spock replies \"I have tried, Captain.\" The first non-Vulcan was the android Data, followed by the Changeling Odo, \"Voyager\"'s holographic Doctor, and the humans Jean-Luc Picard, Seven of Nine, Jonathan Archer (though Archer was carrying the \"katra\" of the ancient Vulcan Surak at the time), and Michael Burnham. In the prequel series \"\" T'Pol uses it in the 4th episode of the first season (\"\") on Travis Mayweather, to calm him down. Other examples of its use in that series include incapacitating Dr. Phlox before he can lobotomize Travis Mayweather in the 2nd season episode \"\", and again in the 3rd season episode \"\", on the kidnapper Loomis to stop him escaping from his apartment.\n\nSome humans, however, have been unable to use the nerve pinch. When Dr. McCoy was in possession of Spock's \"katra\" he was unable to use the nerve pinch despite also being a doctor of great skill.\n\nThe nerve pinch has been used on Vulcans and the vulcanoid Romulans several times, showing that neither race is immune to the technique.\n\nIn the 2013 film \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", Spock used the pinch on the film's villain, Khan, during their final battle. Though it appeared to cause him immense pain, it did not lead to unconsciousness, suggesting Khan and similar superhuman creations have limited tolerance to the grip—at least in the alternate universe shown in J.J. Abrams reboot films. In contrast, in the original episode \"Space Seed\" (and original series universe), Spock does use the Vulcan Nerve Pinch on one of Khan's henchmen, with typical results of causing instant unconsciousness, despite all indications that he was similarly superhuman. This may be seen as a difference between universes, or as a difference between Khan and that particular henchman, since they are each singular occurrences.\n\nIn the 1986 film \"\", while traveling in a San Francisco city bus, Spock used the Vulcan neck pinch to subdue a punk traveler who rudely ignored Kirk's request that he turn off his boom box as his music was causing the other travelers discomfort. This action garnered Spock applause from the relieved travelers on a bus.\n\nThe nerve pinch can also be used on non-humanoid creatures. In the episode \"\", Spock uses the nerve pinch on a \"la matya\" during a time-travel adventure to save the life of his younger self. In the 1989 film \"\", Spock uses the pinch to subdue a horse during a battle on the planet Nimbus III.\n\nIn \"\" then Commander Michael Burnham, a human raised on Vulcan, used the nerve pinch to subdue Captain Philippa Georgiou during her mutiny in \"The Vulcan Hello\".\n\nThe Vulcan nerve pinch has been referred to and parodied in many other television series:\n\n\n\n\nIn the first series [1964] \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Warriors of Death\" from the story \"The Aztecs\", Ian Chesterton holds up his thumb and boasts \"This is all I need [to defeat an enemy],\" and proceeds to grip the Aztec warrior Ixta between the shoulder and neck, rendering him unconscious.\n\nThe pinch to the subclavian artery has been compared to the karate chop, which was used in other 1960s television series' to render opponents unconscious.\n\nOver the years, fans and \"Star Trek\" Expanded Universe writers have made a number of suggestions as to how it would work.\n\nThe book \"The Making of Star Trek\" by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry offers a simple explanation: the pinch blocks blood and nerve responses from reaching the brain, leading to unconsciousness. How this might lead to instantaneous unconsciousness is not explained. In this earliest of \"Star Trek\" reference books, the pinch is referred to as the \"Spock Pinch.\"\n\nAnother conjecture is that it can be done by applying strong and surgically precise pressure over baroreceptors of the carotid sinus at the base of the humanoid neck. The objective would be to elicit the baroreceptor reflex as the receptors detect an apparent high pressure state due to the externally applied force and causes reflex bradycardia and/or hypotension, leading to decreased blood supply to the brain and syncope.\n\nA third conjecture is paranormal rather than medical: because of Vulcans' telepathic nature and incredible control over their own bodies, they are able to send a burst of neural energy into another being and overload its nervous system, rendering it unconscious. This was supported by the fact that Dr. McCoy could not use it in \"\", but it has been rendered moot by the fact that many non-telepathic characters used it in later \"Trek\" series, such as the android Data.\n\nThe canonical mechanism of the nerve pinch was finally offered in the episode \"\" of \"Star Trek: Voyager\". There, the Doctor inspects a crewmember who was found unconscious and observes an extreme trauma to the trapezius neck bundle, \"as though her nerve fibers have been ruptured\"; and it is later revealed that the person was the victim of a nerve pinch.\n\nThe \"Star Trek\" episode \"The \"Enterprise\" Incident\" includes a scene in which Spock administers the so-called \"Vulcan death grip\" to Kirk to convince Romulan onlookers, apparently unfamiliar with Vulcan techniques, that Kirk had been killed. In fact, Spock had merely used a particularly powerful nerve pinch to put Kirk into a deep unconsciousness that closely resembled death. Kirk awoke a short time later with head and neck pain, but no lasting injury. The \"death grip\" differs from the \"nerve pinch\" in that the nerve pinch is administered to the neck area, and the death grip was administered to Kirk's face; the palm directly over the nose and the fingers spread out over the rest of the face. This also differs from the \"Vulcan mind meld\" grip which is administered to only one side of the face. The very existence of a Vulcan \"death grip\" is often quickly denied by fans via a popular phrase: \"There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip\" (first used by Nurse Christine Chapel in \"The \"Enterprise\" Incident\").\n"}
