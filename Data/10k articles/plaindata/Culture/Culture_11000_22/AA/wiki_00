The group was founded in 1967 by Hermina Enrique. Currently, her daughter, Viviana Enrique Acosta, is the Artistic Director. The members of BFA were instrumental in founding the Centro Cultural de la Raza which was the first home of the BFA.\n\nThe name of Ballet Folklorico en Aztlan references the Chicano concept of \"Aztlán\" which refers to the American Southwest. The dance group's performances, relating to Mexican and indigenous dance and culture are meant to preserve the historical tradition of the peoples of Aztlan. Ballet Folklorico refers to traditional dance in Mexico and was popularized in the 1960s.\n\nPrior to moving to San Diego in 1967, Enrique had lived in San Antonio, and expected to find services for folklorico dancing in the city. She was surprised to find none and created her own classes at the Mexican American Advisory Committee (MAAC) Center at National City. Her sons and daughters helped teach classes with her. These classes grew in popularity and led to the creation of BFA.\n\nThe BFA first became involved with members who later formed the Centro Cultural de la Raza in 1969. Salvador Torres, an artist, had been given the old Ford Building in Balboa Park as studio space for a six-month period. During this time, he found out that Enrique was having trouble finding places for the dance group to practice; he offered some of his studio space to them. Later, BFA would be involved in helping to found \"Toltecas en Aztlan,\" which later created the Centro.\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, classes were taught at the Centro by Isabel, Teresa, Veronica and Viviana Enrique (later Viviana Enrique Acosta), along with other teachers.\n\nBFA offers dance classes for children and adults at Muevete Dance Studio in Lemon Grove, California.\n\nDirector of BFA, Acosta, has been inducted to San Diego Women's Hall of Fame as a Historian and for her work with BFA.\n"}

{"id": "5813769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5813769", "title": "Captain Nemo and the Underwater City", "text": "Captain Nemo and the Underwater City\n\nCaptain Nemo and the Underwater City is a 1969 British film starring Robert Ryan, Chuck Connors and Nanette Newman. It features the character Captain Nemo and is inspired by Jules Verne's novel \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\". It was written by Pip and Jane Baker.\n\nCaptain Nemo's submarine Nautilus rescues drowning passengers and takes them to an underwater city, Templemer (pronounced Temple-Meer) where they are told they will remain forever. The survivors include brothers Barnaby (Bill Fraser) and Swallow Bath (Kenneth Connor), Lomax (Allan Cuthbertson), Helena Beckett (Nanette Newman) and her son, and Senator Robert Fraser (Chuck Connors).\n\nNemo takes them on a city scuba tour, but Lomax attempts to steal diving gear and escape but is caught. Fraser seems taken with a musical performance given by the city's swimming teacher Mala (Luciana Paluzzi), this noted by Joab, Nemo’s second in command (John Turner).\n\nJoab shows the Bath brothers how the city makes oxygen and fresh water and as a by-product gold, which is even thrown away. Joab advises them that no one has ever escaped Templemer. Lomax sees the oxygen machine as a means to escape by rupturing the city's dome. Lomax attempts this but only manages to flood the machine’s control room killing Lomax in the process. During this episode, the Bath brothers sneak into the Forbidden Area where they discover a second submarine, the Nautilus II, and see it as a means of escape.\n\nEnlisting Fraser to aid them, Fraser learns how to operate the submarine. During training they ram and kill a vast Manta Ray-like creature accidentally created during the building of the city. Fraser tells Nemo he should leave as he is attempting to cut off the supply of weapons to the American Civil War. Nemo refuses but offers Fraser a position at Templemer. This alienates Joab, who helps Fraser and the Baths steal Nautilus II, on condition they leave without bloodshed, and allow the crew to return with the submarine intact.\n\nThey manage to take the submarine and are followed by Nemo in his submarine. Nemo explains there is fault with the Nautilus II's engines that means the sub could explode. The chase is brief. Unable to match the speed of the escaping submarine, Nemo has Nautilus I sheer away, to try 'going under the reef.' Confused by their pursuers apparently giving up, Fraser asks the Nautilus II's first mate if there is 'a shorter way,' to be told that 'yes, there is,' but that 'this ship is too large!'\n\nA now desperate Fraser gives orders for 'crash speed.' As the submarine increases to flank an explosion causes the engines to fail, and out of control the ship strikes a reef before coming to a stop whilst still submerged. The crew with Fraser and the Baths put on diving gear and attempt to escape from the now flooding submarine, but Barnaby panics and drowns in the attempt.\n\nNautilus I approaches the wreck just in time to be buffeted violently as the bigger ship explodes; Joab is electrocuted as he is thrown against a control panel. Mortally wounded he confesses to Nemo that he helped Fraser to escape. Helena Beckett admits that she knew of the attempt, and that she and her son chose to stay. Mala reads Nemo a letter that Fraser left behind, in which he thanks Nemo for offering him a place in the city's future, but that he cannot accept, as he believes in his mission, and the 'slower, more painful process' towards peace.\n\nThe film closes as Nautilus turns towards Templemer. On the surface, a small schooner is seen picking up two men in mid-ocean, far from either land or any sign of wreckage. Fraser and Swallow Bath, huddled in blankets, are made welcome aboard, and as the schooner prepares to set sail, Fraser finds his companion has concealed a gold ladle under his coat. The two exchange rueful smiles, and Fraser tosses it lightly into the sea.\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of 1.5 million US dollars. It had stemmed from an idea that led to Roger Corman’s failed \"Captain Nemo and the Floating City\", itself based on a combination of two of Jules Verne’s stories. Though that movie never passed the planning stage, MGM producer Steven Pallos managed to re-create the project having read a series of inspirational articles about Jacques Cousteau’s experiments with deep sea habitats, and the 'floating' was changed to 'underwater'. The film drew heavily on the supposed charm of the Victorian era, following agreement between director and scriptwriters to produce a popular escapist atmosphere, more the essence of Michael Todd’s \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" than of Disney‘s \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6299", "title": "Chupacabra", "text": "Chupacabra\n\nThe chupacabra or chupacabras (, literally \"goat-sucker\"; from \"chupar\", \"to suck\", and \"cabra\", \"goat\") is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, including goats.\n\nPhysical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.\n\nEyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and the Philippines, but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange. According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an urban legend.\n\n\"Chupacabras\" can be literally translated as \"goat-sucker\", from \"chupar\" (\"to suck\") and \"cabra\" (\"goat\"). It is known as both \"chupacabras\" and \"chupacabra\" throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word, and the latter a regularization of it. The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian Silverio Pérez, who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.\n\nThe first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico. Eight sheep were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of Canóvanas, when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed. In 1975, similar killings in the small town of Moca were attributed to \"El Vampiro de Moca\" (\"The Vampire of Moca\"). Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.\n\nPuerto Rican comedian and entrepreneur Silverio Pérez is credited with coining the term \"chupacabras\" soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Brazil, United States, and Mexico.\n\nA five-year investigation by Benjamin Radford, documented in his 2011 book \"Tracking the Chupacabra\", concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film \"Species\". The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: \"It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive,\" Tolentino reported. Radford revealed that Tolentino \"believed that the creatures and events she saw in \"Species\" were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time,\" and therefore concludes that \"the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted.\" This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.\n\nIn addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a necropsy, the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.\n\nRadford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from Puerto Rico and Latin America where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted, and the reports in the United States of mammals, mostly dogs and coyotes with mange, that people call \"chupacabra\" due to their unusual appearance.\n\nIn late October 2010, University of Michigan biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite \"Sarcoptes scabiei\", whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred \"because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer.\"\n\nAlthough several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey.\n\nThere are reports of stray Mexican Hairless Dogs being mistaken for chupacabras.\n\nThe most common description of the chupacabra is that of a reptile-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. It is said to be approximately high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a kangaroo.\n\nAnother common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes.\n\nA popular legend in New Orleans concerns a popular lovers' lane called Grunch Road, which was said to be inhabited by \"grunches\", creatures similar in appearance to the \"Chupacabra\".\n\nThe peuchens of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the vampire bat, an animal endemic to the region.\n\nIn the Philippines, another legendary creature called the Sigbin shares many of chupacabra's descriptions.\n\nThe popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in its being featured in many types of media.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1047556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1047556", "title": "Cinema of Cuba", "text": "Cinema of Cuba\n\nCinema arrived in Cuba at the beginning of the 20th century. Before the Cuban Revolution of 1959, about 80 full-length films were produced in Cuba. Most of these films were melodramas. Following the revolution, Cuba entered what is considered the \"Golden age\" of Cuban cinema.\n\nAfter being popularised by the brothers Louis Jean and Auguste Marie Lumière, the cinematographe traveled through several capital cities in different American countries before arriving in Havana, which occurred on January 24, 1897. It was brought from Mexico by Gabriel Veyre. The first presentation was offered at Paseo del Prado #126, just aside the Teatro Tacón. Four short films were shown: \"Partida de cartas\", \"El tren\", \"El regador y el muchacho\" y \"El sombrero cómico\". The tickets were sold at a price of 50 cents, and 20 cents for kids and the military. Short after, Veyre performed a leading role in the first film produced in the island, \"Simulacro de incendio\", a documentary centered around firemen in Havana.\n\nIn this first phase of introduction there were several locations devoted to cinema: Panorama Soler, Salón de variedades o ilusiones ópticas, Paseo del Prado #118, Vitascopio de Edison (in the famous Louvre sidewalk). The Teatro Irioja (today Teatro Martí) was the first to present cinema as one of its attractions. The first in a long list of movie theatres in Havana was set by José A. Casasús, actor, producer and entrepreneur, under the name of \"Floradora\", later renamed \"Alaska\".\n\nIn the six or seven years before World War I, cinema was expanded and stabilized as a business in the most important cities in Latin America. Cuba, just as the rest of the countries in the continent, went through those first years with itinerant and sporadic exhibitions, changing from European providers to North American providers, starting the dependency on the big Hollywood companies.\n\nThe first ambitious genre in the continent was probably historic reviews. In Cuba films like \"El Capitán Mambí\" and \"Libertadores o guerrilleros\" (1914), by Enríque Díaz Quesada with support from Gen. Mario García Menocal are worth mentioning. Díaz Quesada adapted from the Spanish novelist Joaquín Dicenta in 1910, as a tendency widely used then, of using literary works adapted for movies, as well as imitating Charlie Chaplin, the French comedies and cowboy adventure films. The silent stage of production was extended until 1937, when the first full-length fiction movie was produced.\n\nBefore the Cuban Revolution of 1959 the total film production was around 80 full-length movies. Some films are worth mentioning, such as \"La Virgen de la Caridad\" starring Miguel Santos and \"Romance del Palmar\" by Ramón Peón. Many famous people from the continent came to the island to film, and some leading Cuban actors had a strong presence mainly in Mexico and Argentina. Musicians such as Ernesto Lecuona, Bola de Nieve or Rita Montaner also performed and composed for movies in several countries.\n\nIn the first days of 1959, the new government created a cinematographic department within the \"Dirección de Cultura del Ejército Rebelde\" (Culture Division of the Rebel Army), which sponsored the production of documentaries such as \"Esta tierra nuestra\" by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, and \"La vivienda\" by Julio García Espinosa. This was the direct ancestor of what would eventually become the \"Instituto Cubano del Arte y la Industria Cinematográficos\" (ICAIC), which was founded in March as a result of the first culture law of the revolutionary government. Film, according to this law, is \"the most powerful and provocative form of artistic expression, and the most direct and widespread vehicle for education and bringing ideas to the public.\" The ICAIC founded \"Cine Cubano\" in 1960. All production, distribution, and exhibition in the country were run by ICAIC by 1965. The ICAIC also established mobile projection units called \"cine moviles\", trucks that visited remote areas to hold screenings. From its foundation up until 1980, Alfredo Guevara was head of the ICAIC. Under his direction, the organization was pivotal in the development of Cuban cinema which came to be identified with anti-imperialism and revolution.\n\nThe first ten years of the institution were called by critics the Golden Age (\"Década de Oro\") of Cuban cinema, most of all because of the making of \"Lucía\" (1969) by Humberto Solás and \"Memorias del subdesarrollo\" (\"Memories of Underdevelopment\") (1968) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. These two directors are often regarded as the best film directors to have come out of Cuba. \"Memorias del subdesarrollo\" was selected among the best 100 films of all times by the International Federation of Film Clubs. One of the most prolific and strong branches of the Cuban cinema in the last 40 years has been documentaries and short-films. The documentary \"Now\" (1965) by Santiago Álvarez is often considered the first video clip in history. It combines a song with an uninterrupted sequence of images depicting racial discrimination in the U.S..\n\nAnimation has also been a major highlight in the last decades. In 1974, Juan Padrón gave birth to \"Elpidio Valdés\", a character that represents a mambí fighter, struggling for Cuban independence against the Spanish occupation in the 19th century. It is very popular among Cuban children. Another great success of Cuban animation was the full-length film \"Vampiros en La Habana\" (1983), also by Juan Padrón.\n\nEssential in the history of Cuban cinema is the \"Noticiero ICAIC Latinoamericano\" (Latin-American ICAIC News) whose first director was Alfredo Guevara. Years later it was directed by Santiago Álvarez and the Mexican Rodolfo Espino, the most successful documentary maker in the island. In 1979 the ICAIC played a key role in the creation of the Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano (International Festival of New Latin American Cinema) allowing Latin American films a more international audience. The festival is one of the most important of its type in Latin America and has been held in Havana every year since 1979. There is also an international cinema university, the \"Escuela Internacional de Cine, Televisión y Video de San Antonio de los Baños\" (International School of Cinema, Television and Video of San Antonio de los Baños) located in San Antonio de los Baños near Havana, on land donated by the Cuban government and supported by the \"Fundación del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano\", Gabriel García Márquez and the Father of the New Latin American Cinema, Fernando Birri. Hundreds of young students from all over Latin America have studied direction, script, photography and edition.\n\nThe contribution of the ICAIC, which was rapidly positioned as the head of a process aiming for legitimate artistic values and expression of nationality, is not limited only to the support in producing and promoting a movement that spanned fiction, documentary and animation, but also allowed for the exhibition and spread of popular knowledge of the best of cinema from all over the world. It also created the film archives of the Cinemateca de Cuba, and took part in initiatives such as Cinemóviles, which made cinema available on the most intricate sites of the national geography.\n\nThe institution also helped developing the Cuban poster, as a mean of promoting films. It gave birth between 1969 and 1977, to the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora, which influenced Cuban music to a great extent, serving as a starting point for the movement of the Nueva Trova. Figures like Silvio Rodríguez, Pablo Milanés and Leo Brouwer were prominent through all this process.\n\nIn 1980, Alfredo Guevara was ousted from his position as head of the ICAIC, which he had held since its formation, over controversies about Cecilia (1982 film). The film, directed by Humberto Solás, was based on the 19th century Cuban novel Cecilia Valdés. It was the most ambitious Cuban film to date and somewhat monopolized the funds available to filmmakers during its production. This, coupled with the fact that many other directors and the general public did not agree with Solás's interpretation of the film, led to the removal of Alfredo Guevara from his position.\n\nHaving won a great deal of autonomy from the central government in the 1970s, the ICAIC, under the new leadership of Julio García Espinosa, was allowed to make many films dealing with sociopolitical issues. Espinosa was able to increase the recognition of Cuban film and especially of the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema by obtaining greater funds from the government and also inviting big names such as Francis Ford Coppola, Sydney Pollack, Robert De Niro, and Jack Lemmon to the island. Despite his successes, Espinosa faced a large problem in 1991, again due to a controversial film. This film, entitled \"Alicia en el pueblo de Maravillas\", was very critical of the bureaucracy of the government. This, combined with the simultaneous collapse of the Soviet Union, led to Espinosa's retirement.\n\nDuring this time, Alfredo Guevara returned to the scene of the ICAIC in order to help it maintain its autonomy from the central government. Many of the party faithful were calling for the organization to merge with the Cuban Radio and Television Institute. Due to the loss of Cuba's largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, the future of the island country became uncertain, and criticism of the government, which the ICAIC was known for, became unpopular. Guevara managed to get the film released and allow the ICAIC to keep its independent status. He then remained president of the organization throughout the Special Period until his retirement in 2000.\n\nOne of the most notable Cuban films in the recent years was \"Fresa y chocolate\" (\"Strawberry and Chocolate\") (1993) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío. It is about intolerance, and portrays the friendship between a homosexual and a young member of the Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (a communist youth organization). It was also the first Cuban production to ever be nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nOmar González succeeded Alfredo Guevara as the head of the ICAIC and remains in that position today. It continues to directly aid in the production and distribution of films and has production offices, issues film permits, rents studios and equipment to filmmakers, and is closely involved in each stage of the film, from its inception and production, to its distribution and release.\n\nAfter the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cubans who were ideologically ill at ease with the new revolutionary government made their way to the United States, where they settled in concentrated communities made up of other Cubans in South Florida, New York, and New Jersey. Unlike traditional immigrants who chose to leave the homeland behind in search of a better way of life in a new place, most of these Cubans consider themselves exiles forced out of their homeland by political or economic circumstances. Because they continue to think of themselves as Cuban even after decades in the United States, it is appropriate to talk about them as part of a Cuban diaspora that links them emotionally and psychologically to the island. Over one million Cubans have left Cuba since 1959 in different waves of immigration. Among those are talented directors, technicians and actors who settled in the USA, Latin America or Europe, in search of work and creative space in the field of cinema.\n\n\"Los gusanos\" (\"The Worms\") (1978) produced by Danilo Bardisa and directed by Camilo Vila was the first film made by the Cuban exiles dealing with Cuban politics. The screenplay written by Orestes Matacena, Clara Hernandez and Camilo Vila has an overwhelming impact in the U.S. Cuban community inspiring many other Cuban filmmakers to tell their stories with their cameras.\n\nOrlando Jiménez Leal, one of the best known exile filmmakers, produced \"El Super\" (1979), the first Cuban exile fictional film, directed by Jiménez Leal and his young brother-in-law, Leon Ichaso. Based on a play by Ivan Acosta, the film was broadly distributed in the U.S. and won awards at film festivals in Mannheim, Biarritz and Venice. The film examines the trauma of the Cuban middle class, showing them as displaced from their former life and unable to adapt to new circumstances. It also highlights generational conflicts between Cuban-born parents and their teenage children who have been raised in the U.S. and reject tradition in favor of the North American way of life. Jiménez Leal went on to make documentary films such as \"The Other Cuba\" (1983) and \"Improper Conduct\" (1984) in collaboration with Néstor Almendros. \"Improper Conduct\" is a highly controversial film that deals with the treatment of gays in Cuba. \"The Other Cuba\" is a bitter denunciation of the Revolution told from the point of view of the exiled community. The director's strong anti-Castro stance gave voice to the growing community of Cuban political exiles in the U.S. in the 1980s.\nLeon Ichaso's best known film in the U.S. is \"Bitter Sugar \"(1996), a fictional film that strongly criticizes life in post-revolutionary Cuba. The screenplay, written by Ichaso and Orestes Matacena shows the disillusionment of a young Communist and his girlfriend, who are pushed to the breaking point by a repressive society. In tone and theme, it is similar to Jorge Ulla's \"Guaguasí\" (1982), which had less distribution in the U.S. The \"Guaguasí\" screenplay, written by Orestes Matacena, Clara Hernandez and Ulla, portrays a simple man from the countryside, played by actor Orestes Matacena, who is brutalized by his experiences with the revolutionary government in Cuba. The reactionary stance of directors like Villa, Ulla, Ichaso, Almendros and Jiménez Leal has made them the cinematic spokespersons for Cubans who believe that Fidel Castro is personally responsible for negative changes that have occurred in Cuba since 1959. \"Bitter Sugar\" has been shown to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland and to the US Congress.\n\nAn important theme in cinema of the Cuban disapora is the coming and going of people in exile, and the difficult process of adaptation to a new culture. Iván Acosta made the film \"Amigos\" (1986) to show the painful bicultural existence of Cuban-Americans living in Miami. Although it is a low-budget film, it does an effective job of capturing the problems of the younger generation of Cuban-Americans who are torn between the desire to fit in and the pressure to uphold tradition. \"Lejanía\" (1985) by Jesús Díaz is the first film to deal with the issue of Cuban exiles returning to the island for visits with relatives. \"Cercanía\" (2008) by Rolando Díaz, the brother of Jesús, shows a recent arrival from Cuba attempting to reconcile with his family in Miami after decades apart. Rather than address political themes in a direct way, these films focus on personal issues related to adaptation and culture shock. \"Honey for Oshún\" (2001) by Humberto Solás, a Cuban director who remained in Cuba, addresses the clash between Cuban-Americans returning to the island and those who never left. It hints that reconciliation is possible, as long as those who return are willing to accept Cuba on its own terms and not force capitalist ideology on the Cuban people.\n\nIn Cuba, films made by Cuban-Americans or Cubans in exile are not widely distributed or well known, in part because the films deal with the Revolution in a negative light, but also because Cubans on the island dispute the notion of a Cuban diaspora and believe that those who live in exile no longer represent Cuban reality in an authentic light. They take the position that directors who experience life outside Cuba represent Cuba through a distorted lens, and that the films they make are largely works of propaganda.\n\nMany important Cuban actors now live in exile. Among them are César Évora, Anabel Leal, Reinaldo Cruz, Francisco Gattorno, Reynaldo Miravalles, Tomás Millán, William Marquez, Orestes Matacena and Isabel Moreno. Cuban American actors who were born in Cuba but grew up in the U.S. include Andy García, Steven Bauer, William Levy, and Tony Plana.\n\nThe international co-production of films has become very important for the cinema of Cuba and also for the rest of Latin America. An internationally co-produced film is one in which two or more production companies from different countries are involved, or the financing has been sourced from more than one country. Co-productions are becoming increasingly common today but even as early as 1948 were common between Cuba and Mexico.\n\nInternational co-productions began to take off in the 1960s and 1970s, many with the aim of increasing political awareness and highlighting common problems in Latin American countries. Before its dissolution, the USSR also played a role of co-producing films in Cuba such as Mikhail Kalatozov's \"I Am Cuba\". The increased importance of co-produced films was inevitable due to globalization, and in the case of Cuba especially, due to a lack of economic resources. A film created with the cooperation of two or more countries nearly always guaranteed distribution in both countries, resulting in a greater audience and increased revenues. This also allowed for more exposure of regional cinemas.\n\nBeginning as early as the 1930s Spain played a role in producing Latin American and Cuban films, but began to invest more heavily in the 1990s. In 1997, Ibermedia was created for the purpose of promoting co-production between Spain and Latin American countries. There are 14 countries involved in this organization and Cuba is one of them. Two examples of Cuban co-produced films are Humberto Solás's \"Cecilia\" (Cuba/Spain) and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío's Academy Award-nominated \"Strawberry and Chocolate\" (Cuba/Mexico/Spain).\n\nThere have been mixed opinions about the development of co-productions. For some it is a necessary evil. Humberto Solás states that \"For established filmmakers there is not a single cent for production. We are obliged to seek co-productions. If a film is not co-produced, it will not be made.\" The problem with finding foreign funding for Cuban films is that, often, the financiers want to have some amount of influence over the final product so that it can be successful in their own countries. Frequently there are also stipulations that require a certain number of cast and crew to be working on the film from each of the producing countries. For example, a Cuban film that was co-produced by Spain would require a certain number of Spanish actors, writers or directors, and production technicians. This makes it difficult for Cuban national cinema to hold on to its identity and also creates issues when determining the nationality of a film. Julio García Espinosa agrees that the benefit of co-productions is that it has allowed for films to continue being made in Cuba and Latin America, but believes that the most successful co-productions are those that exist solely between Latin American countries.\n\nCuba has been involved in aiding in the production of other Latin American films, but through technical assistance rather than acting as a financier. One example is Chilean director Miguel Littín's Academy Award-nominated \"Alsino and the Condor\", which was shot in Nicaragua and received technical support from Cuba. Also in the late 1980s, Cuba created the Third World Film School to train students from various third world countries in the art of filmmaking.\n\nCuban cinema and Latin American films communicate many different meanings, messages, and focuses. Cuban film director Julio García Espinosa was well known in the 1960s for his contributions to cinematography and culture. He was a founder of the ICAIC and the President of the Section of Cinema of the Cultural Society. The main objectives of Cuban Cinema were production, distribution, and screening films that recorded the ongoing revolutionary process from the perspectives of ordinary people. According to Davies, the films that were shot on location and featured local people were shown free of charge across the country in city cinemas and on makeshift village screens to spectators who were encouraged to participate actively in the films' reception and interpretation. In 1968–88, the most common and desired form of film used in Cuba was Imperfect Cinema.\n\nIt can be acknowledged that Imperfect Cinema was creative, innovative and possessed a distinctive style that is typically a very thought provoking original work of art. Imperfect films captured the viewer's attention because the relevance of the story line matched what the audiences were experiencing in their own lives. Imperfect cinema is a form or theme found through audiences that have struggled in life and are aware of the hard times the people were going through. Only in the person who suffers do we perceive elegance, gravity, even beauty; only in him do we recognize the possibility of authenticity, seriousness, and sincerity. Not only does imperfect cinema represent the struggles of the people it also reveals the process which has generated the problem. The subjective element is the selection of the problem, conditioned as it is by the interest of the audience-which is the subject. The objective element is showing the process-which is the object. Imperfect cinema uses the audience as the subject to show the process of the problem as the object.\n\nAside from indicating the demonstrative, communicative and inquisitive qualities, these characteristics also convey an implicit utilitarian quality. In other words, Imperfect Cinema possesses utilitarian features because it must perform a particular political function within society. Cubans felt included by the films which gave them a sense of importance and pride. Cuban and Latin American films were successful in the international market even though they did not always fit the hegemonic models or use mainstream film languages. Imperfect cinema is a great example of film that is accepted internationally even though it does not fit into the Hollywood genre or codes of representation.\n\nStyle for Imperfect Cinema is thus defined by the specific techniques and qualities contextualized in orthodox Marxism's aesthetics of content over form, such as the use of 'type' characters, harsh imagery made by scratches, under/over exposure, high contrast, excessive movements of the camera, presentation of historical events and the wide use of hand-held cameras. This form of film was very popular among the revolutionary people because the films were portrayed in a manner that was very easy to relate to and shared a common feeling and interest among the people that were experiencing similar situations that were occurring in Cuba at the time. The revolution provided alternatives, supplied an entirely new response, enabled the country to do away with elitist concepts and practices in art, and was the highest expression of culture because it abolished artistic culture as a fragmentary human activity.\n\nImperfect Cinema was responsible for making a reputation for Cuban film, but by the mid-1970s, Cuban filmmakers were purposely making a different style of cinema. Chanan, for example, concludes that by the late 1970s Imperfect Cinema had just about disappeared. He believes that since then Cuban cinema has given up the challenge of creating its own style in favor of imitating Hollywood. For Garcia Espinosa and many of his fellow Latin American filmmakers, Imperfect Cinema was the answer to the need of creating a form of art that demonstrates the process of the problems ... not a cinema to beautifully illustrate concepts and ideas we already know. The purpose of this revolutionary form of film was derived from the revolution itself. By 1989, Cuban cinema had the formal sophistication to carry any revolutionary message, or none at all. Imperfect cinema was no longer interested in quality or technique. It can be created equally well with a Mitchell or with an 8mm camera, in a studio or in a guerrilla camp in the middle of the jungle.\n\nSince all of these critical operations require new approaches to film directing, we cannot expect flawless results every time. Films built on the consecrated conventions of traditional cinematography are more likely to attain technical \"perfection\" than those necessarily \"imperfect\" attempts to challenge established conventions and search out new approaches. The opposite of imperfect cinema is \"perfect\" cinema which is basically described as films that are portrayed as perfect, flawless, and contain beautiful scenery. The majority of scenes that are shot in a \"perfect\" film are in a beautiful place, typically the film is not produced to make the viewer think, and they're usually more aesthetically pleasing rather than meaningful. We maintain that imperfect cinema must above all show the process which generates the problems. It is thus the opposite of a cinema principally dedicated to celebrating results, the opposite of a self-sufficient and contemplative cinema, the opposite of a cinema which \"beautifully illustrates\" ideas or concepts which we already possess.\n\nModern authorship is established and valued mostly as a matter of output and public success. \"Perfect\" films are valued by critics, awards, and merchandise that are produced because of the film. Compared to \"perfect\" films, imperfect films focus on the art, sending a message, and creating substance. Most Latin American films can only achieve success in the international market if they emulate hegemonic models and borrow from mainstream film languages. The \"perfect\" films are difficult for Latin American and Cuban film makers to compete with because most viewers are interested in watching films that are visually attractive and don't require a lot of thought while watching. It stands to reason that today's changing circumstances of film production and consumption determine that genres cannot exist by mere repetition and recycling of past models but have to engage with difference and change. Art will not disappear into nothingness; it will disappear into everything.\n\nThe post Cold War period is known as the \"Special Period\" in Cuba. During this time period the Cuban cinema industry suffered greatly (as did the Cuban citizens due to severe economic depression). This is best phrased by Elliott Young:\n\nThe state expected artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals to become economically autonomous and not rely on state subsidies; this new market orientation forced cultural producers to seek foreign financing or simply to leave the country altogether. The impact of the economic crisis hit the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográfico (ICAIC) directly, leading to an exodus of personnel and the slowing down of production to the extent that, in 1996, the Institute did not release a single feature film\n\nThe films that were produced were no longer made solely for Cuban people, but mainly for foreign audiences. Pastor Vega states \"Before one only thought about the Cuban public. Now you have to think about 'marketing' and 'profits' and all that.\" However, the films that were produced for the Cuban people, tended to take a more drastic turn towards more controversial issues. One of the biggest genres that came out of this period was about homosexuality. One of the most popular movies that come out of this time period is called \"Fresa y chocolate\" (1994, \"Strawberry and Chocolate\"). The success of this movie \"can be partially explained by the way the film elicits multiple recognition from the Cuban viewer\" and that it makes the viewer think/look at the film in a different light.\n\nDuring this time the producers and directors had to always think about cost of production. In the past, going on long excursions to make films were the standard rather than the exception. A perfect example of a movie that was made through this time period is called \"Madagascar\" (1994), directed by Fernando Perez. Ann Marie Stock states (about the production of \"Madagascar\"):\n\n\"Madagascar\" (1994), was made against all odds, during a time when Cuba's state sponsored film institute was experiencing shortages of virgin film stock, fuel to transport crews and equipment, food to provide a meal to those working long days, and the hard currency necessary to edit, produce and distribute films.\n\nThe films that were lucky enough to be put into production, found them that they were being produced as close to the ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry) as possible, or found that the major cities (Havana, Santiago de Cuba, etc. ...) became the backdrop to the plot of the movies. This allowed the directors to use ordinary citizens in the movies instead of having to bring in extras for production. The director could even use citizens' homes as a backdrop, if the owner agreed to allow the director to use it.\n\n\nA list of some of the more important Cuban films produced since 1959:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in corporations. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including Walt Disney, Boeing, and Motorola.\n\nThe 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour. \n\nIn most cases, corporate universities are not universities in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the United States, a nation which has no official legal definition of the term \"university\". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the Hamburger University operated by McDonald's Corporation in Chicago.\n\nCorporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:\n\nCUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.\n\nJ.P. Morgan and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum. They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). \n\nMost CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. \n\nUnlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.\n\nAlthough a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting. Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. To manage this complexity, specific Enterprise resource planning systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a Training management system. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of learning technologies can be used together.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36903454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36903454", "title": "Effective altruism", "text": "Effective altruism\n\nEffective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values. It is the broad, evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.\n\nWhile a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit. People associated with the movement include philosopher Peter Singer, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, Cari Tuna, Oxford-based researchers William MacAskill and Toby Ord, and professional poker player Liv Boeree.\n\nEffective altruism differs from other philanthropic practices because of its emphasis on quantitatively comparing charitable causes and interventions with the goal of maximizing certain human values. In this way it is similar to consequentialism, which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse. The views of the philosopher Peter Singer in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement. Singer's book \"The Life You Can Save\" argued for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use charity evaluators to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.\n\nEffective altruists reject the view that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others. For example, they believe that a person in a developing country has equal value to a person in one's own community. In the 1972 essay 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality', Peter Singer wrote:\n\nIt makes no difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously ..., this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.\n\nIn addition, many effective altruists think that future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, and focus on reducing existential risks to humanity. Others believe that the interests of non-human animals should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals, such as those raised in factory farms.\n\nAlthough there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done with a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. Effective altruists, however, seek to compare the relative importance of different causes and choose one objectively, a concept that is usually referred to as cause neutrality. Effective altruists choose the highest priority causes based on whether activities in each cause area could efficiently advance broad goals, such as increasing human or animal welfare, and then focus their attention on interventions in high priority areas. \n\nSeveral organizations perform cause prioritization research to answer the question of what causes warrant the highest priority. Some common priorities among effective altruists include poverty in the developing world, the suffering of animals in factory farms, and risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth.\n\nEffective altruist organizations argue that some charities are far more effective than others, either because some do not achieve their goals or because of variability in the cost of achieving those goals. When possible, they seek to identify charities that are highly cost-effective, meaning that they achieve a large benefit for a given amount of money. For example, they select health interventions on the basis of their impact as measured by lives saved per dollar, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved per dollar, or disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted per dollar. This measure of disease burden is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.\n\nSome effective altruism organizations use randomized controlled trials as a primary form of evidence, as they are often considered to be at the highest level of strong evidence in healthcare research. \n\nEffective altruists argue that counterfactual reasoning is important to determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume that the best way to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.\n\nEffective altruist organizations make philanthropic recommendations for charities on the basis of their current funding need rather than merely evaluating the value of the work itself. Effective altruists avoid donating to organizations that have no \"room for more funding\" - those that face bottlenecks other than money which prevent them from spending the funds they have already accumulated or are expected to receive. For example, a medical charity might not be able to hire enough doctors or nurses to distribute the medical supplies it is capable of purchasing, or it might already be serving all of the potential patients in its market. There are many other organizations which \"do\" have room for more funding, so giving to one of those instead would produce real-world improvements.\n\nEffective altruism encourages significant charitable donation. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate suffering through donations if the purchases that one forgoes to donate do not cause comparable suffering to oneself, leading some of them to lead a frugal lifestyle in order to give substantially more than is typical in their society. Advocacy focuses on increasing the amount that people donate or identifying nonprofits that best meet the criteria of effective altruism.\n\nGiving What We Can (GWWC) is an organization which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income for the remainder of their working lives to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in November 2009 by Toby Ord, a moral philosopher at Oxford University, who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity. As of 2018, more than 3,200 individuals have taken the pledge.\n\nThe Founders Pledge is a similar system run by the nonprofit Founders Forum for Good where startup founders make a legally binding commitment to donate at least 2% of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business. By May 2016, one year after launch, 430 entrepreneurs had pledged, for an estimated total value of $134 million based on the founders' equity and the companies' valuation.\n\nEffective altruists argue that selection of one's career is an important determinant of the amount of good one does, both directly (through the services one provides to the world) and indirectly (through the ways one directs the money earned based on the career).\n\n80,000 Hours is an Oxford, UK-based organization in the effective altruism movement that writes articles and conducts one-on-one coaching to help people find careers with a positive social impact. It considers indirect methods of altruistic employment, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct practices, such as scientific research. It was co-founded by William MacAskill, who is also its current president.\n\nThe earning to give strategy has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating large sums of money to charity. Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill have argued that the marginal impact of one's potentially unethical actions in such a lucrative career would be small since someone else would have done them regardless, while the impact of donations would be large.\n\nDavid Brooks, a columnist for \"The New York Times\", criticized effective altruists who adopt the strategy. He wrote that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic. In \"The Week\", Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argued that the practice was \"unsettling\".\n\nEffective altruism aspires to be cause-neutral, meaning it is in principle open to helping in whichever areas allow them to do the most good. In practice, most people in the effective altruist movement have prioritized poverty, animal welfare, and risks of the long term future.\n\nGlobal poverty alleviation has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.\n\nCharity evaluator GiveWell was founded by Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld in 2007 to address poverty and is currently a part of the effective altruism movement. GiveWell has argued that the value of donations is greatest for international poverty alleviation and developing world health issues, and its leading recommendations have been in these domains (Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Deworm the World Initiative, and (earlier) VillageReach in global health, and GiveDirectly for direct unconditional cash transfers).\n\nGiving What We Can is focused on causes related to the alleviation of global poverty and does in-house research evaluating causes and charities, but largely relies on research by other organizations such as GiveWell. The organization The Life You Can Save, which originated from the book by the same name, also focuses on global poverty.\n\nWhile much of the initial focus of effective altruism was on direct strategies such as health interventions and cash transfers, there has also been interest in more systematic social, economic, and political reform that would facilitate larger long-term poverty reduction. In September 2011, GiveWell announced GiveWell Labs, which was later renamed as the Open Philanthropy Project, for exploration of more speculative causes such as policy reform. It is a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, a philanthropic foundation founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna.\n\nMany effective altruists believe that reducing animal suffering should be a major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this. Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2.7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption. He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare. Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction. Philosophically, wild animal suffering may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.\n\nAnimal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization connected with the movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling factory farming. Faunalytics (formerly the Humane Research Council) is an organization loosely affiliated with the movement that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.\n\nFocusing on the long-term future, some effective altruists believe that the total value of any meaningful metric (wealth, potential for suffering, potential for happiness, etc.) summed up over future generations, far exceeds the value for people living today. In particular, the importance of addressing existential risks such as dangers associated with biotechnology and advanced artificial intelligence is often highlighted and the subject of active research. Because it is often infeasible to use empirical science (such as randomized control trials) to measure the probability of an existential risk, researchers such as Nick Bostrom have used other methods such as expert opinion elicitation to estimate their importance.\n\nSome organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long term future, and have connections with the effective altruist movement, are the Future of Humanity Institute, Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and Future of Life Institute. In addition, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute is focused on the more narrow mission of aligning advanced artificial intelligence.\n\nThe ideas behind effective altruism, such as consequentialism, have been present in practical ethics for a long time and have been reflected in the writings of philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Peter Singer, and Peter Unger. A basic argument for altruism was defined in Singer's 1972 paper \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\", in which he argued that people have an obligation to help those in need:\n\nIf it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it.\n\nHowever, the movement identifying with the name 'effective altruism' itself only came into being in the late 2000s as a community formed around the groups Giving What We Can and Givewell. It has since been growing in size. The Internet forum LessWrong also played a role in the development of the movement.\n\nEffective altruism conferences have been held since 2013. In 2015, Peter Singer published \"The Most Good You Can Do\", a book on effective altruism. The book describes the philosophy and social movement of effective altruism and argues in favor of it. In the same year William MacAskill published his book \"Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference\" which helped to further popularize the movement. MacAskill also created Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours, both of which are part of the Centre for Effective Altruism.\n\nDavid Brooks has questioned whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be \"internally ennobling\". In the \"Stanford Social Innovation Review\", Ken Berger and Robert Penna of Charity Navigator condemned effective altruism's practice of \"weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another\", calling this \"moralistic, in the worst sense of the word\".\n\nPascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the \"measurement problem\", stating that some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance \"one grinding step at a time\", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and therefore risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement. Jennifer Rubenstein also hypothesizes that effective altruism can be biased against causes that are not straightforward to measure.\n\nIn \"Jacobin\" magazine, Mathew Snow argued that effective altruism \"implores individuals to use their money to procure necessities for those who desperately need them, but says nothing about the system that determines how those necessities are produced and distributed in the first place\". Various critics have similarly objected to effective altruism on the basis of the fact that its proponents tend not to support political causes such as anti-capitalism that change \"the existing global institutional order\". Joshua Kissel has replied that anti-capitalism is compatible with effective altruism in theory, while adding that effective altruists and anti-capitalists have reason to be more sympathetic to each other. Brian Berkey has also argued that support for changing institutions such as capitalism does not contradict the principles of effective altruism, because effective altruism is open to any action that will have the greatest positive impact on the world, including the possibility of changing the existing global institutional order. Elizabeth Ashton argues that we are separately obligated to donate to effective aid charities and to reform the structures that are responsible for poverty.\n\n"}

{"id": "1323496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1323496", "title": "Exonym and endonym", "text": "Exonym and endonym\n\nAn exonym or xenonym is an external name for a geographical place, a group of people, an individual person, or a language or dialect. It is a common name used only outside the place, group, or linguistic community in question. An endonym or autonym is an internal name for a geographical place, a group of people, or a language or dialect. It is a common name used only inside the place, group, or linguistic community in question; it is their name for themselves, their homeland, or their language.\n\nFor instance, \"Germany\" is the English language exonym, is the French language exonym, and is the endonym for the same country in Europe.\n\nMarcel Aurousseau, an Australian geographer, first used the term exonym in his work \"The Rendering of Geographical Names\" (1957). The term \"endonym\" was devised subsequently as an antonym for the term \"exonym\".\n\nAll four of the terms (exonym, endonym, antonym and xenonym) are from the Greek root word (), 'name'. The prefixes are from the Greek (), 'within'; (), 'self'; (), 'out'; and (), 'foreign'.\n\nExonyms and endonyms can be names of places (toponym), ethnic groups (ethnonym), languages (glossonym), or individuals (personal name).\nAs pertains to geographical features, the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names defines:\n\nFor example, \"India\", \"China\", \"Egypt\", and \"Germany\" are the English-language exonyms corresponding to the endonyms \"Bharat\", \"中国\" (\"Zhōngguó\"), \"مَصر\" (\"Masr\"), and \"Deutschland\", respectively. Chinese, Persian, Turkish, Arabic, and German are exonyms in English for the languages that are endonymously known as \"中文\" (\"Zhōngwén\"), \"فارسی\" (\"Fārsi\"), \"Türkçe\", \"العَرَبِيَّة\" (\"al-Arabiyah\"), and \"Deutsch\", respectively.\n\nExonyms may derive from different roots, as in the case of Germany for \"Deutschland\", or they may be cognate words which have diverged in pronunciation or orthography, or they may be fully or partially translated (a calque) from the native language. For example, London (originally Latin \"Londinium\") is known by the cognate exonyms \"Londres\" in Catalan, Filipino, French, Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish; \"Londino\" (Λονδίνο) in Greek; \"Londen\" in Dutch; \"Londra\" in Italian, Maltese, Romanian, Sardinian and Turkish; \"Londër\" in Albanian; \"Londýn\" in Czech and Slovak; \"Londyn\" in Polish; \"Lundúnir\" in Icelandic; \"Lontoo\" in Finnish. An example of a translated exonym is the French name \"Pays-Bas\" for the Netherlands, \"Nederland\" in Dutch, all of which mean \"Low Countries\".\n\nExonyms can also be divided into native and borrowed, i.e. from a third language. For example, Slovene uses the native exonyms \"Dunaj\" (Vienna) and \"Benetke\" (Venice), and the borrowed exonyms \"Kijev\" (Kiev) and \"Vilna\" (Vilnius), from Russian. A substantial proportion of English exonyms for places in continental Europe are borrowed (or adapted) from French; for example: Navarre (\"Navarra/Nafarroa\"), Belgrade (\"Beograd\"), Cologne (\"Köln\"), Munich (\"München\"), Prague (\"Praha\"), Rome (\"Roma\"), Naples (\"Napoli\"), Florence (\"Firenze\"), Copenhagen (\"København\"), etc.\n\nAccording to James A. Matisoff, who introduced the term \"autonym\" into linguistics, \"Human nature being what it is, exonyms are liable to be pejorative rather than complimentary, especially where there is a real or fancied difference in cultural level between the ingroup and the outgroup.\" For example, Matisoff notes \"Khang\" \"an opprobrious term indicating mixed race or parentage\" is the Palaung name for Jingpo people and the Jingpo name for Chin people; both the Jingpo and Burmese use the Chinese word \"yeren\" 野人 (literally \"wild men\") \"savage; rustic people\" as the name for Lisu people.\n\nExonyms develop for places of significance for speakers of the language of the exonym. Consequently, many European capitals have English exonyms, e.g. Athens (Αθήνα/Athína), Belgrade (Београд/Beograd), Bucharest (București), Brussels (Bruxelles, Brussel), Copenhagen (København), Lisbon (Lisboa), Moscow (Москва/Moskva), Prague (Praha), Rome (Roma), Vienna (Wien), and Warsaw (Warszawa), while for instance historically less prominent capitals Ljubljana and Zagreb do not (but do have exonyms in languages spoken nearby e.g. German: Laibach and Agram, though \"Agram\" is old fashioned and not used any more). Madrid, Berlin, Oslo, and Amsterdam, with identical names in most major European languages, are exceptions. Some European capitals might be considered partial exceptions in that whilst the spelling is the same across languages, the pronunciation can differ; thus Paris in English sees the 's' vocalised, whilst in Swedish Stockholm is pronounced with a more emphasised glottal stop which is missing in English. For places considered to be of lesser significance, attempts to reproduce local names have been made in English since the time of the Crusades. Livorno, to take an instance, was \"Leghorn\" because it was an Italian port essential to English merchants and, by the 18th century, to the British Navy; not far away, Rapallo, a minor port on the same sea, never received an exonym.\n\nIn earlier times, the name of the first tribe or village encountered became the exonym for the whole people beyond. Thus the Romans used the tribal names \"Graecus\" (Greek) and \"Germanus\", the Russians used the village name of \"Chechen\", medieval Europeans took the tribal name \"Tatar\" as emblematic for the whole Mongolic confederation (and then confused it with \"Tartarus\", a word for Hell, to produce \"Tartar\"), and the Magyar invaders were equated with the 500-years-earlier Hunnish invaders in the same territory, and were called \"Hungarians\".\n\nThe Germanic invaders of the Roman Empire applied the word \"Walha\" to foreigners they encountered and this evolved in West Germanic languages as a generic name for all non-Germanic speakers; thence, the names Wallachia, Vlachs, Wallonia, Walloons, Cornwall, Wales, Wallasey, Welche in Alsace-Lorraine, and even the Polish name for Italy, \"Włochy\".\n\nDuring the late 20th century the use of exonyms often became controversial. Groups often prefer that outsiders avoid exonyms where they have come to be used in a pejorative way: for example, Romani people often prefer that term to exonyms such as \"Gypsy\" (from Egypt), and the French term \"bohémien, bohème\" (from Bohemia). People may also avoid exonyms for reasons of historical sensitivity, as in the case of German names for Polish and Czech places that at one time had been ethnically or politically German (e.g. Danzig/Gdańsk and Karlsbad/Karlovy Vary), and Russian names for locations once under Russian control (e.g. Kiev/Kyiv).\n\nIn recent years, geographers have sought to reduce the use of exonyms to avoid this kind of problem. For example, it is now common for Spanish speakers to refer to the Turkish capital as Ankara rather than use the Spanish exonym \"Angora\". According to the United Nations Statistics Division, \"Time has, however, shown that initial ambitious attempts to rapidly decrease the number of exonyms were over-optimistic and not possible to realise in the intended way. The reason would appear to be that many exonyms have become common words in a language and can be seen as part of the language’s cultural heritage.\"\n\nIn some situations the use of exonyms can be preferred. For instance, for multilingual cities such as Brussels, which is known for its linguistic tensions between Dutch- and French-speakers, a neutral name may be preferred so as to not offend anyone. Thus an exonym such as Brussels in English could be used instead of favoring either one of the local names (Brussel in Dutch/Flemish and Bruxelles in French).\n\nOther difficulties with endonyms have to do with pronunciation, spelling and word category. The endonym may include sounds and spellings that are highly unfamiliar to speakers of other languages, making appropriate usage difficult if not impossible for an outsider. Over the years, the endonym may have undergone phonetic changes, either in the original language or the borrowing language, thus changing an endonym into an exonym, as in the case of \"Paris\", where the \"s\" was formerly pronounced in French. Another example is the endonym for the German city of Cologne, where the Latin original of Colonia has evolved into \"Köln\" in German, while the Italian and Spanish exonym \"Colonia\" closely reflects the Latin original. In some cases no standardized spelling is available either because the language itself is unwritten (even unanalyzed) or because there are competing non-standard spellings. Use of a misspelled endonym is perhaps more problematic than the respectful use of an existing exonym. Finally, an endonym may be a plural noun and may not naturally extend itself to adjectival usage in another language, like English, which has a propensity to use the adjectives for describing culture and language. The attempt to use the endonym thus has a bizarre-sounding result.\n\nThe names for a language and a people are often different terms, which is a complication for an outsider, with a noticeable example being people from the Netherlands being called the Dutch by native English speakers.\n\nAs modern technology removes many of the barriers between peoples, it is increasingly becoming the case that younger people may be more familiar with an endonym than with its official exonym. For example, many Italian cities are now more famous for their football teams and Torino and Napoli are becoming more common than Turin and Naples.\n\nSometimes the government of a country tries to endorse the use of an endonym instead of traditional exonyms outside the country:\n\nFollowing the declaration in 1979 of Hanyu Pinyin spelling as the standard romanisation of Chinese, many Chinese endonyms have successfully replaced English exonyms, especially city and most province names in mainland China, e.g. Beijing (北京 \"Běijīng\"), Guangdong (广东 \"Guǎngdōng\") (province), Qingdao (青岛 \"Qīngdǎo\"), although older English exonyms are sometimes used in certain contexts – e.g. Peking (duck, opera, etc.), Canton, etc. In the case of \"Beijing\", the adoption of the exonym by media outlets quickly gave rise to a hyperforeignized pronunciation, with the result that many English speakers actualize the \"j\" in \"Beijing\" as [ʒ].\n\nMatisoff wrote, \"A group's autonym is often egocentric, equating the name of the people with 'mankind in general,' or the name of the language with 'human speech'.\" For example, various Native American autonyms are sometimes explained to English readers as having literal translations of \"original people\" or \"normal people\", with implicit contrast to other first nations as not original or not normal. Exonyms often describe others as \"foreign-speaking\", \"non-speaking\" or \"nonsense-speaking\". The classic example is the Slavic term for the Germans, \"Nemtsi\", possibly deriving from a plural of \"nemy\" (\"mute\"): standard etymology has it that the Slavic peoples referred to their Germanic neighbors as \"mutes\" because their language was unintelligible. The term survives to this day in the Russian \"nemtsy\" (\"немцы\"), Bulgarian \"nemtsi\" (\"немци\"), Ukrainian \"nimtsi\" (\"німці\"), Polish \"Niemcy\", Czech \"Němci\", Slovak, Slovenian and Serbo-Croatian \"Nijemci/Nemci\" (\"Нијемци/Немци\"), Montenegrin \"Njemci\" (\"Њемци\"), as well as in the Hungarian \"Német\" and Romanian \"Nemţi\" (both adopted from the Slavic), and even in the Turkish \"Nemçe\" and Arabic \"al-Nimsa\" (النمسا). The Turkish was adapted from the Slavic, and the Arabic from the Turkish, the words in both cases referring specifically to Austria.\n\nOne of the more prominent theories regarding the origin of the term \"Slav\" suggests that it comes from the Slavic root \"slovo\" (hence \"Slovenia,\" \"Slovakia\"), meaning \"word\" or \"speech\". In this context, the Slavs are describing Germanic people as \"mutes\"—in contrast to themselves, \"the speaking ones\".\n\nAnother example of such development is the exonym \"Sioux\", an abbreviated form of \"Nadouessioux\", derived most likely from a Proto-Algonquian term, *-a·towe·, \"foreign-speaking\".\n\nTwo millennia earlier, the Greeks thought that all non-Greeks were uncultured and so called them \"barbarians,\" which eventually gave rise to the exonym \"Berber\".\n\nWhile the Irish words for England and its people are \"Sasana\" and \"Sasanach\" (\"Saxons\"), the word for the English language is \"Béarla\", which derives ultimately from a word meaning \"lips\". In Old Irish, this word was applied to any foreign language, but by the medieval period it had come to be used exclusively for the English language.\n\nExonyms and endonyms must not be confused with the results of geographical renaming as in the case of Saint Petersburg, which became Petrograd (Петроград) in 1914, Leningrad (Ленинград) in 1924, and Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург \"Sankt-Peterbúrg\") again in 1991. In this case, although \"St Petersburg\" has a German etymology, it was never a German exonym for the city between 1914 and 1991, just as Nieuw Amsterdam, the Dutch name of New York City until 1664, is not its Dutch exonym.\n\nOld place names that have become outdated after renaming may afterwards still be used as historicisms. For example, even today one would talk about the Siege of Leningrad, not the Siege of St. Petersburg, because at that time (1941–1944) the city was called Leningrad. Likewise, one would say that Immanuel Kant was born in Königsberg in 1724, not in Kaliningrad (Калининград), as it has been called since 1946.\n\nAlthough the pronunciation for several names of Chinese cities such as Beijing and Nanjing has not changed for quite some while in Mandarin Chinese, they were called Peking and Nanking in English due to the confusion brought about by the older Chinese postal romanization convention, which was used for transcribing Chinese place names before Pinyin became the official romanization method for Mandarin in the 1970s. Nonetheless, many older English speakers still refer to the cities by their older English names and even today they are often used in naming things associated with the cities like Peking opera, Peking duck, and Peking University to give them a more antiquated or more elegant feel. Like for Saint Petersburg, the historical event called the Nanking Massacre (1937) uses the city's older name because that was the name of the city at the time of occurrence. Likewise, many Korean cities like Busan and Incheon (formerly Pusan and Inchǒn respectively) also underwent changes in spelling due to changes in romanization, even though the Korean pronunciations have largely stayed the same.\n\nSometimes, however, historical names are deliberately not used because of nationalist tendencies to linguistically lay claim to a city's past. As a case in point, the on the 1805 Peace of Pressburg does not use any of the city's names then in use (the Hungarian \"Pozsony\", the Slovak \"Prešporok\" or the German \"Pressburg\"), but today's name \"Bratislava\", which became the city's name in 1919.\n\nThe name Madras, now Chennai, may be a special case. When the city was first settled by Englishmen, in the early 17th century, both names were in use. Possibly they referred to different villages which were fused into the new settlement. In any case, Madras became the exonym, while more recently, Chennai became the endonym.\n\nLikewise, Istanbul (İstanbul in Turkish) is still called Constantinople (Κωνσταντινούπολη) in Greek, although the name was changed in Turkish to disassociate the city from its Greek past between 1923 and 1930 (the name Istanbul itself derives from a Medieval Greek phrase). Prior to Constantinople, the city was known in Greek as Byzantion (Greek: Βυζάντιον, Latin: ), named after its mythical founder, Byzas.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book deals with deaths on-set, copycat crimes, obsessed fans, bizarre coincidences, and other incidents which lead a film to be called \"cursed\".\n\nThe book's origins are in several essays by the author, Mikita Brottman. Brottman received her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from Oxford University, taught Comparative Literature at Indiana University as a Visiting Assistant Professor, served as a professor at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, and is currently on the staff of the Pacifica Graduate Institute. Brottman's writings on film and film culture have appeared in \"Film Quarterly\", \"Literature Film Quarterly\" and \"indieWire\", where she regularly covers international film festivals. The book covers \"cursed movies\" in a period ranging from Roman Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968) to \"The Crow\" (1994) with Brandon Lee.\n\nIn a 2005 interview for the \"Sunday Herald\", Brottman defined the elements that make a \"cursed movie\": \"A film will appear to be hexed if one or more of the stars has died after filming or during filming or if it turns out that the stars have drug or health problems or suicidal tendencies - something that the audience wasn't aware of at the time. Or if there's been an unusual pattern of co-incidences associated with the film such as a series of deaths or a series of accidents during filming.\"\n\nThe central section of the book, and the two films which receive the most analysis, are Polanski's \"Macbeth\" (1971), and William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1973).\nPolanski's \"Macbeth\", which receives the most complete coverage, is intercut with descriptions of and parallels with the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate, Polanski's wife. The section on \"The Exorcist\" details extreme audience reactions to the film. Films which receive shorter coverage include \"\" (1983) and Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994).\n\nA review of the book in the film and popular culture journal \"Images\" judges that \"Hollywood Hex\" is most successful in the sections covering \"The Exorcist\" and \"Macbeth\" because of not, \"exploiting the subject material but in maintaining distance.\" Brottman's objective approach to the material gives it an academic and neutral point of view which, in a subject which could easily be sensationalized, is remarked on approvingly in the review. The reviewer, David Ng, comments, \"How easy it would have been to sensationalize this material, to cheapen it with tabloidish conjectures, to dilute it with pop psychology, or to kill it with over-analysis... It is a mature book that trusts its readers to extrapolate... freely.\"\n\"Images\" points out that other films covered by the book are not done in as complete a manner as are \"Macbeth\" and \"The Exorcist\", giving the book a somewhat disjointed quality. Ng comments, \"The shorter essays... while always fascinating, seldom reach the subtle genius of the two centerpieces.\" Nevertheless, Brottman's academic approach to the subject is consistent throughout the book, according to Ng, who writes that she, \"never short changes a movie because it was a bomb or a turkey. \"Poltergeist III\", for instance, is scrutinized with the same level of intelligence as \"The Exorcist\".\n\nThe \"Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture\" (2004) calls the book, \"a fascinating account of murder and misadventure in Tinseltown,\" and an \"unashamedly esoteric film book with a very entertaining premise.\"\n\n"}

The remaining territories are called Red Zones, where governance is weak or non-existent.\n\nBen Larson is a manager at Spiga Biotech, the largest corporation in the world. He works for Elizabeth, the estranged mother of his wife, Laura. In reality, he is a climate refugee from the Red Zone outside Milwaukee whose real name is Aaron. Aaron has infiltrated the Green Zone, assuming the identity of Ben Larson to search for his childhood love Elena, who through a series of unfortunate circumstances has become an executive club companion—a high-end, indentured prostitute who works at a Spiga \"executive club\" called Arcadia. Arcadia is an exclusive brothel for senior Spiga executives. Aaron resolves to work his way up to a senior position in order to access Arcadia and rescue her. After framing his boss Chad for stealing classified information and ensuring his dismissal from the company, Aaron endeavours to obtain the promotion to the now-vacant position and rescue Elena, all while maintaining his Ben Larson cover in the face of increasingly paranoid Spiga security scrutiny and competitive coworkers. He is assisted by Theo, Elena's brother who is still living in the Red Zone, and Reed, another Red Zone denizen who managed to assume a Green Zone persona years before Aaron managed the same feat.\n\n\nOn June 20, 2017 CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released the entire series on DVD in Region 1.\n\nThe series premiered November 30, 2016, on Syfy and in Canada on Showcase.\n\nGeorgina Haig played the female lead in the pilot but left and Allison Miller was cast in her place.\n\nThe series has received a 75% rating on \"Rotten Tomatoes\", the site's critical consensus reading: \"\"Incorporated\"'s impressive production values, solid performances, and engaging vision of a bleak future outweigh a predictable, clichéd narrative.\"\n\n"}

The manuscript is held in the Vatican Library in a collection (\"Codex Palatinus Latinus\" 577) which probably originates from Fulda and thence traveled to Mainz, arriving there in 1479. From Mainz it went to the Bibliotheca Palatina in Heidelberg, and arrived in Rome at the latest in 1623. Preceding the \"Indiculus\" is the so-called Old Saxon Baptismal Vow. The text is edited in the \"Karlomanni Principis Capitulare\", published by the Monumenta Germaniae Historica.\n\n\"Codex Palatinus Latinus\" 577 itself appears to have been copied ca. 800 in either Fulda or Mainz. Alain Dierkens argues, on the basis of word choice (the correspondence between the phrase \"superstitionem et paganiarum\" and the diction used by Boniface in his 742 letter to Pope Zachary) and a comparison between the content of the \"Indiculus\" and the conclusions of the Concilium Germanicum (744), that the \"Indiculus\" was indeed appended to or pertained to the decisions made at the Concilium Germanicum and the two consequent Frankish synods at Estinnes and Soissons. In other words, they were not the product of a late-seventh century scribe at Fulda, nor were the prohibitions aimed specifically or exclusively at the Saxons.\n\nThe index provides valuable insight into the religious culture of the pagan Saxons (from the Christian point of view) and into the daily practices of Christian missionaries working in that area. Since it is more or less contemporary with the activities of Saint Boniface in modern-day Germany, he has been called a \"guiding influence\" on its compilation. According to Alain Dierkens, the \"Indiculus\", which he thinks derives from the \"entourage\" of Boniface, evidences the ongoing practice of pre-Christian practices, including divination, the use of amulets, magic, and witchcraft, and suggests that the church allowed or transformed certain practices which it had been unable to extirpate.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "685448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685448", "title": "Jewish languages", "text": "Jewish languages\n\nJewish languages are the various languages and dialects that developed in Jewish communities in the diaspora. The original Jewish language is Hebrew, which was supplanted as the primary vernacular by Aramaic following the Babylonian exile. Jewish languages feature a syncretism of indigenous Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic with the languages of the local non-Jewish population.\n\nEarly Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested through the end of the Bronze Age—2350 to 1200 BCE. At this early state, Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from the other Northwest Semitic languages (Ugaritic and Amarna Canaanite), though noticeable differentiation did occur during the Iron Age (1200–540 BCE). Hebrew as a separate language developed during the latter half of the second millennium BCE between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, an area known as Canaan.\n\nThe earliest distinctively Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at Khirbet Qeiyafa and dates to the 10th century BCE. The Israelite tribes established a kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium BCE, which later split into the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south after a dispute of succession.\n\nThe kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 BCE, and the kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, its higher classes exiled and the first Temple destroyed. Aramaic became the primary language of the Jews deported to Babylonia, with the first attestations of Jewish/Judean Aramaic found in scrolls from the 5th century BCE on the island of Elephantine. Later the Persians made Judah a province and permitted Jewish exiles to return and rebuild the Temple. Aramaic became the common language in the north of Israel, in Galilee and Samaria, though Hebrew remained in use in Judah with Aramaic influence.\n\nAlexander conquered Judah in 332 BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmoneans, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, and the second Bar-Kochba revolt in 132–135 CE led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea. Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew remained in widespread use among diasporic communities as the medium of writing and liturgy, forming a vast corpus of literature which includes rabbinic, medieval, and modern literature prior to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language.\n\nJewish communities were dispersed around the world in the diaspora which followed the Jewish-Roman wars. Some adopted the languages of their neighbors, but many developed new varieties of these languages, collectively termed \"Jewish languages\". Various reasons lead to the development of distinctive Jewish varieties of the languages of their surrounding non-Jewish neighbors. Jews have often had limited exposure to non-Jewish society for various reasons, including imposed ghettoization and strict endogamy, and as a result Jewish languages diverged and developed separately from non-Jewish varieties in the territories they settled in. Due to frequent expulsions and migrations, single Jewish communities were often influenced by multiple distinct regional languages via language contact. For example, Yiddish, while based on High German, has elements of Romance and Slavic. Jewish languages belong to a variety of genealogical language families, but these languages have common characteristics making their study a distinct field of comparative linguistics known as Jewish linguistics. The common feature between the Jewish languages is the presence of a Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic lexical components stemming from the shared use of these languages in writing and liturgy. Many Jewish languages also display phonological, morphological, and syntactic features distinct from their non-Jewish counterparts. Most written Jewish languages are Hebraized, meaning they use a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet. These languages, unless they already have an accepted name (i.e. Yiddish), are prefixed with \"Judeo\" (ex Judeo-Spanish, Judeo-Arabic).\n\nIn the early 20th century, secularism among Jews, and large population shifts prompted the beginning of a shift from Jewish to non-Jewish languages. Even so, the majority of Jews in Eurasia and Africa, and many immigrants in North America and Palestine, still spoke Jewish languages. However, the Holocaust brought about a significant drop in the use of Jewish languages, especially Yiddish.\n\nJewish languages are generally defined as the unique linguistic varieties of Jewish communities in the diaspora in their contact with surrounding non-Jewish languages. Languages vary in their distance and divergence from their non-Jewish sister languages. For example, Judeo-Yemeni Arabic is quite similar to some non-Jewish varieties of Yemeni Arabic, while Yiddish, a Germanic language, shows a high degree of dissimilarity to modern German dialects. Due to continued liturgical and literary use of Hebrew and Aramaic, Jewish communities were naturally in a state of diglossia. Along with their vernacular Jewish language, most Jews could read and write in Hebrew, which was necessary to fulfill the religious commandment to learn Torah and teach it. Jews were expected to also have knowledge of Judeo-Aramaic, the language of religious commentary (\"targumim\") as well as many prayers, including the Kaddish. Hebrew, the \"Holy Tongue\", was the highest linguistic register in these communities, used for liturgy and study. Hebrew-Aramaic is the only adstratum shared by all Jewish languages. \nSome Jewish languages have multiple registers, for example, both Yiddish and Judezmo have three linguistic registers: colloquial, written, and scholarly-liturgical.\n\nSome Jewish languages show the effects of the history of language shift among the speakers, including Hebrew-Aramaic influence. Yiddish exemplifies such a language. Some Jewish languages may become marked as distinctively Jewish because some shift affected some parts of the language as a whole. For example, what is today known as Baghdad Jewish Arabic (because it is the Arabic variety that was up until recently spoken by Baghdad's Jews) was originally the Arabic dialect of Baghdad itself and was used by all religious groups in Baghdad, but the Muslim residents of Baghdad later adopted Bedouin dialects of Arabic. Similarly, a dialect may be perceived as Jewish because its Jewish speakers brought the dialect of another region with them when they were displaced. In some cases this may cause a dialect to be perceived as \"Jewish\" in some regions but not in others.\n\nSome Jewish language varieties may not be classified as languages due to mutual intelligibility with their parent language, as with Judeo-Malayalam and Judeo-Spanish. In the case of Judeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, linguistically it is a dialect of Spanish, mutually intelligible with other Spanish dialects and varieties, albeit with each Spanish dialect having loanwords and influences from different source languages: Nahuatl and Maya loanwords and influences for Mexican Spanish; Quechua and Aymara in Peruvian Spanish; Italian, Quechua and Guaraní in Argentinian Spanish; Maghrebi Arabic and Berber in \"Ladino Occidental\" (also known as Haketia); Levantine Arabic, Greek, Turkish and South Slavic in \"Ladino Oriental\".\n\nIn some cases, as with Ladino, a register may be developed for Biblical translation and exegesis in which Hebrew-Aramaic patterns are frequently calqued, though the number of true Hebrew and/or Aramaic loanwords may be low. Another possibility is that Jews may speak the same language as their non-Jewish neighbors, but occasionally insert Hebrew-Aramaic or other Jewish elements. This is a transitory state in the shift from use of a Jewish to a non-Jewish language, often made in the context of assimilation. This occurred, for example, with many educated German Jews who transitioned from Western Yiddish to German. This variety of German, used between 1760 and the end of the 19th century (the Haskala), was written with the Hebrew alphabet, and contained a small number of Hebrew and Yiddish loans. An example is Moses Mendelsohn's translation of the Hebrew Bible into German written with Hebrew letters.\n\nAmong the most widely spoken Jewish languages to develop in the diaspora are Yiddish, Ladino, and the Judæo-Arabic group of languages. Yiddish is the Judeo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. Ladino, also called \"Judezmo\" and \"Muestra Spanyol\", is the Judeo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula before the Spanish inquisition. Judeo-Catalan (also called \"Catalanic\" or \"Qatalanit\"), was the Jewish language spoken by the Jewish communities in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands. Judeo-Provençal (or \"Shuadit\") was the Occitan language as it was historically spoken by French Jews although it was not a distinct language, and was indistinguishable from the Occitan spoken by non-Jews.\n\nMany ancient and distinct Jewish languages, including Judaeo-Georgian, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Berber, Krymchak and Judeo-Malayalam have largely fallen out of use due the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, the assimilation policies of Israel in its early days and other factors.\n\nYiddish was the language spoken by the largest number of Jews in the 1850s, but today the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews are English, modern Hebrew, and Russian—in that order.. Yiddish, as well as several other Jewish languages, has contributed to the vocabulary of coterritorial non-Jewish languages, such as English or French.\n\nKol Israel (Israel's public service broadcaster) has long maintained daily short news and features programming in many Jewish languages and dialects. For domestic audiences it broadcast in Iraqi Jewish Arabic (Yahudi) on its Arabic network. While producing: Yiddish, Ladino, Moroccan Jewish Arabic (Mughrabi or Marocayit), Bukharian (Central Asian dialect) and Judeo-Tat for both to domestic and overseas shortwave audiences in relevant areas. In addition, for over two decades from the late 1970s a daily 30 minute shortwave transmission was made to Yemen in Yemenite Jewish Arabic.\n\nRadio Exterior de España, the Spanish International Public broadcaster, provides programming in Ladino, which they refer to as Sefardi.\n\nIn the United States there are some local radio programs in Yiddish as there are also in Birobidzhan in Russia.\n\nJudæo-Marathi (Marathi: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of Marathi spoken by the Bene Israel, a Jewish ethnic group that developed a unique identity in India and in Pakistan. Judæo-Marathi is, like other Marathi, written in the Devanagari script. It may not be sufficiently different from Marathi as to constitute a distinct language, although it is characterized by a number of loanwords from Hebrew and Aramaic as a result of influence from the Cochin Jewish community, Judæo-Malayalam and Portuguese and also some influence from the Urdu language.\n\nFor centuries Jews worldwide spoke the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branching off as independent languages. The usual course of development for these languages was through the addition of Hebrew words and phrases used to express uniquely Jewish concepts and concerns. Often they were written in Hebrew letters, including the block letters used in Hebrew today and Rashi script.\n\nConversely, Ladino, formerly written in Rashi script, since the 1920s is usually written in Turkey in the Latin alphabet with a spelling similar to that of Turkish, and has been occasionally printed in the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets.\nSoviet authorities tried to promote the Cyrillic alphabet for Yiddish in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.\n\nAlso, some Yiddish-speakers have adopted the use of the Latin alphabet, in place of the Hebrew alphabet. This is predominantly to enable communications over the internet, without the need for special Hebrew keyboards.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet has also been used to transcribe a number of languages including Arabic, English, French, Spanish, German, and Greek. While not common, such practice has occurred intermittently over the last two thousand years.\n\nJudaeo-Marathi (Marathi: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of Marathi spoken by the Bene Israel, a Jewish ethnic group in India and in Pakistan. Judæo-Marathi is written in the Devanagari script.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33996477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33996477", "title": "Juan Roque (Zape Confraternity)", "text": "Juan Roque (Zape Confraternity)\n\nJuan Roque was an African living in colonial Mexico City. He died in 1623, leaving behind one of very few wills and testaments of African residents of colonial Latin America. His daughter Ana María, and the confraternity to which he belonged in the hospital of the \"Limpia Concepción\", also left behind documents describing a court battle which detail the final requests made by Juan Roque concerning a house “in the neighborhood of San Hipólito in the lane next to the College of San Juan where it meets the open air market of San Hipólito, bordering the houses of the marshals and those of Don Ángel de Villasaña.”\n\nAfricans played a notable role in the Spanish Conquest. As the Spanish and Portuguese control in colonial Latin America spread, Africans were stereotyped as slaves. However, there were exceptions. Africans and mulattos played active roles in the early 16th century, acting as conquistadors. Juan Garrido, Juan García, and Juan Valiente were all successful conquistadors, who became part of the Spanish communities as the conquest was completed.\n\nBy the 17th century, Africans lived in colonial Latin America, with distinctive organizations and communities that blended African culture with the laws and social expectations of the Spaniards. In New Spain, Africans, who originated from modern day coastal Sierra Leone, founded a brotherhood in Mexico City,\nwhich became the \"Zape\" Confraternity. Documents describe how Africans rose from slavery to become influential members of the community.\n\nBrought to New Spain as a slave before 1600, Juan Roque left a comprehensive will and testament at his death. It reveals the importance of 'confraternities' to the African community in Mexico City, as well as the prominence some Africans were able to achieve. \n\nWritten before his death in 1623, this last will and testament provided for a lavish and expensive funeral and lists profitable real estate that helped ensure the survival of the \"Zape\" Confraternity in Mexico City for several decades after his death. Both expensive and Catholic, Juan Roque’s funeral provides evidence that Africans could establish themselves within communities in colonial Latin America. He requested that he be buried either in the church of the Hospital of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception or the Santísma Veracruz Church of which he was a parishioner. \n\nIn addition, Juan Roque asked that the brotherhoods to which he belonged, like the \"Zape\" Confraternity, accompany his body to the burial and that fifty-five Masses be sung for his soul at different churches around Mexico City, as well as twenty Masses sung for his deceased wife, Isabel de Herrera. \n\nIn her essay analyzing confraternities in New Spain, Nicole von Germeten points out that as a prominent and wealthy African in Mexico City, Juan Roque's lavish funeral “with all the trappings of baroque religiosity” and membership in a confraternity like that of the Zape nation demonstrates the respectability of men of African descent in colonial Latin America. \n\nHe stated that his deceased wife was a free black woman, and when bequeathing his profitable real estate in the neighborhood of San Hipólito, Juan Roque pointed to the status of his daughter, Ana María, as a legitimate daughter from his marriage “according to the Most Holy Church” to Isabel de Herrera and therefore a free black woman. Designating these Africans as free, gave them status within the community and helped the \"Zape\" Confraternity, as it made its case to regain the income from houses around San Hipólito, following Ana María dying childless.\n\nBefore her death, Ana María spoke to members of the \"Zape\" Confraternity confirming that her father had wished the brotherhood to receive the income from the real estate in San Hipólito.\n\nIn colonial Latin America, confraternities were organizations that allowed Africans to achieve a sense of community after being taken from their homeland through the slave trade. These brotherhoods also facilitated the Africans’ conversion to Catholicism: by providing a place of worship, a Christian community, and financial support for members' funerals. The confraternities provided social welfare for Africans in New Spain and limited health care, when Africans were denied access to other assistance.\n\nThe importance of the confraternity’s ability to aid its members monetarily, is clearly evident In the court documents detailing the Zape Confraternity’s battle to receive the income of Juan Roque’s houses in San Hipólito. Juan Roque’s exact description of the location of the houses, in his last will and testament, attempted to ensure that his daughter. and eventually the confraternity, received the benefits of the properties.\n\nSeveral witnesses said that Ana María was adamant that her father wished the houses to go to the brotherhood, should she die without children. Even when one of the elder members of the confraternity urged her to agree with her husband and sell the houses, Ana María refused, because her father “charged her that if she did not have children she should not dispose of the houses, but give them the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception (the \"Zape\" Confraternity), of which he was a member and founder, so that the blacks of the Zape nation would administer them and take care of their earnings.”\n"}
{"id": "601094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601094", "title": "Korma", "text": "Korma\n\nKorma is a dish originating in the Indian subcontinent, consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt (dahi) or cream, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or glaze.\n\nThe English name is an anglicisation of Urdu , more accurately transliterated \"qormā\", and derived from a Turkic root. The word \"korma\" is derived from Urdu \"qormā\", \"ḳormā\" or \"ḳormah\", meaning \"braise\", and refers to the cooking technique used in the dish. All these words, and the names of dishes such as ghormeh (), the Azerbaijani qovurma or \"kavarma\" are ultimately derived from a Turkish language word \"qawirma\" meaning \"[a] fried thing\". The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.\n\nKorma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal incursions into the region. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with \"vark\", said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.\n\nClassically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt, cream or stock added. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on a mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as spinach and turnip. The term \"Shahi\" (), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.\n\nThe korma style is similar to all other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly or seared using a high heat, traditionally using ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid. The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called \"dum\" or \"dampokhtak\".\n\nThe korma can make use of a technique called \"bagar\": later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.\n\nThere is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring.\n\nA korma \"pilau\" (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.\n\nNavratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both. \"Navratan\" means nine gems, and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables.\n"}

{"id": "380597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380597", "title": "Marzanna", "text": "Marzanna\n\nMarzanna (in Polish), Marena (in Russian), Morana (in Czech, Bulgarian, Slovene, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian), or Morena (in Slovak and Macedonian), Maslenitsa (in Russia) and also Mara (in Belarusian and Ukrainian), Maržena, Moréna, Mora or Marmora is a Slavic goddess associated with seasonal rites based on the idea of death and rebirth of nature. She is an ancient goddess associated with winter's death and rebirth and dreams. In Slavic rites the death of the Goddess Marzanna at the end winter, becomes the rebirth of Spring of the Goddess Kostroma (Russian), Lada, Vesna representing the coming of Spring.\n\nSome medieval Christian sources such as the Czech 9th century Mater Verborum compare her to the Greek goddess Hecate, associating her with sorcery. 15th century Polish chronicler Jan Długosz likened her in his \"Annales\" to Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture (together with another Slavic goddess Dziewanna).\n\nIn modern times the rituals associated with Marzanna have lost their sacred character and are a pastime – an occasion to have fun and celebrate the beginning of spring. The tradition is usually celebrated around the spring equinox (March 21). Usually schoolchildren and young people participate in the celebrations alongside local folklore groups and other residents. A procession consisting of men, women and children carries handmade Marzanna (and often also \"Marzaniok\" dolls, the male counterpart to Marzanna) to the nearest river, lake or pond. The participants sing traditional songs and throw effigies of Marzanna into the water. Sometimes the effigies are first set on fire, or their clothes are torn. On the journey back to the village the focus falls on the copses, adorned with ribbons and blown egg shells. The procession, still singing, returns to the village. In some locations (e.g. in Brynica – a district of Miasteczko Śląskie), the beginning of spring is then celebrated with a feast.\n\nMarzanna's name most likely comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *mar-, *mor-, signifying death. The Slovak form of the theonym – \"Ma(r)muriena\" – suggests that the goddess may have originally been connected to the Roman god of war Mars (known under a variety of names, including \"Marmor\", \"Mamers\" and \"Mamurius Veturius\"). The connection to Mars is supported by, among others, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, who underline that he was originally an agricultural deity.\n\nOther theories claim her name is derived from the same Indo-European root as Latin \"mors\" 'death' and Russian \"mor\" 'pestilence'. Some authors also likened her to mare, an evil spirit in Germanic and Slavic folklore, associated with nightmares and sleep paralysis. In Belarusian, Polish, Ukrainian and in some Russian dialects the word 'mara' means dream. But Vladimir Dahl says it means 'phantom', 'vision', 'hallucination'.\n\nThe tradition of burning or drowning an effigy of Marzanna to celebrate the end of winter is a folk custom that survives in the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia. In the past, the festival was held on the fourth Sunday of Lent. In the 20th century the date 21 March was fixed (20–21 March). The rite involves preparing an effigy in female clothing, and either setting it on fire or drowning in a river (or both). This is often performed during a field trip by children in kindergarten and primary schools. The effigy, often made by the children themselves, can range in size from a puppet to a life-size dummy. This ritual represents the end of the dark days of winter, the victory over death, and the welcoming of the spring rebirth.\n\nMarzanna is also the name used to describe the effigy of the goddess, which was ritually burned or drowned during an early spring rite called Jare Święto in order to hasten the approach of spring. The custom of drowning the effigy of Marzanna derives from sacrificial rites; its function was to ensure a good harvest in the upcoming year. Following the principles of sympathetic magic – as described by James Frazer – it was believed that burning an effigy representing the goddess of death would remove any results of her presence (i.e., the winter) and thus bring about the coming of spring.\n\nThe effigy has usually been made of straw, wrapped in white cloth and adorned with ribbons and necklaces. Traditionally the effigy has initially been carried past every house in the village by a group of children holding green juniper twigs. During this procession Marzanna was repeatedly dipped in every encountered puddle or stream. In the evening the effigy passed to the young adults; the juniper twigs were lit, and thus illuminated Marzanna was carried out of the village, burned, and thrown into water. There is a number of superstitions related to the custom of drowning Marzanna: one cannot touch the effigy once it's in the water or one's hand will wither; looking back while returning home may cause an illness, while stumbling and falling may lead to a relative's death within the coming year.\n\nThe Catholic Church attempted to forbid this old Slavic custom. In 1420, the Synod of Poznań instructed the Polish clergy: \"Do not allow the superstitious Sunday custom, do not permit them to carry around the effigy they call Death and drown in puddles\". However, both the custom and tradition prevailed. At the turn of the 18th century there has been an attempt to replace it (on the Wednesday preceding Easter) with a newly introduced custom of throwing an effigy symbolizing Judas down from a church tower. This attempt also failed. Today, the custom is celebrated at spring equinox on 21 March, which coincides with the traditional date of Jare Święto.\n\nThe rite of drowning Marzanna, often conducted together with carrying bouquets of green twigs and branches (dubbed \"gaik\" in Polish, literally \"copse\") was originally performed on the fourth Sunday of Lent, called the White Sunday. The tradition of celebrating it on 21 March only began in the 20th century. Most researchers agree that the custom of carrying the copse (also known as \"grove, new summer\", or \"walking with the Queen\") from house to house was earlier performed much later in the year, probably shortly after Easter.\n\nDetails of the ritual vary from region to region. Typically the effigy or doll representing Marzanna is made of straw and dressed in traditional local costume, rags, or even bridesmaid's clothes. Marzanna may resemble a young woman wearing a garland as well as an old crone. Village dwellers carry the effigy away from the village, often singing event-related songs. Jerzy Pośpiech points out that at first only adults participated in the ritual; only when the custom became a fun game did the young join in.\n\nDepending on local tradition, the ritual that takes place after the procession reaches its chosen destination can be performed in various ways: sometimes the effigy is first torn into pieces, its clothes ripped off, and then drowned in a lake, river or even a puddle. In some variants of the ritual, the effigy is burned; in others, it is first set on fire and then thrown into water. A number of superstitions (also locally varied) are connected to the ritual, e.g.: the person who last returns to the village after the ritual is sure to die in the coming year. In some locations, a tradition functions in which Marzanna is given a male counterpart – Marzaniok.\n\nWalking with the Copse is a ritual in which pine branches, twigs or even entire small trees (pine or spruce) – adorned with ribbons, handmade ornaments, egg shells or flowers – are carried from house to house. In some variations of the ritual a doll is tied to the top branch; in others, a local girl accompanies the copse (hence \"walking with the Queen\"). The copse is usually carried by girls, who walk from house to house, dance, sing and extend best wishes to the hosts. Some sources relate that the group also collected donations. Today the ritual often takes the form of bringing a decorated copse to the village after the ritual of drowning Marzanna is completed. This type of a two-part ritual (destroying the effigy and then returning with the copse) had been observed in the Opole region, the western parts of Kraków voivodeship, Podhale, Slovakia, Moravia, Bohemia, Lusatia and Southern Germany (Thuringia, Franconia). In the 19th century Oskar Kolberg noted that the copse had been carried around as a standalone custom (without the prior destruction of Marzanna) around Kraków and Sandomierz, as well as in the regions of Mazovia (on Easter Tuesday) and Lesser Poland (beginning of May or the Green Week).\n\nThe date when the customs of drowning Marzanna and carrying the copse originated in Silesia is unknown. Although the Catholic Church considered these to be pagan traditions, and persecuted them accordingly, the custom nevertheless survived in Silesia even at times when it had been almost extinct in other regions of Poland. Researchers point out that traditionally only women and girls would walk with a hand-made Marzanna; only later was the custom taken over by young adults and children. In some regions – such as around Gliwice and Racibórz – local girls were followed by boys carrying Marzanna's male equivalent – Marzaniok. The effigies were carried around the village. Songs, often improvised, were sung in front of each house, especially if a girl lived in it. Hosts would reward the singers with money or eggs. Afterwards, the singing procession left the village and went to a nearby body of water – a stream, pond, lake or even a puddle. If there was no lake or pond nearby, the effigy was burned; its clothes had been ripped off or it had been pelted with snow or mud.\n\nThe procession would usually return carrying a copse – a small spruce or pine tree adorned with eggs and ribbons. Nicknamed \"latko\" (summer), the copse symbolised the spring and blooming nature. The procession carried it into the village, accompanied by songs and best wishes.\n\nToday Marzanna is often perceived as a personification of winter and the symbolic drowning ends this season and returns life. In this interpretation, the copse is used to welcome spring and to affirm the re-awakening of nature. However, modern interpretations simplify the ritual: one example is merging two originally separate rituals and changing the time of the year at which they were celebrated. Moreover, even medieval chroniclers suggested that the custom had already evolved into a light-hearted, fun event and its original meaning had been almost forgotten.\n\nResearchers emphasise that Marzanna functioned not merely as a symbol of winter, but also as a Slavic goddess. Marzanna's later association with death (in some regions Marzanna is called Death Crone) trivialized the importance of the goddess, who was the lady of not only death, but also life, and commanded the natural world.\n\nDrowning Marzanna in water (an element of high importance in season-related folk celebrations) is understood as the goddess' symbolic descent into the underworld, to be reborn with next winter. Some researchers underline the sacrificial character of this ritual and suggest that Marzanna is sacrificed in order to appease Winter. The authors of \"Wyrzeczysko\" propose that Marzanna is sacrificed to the demons of water, whose favour was necessary to ensure a plentiful harvest in the coming year.\n\nCelebrating the Copse after Easter – in full spring – performs an individual function in the cycle of rebirth: it announces the coming of spring, a time of joy and song, a time when the Earth bears new fruit.\n\nA Polish black metal band, Furia, has released an album under the title \"Marzannie, Królowej Polski\" \"(To Marzanna, the Queen of Poland)\".\n\nA Russian folk metal band Arkona sings about Марена on their album entitled Lepta.\n\nIn the 2016 BBC television series Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency holistic assassin Bartine \"Bart\" Curlish is designated \"Project Marzanna\" by Project Blackwing.\n\nVirginian brewery Devils Backbone brew a 14° Czech style dark lager named in honour of Marzanna, using her Czech name Morana.\n\n\n"}

The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam (brothel proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a problem play, offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel \"Cashel Byron's Profession\", about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities.\n\nThe story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current brothel owner, is described as \"on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old blackguard of a woman.\" Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life. The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in Victorian Britain.\n\nVivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.\n\n\nShaw said he wrote the play \"to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together.\"\n\nHe explained the source of the play in a letter to the \"Daily Chronicle\" on 28 April 1898:\n\nMiss Janet Achurch [an actress and friend of Shaw’s] mentioned to me a novel by some French writer [\"Yvette\" by Guy de Maupassant] as having a dramatisable story in it. It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability—one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class—not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene—which a baby could write if its sight were normal—in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, \"Cashel Byron's Profession\" (hence the title, \"Mrs Warren's Profession\"), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets.\n\nThe play was originally banned by the Lord Chamberlain (Britain's official theatre censor) because of its frank discussion of prostitution, but was finally performed on Sunday, 5 January 1902, at London's New Lyric Club with the distinguished actor-manager Harley Granville-Barker as Frank, Fanny Brough as Mrs. Warren, George Goodhart as Sir George Crofts, Julius Knight as Praed, Madge McIntosh as Vivie and Cosmo Stuart as Rev. Samuel Gardner. Members-only clubs had been a device to avoid the eye of authority, but actors often also used the opportunity to invite their fellow-artists to a private showing of a play, usually on Sundays, when theatres were closed to the public. The first public performance in London took place in 1925.\n\nA 1905 performance in New York, this time on a public stage, was interrupted by the police, who arrested the cast and crew for violating New York City's version of the Comstock laws. It was later held not to be in violation of the law, and has been revived on Broadway five times since.\n\nThe play has been twice revived by the National Theatre, first in 1970-71 at the Old Vic, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Coral Browne and Sarah Badel, and more recently at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1985-86, directed by Anthony Page, with Joan Plowright and Jessica Turner as Mrs Warren and Vivie.\n\nThe Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario has mounted the play five times since the Festival's inception in 1962: 1976, 1990, 1997, 2008, and 2016 \n\nIn 2006, it was revived off-broadway by The Irish Repertory Theatre, with Dana Ivey as Mrs. Warren, Laura Odeh as Vivie Warren, and David Staller as Mr. Praed. \n\nThe play was revived in 2010 in three separate venues:\n\n\nIt was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 2012, and was so popular that the season was extended.\n\nIn 2016 the play was performed at the Center Theatre in Seattle.\n\nIn 2018, Eleanor Bishop's adaptation of the play was performed at the ASB Waterfront Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand by the Auckland Theatre Company.\n\nSir Harry Johnston wrote a sequel, a novel entitled \"Mrs. Warren's Daughter\", circa 1920.\n\nA 1960 German film adaption, \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\", starred Lilli Palmer.\n\nBBC Television produced a television version first broadcast on 3 October, 1972 on BBC2 under the 'Stage 2' drama strand. Produced by Cedric Messina and directed by Herbert Wise, it starred Coral Browne in the title role, with Penelope Wilton as Vivie. Also in the cast were James Grout, Robert Powell, Richard Pearson and Derek Godfrey. Under the \"Play of the Month\" strand, the production was repeated on BBC1 on 21 April, 1974. The production was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nA radio adaptation was broadcast on the BBC in 2002, and re-broadcast in January 2009 on BBC Radio 7, starring Maggie Steed in the title role.\n\nMen who could afford to get married in the Victorian era could make use of “laws that gave him total control of his wife's person—and her fortune”. Victorian women were expected to maintain a poised and dignified manner, and to obey their husbands. Vivie defies the Victorian expectations of an obedient woman: she is educated and entirely self-sufficient. She rejects two marriage proposals, reflecting her reliance on her work ethic and hard-headed approach to life. Shaw represents Vivie as the product of a type of gender reformation: a character who is asexual and \"permanently unromantic\".\n\nThroughout the play, the boundary between sexual desires and proposed marriages is blurred. Frank flirts with both Mrs. Warren and Vivie; Mrs. Warren's companion Sir George Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie despite his relationship with her mother. Critic Petra Dierkes-Thrun argues that these examples illustrate the way in which Shaw \"critiqued the ideological and economic system that produced her [Mrs. Warren], attacking the problematic double standard of male privilege and the deeply entrenched objectification of women, which Shaw saw pervading all levels of Victorian society down to its most basic nuclear element, the family.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "14885290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14885290", "title": "New Philology", "text": "New Philology\n\nNew Philology generally refers to a branch of Mexican ethnohistory and philology that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by James Lockhart to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s. Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and Matthew Restall published a description of it in the \"Latin American Research Review.\" The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European medieval studies. \nLockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon. For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was Joaquín García Icazbalceta. In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard. The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation. A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.\n\nThe New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian Charles Gibson, whose \"Aztecs under Spanish Rule\" (1964) and his earlier \"Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century\" (1952) were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called Nahuas) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was James Lockhart who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the Nahuatl language. His magnum opus was published in 1992, \"The Nahuas After the Conquest.\", which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.\n\nAn early and important text in this vein was \"Nahuatl in the Middle Years\" (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist Frances Karttunen. Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of \"Beyond the Codices\" (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices. Arthur J. O. Anderson, a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with Charles Dibble in publishing an English translation of the Florentine Codex by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún, participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or \"altepetl\" of Culhuacán. In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as \"The Book of Tributes\", as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus. In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles. Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards. Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.\n\nSome UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly Matthew Restall and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation \"The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society\" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills. and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, \"The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.\" Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled \"Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca\" was followed by his 2001 monograph \"The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History\". Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used \"Aztec\" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than \"Nahua\", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.\n\nLauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their \"central premise [as] the idea that codex is not merely a neutral container for its texts.\" She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of \"textual cultures\" \"posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "992497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=992497", "title": "Pancasila (politics)", "text": "Pancasila (politics)\n\nPancasila () is the official, foundational philosophical theory of the Indonesian state. Pancasila comprises two Old Javanese words originally derived from Sanskrit: \"pañca\" (\"five\") and \"sīla\" (\"principles\"). Thus it is composed of five principles and contends that they are inseparable and interrelated:\n\n\nDesirous of uniting the diverse archipelago of Indonesia into one state in 1945, the future President Sukarno promulgated Pancasila as the foundational philosophical theory of the new Indonesian state (in Indonesian \"Dasar Negara\"). His political philosophy was fundamentally an amalgamation of elements of monotheism, nationalism, and socialism. Sukarno consistently stated that Pancasila was a philosophy of Indonesian indigenous origin that he developed under the inspiration of Indonesian historical philosophical traditions, including indigenous Indonesian, Indian Hindu, Western Christian, and Arab Islamic traditions. \"Ketuhanan\" to him was originally indigenous, while \"Kemanusiaan\" was derived from the Hindu concept of Tat Tvam Asi, the Islamic concept of \"fardhukifayah\", and the Christian concept of neighborly love. Sukarno further explained that \"Keadilan sosial\", i.e. social justice, was derived from the Javanese concept of \"Ratu Adil\", i.e., the Just Leader, being a messianic Javanese ruler who would liberate that people from all kinds of oppression. Pancasila was intended to resolve contrasting Indonesian Muslim, nationalist, and Christian priorities.\n\nThe iteration of Pancasila that Sukarno presented on 1 June 1945 to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (\"Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan\" (BPUPK)) in a speech titled \"The Birth of the Pancasila\" originally defined the Pancasila thus: \n\n\nSukarno gave the first iteration of the Pancasila in his speech of 1 June 1945 to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK), and omitted the word \"Indonesia\". The Committee of Nine (\"Panitia Sembilan\"), composed of Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Mohammad Yamin, Alexander Andries Maramis, Ahmad Subardjo, Ki Hadikusumo, Wachid Hasyim, Agus Salim, and Abikusno, formulated the second iteration of the Pancasila for the Jakarta Charter and the Preamble of the Constitution of Indonesia of 1945 by reordering their original enumeration by Sukarno thus: the fifth \"sila\" of monotheism and religiosity was promoted as the first \"sila\"; the second \"sila\" remained, the original first \"sila\" was re-numbered as the third \"sila\", and the original third and fourth \"sila\" were re-numbered as the fourth and fifth \"sila\". Sukarno accepted this proposition of the other members. Further, the first \"sila\" of the Jakarta Charter and the Preamble of the Constitution of Indonesia of 1945, being the first of the original \"sila\" of Sukarno, was amended to read \"Ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariah Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya\" (\"Belief in Almighty God with the obligation for its Muslim adherents to carry out the Islamic law/Syari'ah\"). On 18 August 1945 the BPUPK amended it further by deleting \"with the obligation for its Muslim adherents to carry out the Islamic law/Syari'ah\" and therefore left the first \"sila\" as simply \"Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa\".\n\nThe Constitution of Indonesia of 1945 defined the Pancasila as the fundamental principles of the independent Indonesian state.\n\nThe New Order administration of Suharto, the second President of Indonesia, strongly supported Pancasila. His government promoted the five principles as a key national ideology. They were outlined as representing the ancient wisdom of the Indonesian people, pre-dating the introduction of foreign religions such as Hinduism and Islam. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his attachment to Javanese beliefs, Suharto glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life (\"ilmu kasampurnaning hurip\") of harmony with God and fellow men.\n\nAfter initially being careful not to offend the sensitivities of Muslim scholars who feared that the Pancasila might develop into a quasi religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 (Tap MPR No. 11/1983) that obligated all organizations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila. He also instituted a mandatory program to indoctrinate all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers, in the Pancasila, which program was denominated \"Penataran P4\". In practice, however, the administration of Suharto exploited the vagueness of the Pancasila to justify its acts and to condemn opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".\n\nUnder Suharto political Islamists were suppressed, and religious Muslims were carefully watched by the Indonesian government. Several Christian Generals who served under Suharto like L.B. Moerdani actively persecuted religious Muslims in the Indonesian military. Their approach, described as being \"anti-Islamic\", allegedly involved denying religious Muslims promotions, preventing them from praying in barracks, and banning them from even using the Islamic greeting \"assalamu'alaikum\". These anti-Islamic policies were said to be supported by Suharto, despite Suharto being a Muslim himself, since he considered political Islam as a threat to his power. The Christian General Theo Syafei, who also served under Suharto, spoke out against political Islam coming to power in Indonesia, and insulted the Qur'an and Islam in remarks described as Islamophobic.\n\nThe formulation of Pancasila took place in the mid-20th century near the end of the Second World War. Thus, the ideology reflects the socio-political condition of the late colonial period in Indonesia and the ensuing great war. Its concept derived and synthesized from the ideas and ideals of Indonesia's founding fathers, most prominently Sukarno's. The historical period that influenced Indonesia's founding fathers, was the socio-political conditions of Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century all the way to the outbreak of the Second World War. \n\nBy the first half of 20th century, some ideologies had been established or made their way into Dutch East Indies includes; imperialism and its antithesis anti-colonial nationalism, traditional Javanese statecraft, Islamism, democracy, socialism and communism. Proponents of these ideologies had formed political organization or party to forward their cause. Islamist Sarekat Islam was established in 1905 followed by Masyumi in 1943. Communist Party was established in 1914, while Sukarno's nationalist Indonesian National Party was established in 1927. Favouring one ideology over another would not satisfy the whole components of Indonesian people, thus it was decided that the new republic need to compose a new ideology derived from indigenous Indonesian values as well as common shared values derived from various ideologies.\n\nIndonesia is a multicultural nation, a diverse country composed of numbers of ethnic groups with different languages, culture, religions and way of life. The founding fathers had decided that the state ideology should encompass and shelter the whole spectrum of Indonesian society, in which consensus for common good must be strived to achieve and justice is served and satisfied. As the result, Pancasila is often viewed as a form of pluralism and moderation, a potpourri of different ideologies, ranging from the socialist, nationalist to religiosity. \n\nSome compromises were made during the formation of Pancasila to satisfy elements of Indonesian society. For example, despite its overwhelming Muslim population, Indonesia did not adopt political Islam nor proclaim Islam as its official religion. Other than Islam, Indonesia also recognizes several world religions: \n\n\nThe adoption of Indonesian instead of Javanese as the national language had practical value as a lingua franca and reduced concerns about favoring the Javanese majority.\n\nPancasila was influenced and copied some aspects of world's values and ideologies, including nationalism, humanity, democracy, socialism and religiosity. The need to unify this diverse country also has led to the formulation of the national motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, which can be translated as unity in diversity. It declares the essential unity of its members despite ethnic, regional, social or religious differences.\n\nIn 1945, during the formation of Pancasila, there was much debate between nationalists who called for a pluralistic state and Islamists who wanted a religious state ruled by Islamic law or sharia. The nation's founders chose religious tolerance. Pancasila encourage its proponent to practice moderation and toleration, thus radicalism and extremism are discouraged. In order to live harmoniously in a plural society, one's membership to a religious, ethnic or social group does not mean that they could dominate, discriminate or be prejudiced in their relations with other groups.\n\nThe International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) has criticized the first \"sila\" because it does not define a right to atheism, i.e., a rejection of theistic belief, and enables a culture of repression against atheists. The IHEU argued that as long as Indonesian law only recognized the religions of Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Protestantism, and the Roman Catholic Church, persons who did not identify with any of them, including atheists, would \"continue to experience official discrimination.\" \n\nSimilar to the controversy surrounding the United States Pledge of Allegiance's wording, the sila has been employed as a tool to repress against people falling outside of the government's classification system. Additionally, LGBT people are also routinely attacked under the guise of enforcing it in the courts and in other public spheres by organizations of all positions on the political spectrum and even by (at the time) a sitting Supreme Court justice, Patrialis Akbar.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The papal slippers were a form of episcopal sandals worn by bishops. However, unlike the (rarely seen) episcopal sandals, which change with the liturgical colour, the papal slippers were always red.\n\nUsually elaborate, papal slippers were made by hand with red satin, red silk, and gold thread; they featured an embroidered cross garnished with rubies and the soles were made of leather. Until the first half of the 20th century, it was customary for pilgrims having an audience with the Pope to kneel and kiss one of his slippers.\n\nThe pope traditionally wore the slippers inside the papal residence, while red leather papal shoes were worn outdoors. Pope Paul VI discontinued the use of the papal slippers but continued to wear the red outdoor papal shoes, which were abandoned by Pope John Paul II in favour of cordovan brown leather walking shoes made in his native Poland. \n\nPope Benedict XVI restored the use of the red outdoor papal shoes, similar to those worn by Paul VI. However, it would seem that the papal slippers have not been restored as photographs of Benedict show him wearing red shoes inside the confines of the Vatican.

{"id": "12737141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12737141", "title": "Pasma", "text": "Pasma\n\nPasma (from Spanish \"espasmo\") refers to a \"folk illness\" unique to the Filipino culture that is said to be most commonly brought about by exposure of \"cold\" and water in many forms: water is believed to facilitate the unhealthy coldness that enters the body in the Filipino culture. There are distinct signs, symptoms, perceived causes and treatments which are recognized in the folk medicine of the Philippines, but these are not described in medical textbooks, discussed in medical schools, or generally recognized by contemporary medical science. Although, these symptoms have been perceived and testified as verifiable by Filipinos who have experienced sickness after a long hard day of work and abruptly taking a cold shower. \n\nUniversity of the Philippines anthropologist Michael Tan points out:\nI've been lecturing in several medical schools for several years now and I keep urging health professionals to be more inquisitive about these illnesses because even if these are not recognized by mainstream medicine, the ailments are very real as far as people are concerned, causing suffering and may even be cited as the cause of death, as in the case of \"bangungot.\"\n\nAlongside numerous diseases recognized by Filipino folk medicine, pasma is attributed to an interaction of \"init\" (heat) and \"lamig\" (cold). Under certain conditions, the body's muscles (kalamnan) are said to be \"hot\" and should not be too quickly brought into contact with \"cold,\" in this case usually meaning cold water or air conditioner.\n\nThe most common symptoms of pasma are hand tremors, sweaty palms, numbness and pains. \"Pasma\" is thus very different from the Spanish term from which it takes its root: \"espasmo\", which means \"spasm.\"\n\nAside from the traditional cause of \"init\" and \"lamig,\" which is a traditional concept sufficiently intact in the contemporary Philippine psyche to be accepted, alone as a cause for pasma, some correlation has been noted with diseases already recognized by contemporary medicine. For example, symptoms of pasma are similar to those found in people with diabetes mellitus\nand thyroid dysfunction. It has also been suggested that the complaints are often neurological in nature and may be linked to some kind of nervous dysfunction.There are several ways that a person is believed to be able to prevent Pasma. These include avoiding tiresome, repetitive movements of the upper extremities, showering and bathing in the morning, and avoiding washing clothes after ironing. Folkloric treatments for Pasma include massages using ginger, coconut oil, alcohol, garlic, and camphor oil. Soaking in lukewarm salted water or rice water is believed to cure Pasma, as well is Pasmang-bituka, a daily salted decoction of solasi (Holy basil).\n\n\n"}

It is generally built to represent the spiritual connection between the tribe and their ancestors and thus each poupou is carved with emblems of the tohunga whakairo’s (carver's) particular lineage. The poupou may also be decorated with representations of the tribe's ancestral history, legends and migration stories to New Zealand. As such each wharenui, and by extension the poupou, are thus treated with the utmost respect, as if it were an ancestor.\n\nFor Māori the ability to carve wooden crafts is both a spiritual and intellectual endeavour.\n\nThe tohunga whakairo had to be well versed in his tribal lineage and history to carve something that was commemorative of his ancestors. At the same time particularly amongst the traditionalists, he had to be cognizant of the proper protocols. For example, in traditional times, the tohunga whakairo never blew the shavings of his work or the ancestors would curse the piece. In other instances, if he allowed women or food near his work the mana (spiritual power) would be destroyed.\n\nIn the contemporary period Māori carvers have struggled to maintain the same traditional protocol in a state that has become increasingly Westernised. As a result, today, many Māori have made an attempt to resurge traditional patterns and carvings within mainstream art through programs like the Māori Arts and Crafts Institute. They have made it their mission to preserve traditional toi whakairo, and have opened various programs and classes to pass their traditions to younger generations.\n\nAccording to Sidney Mead’s \"The Art of Carving\", there are three classical styles typically used in Māori carvings:\n\n\n\n\nThe poupou at the Royal Ontario Museum was made in the nineteenth century. It was built in the style of the Te Ati Awa people of the North Island of New Zealand. It has a dark brown complexion rather than the traditional black, white and red pigments.\n\nIt is currently being displayed in the Oceania exhibit on the third floor of the Royal Ontario Museum. It is housed amongst various other Polynesian, Micronesian, and Australian indigenous artifacts like tapa or siapo cloths and Polynesian weaponry.\n\n"}
{"id": "9200386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9200386", "title": "Pyebaek", "text": "Pyebaek\n\nPyebaek is a Korean wedding custom that is traditionally held a few days after the official ceremony, with only family members present. The ceremony begins with the older couple seated on cushions behind a table in front of a painted screen, with the newlyweds opposite them. The newlyweds perform a deep bow which begins standing and ends with the newlyweds pressing their foreheads to their hands while kneeling on the floor. The bride may present the groom's parents with jujubes (Korean dates) and chestnuts, which symbolize children. A variation will have the newlyweds offering cups of wine, usually cheongju. The bride offers the cup to the father, and the groom offers the cup to the mother. Sometimes the parents will then also offer the newlyweds cups of cheongju or \"soju\". The older couple then shares some wisdom on marriage from their advanced experience. Finally they will throw the jujubes and chestnuts back at the bride, who has to try catching them with her wedding skirt.\n\nIn the United States, this ritual is held a few days before the ceremony. The bride may also receive gifts of money in white envelopes.\n\nModern Korean weddings have incorporated the Pyebaek ceremony after the reception. The original Pyebaek was exclusively for the groom's side of the family to be introduced to the new family member, the bride. In current day Korean weddings, they have also allowed for the Pyebaek ceremony to be with the brides side of the family also.\n\nCommercial services exist to assist those unfamiliar with how the ceremony is performed.\n\nIt is said in ancient Korean customs that one must have a bachelor party in every month leading up to the wedding day, with each month's gathering successively greater than the last for fortune, health, and wisdom will be brought to those who attend, their families, to the bachelor, and lifelong youthfulness and beauty to the lovely bride.\n\nYoungHee Kim and Sung-Yeon Park, professors at Bowling Green State University, view the resurgence of this traditional wedding practice as an example of reverse acculturation and cultural integration in which individuals both adapt to a new culture while maintaining a connection to the native culture. By adding the Pyebaek ceremony to their wedding festivities, Korean-Americans, whether they are marrying another individual of Korean heritage or not, have begun to introduce their heritage culture into the mainstream culture of the United States.\n\n"}

The book was published by Tor Books in June 2012. The audiobook of the novel is narrated by Wil Wheaton. The book won the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Novel and Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\n\nIn the prologue, several senior officers of the \"Intrepid\", flagship of the Universal Union, lament the unusually high number of casualties of low-ranking crew members during recent away missions and conclude that they will need more crewmen to replace them.\n\nDocking at a spaceport, the \"Intrepid\" takes on five new ensigns including Andrew Dahl, an expert in alien religions and xenobiology; Dahl quickly discerns that the crew is extremely phobic of being near the senior officers and of going on away missions due to their unusually high fatality rate. Over the course of several away missions, various crew members suggest that the deaths are due to incompetence, superstition, or cosmic forces, requiring “sacrifices” of some crew members so that others will survive.\n\nAfter several close calls, Dahl meets Jenkins, a crew member who offers a different theory: their reality and timeline are under periodic influence of a badly written television show from the past. As the writers create the plot, characters' free will temporarily ceases in order to progress “the Narrative” of the show. This is why otherwise good officers occasionally seem incompetent, Ensigns make poor decisions, and the ship has mysterious technology on board to produce last-minute inventions and medicines which would otherwise be impossible to produce. Jenkins explains that with Dahl and the other Ensigns' otherwise routine duties, their colorful histories will inevitably make them targets of \"the narrative\" when the writers need \"glorified extras\" to kill for emotional impact.\n\nThe Ensigns kidnap a senior officer and proceed to travel to the past with the mission of convincing them to stop the show. Once there, they meet their actor doubles and realize that they are exact parallels, down to their scars and skin blemishes. Even their imagined backstories became integral events of the Ensigns’ lives. Using this to their advantage, Dahl strikes a deal with the show’s producer and head writer, who happens to be Jenkins’ double, to save the life of the producer's comatose son by switching him with his crew member doppelgänger. Because the producer’s son appeared on the show as an extra, one of the crew members is effectively his identical twin, and will revert to the young man’s personality by staying in the past. Conversely, Dahl reasons that bringing the comatose son into the future will allow them to use \"the Narrative\" to their advantage, letting the advanced technology and reality-altering properties of the writing revive him.\n\nDahl and the Ensigns return to the future and live out the new revised plot created by the head writer, which includes saving the “injured crewman” they had on board. While saving the ship, Dahl sacrifices himself to save a senior officer for the sake of the narrative. Awakening later, Dahl receives a message from the writers and producers explaining his recovery, and they promise to make the lives of the crew meaningful instead of using death as a quick plot device. Dahl then compares the close calls he has had with those of the TV show's protagonists, and deduces that there is another narrative protecting him, which means that he is actually the protagonist of another story. \n\nThe novel features three epilogues. In the first one the head writer deals with writer's block as a consequence of his bad writing choices. In the second one the producer’s son, having reverted to his personality from the crewman who switched with him, determines to do something useful with the second chance at life he's been given. In the third one an actress, who once played an extra on the show, receives a message showing intimate details of the woman whose life—and death—she helped create. She memorializes her lost “sister” on a beach and meets the head writer of the show, with both realizing that their characters on the show were married.\n\nNew Recruits on the \"Intrepid\":\n\nSenior officers of \"Intrepid\" and protagonists of the TV show:\n\nOther crew in the \"Intrepid\":\n\nTV show cast and crew: \n\nThe novel satirises the tropes of redshirt and black box in television science fiction writing.\n\nThe novel won the RT Reviewer's Choice Award for 2012, the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and the Geffen Award for Best Translated Science Fiction Novel.\n\nJohn Schwartz of the \"New York Times\" noted that the plight of the Ensigns as they realize their situation as characters in a television drama as similar to \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\", where the story tells what happens when its characters find out they are not in the \"real\" storyline. \"Forbes\" magazine praised the novel saying \"You don’t have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to enjoy Redshirts, though there are plenty of Easter Eggs for those who are. And the beauty of the book is that it works on multiple levels. If you’re looking for a breezy, fun read for the beach, this is your book. If you want to go down a level and read it as a surreal meditation on character and genre like \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\", this is your book.\"\n\nThe book is being developed into a TV limited series on FX.\n\n"}

The written form is also called Chancery Slavonic by Lithuanian and Western European linguists.\n\nScholars do not agree whether Ruthenian was a separate language, or a Western dialect or set of dialects of Old East Slavic, but it is agreed that Ruthenian has a close genetic relationship with it. Old East Slavic was the colloquial language used in Kievan Rus' (10th–13th centuries). Ruthenian is seen as a predecessor of modern Belarusian, Rusyn and Ukrainian. Indeed, all these languages, from Old East Slavic to Rusyn, have been labelled as \"Ruthenian\" () at some point in history.\n\nIn modern texts, the language in question is sometimes called \"Old Ukrainian\" or \"Old Belarusian\" () and (). As Ruthenian was always in a kind of diglossic opposition to Church Slavonic, this vernacular language was and still is often called \"prosta(ja) mova\" (Cyrillic проста(я) мова), literally \"simple speech\".\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Europe gradually freed itself from the \"Tatar yoke\" in the 14th century, 2 separate mainly East Slavic states emerged: the Grand Duchy of Moscow (Muscovy), which eventually evolved into the Tsardom of Russia and subsequently the Russian Empire; the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia. Many of Ruthenic lands conquered by the Lithuanians were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which covered roughly the territories of modern Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, and western Russia, and later united with Poland to form the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Linguistically, both states continued to use the regional varieties of the literary language of Kievan Rus', but due to the immense Polish influence in the west and to the Church Slavonic influence in the east, they gradually developed into two distinct literary languages: Ruthenian in Lithuania and the Commonwealth, and (Old) Russian in Muscovy. Both were usually called \"Ruskij\" (of Rus’) or \"Slovenskij\" (Slavonic); only when a differentiation between the literary language of Muscovy and the one of Lithuania was needed was the former called \"Moskovskij\" 'Muscovite' (and, rarely, the latter \"Lytvynskij\" 'Lithuanian').\n\nThis linguistic difference is confirmed by the need for translators during the mid-17th-century negotiations for the Treaty of Pereyaslav, between Bohdan Khmelnytsky, ruler of the Zaporozhian Host, and the Tsardom of Russia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27754", "title": "Samaritanism", "text": "Samaritanism\n\nSamaritan religion is the national religion of the Samaritans. The Samaritans follow the Samaritan Torah, which the Samaritans believe to be the original unchanged Torah, as opposed to the Torah used by Jews. In addition to the Samaritan Torah, Samaritans also revere their version of the Book of Joshua and recognize some of the Biblical figures such as Eli.\n\nSamaritanism is internally described as the religion that began with Moses, unchanged over the millennia that have since passed. Samaritans believe Judaism, as well as the Jewish Torah, has been corrupted by time and thus is no longer serving the duties God mandated on Mount Sinai. Additional differences with Judaism center on the place of worship which in Samaritanism is recognized as Mount Gerizim in Samaria, as opposed to Mount Moriya in Judea within Judaism.\n\nSamaritanism holds that the summit of Mount Gerizim is the true location of God's Holy Place, as opposed to the Foundation Stone on the Temple Mount as Judaism teaches. As such, Samaritans trace their history as a separate entity from the Jews back to the time of Moses, where they believe Joshua laid the foundation for their temple. Samaritan historiography traces the schism itself to the High Priest Eli abandoning Moses' Tabernacle in favor of Mount Gerizim following Joshua's death.\n\nAbu l-Fath, who in the 14th century wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:\n\nFurther, the \"Samaritan Chronicle Adler\", or New Chronicle, believed to have been composed in the 18th century using earlier chronicles as sources states:\n\nSamaritanism emerged as an independent ethnic culture following its survival of the Assyrian captivity in the 8th century BC. Jewish sources attest their own narrative of the origins of the Samaritans. From here there are conflicting proposals, including the Samaritans being the people of Kutha described in the Talmud. The traditional Jewish narrative, formed based off 2 Kings and Josephus, details the people of Israel were removed by the king of the Assyrians (Sargon II) to Halah, to Gozan on the Khabur River and to the towns of the Medes. The king of the Assyrians then brought people from Babylon, Kutha, Avah, Emath, and Sepharvaim to place in Samaria. Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the new settlers about God's ordinances. The eventual result was that the new settlers worshiped both the God of the land and their own gods from the countries from which they came. However, genetic studies showed the Samaritans are almost definitely descendants of the historical Israelite population, albeit isolated given the people's reclusive history. This casts doubt into, if not totally disproves, this historical theory that Samaritans originated from Assyria.\n\nFurthermore, the Dead Sea scroll 4Q372, which recounts the hope that the northern tribes will return to the land of Joseph, remark that the current dwellers in the north are referred to as fools, an enemy people, but are not referred to as foreigners. It goes on to say that these people, the Samaritans, mocked Jerusalem and built a temple on a high place (Gerizim) to provoke Israel.\n\nConflict between the Samaritans and the Jews were numerous between the end of the Assyrian diaspora and to the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Tanakh describes multiple instigations from the Samaritan population against the Jews and disparages them, Jesus' Parable of the Good Samaritan also gives evidence of conflict. The destruction of Mount Gerizim's Samaritan temple is attributed to the High Priest John Hyrcanus.\n\nFollowing the failed revolts, Mount Gerizim was rededicated with a new temple, which was ultimately again destroyed during the Samaritan Revolts. Persecution of Samaritans was common in the following centuries.\n\nThe principle beliefs of Samaritanism are as follows:\n\nThe Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the Ancient Hebrew script, a High Priesthood, the slaughtering and eating of lambs on Passover eve, and the celebration of the first month's beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru'ah (the Biblical name for \"Rosh Hashanah\"), at the beginning of Tishrei, is not considered a New Year as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the Jewish Masoretic Text as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is \"the place that God \"has chosen\"\" to establish His name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to \"the place that God \"chooses\"\". Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.\n\nPassover is particularly important in the Samaritan community, climaxing with the sacrifice of up to 40 sheep. The Counting of the Omer remains largely unchanged; however, the week before Shavuot is a unique festival celebrating the continued commitment Samaritanism has maintained since the time of Moses. Shavuot is characterized by nearly day-long services of continuous prayer, especially over the stones on Gerizim traditionally attributed to Joshua. During Sukkot, the sukkah is built inside houses as opposed to traditional outdoor settings. The restrictions of Yom Kippur are more universal in Samaritanism, with even breastfeeding and the feeding of children being disallowed, and the separation of gender during services is never enforced.\n\nSamaritan law differs from Halakha (Rabbinic Jewish law) and other Jewish movements. The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:\n\n"}

Typically, a \"slide library\" contains slides depicting artwork, architecture, or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of art history, architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as biology and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as \"Visual Resources Collections,\" as they may be responsible for all \"visual\" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:\n\nMany educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging & AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously cataloged and inventoried slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, digitized slides and placed them online via content management systems. \n\nThe first American lantern slide collections, developed by museums to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: DePauw University, Columbia University, Oberlin College, Princeton University, University of Rochester. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.\n\nThe first illustrated architectural history course west of the Mississippi was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the University of California, Berkeley in 1905. The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at MIT and Cornell at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides. In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3\"x 4.25\".\n\nThe 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film. Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2\"x2\" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.\n\nThe heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960. The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.\n\n1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25\" x 4.0\" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required lime light which was dirty and dangerous\n1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed\n1888. First perforated film stock developed\n1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock\n1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film\n\n1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, \"A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method\"\n\n1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust\n1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography\n1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film\n1930. Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)\n1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle\n1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base\n1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets\n\n1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides\n\n1968. Visual resources curators begin meeting during annual College Art Association (CAA) conferences\n1969.

Soap dishes are usually located in or near a sink, shower, or bathtub. Most soap dishes are made from waterproof materials such as plastic, ceramic, metal, or glass, though some are made from bamboo. A china saucer or sponge may serve as a soap dish. A soap dish accommodates bar soap, whereas a soap dispenser accommodates liquid soap or foam soap.\n\nElements in the design of a soap dish include safety, ventilation, cleanliness, placement, aesthetics, and cost. When a soap dish is part of a bath accessories set, coordinated group design may be utilized. Notable soap dish designs include Leonard L Hierath's May 2018 US Patent #US-9962042 Article Support (soap dish) US Patent and Trademark Office; Robert A. Pitton's 1956 US patent for a reversible, hemispherical soap dish and Bernard Cohen's October 2017 design for the \"SoapAnchor\" (patent pending).\n\nBecause of their intended use in wet and potentially hazardous environments, most soap dishes are designed with safety in mind. Such features include unbreakable materials, non-slip surfaces, rounded edges, and secure installation elements (e.g., wall mount hardware, a suction cup, or non-skid feet). Depositing or retrieving a slippery bar of soap is facilitated by an open (or semi-open) sided design or by a shallow lip.\n\nA bar of wet soap relies on ventilation to dry. A number of design elements may be used to increase ambient airflow around the soap, including vented surfaces or surfaces interspersed with bumps, ridges, or slats. Mechanical ventilation has not yet become a widespread design element in soap dishes.\n\nBecause of their association with hand washing and hygiene, soap dishes themselves are often the focus of cleanliness. To aid in cleanup, some self-draining soap dishes are designed to allow soapy residue to collect in a compartment below the raised bar of soap. Other such soap dishes funnel the soapy reside directly to the adjacent sink or bathtub, necessitating strategic placement of the soap dish.\n\nMost soap dishes are standalone accessories whose placement is at the user's discretion, though some are a built-in feature of a sink, shower, or bathtub. Standalone soap dishes may be entirely portable or may include options for semi-permanent or permanent installation on a horizontal or vertical surface. Locating a soap dish outside the perimeter of a faucet's or showerhead's stream helps the soap to avoid excess erosion.\n\nThough utilitarian in purpose, soap dishes may be given aesthetic treatment. A soap dish in the form of a whale, for example, was patented in 1961 by Sonia Adelson, with \"the mouth portion thereof being adapted to receive and dispense a bar of soap in an amusing, novel and useful manner\". Another example is the \"Bodoni Soap Dish\", a February 2013 design by David Strauss that was inspired by the legacy of Massimo Vignelli.\n\nA soap dish played a role in a seminal event in the 7th century when Byzantine Emperor Constans II (630-668) was assassinated with one.\n\nA classified ad that appeared on 25 March 1820 in the \"Sydney [Australia] Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser\" lists auction items that include soap dishes. The Oxford English Dictionary gives a later \"first evidence of use\" for the term \"soap-dish\" as 1837 (in \"The Pickwick Papers\" by Charles Dickens).\n\nA pewter soap dish made in Meriden, Connecticut between 1807 and 1835 is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. An 1887 medical journal discusses an operating table that includes a built-in soap dish and an 1892 book on industrial arts shows a soap dish attachment for a scrub bucket. A toy porcelain soap dish likely from the 1890s was unearthed by archaeologist Laurie A. Wilkie at the Oakley Plantation in Louisiana. Wilkie explains in detail the facts surrounding this soap dish that led her to interpret it to be \"a little material embodiment of someone's love for a child\". By the late 19th century, Sears Roebuck & Company was influencing the spread of the soap dish in American households.\n\nA pocket-sized metal soap dish emblazoned with two crossed swords that was in use during World War I (1914-1918) is in the special collections of the Pritzker Military Museum & Library. In 1919, Witter Bynner immortalized a soap dish in his poem entitled \"I Evade,\" which is reproduced here in its entirety: \"The look in your eyes / Was as soft as the underside of soap in a soap-dish … / And I left before you could love me.\"\n\nA gold-plated soap dish was one of over 60 artifacts from Saddam Hussein's private airport and palace that were returned to Iraq by the US government in March 2015 as part of an Iraqi national project to preserve its cultural heritage.\n\n"}
{"id": "38131533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38131533", "title": "Studies of Waldorf education", "text": "Studies of Waldorf education\n\nA number of national, international and topic-based studies have been made of Waldorf education. In 2005, British educational researchers Philip Woods, Martin Ashley and Glenys Woods evaluated Steiner-Waldorf schools for the United Kingdom's Department for Education and Skills. As part of their study, the authors evaluated the state of research as of 2005 and said\n\nA 2003 study conducted by David Jelinek and Li-Ling Sun, both of the College of Education at CalState - Sacramento, investigated empirically the quality of science education at a series of Waldorf schools. They also examined the curriculum of the first Waldorf school as designed by Rudolf Steiner. These curricula were evaluated in comparison to the the traditional criteria of Experiential learning, Developmentalism, Spiral curriculum, Triarchic intelligence, and Multiple intelligences. The authors also used a number of cognitive and academic tests to evaluate the performance of Waldorf-educated students in comparison to age-matched public school-educated peers. Attempts were made to remove the influence of researcher bias by involving analysts with no prior Waldorf background and by using multiple methods to gather quantitative and qualitative data, which was then analyzed using a variety of different statistical measures including central tendency, variability, frequency distributions, correlations, regression, t-tests and chi-square tests. \n\nThe results of Jelinek and Sun's study are complex. For one, it became clear to the study authors early on that Waldorf schools do not match the national standards for science education well. That being said, they also described that there were some benefits of a Waldorf education in terms of open-ended thinking and inquiry. Even so, there were numerous theories and ideas prevalent throughout the curricula studied that were patently pseudoscientific and steeped in magical thinking. These ideas included the evolutionary idea that animals develop from humans, that human spirits are physically incarnated into \"soul qualities that manifested themselves into various animal forms,\" that the current geological formations on Earth have evolved through so-called \"Lemurian\" and \"Atlantiean\" epochs, or that the 4 kingdoms of nature are \"mineral, plant, animal, and man.\" All of these are directly contradicted by mainstream scientific knowledge and have no basis in any form of conventional science. The authors contend that these notions are distinct from any factual inaccuracies found in modern public school textbooks, as the inaccuracies in the latter are of a specific and minute nature that results from the progress of science. The latter (those inaccuracies present in Waldorf textbooks), however, are the result of a mode of thinking that has no valid basis in reason or logic.\n\nA 2012 study compared the reading and math standardized test scores obtained in public Waldorf schools in the United States with scores for their districts as a whole, as well as scores in matched comparison schools. Public Waldorf school scores were lower than those of regular public schools in earlier grades (second and third), but higher in seventh and eighth grade. The authors suggested that \"the Waldorf experience provided a slower academic build-up resulting in poorer test scores in the lower grades followed by higher levels of advanced performance in the 8th grade.\" The authors concluded that a content analysis of parents' comments about the schools supports the impression that public Waldorf schools offer a more holistic approach to education, \"with greater emphasis on the arts, community and developmentally appropriate practice.\" \n\nA 2012 study of Waldorf pupils in Germany concluded that, in comparison to state school pupils, Waldorf students are significantly more enthusiastic about learning, report having more fun and being less bored in school, more often feel individually met, and learn more from school about their personal academic strengths. 85% of the Waldorf students reported that their school environment was pleasant and supportive, compared to 60% of the state school students. More than twice as many Waldorf students report having good relationships with teachers. Waldorf pupils also have significantly less physical ailments such as headaches, stomach aches, or disrupted sleep. There was no statistically significant difference between the state and Waldorf pupils’ achievement on state examinations; this is also true when test scores are compared based on the type of high school diploma granted.\n\nA 2009 PISA study found that, compared to state school students, European Waldorf students are significantly more capable in the sciences, slightly less capable in mathematics; and comparable in reading ability.\n\nA 2009 study comparing Waldorf and public school students in New Zealand found that the Waldorf students, who had no formal instruction in reading in pre-school or kindergarten, caught up in reading ability by around age 10, at which point there was \"no difference in reading achievement between children who had been given early instruction in reading and those who had not\". \n\nA 2008 report by the Cambridge-based \"Primary Review\", found that \"educational alternatives, including Steiner-Waldorf schools and home schooling, produce better academic results.\"\n\nA 2006 PISA study of Austrian students found that Austrian Waldorf students are above average in science. The Waldorf students did best in understanding the questions raised by science and the ability to solve scientific problems and were also above the OECD average for their joy and interest in science. The authors concluded \"The relatively high expertise in science among Waldorf students, in combination with their very high motivation and interest in these subjects, as well as the various pedagogical principles, suggest that regular schools can learn from the Waldorf schools, particularly with regard to concrete application to the sciences.\"\n\nStudies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an \"anthroposophic lifestyle\" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, and antipyretics.\n\nA UK Department for Education and Skills report noted significant differences in curriculum and pedagogical approach between Waldorf/Steiner and mainstream schools and suggested that each type of school could learn from the other type's strengths: in particular, that state schools could benefit from Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.\n\nA major quantitative and qualitative study of senior secondary students in the three largest Steiner schools in Australia was undertaken by Jennifer Gidley in the mid-1990s. It investigated the Steiner-educated students’ views and visions of the future, replicating a major study with a large cross-section of mainstream and other private school students undertaken a few years prior. The findings as summarised below contrasted markedly in some areas with the research from mainstream students at the time.\n\n\nIn 2008, the Rudolf Steiner Schools Association of Australia funded a research project to investigate the relationships between Steiner pedagogy and related 21st century academic discourses. The report on the project is called \"Turning Tides: Creating Dialogue between Rudolf Steiner and 21st Century Academic Discourses\". A bibliography of all the studies that were identified is also available online as is the extended project data.\n\nA study comparing the drawing ability of children in Steiner/Waldorf, Montessori and traditional schools concluded that \"the approach to art education in Steiner schools is conducive not only to more highly rated imaginative drawings in terms of general drawing ability and use of color but also to more accurate and detailed observational drawings,\" while another study found that Waldorf pupils average higher scores on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Ability than state-school students.\n\nAn American study found that Waldorf-educated students scored significantly higher on a test of moral reasoning than students in public high schools and students in a religiously affiliated high school. Waldorf students were also far more likely to volunteer opinions about the survey and research in general, suggesting possible improvements in the survey technique and offering alternative ways of resolving the moral dilemmas raised in the survey.\n\nThe Thomas E. Mathews Community School in Yuba County, California serves high-risk juvenile offenders, many of whom have learning disabilities. The school switched to Waldorf methods in the 1990s. A 1999 study of the school found that students had \"improved attitudes toward learning, better social interaction and excellent academic progress.\" This study identified the integration of the arts \"into every curriculum unit and almost every classroom activity\" of the school as the most effective tool to help students overcome patterns of failure. The study also found significant improvements in reading and math scores, student participation, focus, openness and enthusiasm, as well as emotional stability, civility of interaction and tenacity.\n\nA Masters degree Case Study was conducted in 1995 in South Africa entitled: \"The Rudolf Steiner approach to education: A qualitative study with particular reference to the pre-primary and primary phase of a Waldorf school in KwaZulu-Natal\". Abstract of thesis: The location of this work within the holistic world view or the symbolic science paradigm indicates that the case study approach will be most likely to maximize valid findings. The theoretical and evaluative demands of this study precluded the use of more quantitative methods. The aim was to attempt a demystification of Waldorf Education by means of in-depth interpretation and reconstruction, in other words, using descriptions which have contextual validity. The pre-primary and primary phases of a school in KwaZulu Natal was studied. The perspective of Walker using condensed fieldwork was employed. Despite the limitations of this mode of study it is hoped to give the reader an expectation of what a Waldorf School is like. \n\nKnox, C. A. (1995). \"The Rudolf Steiner approach to education: A qualitative study with particular reference to the pre-primary and primary phase of a Waldorf school in KwaZulu-Natal\".

Available P - Cecil Renaud (Main) Library (Pietermaritzburg Campus) 370.1 KNO V.1 1 Book On Shelf. 370.1 KNO V.2 1 Book On Shelf. \n\nA 1995 survey of U.S. Waldorf schools found that parents overall experienced the Waldorf schools as achieving their major aims for students, and described the education as one that \"integrates the aesthetic, spiritual and interpersonal development of the child with rigorous intellectual development\", preserving students' enthusiasm for learning so that they develop a better sense of self-confidence and self-direction. Some parents described upper grades teachers as overextended, without sufficient time to relate to parental needs and input, and wished for more open and reciprocal parent-school support. Both parents and students sometimes described colleges of teachers as being insular and unresponsive.\nThe students overall were positive about the school and its differences; experienced the school as a \"community of friends\"; and spoke of the opportunity to grow and develop through the broad range of activities offered, to learn when they were ready to learn, to develop imagination, and to come to understand the world as well as oneself. Many students spoke of the kindness of their peers and of learning to think things through clearly for themselves, not to jump to conclusions, and to remain positive in the face of problems and independent of pressure from others to think as they do. Improvements the students suggested included more after-school sports programs, more physical education classes, more preparation for standardized testing, a class in world politics and computer classes. Faculty, parents and students were united in expressing a desire to improve the diversity of the student body, especially by increasing representation of minority groups such as African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\nWaldorf students are less exposed to standardized testing; such tests are generally absent in the elementary school years. Despite this, U.S. Waldorf pupils' SAT scores have usually come above the national average, especially on verbal measures. Studies comparing students' performance on college-entrance examinations in Germany found that as a group, Waldorf graduates passed the exam at double to triple the rate of students graduating from the state education system, and that students who had attended Waldorf schools for their entire education passed at a much higher rate (40% vs. 26%) than those who only had part of their education at a Waldorf school. Educational successes of private Waldorf schools may partially reflect the social status of their students.\n"}
{"id": "19283942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19283942", "title": "Sumpong", "text": "Sumpong\n\nSumpong, in Filipino Psychology, refers to a range of short-term or temporary temperament, mood problem, or illness wherein a person withdraws affection or cheerfulness from people in general.\n\nThe behavior roots from Filipino culture, therefore the term has no English equivalent, but \"having a bad day,\" \"temperament problem,\" \"mood,\" \"tantrum,\" \"neurosis\" and even \"chronic illness\" may be considered close translations, depending on the context.\nSumpong is usually manifested by those who were not able to sleep well. There is the absence of a cheerful behavior, and its expression is almost entirely nonverbal. These manifestations include:\n\nThese are usually efforts to get the offending party to go away, and if these behaviors do not work, the person with \"sumpong\" might choose to escalate them - foot stomping, door slamming, and shouting, for example.\nWhile these external manifestations may indeed sound like a temperament or mood problem in the western sense, the underlying cultural reason for them is what sets \"sumpong\" apart. While tantrums and moodiness have strong negative connotations in western countries, \"sumpong \" is understandable among Filipinos. In fact, \"sumpong\" has positive connotations for the Filipino aside from the obvious negatives ones. Having \"sumpong\" is a manifestation of being able to feel and not being too passive.\n\nLike \"tampo\", the cultural behavior \"sumpong\" roots from the nonconfrontational nature of Filipino culture. That is to say, it is a way of expressing hurt feelings in a culture where the direct expression of anger or resentment is discouraged. The withdrawal behaviors in \"sumpong\" are indirect ways of expressing hostility or resentment.\n\nIt can also be seen as a way by which Filipinos \"save face,\" as direct confrontation is usually a threat to \"smooth interpersonal relationships\" (SIR), which is a deeply valued in Philippine society.\n\nThe basic expectation of one who meets a person with \"sumpong\" is to go away or to refrain from jesting with the person. One way of dealing with a person with \"sumpong\" is to respond to the person with the mood problem with friendly overtures or expressions of concern. Not to do this may, however, cause spontaneous healing (\"nawala na ang sumpong\") after a short \"cooling off\" period. In most cases of \"sumpong\", healing the inner, emotional relationship between two people is usually more critical than resolving the issue itself.\n\nLike other Asians, Filipinos believe strongly in tampo and in saving face. This is why, in response to an invitation, when a Filipino says yes, it might mean “yes”, but could mean “maybe”, or even “I don’t know.” It is often difficult for Filipinos to bring themselves to say no, and it is a good idea to confirm a dinner invitation several times to ensure that they did not say yes because they could not find a proper way to say no. Also tied to saving face are \"amor propio\", which means self-respect; and \"hiya\", which means shame. A Filipino would be thought of as lacking \"amor propio\" if, for example, they accepted criticism weakly or did not offer honored guests the proper hospitality. Hiya is felt by those whose actions are seen as socially unacceptable, and one of the ultimate insults in Philippine society is to be labeled walang-hiya, which roughly translates to being shameless. Everyone is expected to have hiya, and to win the respect of others by conforming to community norms.\n\n\n"}

In September 2003, Tuennerman celebrated the first anniversary of the tour by hosting Tales of the Cocktail, a small gathering of cocktail enthusiasts and industry professionals that included legendary bartender and writer Dale DeGroff.\n\nAfter a hiatus following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Tales of the Cocktail returned to New Orleans in 2006 and resumed operation. The event was moved up to July to avoid overlapping with the anniversary of the hurricane, and has taken place in the summer ever since.\n\nAnn Tuennerman retired from Tales of the Cocktail on September 25, 2017. Mrs. Tuennerman informed the diversity council that her husband Paul Tuennerman would be returning to work at Tales. Several members of the council resigned in protest at not being included in the decision.

It was originally serialized in 1970 as \"The Misspelled Magishun\" in \"If\" magazine.\n\nThe book is about the efforts of a stranded astronaut to escape from a primitive world, showing how sufficiently advanced technology could be perceived as magic by its natives.\n\nThe plot concerns the efforts of an astronaut and geologist/anthropologist, known to the natives as \"Purple\", to escape from a primitive world on which he is stranded and return to his people. The events are seen from the perspective of Lant, one of the natives, who becomes, in the course of the novel, Speaker (chieftain) of his people.\n\nThe natives, a fur covered people, believe in magic and the book shows how sufficiently advanced technology would be perceived by a primitive society.\n\nPurple lands in an egg-shaped vehicle. He casually disrupts the lives of Lant's people, and thoughtlessly demeans Shoogar, the village magician. Shoogar gets revenge by destroying Purple's vehicle, which results in an atomic explosion. Many of the villagers are dead or injured: the rest, including Lant and Shoogar, are forced to flee. Purple is presumed dead.\n\nThe villagers eventually wind up on a fertile peninsula, which, as the summer approaches, is rapidly becoming an island (thanks to the influence of the two suns, the shorelines on this world are somewhat variable). To the annoyance of the existing inhabitants of the area, the villagers contrive to be trapped in the verdant area by the rising seas. The villagers are less happy when they learn that Purple is here, serving ineffectively as local magician, having succeeded the incumbent, Dorthi, by killing him by landing on him in a fall from the sky in an impact suit.\n\nLant's people wish to flee, but have nowhere to go. Lant, who becomes Speaker of the villagers more or less by default, and the local Speaker persuade the two magicians to swear to a peace treaty.\n\nPurple can call his mother ship to get him, but must return to the distant area of the old village to do so. Everyone is stranded on the island for a considerable length of time. Purple conceives the idea of fabricating a flying machine to return him to the area. He persuades his villagers (who are actually anxious to get rid of him) and Lant's, to join in the scheme.\n\nThe ship will have balloons, sails, and pedal-driven steering. A good part of the book deals with the tribulations of Purple in trying to create this work, beyond the technology of the local people. He creates 'aircloth' (a thin, airtight cloth), a rubber-equivalent, and splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. He is successful in building the ship.\n\nBut in so doing, he has changed the lives of the villagers forever. Not only do they have these new technologies, but he has created problems with crime, intoxication, the ecology, and has altered the relationship between the sexes. In addition, he has introduced money into the culture.\n\nPurple, Shoogar, Lant, and Lant's adult two sons take off for the old village. They get there, and Purple is able to summon the mother ship and depart. There is a brief epilogue---after the return home, Lant notes that a new flying machine, much larger than the first, is to be built, thus continuing the industrial revolution started by Purple.\n\nLester del Rey gave the novel a mixed review, finding the comedy of the novel's first segment incongruous with the more seriously played finish, concluding \"It's not at all a bad book -- but it isn't all a good one.\"\n\nJames Nicoll has described it as \"dreadful tosh\", and noted its \"astoundingly horrible treatment of women\".\n\nMost of the names in the book are jokes primarily dealing with the Science Fiction universe. This is known as Tuckerization. David Langford says \"Some sort of record for over-the-top Tuckerization was set by David Gerrold and Larry Niven in their very silly novel \"The Flying Sorcerers\" (1971).\" \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1844599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844599", "title": "Triplicity", "text": "Triplicity\n\nIn astrology, a triplicity is a group of three signs belonging to the same element.\n\nWestern astrology assumes that each sign of the same triplicity is 120 degrees apart, forming angles to one another called trines, which are each equivalent to the 360 degrees of the circle divided by three. Trines are considered to be very powerful and yet very comfortable, free-flowing connections. This suggests that the signs in each element are very comfortable and compatible with one another and tend to have many of the same qualities in common.\n\nIn traditional astrology, the concept of triplicity embodied several factors concerning the four classical elements and were considered of particular importance. Besides the four classical elements, two other ways triplicity could be organized were by \"rulership\" type and by \"season\". However, neither are given much attention by modern astrologers. However, astrology by season, in particular has been adopted by astrologers who practice in modern Neopaganism, Druidism and Wicca.\n\nIn traditional Western astrology there are four triplicities based on the classical elements. Beginning with the first sign Aries which is a Fire sign, the next in line Taurus is Earth, then to Gemini which is Air, and finally to Cancer which is Water -- in Western astrology the sequence is always Fire, Earth, Air, & Water in that exact order. This cycle continues on twice more and ends with the twelfth and final astrological sign, Pisces. The elemental rulerships for the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac (according to Marcus Manilius) are summarized as follows:\n\n\nIn traditional astrology, each triplicity has several planetary \"rulers,\" which change with conditions of sect--that is, whether the chart is a day chart or a night chart.\n\nTriplicity rulerships are a very important essential dignity--one of the several factors used by traditional astrologers to weigh the strength, effectiveness and integrity of each planet in a chart. Many Hellenistic astrologers (for example, Dorotheus of Sidon) considered triplicity rulership the most powerful and demonstrable of the several essential dignities of a planet.\n\nTriplicity rulerships (using the \"Dorothean system\") are as follows:\n\n<div style=\"font-size:90%\">* \"(Ptolemy later modified the rulerships of Water triplicity, making Mars the ruler of the water triplicity for both day and night charts--and William Lilly concurred.)\" </div style>\n\nOne way in which triplicity rulerships were used by earlier astrologers was to divide a person's life into three periods: early, middle, and late. The condition of the triplicity ruler that is \"in sect\" in the chart is evaluated when considering the tenor of the early part of life; the ruler out of sect is examined for the middle of life; and the last third of life is evaluated by looking at the condition of the participating triplicity ruler. \"Participating\" rulers were not used after the Hellenistic period.\n\nIn medieval systems of astrology, each essential dignity was given a different weight. Domicile rulers were given 5 points of weight; exaltation rulers were given 4 points; and triplicity rulers were assigned 3 points of weight. This gives some idea of how much power medieval astrologers accorded to each essential dignity.\n\nTraditional astrology also organizes triplicities according to the actual season in which the zodiac rose. For example, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini appear during the spring season.\n\nThe triplicities of seasonal elements in ancient astrology were the following:\n\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, it is reversed.\n\n"}

He was the Robert A. Milikan Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1947 until his retirement in 1987.\n\nWilliam McNeill was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the son of theologian and educator John T.

The family then moved to Chicago, while spending summers on a family farm on Canada's Prince Edward Island.\n\nHe earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago, where he was editor of the student newspaper and \"was inspired by the anthropologist Robert Redfield\". He earned a Master of Arts degree in 1939, also at the University of Chicago, and wrote his thesis on Thucydides and Herodotus. He began working towards a Ph.D. in history at Cornell University under Carl L. Becker. In 1941, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in World War II in the European theater.

He has stated that teaching \"is the most wonderful way to learn things\". According to John W. Boyer, the University of Chicago's Dean and a former student of McNeill's, McNeill was \"one of the most important historians to teach at the University of Chicago in the twentieth century\". He retired from teaching in 1987 and moved to Colebrook, Connecticut.\n\nMcNeill's best-known work is \"\", which was published in 1963, relatively early in his career. The book explored world history in terms of the effect different old world civilizations had on one another, and cites the deep influence of Western civilization on the rest of the world to argues that societal contact with foreign civilizations is the primary force in driving historical change. It had a major impact on historical theory by emphasizing cultural fusions, in contrast to Spengler's view of discrete, independent civilizations. Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote a glowing review in \"The New York Times Book Review\". McNeill's \"Rise of the West\" won the U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography in 1964.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, he served as the editor of \"The Journal of Modern History\". His \"Plagues and Peoples\" (1976), was an important early contribution to the impact of disease on human history. In 1982, he published \"The Pursuit of Power\", which examined the role of military forces, military technology, and war in human history. In 1989 he published a biography of his mentor Arnold J. Toynbee.\n\nIn 1992 review, he disagreed with Francis Fukuyama's argument in \"The End of History and the Last Man\" that the end of the Cold War meant that the American model of a capitalist liberal democracy had become the \"final form of human government\", as Fukuyama put it. In 1997 he disagreed with the central thesis of Jared Diamond's \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" for overlooking the importance of human \"cultural autonomy\" in determining human development versus Diamond's focus on environmental factors. In 2003, he coauthored \"The Human Web: A Bird's-eye View of World History\" with his son and fellow historian J. R. McNeill.\n\nIn addition to winning the U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography in 1964 for \"The Rise of the West\", McNeill received several other awards and honors. In 1985 he served as president of the American Historical Association. In 1996, McNeill won the prestigious Erasmus Prize, which the Crown Prince of the Netherlands Willem-Alexander presented to him at Amsterdam's Royal Palace. In 1999, Modern Library named \"The Rise of the West\" of the 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the 20th century.\n\nIn 2009, he won the National Humanities Medal. In February 2010, President Barack Obama, a former University of Chicago professor himself, awarded McNeill the National Humanities Medal to recognize \"his exceptional talent as a teacher and scholar at the University of Chicago and as an author of more than 20 books, including \"The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community\" (1963), which traces civilizations through 5,000 years of recorded history\".\n\nIn 1946 McNeill married Elizabeth Darbishire, whom he met during his military service during World War II as an assistant military attaché to the Greek and Yugoslavian governments-in-exile in Cairo. She died in 2006. McNeill himself died in July 2016 at the age of 98.\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}
