When the Japanese started bombing northern Australia in 1942, he and the other children, walked from Barklay Bay on the Arnhem Land coast right to Pine Creek through the bush. From there he was transferred to Alice Springs where he took the train to Adelaide and on to Sydney. He was then returned to Croker Island after the war, but when he was old enough returned to Sydney. He was eventually reunited with his mother, just two years before she died.

{"id": "41812290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41812290", "title": "Annette Lemieux", "text": "Annette Lemieux\n\nAnnette Lemieux (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists (David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological minimalism. Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.\nLemieux has been the recipient of awards from the National Endowment of the Arts and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Monserrat College of Art. Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at Harvard University in the area of visual and environmental studies.\n\nLemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in New York.\n\nAnnette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut. Later on, she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.\n\nIn early works like \"It’s a Wonderful Life\", 1986 [named after the 1946 Frank Capra film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current. Following the legacies of Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”. Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's. Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand. As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.\n\nLemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture. In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective \"The Strange Life of Objects,\" Elizabeth Michelman explains that, \"[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records.\"\n\nIn her recent show entitled \"Unfinished Business\" at the Carpenter Center, Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades. Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.\nWith representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the Krannert Art Museum and Harvard University.\n\nLemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester MA; Museum of Fine Arts Boston; The Art Institute Chicago, as well as many other museums throughout the world. Additionally, she has received awards and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, as well as other institutions. In 2009, received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Montserrat College of Art as well.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5884148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5884148", "title": "Baladi", "text": "Baladi\n\nBaladi ( \"\"; relative-adjective \"of town\", \"local\", \"rural\", comparable to English \"folk\", with a lower-class connotation) can refer to an Egyptian musical style, the folk style of Egyptian bellydance (Raqs Baladi), or the Masmoudi Sogheir rhythm, which is frequently used in baladi music. It is also sometimes spelled in English as 'beledi' or 'baladee'.\n\nIn Egypt, the term baladi does not only apply to local music and dance, and can also apply to many other things that are considered native, rural, rustic or traditional, for example 'baladi bread' or 'Aish Baladi\". It is also applied to kinds of food and mostly to fruits and vegetables coming from rural villages.\n\n\"Baladi\" means “of the country” and is a style of Egyptian folk dance from the early 20th century which is still very popular. Thus, ‘Egyptian Beledi’ means ‘of the country of Egypt’ It came about when farmers moved to the city and began dancing in small spaces. Egyptians have Baladi people, Baladi bread, Baladi rhythms, Baladi music and Baladi dance.\n\nBaladi can take the form of traditional songs, often with a verse-chorus structure - some popular examples include 'That il Shibbak' and 'Hassan ya Koulli'. There is also an improvised musical form in the baladi style.\n\nThis is a structured form of musical improvisation, most usually between a tabla player and an accordionist or saxophonist (although occasionally the ney may be the primary instrument). It is sometimes referred to as a baladi taqsim, ashra baladi, or a baladi progression.\n\nA baladi taqsim consists of a number of distinct sections. Each section has a traditional structure, and the ordering of the sections follows a loose pattern, although this is not always followed. The musicians will not generally include all of the possible sections, but will choose some of them to build a structure for the piece.\n\nMost baladi improvisations will begin with an instrumental solo (taqsim) by the primary instrument. Following this, there is usually a call and response between the instrument and the drummer, flowing into a slow rhythmic section. Further call and response sections and quicker rhythmic sections may follow. The middle part of the piece may include melodies from popular songs, or a section in the Saidi style. The final section is normally the 'tet', which has a quick tempo, and staccato accents on the off-beat.\n\nRaqs baladi is the folk/social form of bellydance. It is more stationary than raqs sharqi, with little use of the arms, and the focus is on hip movements. Baladi dance has a 'heavy' feeling, with the dancer appearing relaxed and strongly connected to the ground. It is performed to baladi or folk music.\n\nTypical costuming for performances of this dance style is a long dress covering the midriff, which may be plain and traditional, or heavily embellished. Traditionally, a baladi dress would resemble a theatrical version of traditional Egyptian clothing. The most common version has a straight skirt with side slits, long sleeves which may be slit to the elbows, and a scooped or shirt-style neckline. Striped fabrics or tulle bi-telli are popular. A sash may be worn around the hips, and a headscarf is often also worn. A baladi-style performance may include the use of sagat, or the dancer may perform with a cane (assaya).\n\nFifi Abdou, one of the legends of 20th-century Egyptian bellydance, is often described as a baladi-style dancer.\n\nIn the West, the Masmoudi Sogheir ('small Masmoudi') rhythm in Arabic music is often referred to as 'baladi', because it is commonly used in baladi music. This is somewhat misleading, as there are several other rhythms commonly found in the baladi style (including Maqsoum, Saiidi and Fellahi), and this rhythm is also found in other musical styles.\n\nThe basic structure of this rhythm, played on the darbuka, is as follows:\n\nCapitals represent stressed beats. Dum (D) is the dominant hand on the middle of the drum, Tek (T) either the dominant or the non-dominant hand on the rim of the drum. Ka (k) is usually the non-dominant hand on the rim of the drum.\n\nThe drummer has freedom to “fill” in between these stressed beats as he/she sees fit to interpret the music. A common fill is:\n\nHere, the second version has a \"bridge\" to lead it into the next bar.\n\nIn some middle eastern countries, in the markets, some fruits and vegetables are sold and announced as \"baladi\" products, i.e. native, natural, fresh, un-cultivated and un-engineered.\n\n\n"}

The word gave rise to the English word buffoon.\n\nThe word bouffon comes from a Latin verb: , to puff (i.e., to fill the cheeks with air); the word \"Buffo\" was used in the Theatre of ancient Rome by those who appeared on the stage with their cheeks blown up; when they received blows that they would make a great noise causing the audience to laugh. The usage of the word bouffon comes from French and has entered English theatrical language through the work of Jacques Lecoq and his pedagogic inquiry into performance approaches of comedy, leading him to create dynamic classroom exercises that explored elements of burlesque, commedia dell'arte, farce, gallows humor, parody, satire, slapstick, etc. that collectively influenced the development of modern bouffon performance work.\n\nPhilippe Gaulier a contemporary of LeCoq explains bouffon in his book \"The Tormentor\".\n\n"}

This is the idea that the preference for color is determined by the average affective response to everything the individual associates with the color. Hence, positive emotional experiences with a particular color are likely to increase the propensity to develop a preference for that color and vice versa. Social and cultural factors also factor into this affective response. A study in 2011 on the effects of \"school spirit\" and color preferences found members of Berkeley were more likely to favor the school's official colors than rival university Stanford. This degree of preference was also correlated with their self-reported level of \"school spirit\". The researchers conducting the study concluded that this was evidence for the EVT.\n\nThe age when infants begin showing a preference for color is at about 12 weeks old. Generally, children prefer the colors red/pink and blue, and cool colors are preferred over warm colors. Purple is a color favored more by girls than by boys. Color perception of children 3–5 years of age is an indicator of their developmental stage. Color preferences tend to change as people age.\n\nFavoritism of colors varies widely. Often societal influences will have a direct impact on what colors we favor and disdain. In the West, the color black symbolizes mourning and sadness, red symbolizes anger and violence, white symbolizes purity and peace, and yellow symbolizes joy and luck (other colors lack a consistent meaning). From a recent study, it was discussed that associative learning is the process where an individual develops color preferences. In different countries, color preference vary. In China, red indicates luck, while in Nigeria and Germany it means the exact opposite.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40277", "title": "Corpus linguistics", "text": "Corpus linguistics\n\nCorpus linguistics is the study of language as expressed in \"corpora\" (bodies) of \"real world\" text. The text-corpus method is a digestive approach that derives a set of abstract rules that govern a natural language from texts in that language, and explores how that language relates to other languages. Originally derived manually, corpora now are automatically derived from source texts. Corpus linguistics proposes that reliable language analysis is more feasible with corpora collected in the field in its natural context (\"realia\"), and with minimal experimental-interference.\n\nThe field of corpus linguistics features divergent views about the value of corpus annotation. These views range from John McHardy Sinclair, who advocates minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves, to the Survey of English Usage team (University College, London), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording.\n\nSome of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance. For example, Prātiśākhya literature described the sound patterns of Sanskrit as found in the Vedas, and \nPāṇini's grammar of classical Sanskrit was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus. Similarly, the early Arabic grammarians paid particular attention to the language of the Quran. In the Western European tradition, scholars prepared concordances to allow detailed study of the language of the Bible and other canonical texts.\n\nA landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication by Henry Kučera and W. Nelson Francis of \"Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English\" in 1967, a work based on the analysis of the Brown Corpus, a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, language teaching, psychology, statistics, and sociology. A further key publication was Randolph Quirk's 'Towards a description of English Usage' (1960) in which he introduced The Survey of English Usage.\n\nShortly thereafter, Boston publisher Houghton-Mifflin approached Kučera to supply a million-word, three-line citation base for its new \"American Heritage Dictionary\", the first dictionary compiled using corpus linguistics. The AHD took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements (how language \"should\" be used) with descriptive information (how it actually \"is\" used).\n\nOther publishers followed suit. The British publisher Collins' COBUILD monolingual learner's dictionary, designed for users learning English as a foreign language, was compiled using the Bank of English. The Survey of English Usage Corpus was used in the development of one of the most important Corpus-based Grammars, the \"Comprehensive Grammar of English\" (Quirk \"et al.\" 1985).\n\nThe Brown Corpus has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora: the LOB Corpus (1960s British English), Kolhapur (Indian English), Wellington (New Zealand English), Australian Corpus of English (Australian English), the Frown Corpus (early 1990s American English), and the FLOB Corpus (1990s British English). Other corpora represent many languages, varieties and modes, and include the International Corpus of English, and the British National Corpus, a 100 million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts, created in the 1990s by a consortium of publishers, universities (Oxford and Lancaster) and the British Library. For contemporary American English, work has stalled on the American National Corpus, but the 400+ million word Corpus of Contemporary American English (1990–present) is now available through a web interface.\n\nThe first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in 1971 by the Montreal French Project, containing one million words, which inspired Shana Poplack's much larger corpus of spoken French in the Ottawa-Hull area.\n\nBesides these corpora of living languages, computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages. An example is the Andersen-Forbes database of the Hebrew Bible, developed since the 1970s, in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax, and every segment tagged with seven fields of information. The Quranic Arabic Corpus is an annotated corpus for the Classical Arabic language of the Quran. This is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar.\n\nBesides pure linguistic inquiry, researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields, such as the emerging sub-discipline of law and corpus linguistics, which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools.\n\nCorpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods, which attempt to trace a path from data to theory. Wallis and Nelson (2001) first introduced what they called the 3A perspective: Annotation, Abstraction and Analysis.\n\n\nMost lexical corpora today are part-of-speech-tagged (POS-tagged). However even corpus linguists who work with 'unannotated plain text' inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms. In such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search.\n\nThe advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus (through corpus managers). Linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators' can exploit this work. By sharing data, corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate, rather than as an exhaustive fount of knowledge.\n\nRecent studies have suggested treatment outcome in adolescents with social anxiety disorder can also be assessed by analysing language by means of Corpus Linguistics.\n\n\nThere are several international peer-reviewed journals dedicated to corpus linguistics, for example,\nCorpora,\nCorpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory,\nICAME Journal and the\nInternational Journal of Corpus Linguistics.\n\nBook series in this field include\nLanguage and Computers,\nStudies in Corpus Linguistics and English Corpus Linguistics\n\n\n"}

Called the \"Queen of Pop\", Madonna is labeled by international authors as the greatest woman in music, as well as the most influential and iconic female recording artist of all time.\n\nAccepted as a global cultural icon, Madonna has built a legacy that goes beyond music and has been studied by sociologists, historians and other social scientists. Her impact is often compared with that of The Beatles and Elvis Presley; they are the best selling acts of all time in the general, solo male and female category respectively. Madonna is a key figure in popular music; critics have retrospectively credited her presence, success and contributions with paving the way for every female artist and changing forever the music scene for women in the music history, as well as for today's pop stars. Even reviews of her work have served as a roadmap for scrutinizing women at each stage in their music career.\n\nMadonna is the first multimedia pop icon in history and professionals agree that she has become the world's biggest and most socially significant pop icon, as well as the most controversial. However, some intellectuals, like the Frenchman Georges Claude Guilbert, felt that she has greater cultural importance, like a myth, that has apparent universality and timelessness. References to Madonna in popular culture are found in the arts, food, science and each branch of entertainment. In a general sense, journalist Peter Robinson noted that \"Madonna invented contemporary pop fame so there is a little bit of her in the DNA of every modern pop thing.\"\n\nHowever, she is not only an omnipresent figure, but also a polarizing one. During her career, Madonna has attracted contradictory cultural social attention from family organizations, feminist \"anti-porn\" and religious groups worldwide with boycott and protests. Although this attracted unprecedented world media attention, the reviews have been negative, resulting sometimes in censorships.\n\nMadonna has been described as an \"omnipresent\" character and one of the most recognizable names and faces in the world. Tetzlaff felt that \"the power of the omnipresent Madonna has to do with hyperreality, but an infinite accumulation of simulacra, an overabundance of information\". Journalist Quico Alsedo from \"El Mundo\" in Spain felt that Madonna has build a nation, landless but densely populated. Music critic T. Cole Rachel, stated in 2015, that \"there’s an approximate 100% probability that any living human over the age of, say, 25 has some sort of specific Madonna-related memory... Even if you aren’t a super fan—or even a fan at all—there’s no escaping Madonna. She is everywhere.\"\n\nIn his book \"Madonna As Postmodern Myth\" (2002), French academic Georges Claude Guilbert explains how Madonna reflects today's society, while William Langley from \"The Daily Telegraph\" feels that \"Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.\" American poet Jane Miller compares her functions as an archetype directly inside contemporary culture with the Black Madonna. Professor John R. May concludes that Madonna is a contemporary \"gesamtkunstwerk\", and academic Sergio Fajardo labels her \"a very powerful symbol\". Scholar Belén González Morales of the Autonomous University of Barcelona comments, \"'The infinite dissection' of Madonna is like a body paradigmatic of the global age that emanating a tremendous amount of meanings ... Madonna has been become a cultural artifact. Strawberry Saroyan states that she's a storyteller and a cultural pioneer, and emphasizes the important thing is her message: \"And all of those things have been brilliantly of a piece. Madonna's ability to take her message beyond music and impact women's lives has been her legacy\".\n\nAuthors note that Madonna has proved a master of cultural appropriation. She is also considered \"a barometer of culture that directs the attention to cultural shifts, struggles and changes.\" The American Library Association, in a review of music journalist Adam Sexton's book \"Desperately Seeking Madonna: In Search of the Meaning of the World's Most Famous Woman\", remarks: \"Love her or hate her, Madonna is an inescapable figure in the contemporary cultural landscape\". Musicologist Susan McClary suggests that Madonna is engaged in rewriting some very fundamental levels of Western thought. One academic from Lehigh University expressed that she stands behind all people and helps them fight against being ostracized in society. Contribuitor from company Spin Media felt that \"Madonna has changed society through her fiery ambition and unwillingness to compromise\". Professor Karlene Faith accerted Madonna's peculiarity is that she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains. She has been a 'cult' figure within self-propelling subcultures just as she became a major\". She also concluded that as fans, moral critics, media journalists, or university scholars, we mediate what Madonna means to our society. In general, academic radicals turned Madonna into the \"cottage industry\", most notable in the 1990s.\n\nMadonna is part of the Culture of United States and an American icon. Authors in \"American Icons\" (2006) felt that \"like Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley or Coca-Cola, Madonna image is immediately recognizable around the world and instantly communicates many of the values of U.S. culture\". Rodrigo Fresán commented: \"saying that Madonna just is a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA\". She was included in the book \"100 Entertainers Who Changed America: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture\" of Greenwood Publishing Group. Historian professor Glen Jeansonne, said that \"Madonna freed Americans from their inhibitions and made them feel good about having fun\". Editor Erin Skarda from \"Time\" felt that essentially redefined what it meant to be famous in America. Author in \"Shaded Lives: African-American Women and Television\" (2002), said that only Madonna rivaled the space Oprah Winfrey occupied in the late twentieth century and in the psyche of national culture. Karen Lac in her Madonna's biography concluded that she is one of those rare people who have become a part of American culture itself. Jim Cullen wrote in \"Restless in the Promised Land: Catholics and the American Dream\" (2001) \"few figures in American life have manage to exert as much control over their destinies as she has, and the fact that se has done so as a woman is all the more remarkable. That Madonna has done this is indisputable\".\n\nIn American society, she is often referenced by her sexual feminist political movement. For example, Sara Marcus from Salon.com felt that with the height of her career, Madonna brought the changes to American culture and expressed that \"her revelatory spreading of sexual liberation to Middle America, changed this country for the better. And that's not old news; we're still living it... as we can see in everything from the ubiquity of pop stars to Rihanna's career. She ends saying that \"the woman [Madonna] remade American culture\". Andrew O'Hagan felt that \"Madonna is like a heroic opponent of cultural and political authoritarianism of the American \"establishment\". Cultural critic Annalee Newitz commented that Madonna has given to American culture, and culture throughout the world, is not a collection of songs; rather, it is a collection of images. \"USA Today\" dubbed her as \"our lady of constant makeovers\". And Lynn Spigel wrote that Madonna intervened \"America's notions of sex, gender and power. Madonna publicized her appropriation of the unspoken and taboo areas of Americas's moralist rhetoric and capitalized on it through the scandalization and titillation of the consumer\".\n\nDubbed as the most iconic female artist of all time, Madonna is a synonym of vanguard in the fields of she work. By her impact and contributions, she has been analyzed from the point view of several studies, including feminist, sexual, gay, queer, musical, social and postmodern etc., becoming known as an icon in all these branches. Reader editor Brian McNair wrote that \"Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence\". Professor Dennis Hall said that \"the fact that not only her work but her person was open to multiple interpretations contributed to the rise of Madonna Studies\". As Hall, Hao Huang in his 1999 book \"Music in the 20th Century\" wrote that Madonna has made a career as well as an art out of reinventing herself — as a rock diva, stage and screen star, video vixen, fashion icon, and cultural phenomenon.\nAcademics felt that Oxford English Dictionary's recent definition of \"icon\" as a \"person or thing\" or an \"institution\", etc., considered worthy of admiration or respect or \"regarded as a representative symbol\", esp. of a culture or movement” (OED 2009), and this include Madonna. Alyson Welsh from \"The Guardian\" commented that \"she is an amazing role model, and a cultural icon\". The program Australasian Journal of American Studies (AJAS) remember that it's not an accident that Mickey Mouse and Madonna are worldwide icons.\n\nProfessors from Heidelberg University shows how Madonna's \"iconicity\" is indeed that of a \"meta-icon\" in the sense that the self-reflexive imitation of celebrity poses. Calls this strategy \"iconizing\", in analogy to the concept of \"vogueing\". The essay also inquires into the blend of biography and performativity that can be said to underlie Madonna's \"iconizing\" in relation to the performance artists. Michelle Goldberg said that \"Andy Warhol did an enormous amount to change that idea in highbrow circles, but Madonna made it conventional wisdom to conflate art and commerce. She pioneered this kind of multimedia, 'life as performance art'.\"\n\nBefore closing the 20th century, \"Q\" magazine declared her as one of the most important cultural figures of this century. Miranda Sawyer, Jefferson Hack and others authors called to her as a 21st-century icon. Andrew Morton wrote in his book \"Madonna\" (2002) that \"she is the undisputed female icon of the modern age\". Also cited as one of the most fascinating women and enigmatic in current history. \"Madonna in Art\" (2004) is a book by Mem Mehmet where included the work art by over a hundred artists, including Andrew Logan, Sebastian Krüger, Al Hirschfeld, and Peter Howson. The book is a testament to her unique global impact. French biographer Anne Bleuzen wrote that she is \"interplanetary\", and Italian author Francesco Falconi felt that she is an icon eternal. Editor Eduardo Gutiérrez Seguro from Latin magazine \"Quién\" wrote:\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" described her as a musical icon without peer, while RTL Television Belgium said that \"Madonna is a key figure in the music\". Bill Wyman, editor of \"Chicago Reader\", wrote that she is a \"genuinely freakish figure in popular music\". According to international media and critics, Madonna is the most influential female recording artist of all time, and the greatest woman in music history.\n\nHer contributions on music are generally praised by critics, which have also been known to induce controversy. Tony Sclafani from company MSNBC felt that her Madonna’s impact and effect on the future direction of music bests The Beatles, even that quarter century after Madonna emerged, artists still use her ideas and seem modern and edgy doing so. Laura Barcella in her book \"Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop\" (2012) wrote that \"really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look \"du jour\", and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye.\" Similar to Barcella, Joe Levy \"Blender\" editor in chief, \"opened the door for what women could achieve and were permitted to do\".\n\nIn the music industry, Madonna was the first female to have complete control of her music and image. Authors noted that before Madonna, records labels determined every step of artists, but she introduced her style and conceptually directed every part of her career; the music industry was the foundation to permanently change the way the record companies treat artists. Journalist Carol Benson wrote that Madonna entered the music business with definite ideas about her image, but it was her track record that enabled her to increase her level of creative control over her music. Many years after, she founded Maverick Records became the most successful \"vanity label\" in the history of music. While under Madonna's control it generated well over $1 billion for Warner Bros. Records, more money than any other recording artist's record label.\n\nCritics felt in retrospect that Madonna's presence is defined for changing contemporary music history for women's, mainly rock, dance and pop scene. Also, she is cited that open the doors for the future hip-hop explosion and approach to sex to her music. Erin Vargo from online magazine in popular culture, felt that \"Madonna has fought for freedom of expression by female artists. Her legacy has paved the way for today’s pop, hip-hop, and rock artists to get into their own groove\". \"The Times\" stated: \"Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice\". \"The New York Post\" writer Brian Niemietz, who found that Madonna revolutionized dance music much the same way Elvis Presley invented gospel and rock and roll.\n\nMadonna is a pop star icon. She is the first multimedia figure in the history of popular culture. Peter Robinson from \"The Guardian\" felt that \"Madonna pretty much invented contemporary pop fame so there is a little bit of her in the DNA of every modern pop thing\". \"Rolling Stone\" of Spain wrote that \"Madonna became the first viral Master of Pop on history, years before the Internet was massively used.\" Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of tendency and commerciality\". Also, Caryn Ganz from the same magazine wrote that \"Madonna is the most media-savvy American pop star since Bob Dylan and, until she toned down her press-baiting behavior in the nineties, she was the most consistently controversial one since Elvis Presley. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that \"one of Madonna's greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality\". Becky Johnston from \"Interview\" magazine commented: \"[F]ew public figures are such wizards at manipulating the press and cultivating publicity as Madonna is. She has always been a great tease with journalists, brash and outspoken when the occasion demanded it, recalcitrant and taciturn when it came time to pull back and slow down the striptease\".\n\nAcademic Becca Cragin explain that \"Madonna has managed to hold the public's attention for 30 years now, in large part because of her skillful use of the visual in expressing herself and marketing her music\". French academic Georges-Claudes Guillbert wrote that taking some elements and transforms them into commercial products. Cultural critic, Douglas Kellner explained that Madonna's popularity also requires focus on audiences, not just as individuals, but as members of specific groups. Journalist Mark Watts felt that the rise and (perceived) decline of Madonna has gone, so to say, hand-in-hand with that of postmodern theory. According to journalist Annalee Newitz, \"the academics in the fields of theology to queer studies have written literally volumes about what Madonna's fame means for gender relations, American culture, and the future\". As Newitz, author in \"Images of women in American popular culture\" (1995) said that Madonna had reached such staggering celebrity that scholarly and popular assessments of the meaning of her work for the future of feminism, for the sexual values of the young. In this way, many authors, including Alvin Hall and Matthew Rettenmund (\"Encyclopedia Madonnica\"; 1995), agree that Madonna is \"the world's greatest artist\" while others classify her as \"the most powerful celebrity or famous woman in the world\". Music editor Bill Friskics-Warren wrote that \"Madonna's megastardom and cultural ubiquity had made her as much a social construct as anything else, a \"person-turned-idea,\" as Steve Anderson put it, along the iconic lines of Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe\".\n\nCalled to as a \"mainstream hero\" by professor Karlene Faith, Madonna is the best-selling woman artist in the history, and the most successful female recording artist of alltime certified by \"Guinness Book of Worlds Records\". With several critics feeling that she paved the way for every female artist, \"Time\" magazine expressed that \"every pop star of the last two or three decades has Madonna to thank in some part for his or her success\". She is cited like an influence by many other artists worldwide.\n\nHer superstardom also is cited as the motivation of the success commercial and popularised or introduction of several things like branches, terms, groups, cultures, persons and products. For example, the media cited her acting in the movie \"Evita\", that popularised Argentinian politics and she put the nation Malawi on the map while she launched the trend for celebrity adoption. Madonna's success open to other celebrities such as singers, actors and politicians have successfully dabbling in the publishing field for young audiences. Her first book \"Sex\" changed publishing history. Her album \"Something to Remember\" set a trend of releasing ballad albums afterward, such as the 1996 albums \"Love Songs\" by Elton John and \"If We Fall in Love Tonight\" by Rod Stewart.\n\nShe popularizing the Voguing. Academic Stepehn Ursprung from Smith College felt that \"Madonna created a market for Voguing in the commercial entertainment world\". Analyzed that \"through a close connection with the continued commercial success of Madonna, Voguing has left its mark on the world largely... Voguing was first appropriated by pop culture by pop music icon Madonna\". The website Wallblog (Haymarket Media Group) from United Kingdom called tentatively in a question, to Yahoo! like the \"Madonna of digital media\". Even, is cited that she has carried the burlesque to mass culture. As is cited that MTV helped her, some authors like Josue Rich from \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that Madonna helped make MTV (alongside Michael Jackson). Biographer Mick St Michael wrote that \"girl power began with Madonna\". Also, she has credit for the introduction of electronic music to the stage of popular music, and innovated the rave culture. Similar, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that Madonna introduced the dance pop to mainstream scene.\n\nAccording to intellectuals, the phenomenon of femininity inspired by South Asia as a tendency in Western media could go back to February 1998 when the pop icon Madonna released her video for \"Frozen\". They explained that \"although Madonna did not initiate the Indian fashion accessories beauty [...] took the public eye to attract the attention of the global media. The Spanish style of Madonna in the video \"La Isla Bonita\" became popular and was reflected in fashion trends of the time in the form of \"boleros\", skirts with tables and rosaries and crucifixes as accessories. According to the official website of the city Safed, Madonna popularized the Jewish mysticism. Madonna set a trend that influenced people to take interest in the sexuality of women's bodies. In general, some authors like entertainment critic Rogelio Segoviano felt that \"the fever for queen of pop does not yield to the passage of time\".\n\n\"Time\" included her as one of the Top 100 Icons of all time in fashion, style and design. Critics praised Madonna's style during her career, which became the defining look in the 80s. This gave rise to the term of Madonna wannabe. To experts in the 1990s, her use of fashion was even more eclectic.\n\nJournalist Michael Pye felt that \"the face that launched a thousand fashions. To a large extent Madonna not only makes fashion, she is fashion. Editor of \"Vogue\" magazine Anna Wintour declared:\nProfessors in \"Oh Fashion\" (1994) book wrote that \"the Madonna phenomenon suggests that in a postmodern image culture identity is constructed through image and fashion, involving one's look, pose, and attitude. Fashion and identity for Madonna are inseparable from her aesthetic practices, from her cultivation of her image in her music videos, films, TV appearances, concerts, and other cultural interventions\". \"Billboard\" declared that \"no pop diva has reinvented her fashion image with the consistency and creativity of Madonna... she evolved into a fashion-forward icon whose sense of style became as influential as her chart-topping tunes\". Similarly, editor of \"The Huffington Post\" Dana Oliver comments why Madonna is the ultimate style chameleon and added that \"no one has transformed herself like Madonna. She has had about as many looks as she has records. Her ability to constantly reinvent herself and her music has helped to secure her status as an icon, and she has influenced a generation of copycats. In short, no one has had more diverse looks than Madonna\".\n\nChloe Wyma from Louise Blouin Media commented that Madonna's chameleon attitude in transforming her fashion has become a universally recognized fact. Ana Laglere from Batanga Media expressed that \"each new Madonna's style is a trend and is used by major designers as inspiration, flooding our world with innovative ideas\".\nCynthia Robins from \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said that \"when Madonna came along, all fashion hell broke loose. Thus far, her influence on fashion —high, low and otherwise— has transmogrified from 'Who's That Girl?' to what in the world will Madonna wear next?\". Alessandra Codinha from \"Vogue\" named as \"the master of reinvention\".\n\nMadonna as a feminist icon has generated variety of opinions worldwide. She is frequently associated with the feminist movement and she is considered a revolutionary figure who questioned the boundaries of gender. She is also responsible for influencing the mentality and behavior of women and how society interprets these changes. Professor Sut Jhally felt that \"Madonna is as an almost sacred feminist icon\". Academic Camille Paglia from University of the Arts called Madonna a \"true feminist\" and noted that \"she exposes the puritanism and suffocating ideology of American feminism, which is stuck in an adolescent whining mode\". According to her, \"Madonna has taught young women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising total control over their lives\". Psychologist Jule Eisenbud in \"Sex Symbols\" (1999) noted that Madonna's refusal to accept that power and femininity is equivalent to masculinity has allowed her to maintain her status as a sex symbol.\n\nJessica Valenti wrote in her book \"\" (2012) \"sure, one Madonna gave birth to Jesus... but our Madonna gave birth to \"femme-inism\". Spanish newspaper \"Periódico Diagonal\" convened a researchers panel discussion her as a feminist icon. One of the comments, included that \"she democratized the idea of women as protagonists and as agents of their own action\", while some ambiguous ones stated that she contributed to women's empowerment of a few Western women, straight and gay middle class, but that empowerment is not feminism, because it is individualistic. Madonna was included in \"The Guardian\" list of the Top 100 women and editor Homa Khaleeli declared \"no matter the decade or the fashion, she has always been frank about her toughness and ambition\". She is still one of the most famous women on the planet and \"she inspires not because she gives other women a helping hand, but because she breaks the boundaries of what's considered acceptable for women\". She was also included in \"Time\" magazine's list of the 25 most powerful women in the 20th century.\n\nMadonna has been referred to as a sexual icon, and sex symbol; most notable in the decade of the 1980s and 1990s. Also, she is cited as an icon of sexual freedom and expression. Author Courtney E. Smith in the 2011 book \"Record Collecting for Girls\" noted that most people associate Madonna with sex. Chuck Klosterman in his book \"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\" (2003) wrote that \"whenever I hear intellectuals talk about sexual icons of the present day, the name mentioned most is Madonna\". Even, Karen Fredericks from socialist newspaper \"Green Left Weekly\" in comment with her sexual attitude said that Madonna capturing an enormous mainstream audience, has had a perhaps surprising impact in progressive circles.\n\nArtists Adam Geczy and Vicki Karaminas in \"Queer Style\" (2013) noted Madonna transmogrified from virgin to dominatrix to \"Über Fran\", each time achieving iconic status. Added Madonna was the first woman to do so-and with mainstream panache and approbation. bell hooks teach that her \"power to the pussy\" credo worked only to solidify Madonna's positioning on the backs of the marginalized. The sexual icon she constructed may indeed, then, accord power to the pussy. Academics from European School of Management and Technology felt that Madonna became one of the world's first performers to manipulate the juxtaposition of sexual and religious themes. American editor Janice Min wrote that \"long before \"Sex and the City\", Madonna owned her sexuality. She made people cringe but also think differently about female performers. Her role as a provocateur changed boundaries for ensuing generations. She was a one-woman reality show.\" As Min, Shmuel Boteach, author of \"Hating Women\" (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: \"Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as Janet Jackson now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums\".\n\nDuring her career, Madonna has several provocative works. Perhaps, her book \"Sex\" is most notorious, considered by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. Some authors noted that \"Sex\" helped Madonna make a name in the porn industry, and earned her the title of S&M's first cultural ambassador. Steve Bachmann, on his book \"Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity\" pointed out that \"perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise\". Brian McNair, author of \"Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire\" (2012) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had \"porno elegance\" and that \"\"Sex\" is the author of a cultural phenomenon of global proportions [due to the critics] and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence. Professors in \"Oh Fashion\" (1994) book felt that \"Madonna is a toy for boys, but on another level boys are toys for her\".\n\nAccording to \"The Advocate\", Madonna is the greatest gay icon of all time. \"New Statesman\" reported that Madonna became the supreme gay icon, and the Madonna Studies analyzed and support these. Scholars Carmine Sarracino and Kevin Scott in \"The Porning of America\" (2008), wrote that Madonna \"gained particular popularity with gay audiences, signaling the creation of a career-long fan base that would lead to her being hailed as the biggest gay icon of all time\". \"Out\" magazine wrote that Madonna \"stuck her neck out and positioned herself to be a gay icon before it was cool to be one\".\n\nAssociate professor Judith A. Peraino wrote that \"no one has worked harder to be a gay icon than Madonna, and she has done so by using every possible taboo sexual in her videos, performances, and interviews\". Similar, Alex Hopkins from \"Time Out\" magazine denoted that gay community labeled her as [Their] 'Glorious Leader', \"Madge is part of our subculture's rich history of diva worship. She has referenced every sacred monster from Dietrich to Monroe, revelled in upfront, often transgressive sexuality and demonstrated a highly developed sense of camp. No wonder we loved her\". Also, her lack of inhibition helped inspire a generation of gay men and women to live on their own terms.\n\nMadonna is also referred to as a queer icon and icon of queerness. Theologist, Robert Goss wrote: \"For me, Madonna has been not only a queer icon but also a Christ icon\". Similar Sheila Whiteley from \"Sexing the Groove: Popular Music and Gender\" (2013) felt that \"Madonna came closer to any other contemporary celebrity in being an above-ground queer icon\".\n\nAccording to Lucy O'Brien: Much has been made of Madonna as a postmodern icon, yet all her reference points have been resolutely modernist—from Steinbeck and Fitzgerald to Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath, to her predilection for narrative and psychoanalysis.\n\nCanadian editor Richard Appignanesi wrote that for some \"Madonna is the cyber-model of the New Woman. Similar, senior lecturers Stéphanie Genz and Benjamin Brabon in \"Postfeminism: Cultural Texts and Theories\" (2009) felt that \"whether it is as a woman, mother, pop icon or fifty year old, the American singer challenges our preconceptions of who 'Madonna' is and, more broadly, what these identity categories mean within a postmodern context\".\n\nMadonna as a pop icon and figure on popular culture has generated scrutine analysis, but some journalists and critics like Carol Clerk wrote that \"during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon\". However, academics from Rutgers University comments that \"Madonna has become the world's biggest and most socially significant pop icon, as well as the most controversial\". Critical theorist Douglas Kellner described her as \"a highly influential pop culture icon\" and \"the most discussed female singer in popular music\". Even, in 2012 Latin critics felt that Madonna is the most influential presence of current popular culture. Historian Jasmina Tešanović like others authors, noted that Madonna's changes are well-calculated in order to be ahead of the curve, of the game, to dictate the fashion, to be a trendsetter and called her as one of the most honest performers in pop culture. VH1 listed her behind David Beckham as the greatest pop icon of all time.\n\nWilliam Langley from \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that Madonna \"remains a permanent fixture on every list of world's most powerful/admired/influential women.\" For example, \"The Sun\" listed her in the topping of \"the 50 female singers who will never be forgotten\". American journalist Edna Gundersen felt that Madonna is \"durable pop triumvirate\". Also, she has been referred to as a \"modern Medusa\" or \"queen of gender disorder and racial deconstruction\".\n\nMadonna has several titles, subjectives and superlatives, many of them explain and explore her large impact in many fields. Blogger Richard Pérez-Feria posted on \"The Huffington Post\" that \"over the course of her remarkable career, Madonna has been called many things... whore, which, for vastly different reasons. What Madonna ultimately achieved is nothing less than reigning as the universe's Queen of Pop, as in music, culture, life\". Chilean newspaper of politics, economy and culture, \"\" stated in 1996, that \"to Madonna can be attributed many titles and never be exaggerated. She is the undisputed queen of pop, sex goddess, and of course marketing\". Music blogger Alan McGee from \"The Guardian\" felt that Madonna is post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop. Like a corollary, her most notable nickname in world popular culture is Queen of Pop. Carlos Otero from Divinity Channel wrote that \"Madonna has secured for life the title of Queen of Pop. He further asserted that \"after 30 years of career would take another three decades to meet her influence and legacy\".\n\nMathew Donahue, one of 12 faculty members of Bowling Green State University's Pop Culture Studies program, gives lectures about Madonna in many of his music and culture classes has qualified her as the \"Queen of all Media\". Also, she was named as the mother of \"kingdom technological\". Madonna is also referred to as the Queen of MTV. CNN commented that MTV could stand for \"Madonna Television\". Julían Ruíz from Spanish newspaper \"El Mundo\" said that she is our \"Lady Madonna\".\n\n\nProfessors in \"American Icons\" noted that she was not only an omnipresent figure but a polarizing one. For example, in 1993, she was the subject of the \"I Hate Madonna Handbook\" and the following year the inspirations for \"I Dream of Madonna\". Lynn Spigel noted that Madonna is a producer of cultural ambiguity and openness. Rabbi Isaac Karudi —the highest authority of the Orthodox Kabbalah— described her as a \"depraved cultural icon\". Social critic and critical theorist, Stuart Sim noted that \"Madonna now attained the status of cultural icon, she is however, an extremely problematic one, as her delight in simultaneously evoking and transgressing cultural stereotypes of feminity makes her exceedingly difficult to categorize; depending on one's point of view\". Cultural critic Fausto Rivera Yánez from \"\" said that \"Madonna has labeling usurper, since much of its aesthetic and musical approach draws on religious imagery of black cultures, discourses of sexual diversity and circumstantial geopolitical contexts\". Maureen Orth explain her the contradiction as a cultural and social impact:\n\nAmerican Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for \"The New York Times\" Michiko Kakutani, felt that Madonna is incredibly popular. Or: \"Clearly, Madonna is not universally loved.\" Or: \"The politics of sex and gender representations as they relate to identity has not been lost on Madonna.\" Authors in \"Representing gender in cultures\" (2004) noted that \"Madonna has been consistently denied a status of a 'real' musician and even accused of using, in a vampire-like way, fashionable musicians to update her sound\".\n\nDuring her career, Madonna attracted the attention of family organizations, feminist \"anti-porn\" and religious groups worldwide with boycott and protests. Professor Bruce David Forbes author of \"Religion and Popular Culture in America\" (2005) felt that \"some of the most important and interesting texts in recent American culture which have overlapping concerns with liberation theologies are by Madonna\". Karen Fredericks from socialist newspaper \"Green Left Weekly\" questioned if does the \"Madonna phenomenon\" advance the cause of women's liberation within Western societies? she said that clearly, there's no point going to Madonna for help. She asserted that the artist is a commodity in a capitalist market which has been influenced, at least to some extent, by the demands of the women's movement. Sociologist John Shepherd wrote that Madonna's cultural practices highlight the sadly continuing social realities of dominance and subordination. In 1988, one Italian sculptor planned a statue of Madonna in Pacentro, where are from her paternal grandparents, who said \"Madonna is a symbol of our children and represents a better world in the year 2000\". The then mayor of the city declared: \"it is absolutely untrue that the city administration of Pacentro is willing to host the statue to the singer Madonna as some maintain\".\n\nAcademic Audra Gaugler from Lehigh University advocated for Madonna, wrote that \"she has faced much criticism throughout her career, but much of it is unjust. Instead of Madonna's actions eliciting criticism, they should elicit praise because she radically tries to change society by blurring the boundaries that separate different groups of people in society and she urges all people to gain power in their lives and lift themselves out of subordinate positions. Madonna blurs the boundaries that exist in society and separate people in society in two distinct ways\". She noted that there exists a large band of critics that at first praised her, but then became disillusioned with her as she became more and more controversial.\n"}

Hultzsch, a German epigraphist and Indologist, renowned for understanding and deciphering the ancient inscriptions of Ashoka as part of his 159th birthday celebrations.\n\n"}

It was cast on 5 February 1484 by order of King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy Pegu, and was given as a present to the Shwedagon Pagoda of Dagon (today's Yangon, Myanmar).\n\nIn 1484, prior to the casting of the bell, King Dhammazedi's astrologer advised him to postpone the date, because it was at the astrologically inauspicious time of the Crocodile constellation, and the resulting bell would not produce any sound. After the bell was completed, it reportedly gave an unpleasant sound.\n\nAccording to texts of the time, the bell was cast of 180,000 viss (294 t) of metal which included silver and gold, as well as copper and tin. The bell was said to be twelve cubits high and eight cubits wide.\n\nIn 1583, Gasparo Balbi, a Venetian gem merchant, visited ancient Dagon and the Shwedagon Pagoda. He wrote in his diary about the King Dhammazedi Bell. His description of the Great Bell said that it had writing engraved from top to bottom around its circumference that he could not decipher at that time:\n\nEuropean explorers and merchants began to make contacts in Lower Burma in the early 16th century. Filipe de Brito e Nicote, a Portuguese warlord and mercenary known as \"Nga Zinka\" to the Burmese, arrived in Lower Burma sometime in the 1590s. At that time, Syriam (now known as Thanlyin) was the most important seaport in the Burmese Kingdom of Taungoo.\n\nIn 1599, de Brito led an Arakanese force which sacked Syriam and Pegu (now known as Bago), the capital of Lower Burma. The King of Arakan appointed de Brito as governor of Syriam. By 1600, de Brito had extended his power across the Bago River to Dagon and the surrounding countryside. De Brito declared independence from the Arakanese king in 1603 and established Portuguese rule under Aires de Saldanha, Viceroy of Portuguese India.\n\nIn 1608 De Brito and his men removed the Dhammazedi bell from the Shwedagon Pagoda and rolled it down Singuttara Hill to a raft on the Pazundaung Creek. From here, the bell was hauled by elephants to the Bago River. The bell and raft were lashed to de Brito's flagship for the journey across the river to Syriam, to be melted down and made into ships' cannons. The load proved to be too heavy however: at the confluence of the Bago and Yangon Rivers, off what is now known as Monkey Point, the raft broke up and the bell went to the bottom, taking de Brito's ship with it.\n\nBurmese forces under King Anaukpetlun recaptured Syriam in September 1613. De Brito was executed by impalement on a wooden stake.\n\nMany people have tried to save the bell, thus far without success. Professional deep sea diver, James Blunt, has made 115 dives to find the bell, using sonar images of objects in the area for guidance. Making it even harder to find is the fact that there are also 3 shipwrecks in the area. The water is muddy and visibility is extremely poor under the surface. The Dhammazedi Bell is thought to be buried in of mud. The great Bell rests between the wrecks of two Dutch East Indiaman ships: \"Komine\" and \"Koning David\", along with small pieces of De Brito's galleon.\n\nIn 2000, the Burmese government asked an English marine scientist named Mike Hatcher and his team to raise the bell; they wanted to see it restored to the Pagoda. Hatcher agreed to undertake the project, which has involvement from Japanese, Australian and American companies. Richard Gere is involved in raising funds.\n\nThe project is not without its opponents: Some pro-democracy campaigners say the salvage operation might be misconstrued as an endorsement by the international community of Myanmar's military dictatorship, and should wait until talks with the regime have progressed or until such time as a democratic government is in place.\n\nOne of seven salvage projects forecast for Mike Hatcher and his team in 2001, Mike's team was slated to begin the search for the precise location of the Dhammazedi Bell in March that year. After a flurry of excitement stirred up by BBC's announcement of the project, however, it apparently did not get off the ground, perhaps due to complications involved in his discovery in June 2000 of a huge sunken wreck in Indonesian waters, with the largest collection of porcelain ever found.\n\nIf the project ever does go forward, divers will use some combination of sub-bottom profilers, personal mounted sonar, night vision devices, and copper sulphate detectors to locate the bell (since the mud around all that bronze would be expected to have a high concentration of copper sulphate). About nine months after the survey they expect to lift the bell from the river. To do this, they will have to build a small version of a North Sea oil platform in the muddy rapids of the confluence of two rivers, and assemble a large crane to lift the bell out of the water. Once it is lifted, they will construct a railway to transport it uphill about half a mile to the Shwedagon Pagoda. This final operation will take about four months.\n\nIn July 2010, the \"Myanmar Times\" reported an Australian documentary filmmaker and explorer Damien Lay to be another foreigner who had decided to take it up as his new project. Lay and his team, conducted extensive side scan sonar surveys and diving operations, covering approximately four square kilometers of river floor in the area where it was believed the bell may be located. Lay and his team, identified and confirmed the presence of fourteen shipwrecks in the area where the bell is believed to be located. Lay and his team identified two significant targets and acquired sonar imagery of both the bell and the galleon ship. Both targets are visible to sonar and resting on the sea floor. The location of these targets has not been released. Both targets are well outside the area where the bell was previously thought to be. Lay had stated that the location of the bell was not where most people thought, that the myths and legends surrounding the location of the bell was not supported by evidence and that the location of the bell had been significantly overlooked by the misinterpretation of the history. \"The location of the bell was quite surprising\", Lay said.\n\nLay had conducted the bell search as part of the Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition, an ongoing operation privately funded operation conducted over the past eight years by Lay. The bell search was conducted as return to gesture to people and Government of Myanmar for their assistance and support in allowing Lay to search for and recover the wreckage of the \"Lady Southern Cross\" and remains of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and John Thompson \"Tommy\" Pethybridge, who disappeared off the coast of Myanmar on November 8, 1935.\n\nPrevious attempts to locate the bell, by both domestic and foreign teams since 1987, either failed or did not materialize. Some treasures from the Shwedagon, part of the loot, are also believed to be there guarded by \"nat\" spirits, and some locals have claimed to have sighted the bell surfacing on a full moon night.\n\nAt the end of June 2012, the Historical Research Department of the Ministry of Culture and SD Mark International LLP Co of Singapore held a workshop in Yangon for a renewed attempt with the Singaporean firm pledging USD 10 million for the non-profit project.\n\nIn August 2014, searcher San Linn claimed that the bell has been found and that preparations were being made for salvaging it and bringing it to land shortly. However, these claims were found to be false, and searches for the bell continue.\n\n"}
{"id": "14612945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14612945", "title": "Hiragasy", "text": "Hiragasy\n\nThe \"hiragasy\" (\"hira\": song; \"gasy\": Malagasy) is a musical tradition in Madagascar and particularly among the Merina ethnic group of the Highland regions around the capital of Antananarivo. \nThe hiragasy is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and \"kabary\" oratory performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes.\n\nThe tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince Andrianampoinimerina first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches (\"kabary\"); these troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances. The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval. Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.\n\nAfter independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands. Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning. While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar Rossy authored his 1995 song \"Lera.\" The song was critical of the Zafy regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment. The most famous troupe is Ramilison Fenoarivo, Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.\n\nThe performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar. Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching lamba cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the Imperial period); and which instruments are used. Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned. Instead, the most common instruments are violins, trumpets, and snare and bass drums; the sodina, accordion, kabosy or clarinet may occasionally make an appearance.\n\nHiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of kabary. \n1. The Sasitehaka: Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm. The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.\n2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary): One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle. He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (\"indray miditra\") of the show through \"kabary\" - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating ohabolana (proverbs). \n3. The Renihira (Queen Song): The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them. This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions. \n4. The Dihy (Dance): The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes. A kabary (\"kabarindihy\") is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it. There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed. The true \"Dihy\" is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts. The \"Tsikandihy\" or \"Dihy Irery\" is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer. The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.\n5. The Zanakira or Vakodrazana: A short performance lasting approximately 20 minutes that concludes the spectacle.\n\nWhen two or more troupes are competing, each troupe takes its turn at each stage before all proceed to the next stage of the performance. The troupes may all complete the entire cycle (this first round is termed the Vakisehatra) before repeating the entire process in a second round with a new set of themes (the second round being known as the Adi-Kiha) before all conclude with the Vakodrazana. In these competitive performances, troupes may have as many as three or more themes to explore and the competition may last from early morning until nightfall.\n\n"}

{"id": "1032620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1032620", "title": "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", "text": "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids is a 1989 American comic science fiction film. The directorial debut of Joe Johnston and produced by Walt Disney Pictures, it tells the story of an inventor who accidentally shrinks his and his next door neighbor's kids to a quarter of an inch with his electromagnetic shrinking machine and accidentally throws them out with the trash, where they must venture into their backyard to return home while fending off insects and other obstacles.\n\nRick Moranis stars as Wayne Szalinski, the inventor who accidentally shrinks his kids, Amy (Amy O'Neill) and Nick (Robert Oliveri). Marcia Strassman portrays his wife, Diane, to whom he delivers the titular line. Matt Frewer, Kristine Sutherland, Thomas Wilson Brown, and Jared Rushton star as Russ, Mae, Russ Jr., and Ron Thompson, the Szalinskis' next door neighbors.\n\nThe film became an unexpected box office success, grossing in excess of $222 million worldwide, and became the highest-grossing live-action Disney film ever, a record it held for five years. It was met with positive reviews from both critics and audiences, who praised the story, visuals and innovation. Its success spawned two sequels \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\" in 1992 and the direct-to-video \"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves\" in 1997, which both received mixed critical reception, as well as leading to the creation of a that ran from 1997 to 2000.\n\nScientist and inventor Wayne Szalinski lives in his suburban home attempting to perfect a ray gun capable of shrinking objects, but it keeps blowing up the apples he uses as test subjects instead. After an argument between him and his wife, Diane, she spent the previous night with her mother and is currently at work, worrying their daughter, Amy, and son, Nick, who has inherited Wayne's inventive ingenuity and intelligence. Their next door neighbors, the Thompsons, are getting ready for a fishing trip, but their oldest son, Russ Jr., is less than enthusiastic, as his and Russ' interests often clash, resulting in him feeling belittled, and he is more interested in meeting Amy than spending the weekend camping. Their younger son, Ron, however, is enthusiastic, though his relationship with Russ is strained when he inadvertently sets off a booby trap in the yard.\n\nWayne instructs Amy and Nick to clean the house in preparation for Diane's return before leaving for his conference. Nick is assigned to mow the lawn, but he makes a deal to let his friend, Tommy Pervis, do it with the remote-controlled lawnmower, but he (Tommy) has to leave and promises to do it later. Later, Ron accidentally hits his baseball through the Szalinskis' attic window, which inadvertently activates the machine and blocks its targeting laser. Caught by Russ Jr., he is made to confess to Amy and Nick, and Amy has Nick take Ron to retrieve the ball and pay for the window. They come upon the machine and are hit by its beam, thus shrinking them. \n\nAt his conference, Wayne is laughed at for failing to provide proof of his shrinking machine and leaves in frustration, while back at home Amy and Russ Jr. go to check on Ron and Nick and are shrunk by the ray as well. When Wayne returns home, they try to get his attention, but their voices are too small and he is unable to hear them. Frustrated by his day and the broken window he discovers, he takes it out on the machine, damaging it and nearly crushing the kids with the fragments. He then sweeps the debris (and the kids) into a dust pan and takes them out in a trash bag. They escape from it, but are forced to cross the uncut yard's wilderness to get back to the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Diane returns home and she and Wayne make up, but they soon grow concerned about Amy and Nick. While trying to summon their dog, Quark, Nick falls into a flower, he and Russ Jr. are carried away by a pollen picking honey bee, and are nearly killed by Wayne as he tries to swat it with a baseball bat, causing it to crash land. Wayne realizes that a baseball was what caused the attic window to break since Nick doesn't play sports. Once there, he realizes what happened to the kids; afraid to step on the lawn, he uses stilts to search for them and accidentally activates the sprinklers, which causes chaotic torrents to come down on them. Amy nearly drowns when she is knocked into a pool of mud, but Russ Jr. saves her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. \n\nMeanwhile, Wayne arranges a sling to hover over the lawn and search for the kids. Next door, Russ and Mae are forced to call off their trip because their sons haven't returned yet, and they call the police to report them missing. Wayne tells Diane about what happened to the kids, and she joins in the search after a short panic attack. Eventually, she convinces Wayne to tell Russ and Mae, who are extremely skeptical. Russ angrily threatens Wayne, but leaves his porch light on just in case.\n\nSoon, the kids' hunger is saved by one of Nick's oatmeal creme cookies, but their meal is interrupted by an ant scouting it. Ron decides to tame it in order to take them home. Soon they grow attached to \"Antie\" and try to set him free, but he instead decides to follow Ron like a loyal pet. The kids find a Lego to camp in for the night, and after a heartfelt conversation about their feelings for each other, Russ Jr. and Amy kiss. However, they are attacked by a scorpion, which traps Ron in the Lego. Nick tells the others to hurry. Antie comes to rescue Ron, but is fatally stung before the kids unite and wound the scorpion, driving it off.\n\nThe next morning, Tommy returns to mow the lawn. Nick recognizes the danger and they run, seeking shelter in an earthworm burrow; Wayne and Diane stop Tommy just in time to save the kids, who are blown out of the burrow by the lawnmower's blades. Quark chances upon them, and while riding him into the house, Nick loses his grip and falls into Wayne's bowl of Cheerios; he is nearly eaten before Quark bites Wayne in the ankle, making him aware of Nick and the others' presence.\n\nBack in the attic, the kids make Wayne realize that the laser was generating too much heat, causing things to blow up, until it was blocked by the baseball. He corrects the mistake, and Russ volunteers as a subject for a successful test. The kids are then returned to their normal sizes and reunited with their parents. Months later, at Thanksgiving, the Szalinskis and Thompsons, now close friends, are toasting over an enlarged turkey. Russ Jr. and Amy are apparently dating now, while Ron and Nick are friends, and Quark is eating from an enlarged Alpo bone. Nick finally gets a joke that Russ Jr. told him about learning CPR in \"French\" class, at which he laughs.\n\n\nThe project was originally brought to Disney Studios by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna. Gordon was hired to direct the film and Yuzna to produce. The film was written as \"Teeny Weenies\" by Stuart Gordon, Ed Naha, and Brian Yuzna. Tom Schulman was later added as a screenwriter. Gordon originally prepped the film but had to drop out as director shortly before filming began due to illness. Joe Johnston was brought in to replace him.\n\nAs \"Teeny Weenies\" seemed to appeal more to a child demographic, the name was changed to \"Grounded\" to appeal to a more mature audience. That name was later rejected in favour of \"The Big Backyard\". \n\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\", a line of dialogue from the film, ultimately became its title.\n\nThe film was heavily influenced by '50s fare such as \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\".\n\nJudy Taylor, Mike Fenton, and Lynda Gordon were the casting directors. Before Rick Moranis was cast as Wayne Szalinski, the script was written with Chevy Chase in mind because of his popularity in \"National Lampoon's Vacation\". He was filming the second sequel, \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\", and was too busy to portray Wayne.\n\nJohn Candy was also considered for the role of Wayne. He declined, but suggested to director Joe Johnston that his friend, (and costar of \"SCTV\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and \"Spaceballs\"), Rick Moranis, would be a good choice. Marcia Strassman portrays Wayne's wife, Diane, who is having marital troubles with him.\n\nMatt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland portray Russ and Mae Thompson, the Szalinskis' next door neighbors and parents of Russ Jr. and Ron. Russ is very demanding of Russ Jr. and can't understand why he isn't more interested in masculine things such as football and fishing (until the end of the film, when he learns to accept him for who he is). He is dimwitted and clumsy and secretly takes to cigarettes when he is nervous or scared. On the other hand, Mae is a very nice person and friendly with the Szalinskis.\n\nThe film needed four teenagers to play the leads. Russ Jr., portrayed by Thomas Wilson Brown seems to be interested in Amy, and less in football, while Ron, Jared Rushton, appears to be more straightforward and a bully toward Nick, though he warms towards him. Rushton has quoted that he took the role after thinking that the script was \"appealing\" and he thought his character had progressed throughout the film with his personality.\n\nAmy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri were cast as Amy and Nick Szalinski, Wayne and Diane's kids. Oliveri commented that he was in awe about watching his stunt double do his stunts. He later starred as Kevin Boggs in Tim Burton's \"Edward Scissorhands\". O'Neill thought the film was a fun experience and that doing off-set activities, such as swimming or playing cards, was fun to do with the other younger cast members. She accepted the role because it was a \"Disney movie\".\n\nJoe Johnston was selected to direct the film for his directorial debut, having been mostly working on films as an effects illustrator and art director. It was filmed at the backlot of Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. Gregg Fonseca was the production designer and was in charge of managing several different sets for the scenes in it.\n\nSome filming took place in and around Beverly Hills, California. In the scene where Diane walks out of the mall to the pay phone, a sign says \"Beverly Hills Mall\". It is unclear if the whole film takes place there or just that scene, as this contradicts one assertion in the sequel that Wayne was originally from, and thus the Szalinski residence depicted in this one is in Fresno.\n\nSpecial effects were heavily used for the film, such as the electronically controlled ants and bees. For the most part, the production team tried to use practical effects that would work in camera. For the scene where Wayne lands in the Thompsons' pool, Moranis jumped off a flying board in the form of a teeter-totter on a swing set. A stuntman pushed the board, sending him flying through the air and landing on a mat.\nNumerous storyboards were used for the film, particularly in the sprinkler and bee scenes. Scale models were also used for the bee scene, with miniature Russ Jr. and Nick plastic figures attached. Forced perspective was used in the giant cookie scene, to make it seem bigger. The child actors were strapped in for the scene with the broom. The bristles were actually pieces of foam that were carved and tied to a rig system.\n\nThe film opened on June 23, 1989, in 1,498 theatres. It opened at #2 on opening night, behind \"Batman\", with a total of $14,262,961. It earned $130,724,172 domestic and $92,000,000 overseas, earning a grand total of $222,724,172. Attached to it was Disney and Amblin Entertainment's first Roger Rabbit short, \"Tummy Trouble\", executively produced by Steven Spielberg, produced by Don Hahn, directed by Rob Minkoff, and also composed by James Horner.\n\nThe film has earned a 75% \"fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. Caryn James, of \"The New York Times\", gave a positive review, saying: \"As sweet, funny, and straightforward as its title.\" \"Variety\" gave another positive review stating, \"[It's] in the best tradition of Disney -- and even better than that, because it is not so juvenile that adults won't be thoroughly entertained.\" A rare negative review came from Roger Ebert, of the \"Chicago Sun Times\", who stated: \"The special effects are all there, nicely in place, and the production values are sound, but the movie is dead in the water.\"\n\nJames Horner won an ASCAP Award for Top Box Office Films and was also nominated for a Saturn Award. The film was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Thomas Wilson Brown, Jared Rushton, Robert Oliveri and the Special Effects Crew were also nominated for a Saturn Award. The Special Effects Crew won a BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects. Amy O'Neill and Jared Rushton were each nominated for a Young Artist Award and director Joe Johnston was nominated for a Fantasporto Award.\n\nThe film was presented in the \"100 Greatest Family Films\", in which Amy O'Neill and Thomas Wilson Brown talked about it for MTV.\n\nAfter years without releasing James Horner's soundtrack to the film, Intrada Records released it on March 6, 2009. The song that Amy dances to in the kitchen is \"Turn It Up\" by Nick Kamen, written by Jeffrey Pescetto and Patrick DeRemer.\n\nThe soundtrack was limited to a 3,000 copies release. Horner's main title music incorporates cues from the score by Nino Rota from Federico Fellini's film \"Amarcord\" (1973) and Raymond Scott’s piece \"Powerhouse B\" (1937), the latter often referenced in Carl Stalling’s Warner Bros. cartoon scores. Scott's piece was used without payment or credit, leading his estate to threaten legal action against Disney. Disney paid an undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement and changed the film's cue sheets to credit Scott. Horner’s main title music underscores all the major moments involving Szalinski’s technology.\n\nWith 15 tracks, Horner produced the record with longtime engineer Simon Rhodes while it was originally performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\nIn 1992, Disney released the first sequel, \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\", with Moranis, Strassman, O'Neill, and Oliveri reprising their roles as Wayne, Diane, Amy and Nick Szalinski. As the title suggests, Wayne succeeds in enlarging his two-year-old son, Adam, to gigantic proportions as one of his size-changing experiments goes awry.\n\nA three-dimensional film called \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience\" complete with physical effects such as wind and water was created as an attraction at Walt Disney World's Epcot in 1994, and later Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. It is a mock award show by \"The Imagination Institute\" that is intended to honor Wayne as \"Inventor of the Year\". Instead, the audience is \"shrunk\" and threatened by Quark, Gigabyte (Nick's pet python), Diane, and even Adam, among other thrills. It reprises most of the original cast and adds Eric Idle as the host of the award show. It is currently closed at all of its locations due to the return of \"Captain EO\" (which was originally replaced by it in 1994). Currently no return dates have been confirmed.\n\nIn 1997, Disney produced the second sequel, \"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves\", as a direct to video release. Rick Moranis was the only returning actor from the previous films who reprised his role, with Amy and Nick having gone off to college and Quark's disappearance never being explained. Many new characters were added such as Wayne's brother, Gordon, and his family. This time, the parents are shrunk and need to be rescued by their kids.\n\nThe last incarnation of the franchise was the television program \"\". Peter Scolari took over as Wayne and Nick and Amy both returned as characters, roughly the same age as in the original film, and played by new actors.

It was tasked with preserving the \"traditional genius\" of the country; among other things, the native Ethiopic script and the literary and scholarly tradition it enabled, as well as the \"promotion of research in languages and fine arts\".\n\nIn 1956 Emperor Haile Selassie promulgated a decree chartering the Academy as an independent organisation. The Academy, as a single body, eventually ceased to operate during the time of the Derg regime in the 1980s, although some of its constituent organizations have persisted- directly or indirectly- to the present.\n\nAt the time of its foundation, the Academy comprised three subsidiary groups: The Language and Literature Council, the Fine Arts Council, and the Science and Technology Council. \n\nThe role of the Language and Literature Council, after its establishment, over time shifted from the academic study of languages and literature towards that of a Language regulator (i.e. the \"Académie française\" or the \"Real Academia Española\") for the Amharic language. In light of this, it was reorganised into the National Academy of the Amharic Language in 1972. It was charged with setting the national language policy as to \"foster the growth of the Amharic language\" and to \"encourage the development of its literature\". To this end, it designed a programme of spelling reform (albeit unimplemented), published compilations of Ethiopian proverbs (in multiple language), volumes of translated Ge'ez-language poetry, technical and bi-lingual dictionaries, and multiple professional journals.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the imperial government by the left-wing \"Derg\" (Coordinating Council of the Armed Forces) in the 1974 coup d'état and the installation of a socialist military government, the Language Academy was seen as a chauvinistic vehicle of linguistic imperialism, and one that favoured of the tongue of the ruling elite at the expense of the country's eight dozen other languages and dialects. As a result, in 1979 it was transformed into the Academy of Ethiopian Languages under the Ministry of Culture and Sport, whose regulatory remit extended to all Ethiopian languages. It had four academic subcommittees: lexicography, linguistics, terminology, and literature- both written and oral (the inclusion of the latter signifying a significant break with the prior emphasis on Ge'ez and its literary tradition).\n\nIt continued to operate after the fall of the military regime as an independent organization until 1997, when it became a research body of Addis Ababa University, known as the Ethiopian Languages Research Centre until 2010, when it was restored to the status of an autonomous academy and language regulator and renamed as Academy of Ethiopian Languages and Cultures. In 2013, however, the entirely separate Regional Somali Language Academy, based in Djibouti, was set up by multinational agreement- including Ethiopia- as the international regulator of Somali language.\n\nThe Fine Arts Council, later the Academy of Fine Arts, counted, among others, Baalu Girma, Afewerk Tekle, and Ashenafi Kebede as members. It had ceased to operate by the time of the fall of the Derg in 1991.\n\nThe Science and Technology Council, later the Academy of Sciences and Technology, became defunct some time during the rule of the Derg. However, it can be considered to have a partial successor in the form of the Ethiopian Academy of Sciences, which was founded in 2010 following the efforts of academics, such as the historian , over several years to establish such an organisation. Its mission was declared as to \"advance the development of all the sciences, including the natural sciences, mathematics, the health sciences, agricultural sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities, fine arts and letters, making its envisioned scope closer to that of the entire Imperial Academy than just the sciences.\n\n"}
{"id": "10739609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10739609", "title": "Influence and reception of Friedrich Nietzsche", "text": "Influence and reception of Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche's influence and reception varied widely and may be roughly divided into various chronological periods. Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early.\n\nBeginning while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness, many Germans discovered his appeals for greater heroic individualism and personality development in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", but responded to those appeals in diverging ways. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890. Nietzsche's anarchistic influence was particularly strong in France and the United States. \n\nBy World War I, German soldiers even received copies of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" as gifts during World War I. The Dreyfus Affair provides another example of his reception: the French anti-semitic Right labelled the Jewish and leftist intellectuals who defended Alfred Dreyfus as \"Nietzscheans\". Such seemingly paradoxical acceptance by diametrically opposed camps is typical of the history of the reception of Nietzsche's thought. In the context of the rise of French fascism, one researcher notes, \"Although, as much recent work has stressed, Nietzsche had an important impact on \"leftist\" French ideology and theory, this should not obscure the fact that his work was also crucial to the right and to the neither right nor left fusions of developing French fascism.\n\nIndeed, as Ernst Nolte proposed, Maurrassian ideology of \"aristocratic revolt against egalitarian-utopian 'transcendence'\" (transcendence being Nolte's term for the ontological absence of theodic center justifying modern \"emancipation culture\"), the interrelation between Nietzschean ideology and proto-fascism offer extensive space for criticism and the Nietzschean ambiance pervading French ideological fermentation of extremism in time birthing formal fascism, is unavoidable.\n\nMany political leaders of the 20th century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas. However, it is not always possible to determine whether or not they actually read his work. Regarding Hitler, for example, there is a debate. Some authors claim that he probably never read Nietzsche, or that if he did, his reading was not extensive. Hitler more than likely became familiar with Nietzsche quotes during his time in Vienna when quotes by Nietzsche were frequently published in pan-German newspapers. Nevertheless, others point to a quote in \"Hitler's Table Talk\", where the dictator mentioned Nietzsche when he spoke about what he called \"great men\", as an indication that Hitler may have been familiarized with Nietzsche's work. Other authors like Melendez (2001) point out to the parallels between Hitler's and Nietzsche's titanic anti-egalitarianism, and the idea of the \"übermensch\", a term which was frequently used by Hitler and Mussolini to refer to the so-called \"Aryan race\", or rather, its projected future after fascist engineering.\nAlfred Rosenberg, an influential Nazi ideologist, also delivered a speech in which he related National Socialism to Nietzsche's ideology. Broadly speaking, despite Nietzsche's hostility towards anti-semitism and nationalism, the Nazis made very selective use of Nietzsche's philosophy, and eventually, this association caused Nietzsche's reputation to suffer following World War II.\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that Mussolini early on heard lectures about Nietzsche, Vilfred Pareto, and others in ideologically forming fascism. A girlfriend of Mussolini, Margherita Sarfatti, who was Jewish, relates that Nietzsche virtually was the transforming factor in Mussolini's \"conversion\" from hard socialism to spiritualistic, ascetic fascism,: \"In 1908 he presented his conception of the superman's role in modern society in a writing on Nietzsche entitled, \"The Philosophy of Force.\"\n\nNietzsche's influence on Continental philosophy increased dramatically after the Second World War.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Nietzsche was frequently associated with anarchist movements, in spite of the fact that in his writings he definitely holds a negative view of egalitarian anarchists. Nevertheless, Nietzsche's ideas generated strong interest from key figures from the historical anarchist movement which began in the 1890s. According to a recent study, \"Gustav Landauer, Emma Goldman and others reflected on the chances offered and the dangers posed by these ideas in relation to their own politics. Heated debates over meaning, for example on the will to power or on the status of women in Nietzsche’s works, provided even the most vehement critics such as Peter Kropotkin with productive cues for developing their own theories. In recent times, a newer strand called post-anarchism has invoked Nietzsche’s ideas, while also disregarding the historical variants of Nietzschean anarchism. This calls into question the innovative potential of post-anarchism.\"\n\nSome hypothesize on certain grounds Nietzsche's violent stance against anarchism may (at least partially) be the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of Max Stirner. Thus far, no plagiarism has been detected at all, but a probable concealed influence in his formative years.\n\nSpencer Sunshine writes \"There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of \"herds\"; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the state on cultural production; his desire for an \"overman\" — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, \"Yes\" to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the \"transvaluation of values\" as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history.\" Lacking in Nietzsche is the anarchist utopian-egalitarian belief that every soul is capable of epic greatness: Nietzsche's aristocratic elitism is the death-knell of any Nietzschean conventional anarchism. \n\nAccording to Sunshine: \"The list is not limited to culturally oriented anarchists such as Emma Goldman, who gave dozens of lectures about Nietzsche and baptized him as an honorary anarchist. Pro-Nietzschean anarchists also include prominent Spanish CNT–FAI members in the 1930s such as Salvador Seguí and anarcha-feminist Federica Montseny; anarcho-syndicalist militants like Rudolf Rocker; and even the younger Murray Bookchin, who cited Nietzsche's conception of the 'transvaluation of values' in support of the Spanish anarchist project.\" Also in European individualist anarchist circles his influence is clear in thinker/activists such as Emile Armand and Renzo Novatore among others. Also more recently in post-left anarchy, Nietzsche is present in the thought of Hakim Bey and Wolfi Landstreicher.\n\nThe Italian and German fascist regimes were eager to lay claim to Nietzsche's ideas, and to position themselves as inspired by them. In 1932, Nietzsche's sister, Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, received a bouquet of roses from Adolf Hitler during a German premiere of Benito Mussolini's \"100 Days\", and in 1934 Hitler personally presented her with a wreath for Nietzsche's grave carrying the words \"To A Great Fighter\". Also in 1934, Elisabeth gave to Hitler Nietzsche's favorite walking stick, and Hitler was photographed gazing into the eyes of a white marble bust of Nietzsche. Heinrich Hoffmann's popular biography \"Hitler as Nobody Knows Him\" (which sold nearly a half-million copies by 1938) featured this photo with the caption reading: \"The Führer before the bust of the German philosopher whose ideas have fertilized two great popular movements: the national socialist of Germany and the fascist of Italy.\"\n\nNietzsche was no less popular among French fascists, perhaps with more doctrinal truthfulness, as Robert S. Wistrich has pointed out\nThe \"fascist\" Nietzsche was above all considered to be a heroic opponent of necrotic Enlightenment \"rationality\" and a kind of spiritual vitalist, who had glorified war and violence in an age of herd-lemming shopkeepers, inspiring the anti-Marxist revolutions of the interwar period. According to the French fascist Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, it was the Nietzschean emphasis on the autotelic power of the Will that inspired the mystic voluntarism and political activism of his comrades. Such politicized readings were vehemently rejected by another French writer, the socialo-communist anarchist Georges Bataille, who in the 1930s sought to establish (in ambiguous success) the \"radical incompatibility\" between Nietzsche (as a thinker who abhorred mass politics) and \"the fascist reactionaries.\" He argued that nothing was more alien to Nietzsche than the pan-Germanism, racism, militarism and anti-Semitism of the Nazis, into whose service the German philosopher had been pressed. Bataille here was sharp-witted but combined half-truths without his customary dialectical finesse.\nThe German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who was (with great harm to his subsequent reputation) an active member of the Nazi Party, himself noted that everyone in his day was either 'for' or 'against' Nietzsche while claiming that this thinker heard a \"command to reflect on the essence of a planetary domination.\" Alan D. Schrift cites this passage and writes, \"That Heidegger sees Nietzsche heeding a command to reflect and prepare for earthly domination is of less interest to me than his noting that everyone thinks in terms of a position for or against Nietzsche. In particular, the gesture of setting up 'Nietzsche' as a battlefield on which to take one's stand against or to enter into competition with the ideas of one's intellectual predecessors or rivals has happened quite frequently in the twentieth century.\"\n\nMarching in ideological warfare against the arrows from Bataille, Thomas Mann, the far more centrist Albert Camus and others, the Nazi movement, despite Nietzsche' virulent hatred of both volkist-populist socialist and nationalism (\"national socialism\"), did, in certain of its emphases, share an affinity with Nietzsche's ideas, including his ferocious attacks against democracy, egalitarianism, the communistic-socialistic social model, popular Christianity, parliamentary government, and a number of other things. In \"The Will to Power\" Nietzsche praised – sometimes metaphorically, other times both metaphorically and literally – the sublimity of war and warriors, and heralded an international ruling race that would become the \"lords of the earth\". Here Nietzsche was referring to pan-Europeanism of a Caesarist type, positively embracing Jews, not a Germanic master race but a neo-imperial elite of culturally refined \"redeemers\" of humanity, otherwise wretched and plebeian and ugly in its mindless existence.\n\nThe Nazis appropriated, or rather received also inspiration in this case, from Nietzsche's extremely old-fashioned and semi-feudal views on women: Nietzsche despised modern feminism, along with democracy and socialism, as mere egalitarian leveling movements of nihilism. He forthrightly declared, \"Man shall be trained for war and woman for the procreation of the warrior, anything else is folly\"; and was indeed unified with the Nazi world-view at least in terms of the social role of women: \"They belong in the kitchen and their chief role in life is to beget children for German warriors.\" Here is one area where Nietzsche indeed did not contradict the Nazis in his politics of \"aristocratic radicalism.\"\n\nDuring the interbellum years, certain Nazis had employed a highly selective reading of Nietzsche's work to advance their ideology, notably Alfred Baeumler, who strikingly omitted the fact of Nietzsche's anti-socialism and anti-nationalism (for Nietzsche, both equally contemptible mass herd movements of modernity) in his reading of \"The Will to Power\". The era of Nazi rule (1933–1945) saw Nietzsche's writings widely studied in German (and, after 1938, Austrian) schools and universities. Despite the fact that Nietzsche had expressed his disgust with plebeian-volkist anti-Semitism and supremacist German nationalism in the most forthright terms possible (e.g. he resolved \"to have nothing to do with anyone involved in the perfidious race-fraud\"), phrases like \"the will to power\" became common in Nazi circles. The wide popularity of Nietzsche among Nazis stemmed in part from the endeavors of his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the editor of Nietzsche's work after his 1889 breakdown, and an eventual Nazi sympathizer. Mazzino Montinari, while editing Nietzsche's posthumous works in the 1960s, found that Förster-Nietzsche, while editing the posthumous fragments making up \"The Will to Power\", had cut extracts, changed their order, quoted him out of context, etc.\n\nNietzsche's reception among the more intellectually percipient or zealous fascists was not universally warm. For example, one \"rabidly Nazi writer, Curt von Westernhagen, who announced in his book \"Nietzsche, Juden, Antijuden\" (1936) that the time had come to expose the 'defective personality of Nietzsche whose inordinate tributes for, and espousal of, Jews had caused him to depart from the Germanic principles enunciated by Meister Richard Wagner'.\"\nThe real problem with the labelling of Nietzsche as a fascist, or worse, a Nazi, is that it ignores the fact that Nietzsche's aristocratism seeks to revive an older conception of politics, one which he locates in Greek \"agon\" which [...] has striking affinities with the philosophy of action expounded in our own time by Hannah Arendt. Once an affinity like this is appreciated, the absurdity of describing Nietzsche's political thought as 'fascist', or Nazi, becomes readily apparent.\nJacob Golomb observed, \"Nietzsche's ideas were widely disseminated among and appropriated by the first Hebrew Zionist writers and leaders.\" According to Steven Aschheim, \"Classical Zionism, that essentially secular and modernizing movement, was acutely aware of the crisis of Jewish tradition and its supporting institutions. Nietzsche was enlisted as an authority for articulating the movement's ruptured relationship with the past and a force in its drive to normalization and its activist ideal of self-creating Hebraic New Man.\"\n\nFrancis R. Nicosia notes, \"At the height of his fame between 1895 and 1902, some of Nietzsche's ideas seemed to have a particular resonance for some Zionists, including Theodore Herzl.\" Among many other facts that show Herzl had a serious interest in Nietzsche, at least for a time (including the fact that under his editorship the \"Neue Freie Presse\" dedicated seven consecutive issues to Nietzsche obituaries), Golomb points out that Herzl's cousin Raoul Auernheimer claimed, in a memorial tribute, that Herzl was familiar with Nietzsche and had \"absorbed his style\".\n\nOn the other hand, Gabriel Sheffer suggests that Herzl was too bourgeois and too eager to be accepted into mainstream society to be much of a (even if \"aristocratic\") revolutionary, and hence could not have been strongly influenced by Nietzsche, but remarks, \"Some East European Jewish intellectuals, such as the writers Yosef Hayyim Brenner and Micha Josef Berdyczewski, followed after Herzl because they thought that Zionism offered the chance for a Nietzschean 'transvaluation of values' within Jewry\". Nietzsche also influenced Theodor Lessing.\n\nMartin Buber was fascinated by Nietzsche, whom he praised as a heroic figure, and he strove to introduce \"a Nietzschean perspective into Zionist affairs.\" In 1901, Buber, who had just been appointed the editor of \"Die Welt\", the primary publication of the World Zionist Organization, published a poem in \"Zarathustrastil\" ( a style reminiscent of Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\") calling for the return of Jewish literature, art and scholarship.\n\nHowever, praise for Nietzsche was not by any means universal among Zionists. Max Nordau, an early Zionist orator and controversial racial anthropologist, insisted that Nietzsche had been insane since birth, and advocated \"branding his disciples [...] as hysterical and imbecile.\"\n\nCarl Jung, the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology, recognized Nietzsche's profundity early on. \"From the time Jung first became gripped by Nietzsche’s ideas as a student in Basel to his days as a leading figure in the psychoanalytic movement, Jung read, and increasingly developed, his own thought in a dialogue with the work of Nietzsche. … Untangling the exact influence of Nietzsche on Jung, however, is a complicated business. Jung never openly addressed the exact influence Nietzsche had on his own concepts, and when he did link his own ideas to Nietzsche’s, he almost never made it clear whether the idea in question was inspired by Nietzsche or whether he merely discovered the parallel at a later stage.\" In 1934, Jung held a lengthy and insightful seminar on Nietzsche's \"Zarathustra\". In 1936, Jung explained that Germans of the present day had been \"seized\" or possessed by the psychic force known in Germanic mythology as Wotan, \"the god of storm and frenzy, the unleasher of passions and the lust of battle\"—Wotan being synonymous with Nietzsche's Dionysus, Jung said. A 12th-century stick found among the Bryggen inscriptions, Bergen, Norway bears a runic message by which the population called upon Thor and Wotan for help: Thor is asked to receive the reader, and Wotan to \"own\" them. \"Nietzsche provided Jung both with the terminology (the Dionysian) and the case study (Zarathustra as an example of the Dionysian at work in the psyche) to help him put into words his thoughts about the spirit of his own age: an age confronted with an uprush of the Wotanic/Dionysian spirit in the collective unconscious. This, in a nutshell, is how Jung came to see Nietzsche, and explains why he was so fascinated by Nietzsche as a thinker.\"\n\nNietzsche had also an important influence on psychotherapist and founder of the school of individual psychology Alfred Adler. According to Ernest Jones, biographer and personal acquaintance of Sigmund Freud, Freud frequently referred to Nietzsche as having \"more penetrating knowledge of himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live\". Yet Jones also reports that Freud emphatically denied that Nietzsche's writings influenced his own psychological discoveries; in the 1890s, Freud, whose education at the University of Vienna in the 1870s had included a strong relationship with Franz Brentano, his teacher in philosophy, from whom he had acquired an enthusiasm for Aristotle and Ludwig Feuerbach, was acutely aware of the possibility of convergence of his own ideas with those of Nietzsche and doggedly refused to read the philosopher as a result. In his excoriating — but also sympathetic — critique of psychoanalysis, \"The Psychoanalytic Movement\", Ernest Gellner depicts Nietzsche as setting out the conditions for elaborating a realistic psychology, in contrast with the eccentrically implausible Enlightenment psychology of Hume and Smith, and assesses the success of Freud and the psychoanalytic movement as in large part based upon its success in meeting this \"Nietzschean minimum\".\n\nEarly twentieth-century thinkers who read or were influenced by Nietzsche include: philosophers Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ernst Jünger, Theodor Adorno, Georg Brandes, Martin Buber, Karl Jaspers, Henri Bergson, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Leo Strauss, Michel Foucault, Julius Evola, Emil Cioran, Miguel de Unamuno, Lev Shestov, Ayn Rand, José Ortega y Gasset Rudolf Steiner and Muhammad Iqbal; sociologists Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber; composers Richard Strauss, Alexander Scriabin, Gustav Mahler, and Frederick Delius; historians Oswald Spengler, Fernand Braudel and Paul Veyne, theologians Paul Tillich and Thomas J.J. Altizer; the occultists Aleister Crowley; and Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff. Novelists Franz Kafka, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, André Malraux, Nikos Kazantzakis, André Gide, Knut Hamsun, August Strindberg, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence and Vladimir Bartol; psychologists Sigmund Freud, Otto Gross, C. G. Jung, Alfred Adler, Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, Rollo May and Kazimierz Dąbrowski; poets John Davidson, Rainer Maria Rilke, Wallace Stevens and William Butler Yeats; painters Salvador Dalí, Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko; playwrights George Bernard Shaw, Antonin Artaud, August Strindberg, and Eugene O'Neill; and authors H. P. Lovecraft, Olaf Stapledon, Menno ter Braak, Richard Wright, Robert E. Howard, and Jack London. American writer H. L. Mencken avidly read and translated Nietzsche's works and has gained the sobriquet \"the American Nietzsche\". Mencken presented in his book on Nietzsche the \"hard Nietzsche\" little-known today; Nietzsche's actual, realistic philosophy of anti-egalitarian aristocratic revolution, Mencken's work standing in contrast positively to the \"post-modernist\" theoreticians of \"linguistic schizo-analysis today\", who try to turn Nietzsche into an all-American liberal without fangs. Nietzsche was declared an anarchist by Emma Goldman rather disputably, and he influenced other anarchists such as Guy Aldred, Rudolf Rocker, Max Cafard and John Moore.\n\nThe popular conservative writer, philosopher, poet, journalist and theological apologist of Catholicism G. K. Chesterton expressed contempt for Nietzsche's ideas, deeming his philosophy basically a poison or death-wish of Western culture:\n\nThomas Mann's essays mention Nietzsche with respect and even adoration, although one of his final essays, \"Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Light of Recent History\", looks at his favorite philosopher through the lens of Nazism and World War II and ends up placing Nietzsche at a more critical distance. Many of Nietzsche's ideas, particularly on artists and aesthetics, are incorporated and explored throughout Mann's works. The theme of the aesthetic justification of existence Nietzsche introduced from his earliest writings, in \"The Birth of Tragedy\" declaring sublime art as the only metaphysical consolation of existence; and in the context of fascism and Nazism, the Nietzschean aestheticization of politics void of morality and ordered by caste hierarchy in service of the creative caste, has posed many problems and questions for thinkers in contemporary times. One of the characters in Mann's 1947 novel \"Doktor Faustus\" represents Nietzsche fictionally. In 1938 the German existentialist Karl Jaspers wrote the following about the influence of Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard:\n\nBertrand Russell in his \"History of Western Philosophy\" was scathing in his chapter on Nietzsche, calling his work the \"mere power-phantasies of an invalid\" and referring to Nietzsche as a \"megalomaniac\". Russell is here depicting the \"hard Nietzsche\" very few today would recognize. Russell's psychological daggers against Nietzsche are unbalanced, but worth considering. In one particularly harsh section, he says:\n\nLikewise, the fictional valet Reginald Jeeves, created by author P.G. Wodehouse, is a fan of Baruch Spinoza, recommending his works to his employer, Bertie Wooster over those of Friedrich Nietzsche:\nThe appropriation of Nietzsche's work by the Nazis, combined with the rise of analytic philosophy, ensured that British and American academic philosophers would almost completely ignore him until at least 1950. Even George Santayana, an American philosopher whose life and work betray some similarity to Nietzsche's, dismissed Nietzsche in his 1916 \"Egotism in German Philosophy\" as a \"prophet of Romanticism\". Analytic philosophers, if they mentioned Nietzsche at all, characterized him as a literary figure rather than as a philosopher. Nietzsche's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Nietzsche translations by the Jewish-German, American philosopher Walter Kaufmann and the British scholar R.J. Hollingdale.\n\nNietzsche's influence on Continental philosophy increased dramatically after the Second World War, especially among the French intellectual Left and post-structuralists.\n\nAccording to philosopher René Girard, Nietzsche's greatest political legacy lies in his 20th-century French interpreters, among them Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), and Jacques Derrida. This philosophical movement (originating with the work of Bataille) has been dubbed French Nietzscheanism. Foucault's later writings, for example, revise Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories of power that divide and fragment rather than unite polities (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's Leftist interpreters, used the much-maligned \"will to power\" thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such as the rhizome and other \"outsides\" to state power as traditionally conceived.\n\nGilles Deleuze and Pierre Klossowski wrote monographs drawing new attention to Nietzsche's work, and a 1972 conference at Cérisy-la-Salle ranks as the most important event in France for a generation's reception of Nietzsche. In Germany interest in Nietzsche was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, who has devoted several essays to Nietzsche. Ernst Nolte the German historian, in his literature analyzing fascism and Nazism, presented Nietzsche as a force of the Counter-Enlightenment and foe of all modern \"emancipation politics\", and Nolte's judgment generated impassioned dialogue.\n\nIn recent years, Nietzsche has also influenced members of the analytical philosophy tradition, such as Bernard Williams in his last finished book, \"Truth And Truthfulness: An Essay In Genealogy\" (2002). Prior to that Arthur Danto, with his book, \"Nietzsche as Philosopher\" (1965), presented what was the first full-length study of Nietzsche by an analytical philosopher. Then later, Alexander Nehamas, came out with his book, \"Nietzsche: Life as Literature\" (1985).\n\n"}

Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, \"instructional theory\" is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: behaviorism, the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; cognitivism, the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and constructivism, the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge. Instructional theory is heavily influenced by the 1956 work of Benjamin Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, and the results of his Taxonomy of Education Objectives—one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. One of the first instructional theorists was Robert M. Gagne, who in 1965 published \"Conditions of Learning\" for the Florida State University's Department of Educational Research.\n\nInstructional theory is different than learning theory. A learning theory \"describes\" how learning takes place, and an instructional theory \"prescribes\" how to better help people learn. Learning theories often inform instructional theory, and three general theoretical stances take part in this influence: behaviorism (learning as response acquisition), cognitivism (learning as knowledge acquisition), and constructivism (learning as knowledge construction). Instructional theory helps us create conditions that increases the probability of learning.\n\nInstructional theories identify what instruction or teaching should be like. It outlines strategies that an educator may adopt to achieve the learning objectives. Instructional theories are adapted based on the educational content and more importantly the learning style of the students. They are used as teaching guidelines/tools by teachers/trainers to facilitate learning. Instructional theories encompass different instructional methods, models and strategies.\n\nDavid Merrill's First Principles of Instruction discusses universal methods of instruction, situational methods and core ideas of the post-industrial paradigm of instruction.\n\nUniversal Methods of Instruction:\n\nSituational Methods:\n\nbased on different approaches to instruction\nbased on different learning outcomes:\nCore ideas for the Post-industrial Paradigm of Instruction:\nFour tasks of Instructional theory:\n\nPaulo Freire's work appears to critique instructional approaches that adhere to the knowledge acquisition stance, and his work \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" has had a broad influence over a generation of American educators with his critique of various \"banking\" models of education and analysis of the teacher-student relationship.\n\nFreire explains, \"Narration (with the teacher as narrator) leads the students to memorize mechanically the narrated content. Worse yet, it turns them into \"containers\", into \"receptacles\" to be \"filled\" by the teacher. The more completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are.\" In this way he explains educator creates an act of depositing knowledge in a student. The student thus becomes a repository of knowledge. Freire explains that this system that diminishes creativity and knowledge suffers. Knowledge, according to Freire, comes about only through the learner by inquiry and pursuing the subjects in the world and through interpersonal interaction.\n\nFreire further states, \"In the banking concept of education, knowledge is a gift bestowed by those who consider themselves knowledgeable upon those whom they consider to know nothing. Projecting an absolute ignorance onto others, a characteristic of the ideology of oppression, negates education and knowledge as processes of inquiry. The teacher presents himself to his students as their necessary opposite; by considering their ignorance absolute, he justifies his own existence. The students, alienated like the slave in the Hegelian dialectic, accept their ignorance as justifying the teacher's existence—but, unlike the slave, they never discover that they educate the teacher.\"\nFreire then offered an alternative stance and wrote, \"The raison d'etre of libertarian education, on the other hand, lies in its drive towards reconciliation. Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students.\"\n\nIn the article, \"A process for the critical analysis of instructional theory\", the authors use an ontology-building process to review and analyze concepts across different instructional theories.

{"id": "5913974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5913974", "title": "Kainnilai", "text": "Kainnilai\n\nKainnilai (Tamil:கைநிலை), and Innilai (Tamil:இந்நிலை) are Tamil poetic works belonging to the \"Pathinenkilkanakku\" anthology of Tamil literature. These two books together form the eighteenth book in the anthology, belonging to the 'post Sangam period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. \"Kainnilai\" contains sixty poems written by the poet Pullangkaathanaar and \"Innilai\" contains 45 poems and was written by the poet Poigayaar.\n\nThe poems of \"Innilai\" deal with the ethical concepts of \"aram\" – propriety, \"porul\" – wealth, \"inpam\" – love and \"veedu\" – salvation. In this respect it is similar to \"Tirukkural\" which also concerns with these concepts.\n\n\"Kainnilai\" is available in a much-damaged condition with many of its poems only partially available. \"Kainnilai\" deals with the subjective (\"agam\") concepts. \"Agam\" in the Sangam literature denotes the subject matters that deal with the intangibles of life such as human emotions, love, separation, lovers' quarrels, etc. The poems of \"Kainnilai\" are categoriesed into twelve poems for each of the five \"thinai\", or landscape of Sangam poetry and describe in detail the situation and emotions specific to each landscape. The five landscapes of Sangam poetry are \"mullai\" – forest, \"kurinji\" – mountains, \"marutham\" – farmland, \"paalai\" – arid land and \"neithal\" – seashore.\n\n"}
{"id": "288001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288001", "title": "Kanon (visual novel)", "text": "Kanon (visual novel)\n\nFollowing the game's release, \"Kanon\" made several transitions into other media. Two manga series were serialized in \"Dengeki Daioh\" and \"Dragon Age Pure\". Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license was given to Funimation after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between \"Kanon\" and the musical term canon by using Pachelbel's \"Kanon D-dur\", or \"Canon in D major\", as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.\n\n\"Kanon\" is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. \"Kanon\" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThere are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for \"Kanon\", commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of \"Kanon\"'s influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on \"Kanon\" who thought that.\n\nIn the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of \"Kanon\" without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in \"Kanon\" are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.\n\nThere are several important locations featured in the \"Kanon\" story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.\n\nThere are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006–2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as overture and introit. Miracles play a large part in the story; \"Kanon\"s plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur. The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story. Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid.\n\nOne of the motifs in the story is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. \"Newtype USA\" stated in an article on \"Kanon\" that \"it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive\", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).\n\nThe player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa, the protagonist of \"Kanon\". He is a cynical 17-year-old high school student, and is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. Ayu Tsukimiya, the main heroine of \"Kanon\", is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the masculine first-person pronoun . She has a fondness for eating taiyaki, and is notorious for her catchphrase, , which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi's first cousin Nayuki Minase, another of \"Kanon\"'s heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise.\n\nYuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by \"Kanons third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young girl who has lost her memories, but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever. Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in \"Kanon\" is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she \"punishes\" someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.\n\n\"Kanon\"s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to \"Kanon\"'s beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.\n\nOn the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.\n\nAnother girl who is connected to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted. Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.\n\nMost of \"Kanon\"s development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher Nexton under the brand Tactics. After the release of the brand's third game \"\", most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game. Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at VisualArt's once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on \"Kanon\". The planning for the visual novel was headed by Naoki Hisaya who was also one of two scenario writers with Jun Maeda. Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design and computer graphics. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Dinn, Miracle Mikipon, Shinory—and background art was provided by Torino. The music in the game was composed by OdiakeS, Shinji Orito and Jun Maeda. \"Kanon\" was the first and last visual novel developed by Key that two of the main staff—Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS—worked on before pursuing a similar line of work in other visual novel studios.\n\n\"Kanon\" was released as an adult game on June 4, 1999 in limited and regular editions, playable on a Windows PC as a CD-ROM. The limited edition came bundled with the remix album \"Anemoscope\" remixing background music tracks featured in the visual novel. Key released an all ages version on January 7, 2000 for Windows. An updated adult version called the \"Kanon Standard Edition\" was released on November 26, 2004 with added support for Windows 2000/XP as a DVD-ROM. The \"Standard Edition\" incorporates the extra graphics added to the earlier all ages version of the game, and other technical changes such as more save slots. An all ages version of the \"Standard Edition\" was released on January 28, 2005. An updated all ages version of \"Kanon\" compatible for Windows Vista PCs was released by Key on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box. Another all ages updated version compatible for Windows 7 PCs called \"Kanon Memorial Edition\" was released on April 30, 2010.\n\nThe first consumer console port of the game was released for the Dreamcast on September 14, 2000 by NEC Interchannel. A PlayStation 2 (PS2) version was released on February 28, 2002 also by NEC Interechannel. The PS2 version was re-released as a \"Best\" version on December 22, 2004. The PS2 version was bundled in a \"Key 3-Part Work Premium Box\" package together with the PS2 versions of \"Air\" and \"Clannad\" released on July 30, 2009. An adult version playable as a Blu-ray Disc was released on December 16, 2011 by Asoberu! BD-Game, a brand of VisualArt's.\n\nA PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of the game was released in Japan on February 15, 2007 by Prototype. The first release of the PSP version came with a special DVD featuring a message from five of the voice actors and a recompiled opening video from the video game version. The five voice actors on the DVD included: Mariko Kōda as Nayuki Minase, Akemi Satō as Shiori Misaka, Mayumi Iizuka as Makoto Sawatari, Yūko Minaguchi as Akiko Minase, and Tomokazu Sugita as Yuichi Aizawa. Yui Horie as Ayu Tsukimiya voiced the short introduction of the DVD, but was not featured in the contents of the DVD itself. A downloadable version of the PSP release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on November 9, 2009. A version playable on FOMA and SoftBank 3G mobile phones was released by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto in May 2007. A version playable on Android devices was released on November 30, 2011. A version playable on iOS devices was released on April 4, 2013. In the original release, there was no voice acting for the characters, but in the later versions produced for the Dreamcast and PS2, full voice acting was included. The only exception was Yuichi, who was not voiced in either version. However, the PSP release features voice acting for Yuichi, provided by Tomokazu Sugita.\n\nFive adult light novels written by Mariko Shimizu and published by Paradigm were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000. The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by Itaru Hinoue, the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were and in December 1999. The third was released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled \"The Fox and the Grapes\" (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with VisualArt's under their VA Bunko imprint, which removed the erotic scenes, starting with \"Yuki no Shōjo\" on June 27, 2009, and ending with \"Hidamari no Machi\" on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume. A sixth novel titled for the supporting character Sayuri Kurata written by Shimizu and illustrated by Zen was released on March 31, 2011.\n\nA set of five drama CDs were released between September 29, 2000 and April 27, 2001, with each volume focusing on a different heroine. A set of five anthology drama CDs were released between December 22, 2001 and May 25, 2002, with each volume again focusing on a different heroine. A radio show to promote the Dreamcast port of \"Kanon\" titled broadcast 13 episodes between October 6 and December 29, 2000. The show, produced by Movic, was hosted by Yukari Tamura and Tomoko Kawakami, the voices Mai Kawasumi and Sayuri Kurata, respectively. A radio drama titled broadcast 53 episodes between October 6, 2001 and October 5, 2002. The show, which was broadcast on TBS Radio and Radio Kansai, was hosted by Yūko Minaguchi, the voice of Akiko Minase, and narrated by Atsushi Kisaichi. The voice actors from \"Kanon\" were also featured as guests. Five CD compilation volumes containing all of the show's broadcasts were released between August 30, 2002 and April 26, 2003.\n\nThe first \"Kanon\" manga illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks' manga magazine \"Dengeki Daioh\" between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate \"tankōbon\" volumes published by MediaWorks under their \"Dengeki Comics\" imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume one and the epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in. The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely. This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.\n\nThe second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title with the subtitle \"each regret of Kanon\", was serialized between volumes two and seven of Fujimi Shobo's \"Dragon Age Pure\" magazine sold between June 29, 2006 and October 20, 2007, respectively. The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007 and focused on Nayuki's story. The second volume was released on December 8, 2007 and focused on the other four heroines. There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two.\n\nThere have also been many releases of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title \"Kanon Comic Anthology\", was released in November 2000 under their \"DNA Media Comics\" label. Volumes for this series continued to be released for another two years, ending in December 2002 with the 14th volume; an additional 15th volume was released later in February 2007. Ichijinsha also released two more volumes of anthology collections of four-panel comic strips titled \"Kanon 4-koma Kings\" in April and June 2001. Softgarage released an anthology in a single volume in December 2002 titled \"Kanon Anthology Comic\". In April 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both \"Kanon\" and \"Air\" titled \"Haru Urara: Kanon & Air\".\n\nBetween June and August 2004, Ohzora also released five separate volumes of manga based on \"Kanon\" drawn by five separate artists. Ohzora later collected some of the previously published manga anthologies into two volumes titled \"Kanon Anthology Comics Best Selection\" released in December 2006 and January 2007. Additionally, Ohzora released another 13 volumes of an anthology series titled \"Kanon\" under their \"Twin Heart Comics\" label. The now-bankrupt publisher Raporto also released 21 manga anthology volumes titled \"Kanon\" under their \"Raporto Comics\" label between November 2000 and October 2002. The last manga anthology, a collection of four-panel comic strips released in a single volume by Enterbrain titled \"Magi-Cu 4-koma Kanon\", was released in January 2007 under their \"MC Comics\" label. Each of the anthology series are written and drawn by an average of 20 people per volume.\n\nThe first \"Kanon\" anime was produced by the Japanese animation studio Toei Animation and directed by Naoyuki Itō. Thirteen episodes were produced and aired in Japan on Fuji TV between January 31 and March 28, 2002. The series also later aired on Kansai TV. Later, a single original video animation (OVA) episode titled \"Kanon Kazahana\" was released in March 2003. The anime series and OVA used the songs \"Florescence\" and \"Flower\" for the opening and ending themes, respectively. While it does not appear as the ending theme in the first 12 episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme \"Where the Wind Reaches\" is used as the ending theme for the series in episode 13. Additionally, the game's opening theme \"Last regrets\" is played near the end of episode 13 during the flashback scene.\n\nStarting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators of another Key game-turned-anime, \"Air\", decided to animate a new adaptation of \"Kanon\". This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara and written by Fumihiko Shimo, aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007 at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention that they have officially licensed the second \"Kanon\" anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been spread on the Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007. In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second \"Kanon\" anime were transferred from ADV to Funimation Entertainment who continued to produce the series in North America.\n\nThe second TV \"Kanon\" animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same voice acting cast as the first anime, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the \"Kanon\" game are used for the second anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled \"Last regrets (X'mas floor style)\" by Eiko Shimamiya from I've Sound's first album \"Regret\". Other songs are used from the arrange albums released over the years, which include \"Anemoscope\", \"Recollections\", \"Re-feel\", and \"Ma-Na\".\n\nThe visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme \"Last regrets\", and the ending theme , both sung by Ayana. The lyrics for both songs were written by Jun Maeda, and arranged by Kazuya Takase of I've Sound. The five heroines have leitmotifs. Ayu's theme is ; Nayuki's theme is ; Makoto's theme is \"The Fox and the Grapes\"; Shiori's theme is ; lastly, Mai's theme is .\n\nThe first music album released was \"Anemoscope\" which came bundled with the original release of \"Kanon\" in June 1999. The next release was a single, \"Last regrets/Place of wind which arrives\", which contained the opening and ending themes plus arranged versions of three background music tracks and a male vocal version of the opening theme. A compilation album containing tracks from the two albums was released in December 2001 called \"Recollections\". The game's original soundtrack was released in October 2002 containing 22 different tracks along with short versions of the two theme songs. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called \"Re-feel\" which contained five tracks from \"Kanon\" and five from \"Air\". Excluding the first two albums, each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's record label Key Sounds Label; this is due to the first two albums being released before the label was formed.\n\nThe first anime's first original soundtrack was released in May 2002, and a second followed in July 2002. The first anime's opening theme is \"Florescence\" and the ending theme is \"Flower\", both sung by Miho Fujiwara; the maxi single containing the anime's opening and ending themes was released in June 2002. An album containing music box arranged tracks of music from the first anime was released in July 2003 called \"Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Shū\". The albums released for the first anime were produced by Frontier Works and Movic. A single was released in commemoration for the second anime called \"Last regrets/Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho\" which contained the game's original opening and ending themes in original, short, and remixed versions; the album was produced by Key Sounds Label.\n\nAccording to a national ranking of how well bishōjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original \"Kanon\" release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking. Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks. The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002. The \"Kanon\" Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings. The \"Kanon\" Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35. The all ages version of the \"Kanon\" Standard Edition premiered at number 42 on the national ranking, went up to 35 the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that. The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week. \"Kanon\" has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms, not counting the PSP release.\n\nFive days before the first PS2 release for \"Kanon\", a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. \"Kanon\" was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being \"America Ōden Ultra Quiz\" from DigiCube and \"Marle de Jigsaw\" from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of \"Kanon\"'s story could be summed up as \"the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end,\" resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of \"Dengeki G's Magazine\", poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, \"Kanon\" ranked fifth with 71 votes.\n\nCharacters from \"Kanon\" have appeared in several dōjin games not directly based on the \"Kanon\" series such as the \"Eternal Fighter Zero\" game by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from \"Kanon\" or from \"\". The dōjin game \"Glove on Fight\" featured at least two \"Kanon\" characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a fighting style game along with various other characters taken from other media. The character Ayu Tsukimiya in particular is known to appear in works outside \"Kanon\", such as in strip 67 of the webcomic \"Megatokyo\" where Ayu is shown eating \"taiyaki\".\n\nThe second \"Kanon\" anime series was reviewed at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how the series is a \"formulaic moe haremfest\", and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers \"feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness\". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of \"Air\", saying \"Like \"Air\", the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike \"Air\", however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny.\" Martin also compares \"Kanon\" to the anime adaptation of \"Shuffle!\" which is described as \"bombing\" where \"Kanon\" \"works\". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters \"endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what \"Shuffle!\"'s do.\" Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it \"overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times\" causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being \"too erratic to be fully credible\" or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as \"one of the best moe-centric series to date\" and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making \"Kanon\" \"one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year\". Martin adds another series comparison, citing \"Kanon\" as the \"polar opposite of \"Gurren Lagann\"\", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.\n\n\n \n"}

It opened in September 2008, replacing the former Langleywood Secondary School. The building was designed by Foster and Partners, led by the architect Norman Foster and by Buro Happold. The school is supported by the Arbib Foundation. It has a specialism of science and a museum education theme, including exhibits in the school building. It also promotes sport, notably cricket and rowing.\n\nLangleywood Secondary School was created in 1982 on the site of the former Langley Secondary Modern School following a merger with the former Holmewood Secondary Modern School. As of 2005 Langleywood had about 800 pupils. From 2003 to 2005, Langleywood was in Ofsted 'special measures', but this period was successfully completed in November 2005. Upon the closure of Langleywood Ofsted were invited into the school by the outgoing Headmaster, Mr Paul McAteer, to give a final report. This final report described Langleywood as \"a good school with outstanding features.\"\nIn July 2004, Slough Borough Council, the local education authority, agreed to support the establishment of an academy on the Langleywood site. Langleywood closed in July 2008 and was replaced by The Langley Academy in September 2008. The new academy opened in new buildings designed by Foster and Partners and was sponsored by the Arbib Foundation.\n\nThe Langley Academy under the leadership of its first Principal, Mr Chris Bowler, quickly established itself as the most popular non-selective secondary school in Slough as judged by parental preferences. It set very high standards of behaviour and discipline and set about the process of raising attainment and expectations as well as giving students a real voice in the way that the academy was run. It became well known in the area and beyond for its focus on science (it is a science specialist academy) and for being the only museum learning school in the UK. It also had a major focus on rowing, helped by Olympic double gold medallist Andy Holmes.\n\nThe impressive progress made in the first two years was noted by OFSTED in the Section 8 report from July 2010, where the academy was classed as having made 'good progress', in contrast to many other academies that opened at the same time. Its exam results rose significantly during the first three years, outperforming the school it had replaced.\n\nThe Principal, Mr Bowler, left the academy before the full OFSTED inspection in July 2011. He was replaced by Mr Peter Blewett as Acting Principal until a permanent appointment was made in the autumn term when Mr Rhodri Bryant was appointed as the new Principal.\n\nAll students in the Langley Academy are assigned to one of six houses each with their own foci:\n\n"}
{"id": "4272726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4272726", "title": "Legend of the Rainbow Warriors", "text": "Legend of the Rainbow Warriors\n\nSince the early 1970s, a legend of Rainbow Warriors has inspired some environmentalists and hippies with a belief that their movement is the fulfillment of a Native American prophecy. Usually the \"prophecy\" is claimed to be Hopi or Cree. However, this \"prophecy\" is not Native American at all, but rather from a 1962 Evangelical Christian religious tract, titled \"Warriors of the Rainbow\" by William Willoya and Vinson Brown from Naturegraph Publishers. Brown is the founder and owner of Naturegraph Publishers. \n\nThe roots of that myth go back to a book called \"Warriors of the Rainbow\". It was basically an evangelical Christian tract which was published in 1962. If anything, it was an attack on Native culture. It was an attempt to evangelize within the Native American community.\n\nThe modern story has been misrepresented as ancient prophecy. While this falsification may have been done consciously by the creators of the story, those who pass the story on may sincerely believe the story is authentic. This phenomenon is an example of what scholar Michael I. Niman calls \"fakelore.\"\n\nWhile there are variations on the theme, especially as it has become popularized in Internet memes, the common thread in all versions of the story is that a time of crisis will come to the Earth, that people of many races will come together to save the planet, and it is always erroneously credited as being a Native American or First Nations prophecy: \"It is said there will be a time when the trees are dying, blah, blah, blah. There will be a tribe of people who come and save the Earth and they will be called the Rainbows.\" Some modern versions of the fictitious story specifically state that this new \"tribe\" will inherit the ways of the Native Americans, or that Native ways will die out to be replaced by the new ways of the \"Rainbow\" people.\n\nThe legend said [the Native Americans] would also be joined by many of their light-skinned brothers and sisters, who would in fact be the reincarnate souls of the Indians who were killed or enslaved by the first light-skinned settlers. It was said that the dead souls of these first people would return in bodies of all different colours: red, white, yellow and black. Together and unified, like the colours of the rainbow, these people would teach all of the peoples of the world how to have love and reverence for Mother Earth, of whose very stuff we human beings are also made.\n\n\"Warriors of the Rainbow\" relates these fictitious \"Indian\" prophecies to the Second Coming of Christ and has been described as purveying \"a covert anti-Semitism throughout, while evangelizing against traditional Native American spirituality.\"\n\nThe book \"The Greenpeace Story\", states that Greenpeace co-founder Bob Hunter was given a copy of \"Warriors of the Rainbow\" by a wandering dulcimer maker in 1969 and he passed it around on the first expedition of the Don't Make a Wave Committee, the precursor of Greenpeace. The legend inspired the name of three Greenpeace ships, \"Rainbow Warrior\", used in environmental protection protests as well as the name of the hippie group, the Rainbow Family.\n\nNative American author and poet Sherman Alexie has addressed this belief in the \"inner Indian\" and the ways \"American whites have co-opted Indian culture,\" notably in his poem, \"How to Write the Great American Indian Novel\":\n\nIn 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Family members who are \"appropriating and practicing faux Native ceremonies and beliefs. These actions, although Rainbows may not realize, dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking.\" The signatories specifically named this misappropriation as \"cultural exploitation.\"\n\na group that cites a fictitious \"Native American prophecy\" as informing their self-identification as \"warriors of the rainbow\" and willfully appropriates Native cultural practices, is not only adventurist and dangerous, but offensive to many of us who advance and continue to defend the spiritual, the cultural, the sacred, and, most importantly, the political vitality and vision of the \"Oceti Sakowin\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35240745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35240745", "title": "Lexical hypothesis", "text": "Lexical hypothesis\n\nThe lexical hypothesis (also known as the fundamental lexical hypothesis, lexical approach, or sedimentation hypothesis) is a thesis, current primarily in early personality psychology, and subsequently subsumed by many later efforts in that subfield. Despite some variation in its definition and application, the hypothesis is generally defined by two postulates. The first states that those personality characteristics that are important to a group of people will eventually become a part of that group's language. The second follows from the first, stating that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word. With origins in the late 19th century, use of the lexical hypothesis began to flourish in English and German psychology in the early 20th century. The lexical hypothesis is a major foundation of the Big Five personality traits, the HEXACO model of personality structure and the 16PF Questionnaire and has been used to study the structure of personality traits in a number of cultural and linguistic settings.\n\nSir Francis Galton was one of the first scientists to apply the lexical hypothesis to the study of personality, stating:\n\nDespite Galton's early ventures into the lexical study of personality, over two decades passed before English-language scholars continued his work. A 1910 study by G. E. Partridge listed approximately 750 English adjectives used to describe mental states, while a 1926 study of Webster's New International Dictionary by M. L. Perkins provided an estimate of 3,000 such terms. These early explorations and estimates were not limited to the English-speaking world, with philosopher and psychologist Ludwig Klages stating in 1929 that the German language contains approximately 4,000 words to describe inner states.\n\nNearly half a century after Galton first investigated the lexical hypothesis, Franziska Baumgarten published the first psycholexical classification of personality-descriptive terms. Using dictionaries and characterology publications, Baumgarten identified 1,093 separate terms in the German language used in the description of personality and mental states. Although this figure is similar in size to the German and English estimates offered by earlier researchers, Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert revealed this to be a severe underestimate in a 1936 study. Similar to the earlier work of M. L. Perkins, they used Webster's New International Dictionary as their source. From this list of approximately 400,000 words, Allport and Odbert identified 17,953 unique terms used to describe personality or behavior.\n\nThis is one of the most influential psycholexical studies in the history of trait psychology. Not only was it the longest, most exhaustive list of personality-descriptive words at the time, it was also one of the earliest attempts at classifying English-language terms with the use of psychological principles. Using their list of nearly 18,000 terms, Allport and Odbert separated these into four categories or \"columns\":\n\nAllport and Odbert did not present these four columns as representing orthogonal concepts. Many of their nearly 18,000 terms could have been differently classified or placed into multiple categories, particularly those in Columns I and II. Although the authors attempted to remedy this with the aid of three outside editors, the average level of agreement between these independent reviewers was approximately 47%. Noting that each outside judge seemed to have a preferred column, the authors decided to present the classifications performed by Odbert. Rather than try to rationalize this decision, Allport and Odbert presented the results of their study as somewhat arbitrary and unfinished.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, researchers such as Raymond Cattell and Donald Fiske used factor analysis to explore the overarching structure of the trait terms in Allport and Odbert's Column I. Rather than rely on the factors obtained by these researchers, Warren Norman conducted an independent analysis of Allport and Odbert's terms in 1963. Despite finding a five-factor structure similar to Fiske's, Norman decided to return to Allport and Odbert's original list to create a more precise and better-structured taxonomy of terms. Using the 1961 edition of Webster's International Dictionary, Norman added relevant terms and removed those from Allport and Odbert's list that were no longer in use. This resulted in a source list of approximately 40,000 potential trait-descriptive terms. Using this list, Norman then removed terms that were deemed archaic or obsolete, solely evaluative, overly obscure, dialect-specific, loosely related to personality, and purely physical. By doing so, Norman reduced his original list to 2,797 unique trait-descriptive terms. Norman's work would eventually serve as the basis for Dean Peabody and Lewis Goldberg's explorations of the Big Five personality traits.\n\nIn the 1970s, , a thought leader of the Moscow Semantic School, developed the systemic, or systematic, approach to lexicography which utilizes the concept of \"the language picture of the world\". Also the concept is called \"the naive picture of the world\" in order to stress the non-scientific view of the world which is imprinted in natural language. In his book \"Systematic Lexicography\", which was published in English in 2000, J.D.Apresjan puts forward the idea of building dictionaries on the basis of \"reconstructing the so-called naive picture of the world, or the \"world-view\", underlying the partly universal and partly language specific pattern of conceptualizations inherent in any natural language\". In his opinion, the general world-view can be fragmented into different more local pictures of reality, such as naive geometry, naive physics, naive psychology, and so forth. In particular, one chapter of the book Apresjan allots to the description of lexicographic reconstruction of \"the language picture of the human being\" in the Russian language. Later on, Apresjan's work laid basis for Sergey Golubkov's further attempts to build \"the language personality theory\" which would be different from other lexically-based personality theories (e.g. by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, etc.) due to its meronomic (partonomic) nature versus the taxonomic nature of the previously mentioned personality theories.\n\nConcepts similar to the lexical hypothesis are at the root of ordinary language philosophy. Similar to the use of the lexical hypothesis to understand personality, ordinary language philosophers propose that philosophical problems can be solved or better understood through an exploration of everyday language. In his essay \"A Plea for Excuses,\" J. L. Austin cited three main justifications for this approach: words are tools, words are not only facts or things, and commonly used words \"embod[y] all the distinctions men have found worth drawing...we are using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our perception of, though not as the final arbiter of, the phenomena.\"\n\nDespite its widespread use in the study of personality, the lexical hypothesis has been challenged for a number of reasons. The following list describes some of the major critiques levelled against the lexical hypothesis and personality models founded on psycholexical studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1101767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1101767", "title": "List of longest novels", "text": "List of longest novels\n\nThis is a list of the longest novels over 500,000 words published through a mainstream publisher. The longest novel is \"Artamène ou le Grand Cyrus\", originally published (1649–54) in ten parts, each part in three volumes. \"Artamène\" is generally attributed to Madeleine de Scudéry.\n\nComposing a list of longest novels yields different results depending on whether pages, words or characters are counted. Length of a book is typically associated with its size—specifically page count—leading many to assume the largest and thickest book equates to its length. Word count is a direct way to measure the length of a novel in a manner unaffected by variations of format and page size.\n\nThree possible ways to determine length exist and each has its own method for determining length. Character counts are at best estimations of spaces, written characters and punctuation; Guinness World Records uses this criterion. Word counts is another method that counts each word and omits punctuation, but still considered an estimation for length. Using computer software to count words is the current preferred method for academia and publications. An arbitrary way is to assume that a standard formatted page with 12 pt Courier font and double-spaced lines is 250 words. Due to formatting, page counts are subject to change from font, style, formatting or paper size of the published work and cannot be considered a measure of length despite it being the easiest physical indicator of length. For the purposes of this list, word counts are ideal. Page counts are a relative indicator of length; for proper comparison the page size will be included.\n\nSome difficulty is created when comparing word counts across different writing systems. The logographic Chinese characters used to write East Asian languages each represent one \"morpheme\" and are not separated by spaces. The same character may at times stand for one word, and other times form part of a larger word. For instance the characters \"zhong\" 中 and \"guo\" 囯 can be used independently to mean \"middle\" and \"kingdom\", respectively, but can also be combined into \"Zhongguo\" 中囯, \"China\" (i.e. \"The Middle Kingdom\"). One could theoretically construct a noun phrase \"Zhongguo zhong guo\" 中囯中囯 meaning \"kingdoms in the middle of China\". The absence of any formal marking of word boundaries means that it would be difficult to mechanically determine if such a phrase consists of two, three, or four words without knowing Chinese. East Asian bibliographies therefore generally give only the \"character count\" without attempting any \"word count\".\n\nWhile a rough approximation might seemingly be gotten from citing the word count of a \"translation\" into a Latin alphabet language like English, this is hazardous as the great grammatical and stylistic differences between the languages might cause one to require more or fewer words to convey the same meaning as the other. Citing a translation only indicates how many words are required to convey the same \"meaning\" in the target text, not how many words the source text actually consists of.\n\nWhat counts as a novel is another variable. For the purposes of the list, a \"novel\" is defined as a single work in print or electronic form that has been published through a mainstream publisher, one that has acquired publishing rights from authors. A \"single work\" includes works thought of as one novel by the author, but published in multiple volumes for reasons of convenience.\n\nExcluded are self-published, printed-on-demand, vanity works, unpublished novels like Henry Darger's, novel sequences like the \"Chronicles of Barsetshire\", novel cycles such as those set in the \"James Bond\" universe, and record-grabbing stunts. Also not included are any Internet novel (mainly in China).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36874131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36874131", "title": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain", "text": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on September 1, 2015. It is the ninth installment in the series that was directed, written and designed by Hideo Kojima following \"\", a stand-alone prologue released the previous year, as well as his final work at Konami.\n\nSet in 1984, nine years after the events of \"Ground Zeroes\" and a decade before the events of the original \"Metal Gear\", the story follows mercenary leader Punished \"Venom\" Snake as he ventures into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the Angola–Zaire border region to exact revenge on the people who destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax of \"Ground Zeroes\". It carries over the tagline of \"Tactical Espionage Operations\" first used in \"\".\n\n\"The Phantom Pain\" was critically acclaimed upon release, with its gameplay drawing praise for featuring a variety of mechanics and interconnected systems which allow a high degree of player freedom in approaching objectives. While the story was acknowledged for its emotional power and exploration of mature themes, it drew criticism from some critics for its lack of focus, with further scrutiny over its second half and ending that left several plot points unresolved; this was linked to conclusive evidence of removed content, which led some to suggest that the game was released unfinished. Despite this, \"The Phantom Pain\" received perfect review scores from several publications and was described by some critics to be the greatest stealth game of all time. A complete edition that bundles \"The Phantom Pain\" and \"Ground Zeroes\" together, titled \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience\", was released in October 2016.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" is an action-adventure, stealth game in which players take the role of Punished \"Venom\" Snake from a third-person perspective in an open world environment. The gameplay elements were largely unchanged from \"Ground Zeroes\", meaning that players will have to sneak from several points in the game world, avoiding enemy guards, and remaining undetected. Included in Snake's repertoire are binoculars, maps, a variety of weapons, explosives, and stealth-based items such as cardboard boxes and decoys. Following one of the series traditions, \"The Phantom Pain\" encourages players to progress through the game without killing, using non-lethal weapons such as tranquilizer darts to subdue enemies. Players may traverse the game world with vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, in addition to traveling on foot or on horseback, and as certain locations are mountainous, occasionally, players can opt to go rock climbing as a shortcut. They may call for helicopter support against enemy soldiers or request airstrikes that can bomb the target area or change the current weather. Snake can call on AI companions—including Quiet, a silent female sniper with supernatural abilities; D-Horse, a horse with a customizable saddle for carrying more equipment in the field; D-Walker, a manned, highly agile mobile weapons platform that can provide heavy weapons support; and D-Dog, a wolf pup raised and trained on the new Mother Base to assist him in the field. The companions' abilities and their effectiveness will depend on the player's relationship with them. There is a large emphasis based on tactics in \"The Phantom Pain\".\n\nAs in \"Peace Walker\", \"The Phantom Pain\" features a base-building system that allows players to develop weapons and items from their home base. Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app. Unlike in \"Peace Walker\" where players can only see Mother Base from the air, they can control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in \"Peace Walker,\" returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base. Money for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found all over the map, such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes, as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested in upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.\n\nThe enemy AI has improved in terms of situational awareness. If players frequently use particular weapons or tactics to subdue enemy soldiers, this will see the enemy increase in numbers and be outfitted with better equipment; for example, the frequent use of headshots will see enemy soldiers don metal helmets to make targeting the head harder.\n\nThe game has a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle that runs in real-time. The cycle is able to be fast-forwarded when Snake lights a \"Phantom Cigar\", a type of electronic cigar; a digital silver Seiko watch panel appears on screen to denote time. The passage of time enables players to analyze the movement of marked enemy forces in the area, such as shifts in sentry patrols and individual patrol routes. Weather effects, such as sandstorms and rain, affects the gameplay environment by reducing visibility or masking the sound of footsteps.\n\nA game design direction allows the player to choose in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order they like, and yet still \"understand the encompassing message by the end\".\n\nKojima spoke about the restrictive nature of previous \"Metal Gear Solid\" titles, saying that they \"set [the player] on one rail to get from point A to point B, with a certain amount of freedom between\". In stark contrast, \"The Phantom Pain\" offers players new ways of traversal and sneaking methods, such as taking a motorcycle, plane or helicopter to the mission area (however, usage of the former two vehicles was later dropped during development). Players are able to traverse the game world or deploy directly to landing zones that allow for different approaches. A video published after the E3 2015 convention showcased this, with the same mission played four times in a number of different ways: with the player opting for stealth, launching a direct assault via helicopter gunship, attempting to assassinate a target with a sniper rifle, and smuggling an explosive device into an enemy base by way of an unsuspecting patrol vehicle crew. The player's actions affect the wider game world; for example, sabotaging a radar installation will open up new entry points. The playable world in \"The Phantom Pain\" is two hundred times larger than that of \"Ground Zeroes\", featuring a variety of climate conditions and environments. This allows the players to freely roam the map while proceeding to either story missions or sidequests, as in other games with nonlinear gameplay. In addition, players who have previously played \"Ground Zeroes\" are able to import save data into \"The Phantom Pain\" and gain special perks.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" includes two multiplayer modes: first, the new \"Metal Gear Online\", developed by Kojima Productions' newly formed Los Angeles division (now known as Konami Los Angeles Studio). The first footage for multiplayer was revealed in December 2014. While originally set for launch alongside the release of \"The Phantom Pain\", \"Metal Gear Online\" was postponed to October 6 for consoles and January 2016 for Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe second multiplayer mode is an extension of the Mother Base base-building feature. Players are able to expand their operations to include \"Forward Operating Bases\" which can be used to generate resources and income for the single-player campaign. These facilities can be attacked by other players, making a player-versus-player mode available whereby the attacking team attempts to steal resources and/or soldiers and the defending team tries to protect the Forward Operating Base from the intruder. Defenders are able to call on their friends to aid in the defense, especially if their Forward Operating Base is attacked during a story mission. Players are able to customize the security, staffing, and layout of their Forward Operating Bases, allowing for a large number of compound configurations. Following the success or failure of the intrusion, the location of the attacking player's Forward Operating Base is revealed to the defending player; however, defending players can only launch a retaliatory strike if the attacker was discovered during their infiltration. The Forward Operating Base feature is an entirely separate multiplayer experience to \"Metal Gear Online\" and is also needed to increase the number of combat units the player can deploy.\n\nDuring development, Kojima Productions and Konami attracted criticism for their decision to include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players who may not have the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions. Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall, which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a paywall.\n\nIn the aftermath of the events of \"Ground Zeroes\" and the destruction of Militaires Sans Frontières (commonly abbreviated as MSF), Big Boss (Kiefer Sutherland/Akio Ōtsuka) falls into a coma. Nine years later, he awakens and helps lead a new mercenary group, Diamond Dogs. Adopting the codename \"Venom Snake\", he ventures into Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War and the Angola—Zaire border region during the Angolan Civil War to track down the men responsible for MSF's destruction. Along the way, he becomes reacquainted with his former rival Ocelot (Troy Baker/Satoshi Mikami) and encounters Quiet (Stefanie Joosten), an assassin and sniper with supernatural abilities. While he and Kazuhira Miller (Robin Atkin Downes/Tomokazu Sugita) are initially driven to exact revenge, Snake soon unearths a plot by the Patriots organization to develop a new model of the Metal Gear system known as the ST-84 \"Sahelanthropus\".\n\nIn contrast to previous \"Metal Gear\" installments, Kojima Productions conducted the voice acting and motion capture with English-speaking actors and stuntmen first. While facial capturing was used before for \"Metal Gear Solid 4\", it was done separately from the actual voice acting. The Japanese voice acting was dubbed over the English cast's performance afterward, in contrast to previous releases in the series since \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", which had the characters' vocal and facial expressions lip-synched specifically to both, Japanese and English voice acting.\n\nAt E3 2013, Konami confirmed that actor Kiefer Sutherland would provide Snake's voice and motion capture work for the game, taking a role over voice actor David Hayter. Kojima's reason for replacing Hayter was to \"have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words\", and that he \"needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities of a man in his late 40s\". Hollywood producer and director Avi Arad suggested to Kojima that Sutherland could fulfill his requirements. Akio Ōtsuka was unaffected by this casting change and continued to voice Snake in the Japanese version. On March 4, 2015, Kojima revealed that Snake would have less dialogue in \"The Phantom Pain\" than previous installments. The reasoning behind it was to make Snake come across as an extension to the player and that he \"will act based on [player's actions] rather than doing things like making spontaneous comments or flirting with women.\"\n\nOther members of the voice cast include Troy Baker as Ocelot, Jay Tavare as Code Talker, James Horan as Skull Face, Robin Atkin Downes as Kazuhira Miller, Christopher Randolph as Dr. Emmerich and Piers Stubbs as Eli. The Japanese dub features Tomokazu Sugita as Miller, Hideyuki Tanaka as Emmerich, Takaya Hashi as Skull Face, Satoshi Mikami as Ocelot, Osamu Saka (whose previous roles include Sergei Gurlukovich in \"\" and The End in \"\") as Code Talker, and Yūtarō Honjō as Eli. Dutch-born model Stefanie Joosten provides the likeness, voice and motion capture for the new heroine Quiet, a mute sniper with supernatural abilities who may assist Snake on missions depending on the player's actions during a certain mission. She also provides the vocals for \"Quiet's Theme\".\n\nIn 1984, nine years after the events of \"\", Big Boss awakens from a coma in a hospital in Cyprus. Quiet, a Cipher assassin, tries to kill him, but Big Boss is rescued by a heavily bandaged man called Ishmael. The pair escapes the hospital while evading pursuit from Cipher's soldiers and two superhumans, Tretij Rebenok, the \"Third Child\" and the \"Man on Fire\". Although Big Boss loses sight of Ishmael, he is recovered by his ally Revolver Ocelot and brought aboard Diamond Dogs, a new mercenary group founded by Kazuhira Miller on an offshore platform near Seychelles.\n\nBig Boss adopts the code name \"Venom Snake\" and begins searching for Cipher. During his journey, Snake becomes involved in the Soviet-Afghan and the Angolan Civil Wars, and he recruits Quiet, who no longer speaks and has gained superhuman abilities; scientist Dr. Huey Emmerich; and Code Talker, a Navajo expert on parasites forced to work for Cipher. Eli, a British child believed to be a clone of Snake, who leads a band of child soldiers is brought to the base after an operation. Though there is speculation into whether or not he is Big Boss's son, a DNA test confirms that Venom Snake and Eli are not genetically related.\n\nSnake learns that Cipher's leader Major Zero was usurped and XOF, a rogue faction of Cipher, was responsible for destroying MSF. XOF's leader Skull Face considers Cipher's plan to unite the world for peace as the same as making it culturally American, obliterating other cultures. To avoid this, he intends to release a unique parasite that kills anyone who speaks English. A modified parasite was used to give Quiet and Skull Face's elite soldiers, the Skulls, their unusual abilities. After releasing the English strain parasite, Skull Face plans to make nuclear weapons available to as many groups as he can, believing that nuclear deterrence will stop the weapons actually being used, attaining world peace while still protecting the integrity of each culture. However, he will secretly retain remote control of the weapons. Skull Face intends to use the threat of the latest Metal Gear system, known as ST-84 \"Sahelanthropus\", to make nuclear weapons desirable again, but as he cannot get it to function, he is dependent on the Third Child's psychic abilities to manipulate it.\n\nDuring a test, the Third Child turns against Skull Face, having Sahelanthropus seriously wound him and crush the Man on Fire. Although Snake defeats the Metal Gear, he is only able to recover one of Skull Face's three parasite vials; one goes missing and the other is taken by the Third Child and given to Eli. Skull Face is left to die by Snake and Miller but Huey executes him. The Diamond Dogs return to their base with Sahelanthropus. Following their return, Eli, the Third Child, and the child soldiers steal Sahelanthropus and flee the base. It transpires that the Third Child was not consciously working for Skull Face, but his psychic powers enthralled him to the will of the most vengeful person nearby, meaning Sahelanthropus's attack was instigated by Eli.\n\nAn epidemic of parasites occurs on base forcing Snake to personally kill many of his own men to contain it. To honor them, he has their cremated remains turned into diamonds to carry into battle. Huey is accused of causing the epidemic while attempting to mutate the parasites to sell as weapons. Alongside suspicion of his role in MSF's destruction, and evidence that he murdered his wife Dr. Strangelove while arguing over using their son in experiments, Snake exiles him from Diamond Dogs. Following this event, Quiet disappears in Afghanistan. Code Talker reveals that Quiet was infected with the English strain parasite with the intention of joining Diamond Dogs in order to spread it, but her allegiance shifted to Snake and so she remained silent to prevent an outbreak. Huey's mutation of the parasite convinced Quiet that she could not guarantee the safety of Diamond Dogs. Snake finds Quiet captured by Soviet soldiers and frees her only to be attacked an onslaught of armored vehicles. They defeat the wave but as another one approaches they are forced to hide in a sandstorm. Quiet is then forced to speak to summon help when Snake is bitten by a venomous snake. She disappears into the desert to avoid causing another epidemic.\n\nIt is later revealed that Venom Snake is not actually Big Boss but a loyal MSF medic caught in the same explosion that injured the real Big Boss, Ishmael. During his coma, the medic was transformed into a second Big Boss via plastic surgery and hypnotherapy to serve as a decoy for the actual Big Boss while he wages a covert war against Cipher. On behalf of the real Big Boss, Venom Snake goes on to set the events of the Outer Heaven uprising in motion and dies at the hands of Solid Snake. The original Big Boss resurfaces during the . Miller and Ocelot discuss Big Boss' plans to create Outer Heaven. While Ocelot remains supportive, Miller is disgusted at his former ally's deception but agrees to continue assisting Venom Snake and Big Boss's sons in hopes of contributing to the real Big Boss's downfall.\n\nIn February 2012, a site owned by Konami, \"Development Without Borders\", promoted development for a new \"Metal Gear\" title, for \"The \"next\" MGS\". The site was recruiting staff for the 2012 GDC pavilion in March, and requested applications for several positions for the latest \"Metal Gear Solid\" targeted for \"high-end consoles\" and \"next-gen Fox engine\". As the year went on, screenshots and videos of the newly announced Fox Engine were unveiled by the team. This media demonstrated many random settings and characters, although none related to the \"Metal Gear\" series. Certain screenshots, however, were noted to feature a character who resembled the Big Boss character of \"Metal Gear\", walking up to a Stryker AFV previously seen in \"Metal Gear Solid 4\".\n\nKonami unveiled \"\" at a private function celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \"Metal Gear\" series on August 30, 2012. The game later made its public debut two days later at the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo. Kojima revealed very little detail about the project at the time other than it was a prologue to \"Metal Gear Solid V\",<ref name=\"VG24/7\"></ref> and that it would be the first game to use the Fox Engine, a game engine developed by Kojima Productions. In January 2013, Kojima revealed that \"Ground Zeroes\" would be the first title in the series to be subtitled in Arabic, a feature the team had planned for previous games. He also confirmed that the length of the cutscenes was reduced, as he believed that long cutscenes had become outdated.\n\nIn an interview with VG247, Kojima expressed concerns over whether or not \"Ground Zeroes\" would be released. He claimed that his aim was to target taboos and mature themes, which he considered to be \"quite risky\", adding that his roles as creator and producer were in conflict with one another; as creator, Kojima wanted to take the risk of exploring themes that might alienate audiences, but as producer, he had to be able to tone down the content in order to sell as many copies of the game as possible. Ultimately, the role of creator won out, and Kojima described his approach as \"prioritizing creativity over sales\".\nAt the Spike Video Game Awards in December 2012, a teaser trailer for a game known as \"The Phantom Pain\" was shown, credited to a new Swedish developer known as Moby Dick Studio, and was described as being \"100% gameplay\". Allegedly led by Joakim Mogren, the studio's mission statement read that it aimed to \"deliver an uncompromising, exciting, and touching game experience to people all around the globe.\" After the presentation, commentators speculated that \"The Phantom Pain\" was actually a \"Metal Gear\" game, noting the protagonist's resemblance to Big Boss, graphics similar to those produced by the Fox Engine, the quote \"V has come to\" at the end of the trailer, and that the title \"Metal Gear Solid V\" fits in the negative space and indentations of the game's logo when using the same font. The name \"Joakim\" was an anagram of \"Kojima\", the domain name for the studio's website had only been registered about two weeks prior to the announcement, and that several people wearing Moby Dick Studio shirts were sitting in a VIP area intended for Konami staff. Hideo Kojima stated he was impressed by the trailer and how Mogren was inspired by \"Metal Gear\".\n\nAn actor playing a heavily bandaged Mogren appeared in an interview on the March 14, 2013 episode of \"GameTrailers TV\"; while stating that he could not reveal many details, he confirmed that more details about \"The Phantom Pain\" would be revealed at the upcoming Game Developers Conference, and showed a series of screenshots on an iPad to the show's host Geoff Keighley. After Keighley pointed out the Fox Engine logo in the screenshots, Mogren appeared nervous and the segment abruptly ended.\n\nOn March 27, 2013, at GDC 2013, Kojima confirmed that his studio was behind the trailer, and announced that \"Metal Gear Solid V\" would be two separate games; \"Ground Zeroes\" would now serve as a prologue for the main game, which was officially announced as \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\". He subsequently presented a trailer for the game and showcased the Fox Engine. The trailer featured the song \"Not Your Kind of People\" from Garbage's 2012 album of the same name.\n\nWhile the official trailer announcing the game was running on a PC, the game was released for the seventh and eighth generations of video game consoles. In an interview during E3 2013, when asked about a PC release Kojima stated \"We are making it, and it will be on par with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.\" However, he made it clear that the PC port was not their priority. Kojima confirmed that the visuals seen in the trailer would look close to those in the final game. He also stated that he would like \"Metal Gear Solid V\" to be his final \"Metal Gear\" game, noting that unlike previous titles where he had announced that he had finished making games in the series, only to return for subsequent games, his involvement with the franchise would be over this time around. Although the trailer had Snake suffering from hallucinations in the form of a flaming whale, Kojima assured that there would be a balance in realism. Kojima later revealed that \"The Phantom Pain\" was initially presented as an independent game so as to assess the public and industry response to the Fox Engine, as he felt that announcing the game as part of \"Metal Gear Solid V\" would bias reactions to the engine.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3 2013, a fourth trailer was shown at the Microsoft press conference, demonstrating the new play mechanics, as well as the cast of characters. The development of an Xbox One version was also announced at the conference. The PlayStation 4 version was announced the following day when Konami uploaded the red band version of the trailer on their YouTube channel in addition to the standard green band version.\n\nThe trailers for \"Metal Gear Solid V\" showed the game running on a PC hardware, but according to Kojima with textures and character models somewhat based on seventh generation hardware. The developers aimed to improve the technical quality for the versions released for the eighth generation of consoles.\n\nKojima alluded to the game possibly being \"too big to clear\", adding that the game is \"200 [times larger] than \"Ground Zeroes\"\". Kojima wanted the player to connect with Snake in \"The Phantom Pain\". To accomplish this, the loss of Mother Base, which the player developed throughout \"Peace Walker\", would serve as motivation for revenge for both Snake and the player. Kojima also tried making Snake relatable to newcomers of the series by making him unaware of what happened in the nine years during which he was in a coma. Weapons, vehicles and other armaments are unlicensed and fictional in \"The Phantom Pain\", just as they were in \"Ground Zeroes\", unlike previous \"Metal Gear Solid\" games that included mostly real-world based weaponry.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, at E3 2014, a fifth cinematic trailer featuring Mike Oldfield's song \"Nuclear\" was shown at the Sony press conference, unveiling more plot details surrounding the Diamond Dogs and Snake's antagonistic descent. It was leaked a day earlier, due to an accidental post from Konami's official YouTube channel. Alongside the new trailer, the official site for \"Metal Gear Solid V\" was updated and included new information and images such as the developmental progress of the in-game map and the evolution of Snake's design across all games in the series. On August 25, 2015, Kojima released a launch trailer showing \"Metal Gear's Evolution and Harmony\" with clips from the previous games along with the reveal of the new \"Metal Gear Sahelanthropus\".\n\nOver $80 million was spent on the development of the game.\n\nThe music of \"The Phantom Pain\" was produced by Harry Gregson-Williams, making it his fourth \"Metal Gear\" title, and composed by Ludvig Forssell, Justin Burnett, and Daniel James. Also featured in \"The Phantom Pain\" are collectable music tapes the player can listen to in-game, with a mixture of licensed music from the era, and music from past \"Metal Gear\" titles.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack\" was released on September 2nd, 2015, containing 50 tracks selected from both \"Ground Zeroes\" and \"The Phantom Pain\". Following this on December 23rd, 2015, was \"Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack\", containing 114 tracks again selected from both \"Metal Gear Solid V\" games. Finally, \"Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack The Lost Tapes\" was released on March 30th, 2016, primarily consisting of tracks written by Ludvig Forssell for the in-game cassette tapes. The latter two releases also include music that went unused in the game, with \"Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack\" in particular containing two tracks from the cut \"Mission 51: Kingdom of the Flies\".\n\nThe game's soundtrack later won the award for Best Score/Soundtrack at The Game Awards 2015. The event also had Stefanie Joosten, Quiet's voice actress, on stage performing \"Quiet's Theme\".\n\nIn March 2015, Konami announced plans for a corporate restructuring that saw them part ways with Hideo Kojima and his development studio Kojima Productions. As part of the separation, Kojima's name was removed from the game cover, all of its associated paraphernalia and future releases of \"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\" and \"Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection\". A Konami spokesperson stated that Kojima would still be involved with Konami and the \"Metal Gear\" franchise, and despite the dispute, the company expressed confidence that the game would be declared Game of the Year.\n\nIn July 2015, series composer Rika Muranaka told \"Fragged Nation\" in an interview that over 30 commissioned songs for Metal Gear Solid were never used, with Muranaka believing that Kojima has a lack of business sense that played a part in his split from Konami.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" was released in different editions. Special Day One editions of the game for each platform featured downloadable content (DLC) vouchers for special weapons and \"Metal Gear Online\" experience points. The North American Collector's Edition (which was available for PS4 and Xbox One) comes with a steelbook and a small-size replica of Snake's bionic arm; the Premium Package for the Japanese release (which was available for PS4, PS3, and Xbox One) features a full-size replica, which was also sold separately in May 2016. Sony released a PlayStation 4 bundle with the unit painted in the colors of the arm.\n\nThe physical PC release of \"The Phantom Pain\" only includes a CD key and a disc with a Steam installer contained within. Game files are not included on-disc and must be downloaded.\n\nTie-in products were also released for the game. Sony Mobile Communications released special edition Walkman, Xperia Z4, Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, and Xperia J Compact devices, each featuring Outer Heaven emblems, soundtrack audio, and wallpapers. Watch manufacturer Seiko released a digital watch, resembling Venom Snake's watch from the game. Eyeglasses maker JF Rey produced themed eyewear patterned after what Kaz and Ocelot are wearing in the game. Japanese toy company Sentinel, which previously made an iDroid casing for the iPhone 5 and 5S, produced a transformable figure of the Sahelanthropus, while Kotobukiya readied a 1/100 scale kit of the unit. Sports apparel company Puma joined the project through a line of sports jackets, T-shirts, and footwear, including Snake's sneaking boots.\n\nSquare Enix's PlayArts \"Kai\" figure line featured several of the game's characters, while Kaiyodo produced Venom Snake and a Soviet Army soldier for the RevoMini figure category. An art book, titled \"The Art of Metal Gear Solid V\", was published by Dark Horse Comics on November 2, 2016.\n\nA complete edition of the game, titled \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience\", was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam on October 11 in North America, October 13 in Europe, and November 10 in Japan. The bundle includes the \"Ground Zeroes\" prologue and \"The Phantom Pain\" in one package, along with all previously released downloadable content for both games.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nVince Ingenito of IGN awarded the game a score of 10/10, complimenting the way the gameplay mechanics worked together and the organic nature of the open-ended missions that allowed players to create their own memorable experiences, without being punished for deviating from stealth. The review concluded that \"The Phantom Pain\" is \"a gameplay marvel, rewarding intelligence and creativity in a way few games do.\" GameSpot also gave the game a 10/10, similarly praising its \"near impeccable\" gameplay, commenting that, alongside main and side missions, \"emergent scenarios serve as the third pillar of \"The Phantom Pain\" open-world gameplay experience\". The review also highlighted the meaningful development of the characters despite being beholden to the original \"Metal Gear\" as the conclusion of Venom Snake's character arc. \"The Phantom Pain\" was the twenty-third game—and the third in the \"Metal Gear\" series—to ever receive a perfect 40/40 review rating from Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\".\n\n\"EGM\" awarded the game 9.5/10, praising the story's emotional power and thematic concerns exploring the futility of war in a much more compelling and cohesive way than other franchises such as \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield\", as well as the way in which the game world responded to the player's actions. However, the review was critical of the reliance on resource management, particularly in the way assaults on Forward Operating Bases could interrupt and distract from key missions. Destructoid awarded it a score of 9/10, saying that the game is \"equal parts tough and flashy, and it's fitting that if this is Kojima's last \"Metal Gear\", he goes on a high note.\"\n\n\"Game Informer\"s Joe Juba awarded the game 9.25/10, praising the mission design for its flexibility and offering players multiple pathways to completion without restricting their choice of weapons or equipment. However, despite seeing the value in restructuring the narrative to compliment the open world platform and the episodic mission structure given the series' complex mythology, Juba felt that this went too far with the result being that the player could stumble into crucial story elements without context. \"Polygon\"s Michael McWhertor also awarded the game 9/10, similarly praising the game mechanics, but directing criticism at the convoluted storyline which it felt hinged on a detailed knowledge of the series' mythos to the point where it would be inaccessible to newcomers to the franchise.\n\n\"The Phantom Pain\" was also positively received outside the traditional gaming media. In a five-star review, \"The Telegraph\"s Kirk McKeand stated that the game \"takes the best of a great series and creates a series' best in the process\". The review complimented the seamless integration of the gameplay modes and noted the way the game's Mother Base mode offered satisfactory and meaningful progress, a sentiment echoed by \"Time\"s Matt Peckham, who also complimented the game's longevity, pacing and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile much of \"The Phantom Pain\" received plaudits, the game was criticized by some reviewers who felt it was lacking in terms of a focused and compelling narrative with interesting characters, especially when compared to prior \"Metal Gear\" titles. Ingenito opined that its story would be divisive for long-term fans, calling it \"insubstantial and underdeveloped\", with plot-related questions generally being answered in a \"rushed and unsatisfying\" way and a tendency for the game to gloss over its subject matter. He wrote how much of the characterization and memorable moments seen in previous installments had been replaced with individuals doing little more than appearing in scenes, giving information and then standing around. In addition, he called out the frequent lack of communication from Kiefer Sutherland as Venom Snake throughout important plot sections as \"positively jarring\". \"Kotaku\"s Jason Schreier argued that the story was \"damn unfulfilling\", having \"terrible\" pacing, \"incoherent\" dialogue, and \"incomprehensible\" character motivations. He echoed Ingenito's view of Snake, calling him in cutscenes \"nearly silent to the point of awkwardness ... where his response to emotional events will often just be to look at people.\" David Roberts, writing for \"GamesRadar\", described the story as \"unconventional\" and full of \"loosely connected scenes\", saying \"a whole lot of nothing happens in between quick bursts of exposition\". He praised Kiefer Sutherland as Snake, but criticized Skullface as being greatly undeveloped as a villain and being met with \"one of the most anti-climactic showdowns in video game history\". Roberts also wrote how the story \"drifts along aimlessly\" in the second half and which ultimately felt \"hollow\" from not giving closure to the end twist that the player is not controlling Big Boss. Similarly, the reveal and story ending also drew a polarizing response from other critics.\n\n\"The Phantom Pain\" was also criticized for forcing players to replay missions on higher difficulty settings to unlock the final missions, with Schreier saying that it added unnecessary padding to a section of plot conveying the game's most emotional events.\n\nBefore the release of the game, the presentation of the female character Quiet became a topic of controversy concerning her appearance. \"Halo\" designer David Ellis criticized her for being oversexualized and a negative affirmation of the stereotype of the game industry as \"full of man babies\". Kojima and Konami released Quiet figurines in May 2015 as part of the game's promotion. The figure's soft, pliable breasts were criticized in social media and in the press.\n\nThe finished game drew more criticism of Quiet's portrayal in both reviews and opinion pieces. \"GamesRadar\"s David Roberts described Quiet as \"one of the most complex and conflicted characters in \"MGS5\"\", but that her depiction was an example of a \"juvenile approach to sexuality\" that typifies Kojima's work and the \"Metal Gear\" series as a whole. Michael McWhertor of \"Polygon\" described the justification for Quiet's lack of clothing as \"inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story\", and criticized how the game presented other female characters by \"zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way.\"\n\nFollowing the release of the game, those who had bought the Collector's Edition discovered that the bonus disc included cutscenes and concept art of an in-game mission, \"Episode 51: Kingdom of the Flies\", that continued on from the end of the campaign, having not been playable in the game. The story ending was criticised for feeling abrupt and leaving several plot points unresolved, and critics found that the removed mission tied up one such important plot thread whilst also providing closure to the relationship between two of the characters. Consequently, many agreed that the inclusion of Episode 51 would have given the game a more satisfactory conclusion.\n\nAnother large criticism of the story was the decision to force players to replay past missions to progress through its second half, with one theory being that original content had been envisioned but which had not been incorporated into the finished game due to time constraints, resulting in the re-used sections. This assumption was supported by further evidence of removed content: not long after the discovery of Chapter 51, users of the Facepunch forums who had been extracting data from the PC version of the game's files found evidence of a third story chapter, titled \"Chapter 3: Peace\", that was not included in the final version of the game. Konami later neither confirmed nor denied that Chapter 3 had been fully cut from the main game. \"Metal Gear Solid\" community manager Robert Allen Peeler was asked via Twitter if any upcoming downloadable content would be released for \"The Phantom Pain\", in the hope that the story content would be included, but this was refuted. Many fans also believed that, due to the chapter's title, it was somehow linked to Konami's \"Nuclear Disarmament Event\" which was opened shortly after launch with the goal of revealing a secret in the game, and which would close once all in-game nuclear weapons that had been manufactured by players were disposed of. Data miners had uncovered a related cutscene within the game's files that would be released once the event had finished, however speculation still spread that Chapter 3 was connected in some way. Robert Allen Peeler discussed player's suspicions via Twitter and Reddit and did not deny that further events may occur once the disarmament had concluded. On February 2, 2018, the Nuclear Disarmament Event ending was triggered prematurely on the Steam version of the game, despite there still being over 9000 player nukes in existence at the time, resulting in the release of the previously-uncovered cutscene. After investigation, Konami announced that this was the result of a technical error owing to the game's servers being sent incorrect values.\n\nCritics attributed the missing content to the disclosed tensions between Konami and Kojima during development, the general consensus being that Konami had given strict deadlines for the game's release, having been dissatisfied with how much money Kojima had spent on development. Data miners also uncovered numerous other examples of lesser content that had not been included in the game, ranging from gameplay features to cutscenes, but what precisely had been removed as a result of the Konami-Kojima conflict, and what had simply been abandoned earlier in development out of choice, was open to discussion. Regardless, due to the removed story content and subsequent narrative flaws, the game was labeled by some critics as being unfinished. Conversely, \"GamesRadar\" argued that the game's incomplete state was deliberate on Kojima's part. Speaking to IGN, Kojima himself seemingly alluded to the fact that he considered the game unfinished when stating that the new intellectual property he was developing since leaving Konami (later revealed as \"Death Stranding\") would be \"a complete game\".\n\nAfter the announcement of \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience\", which would include all previously released downloadable content, several fans took this as an opportunity to voice their concerns via Twitter about the missing content that had been uncovered, particularly with regards to Episode 51. Konami responded that Episode 51 had been removed in the early development stages of the game as it had not been intended to be a pivotal ending to the story, and that there were no future plans to have the mission available to play.\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" shipped 3 million physical copies within its first five days of release, across all platforms. On its release date, the game grossed US$179 million. \"The Phantom Pain\" debuted at number one on the United Kingdom charts. It became the third biggest video game launch of 2015 in the UK, behind \"\" and \"\". \"The Phantom Pain\" was the most successful launch for the series in the UK, beating the previous record holder, \"\", by 37 percent. The game sold 411,199 physical retail copies on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 within the first week of release in Japan, topping the Japanese software sales charts that week.\n\nThe game sold noticeably more on the PlayStation family of consoles than the competing Xbox in the UK. Excluding computer sales, \"The Phantom Pain\" moved approximately 72 percent of copies on PlayStation 4, roughly three times the amount sold on the Xbox One, which accounted for 22 percent of sales. 3 percent of sales were on PlayStation 3, and 2 percent on Xbox 360. By the end of September 2015, \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" had shipped 5 million copies, and reached 6 million by the end of December 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "9658561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9658561", "title": "Mosaic (film)", "text": "Mosaic (film)\n\nMosaic is an animated superhero film about a new character created by Stan Lee. It features the voice of Anna Paquin as Maggie Nelson with supporting roles done by Kirby Morrow, Cam Clarke, Garry Chalk, Ron Halder, and Nicole Oliver. It was released under the \"Stan Lee Presents\" banner, which is a series of direct-to-DVD animated films distributed by POW Entertainment with Anchor Bay Entertainment. The story was by Stan Lee, with the script by former X-Men writer Scott Lobdell.\n\n\"Mosaic\" was released on DVD on January 9, 2007, and had its television premiere on March 10, 2007 on Cartoon Network.\n\nAspiring young actress Maggie Nelson (Anna Paquin), who lives in New York City, gains chameleon-like powers after she is exposed to an electrical storm and a magic rune which her father, an Interpol agent, had brought home to study after it was found at the scene of a murder at a New York City museum. Her powers are from a secret and ancient race known as the Chameliel, who are able to hide in plain sight of the public due to their shape shifting abilities, and she is told all about the Chameliel after meeting a young Chameliel named Mosaic (Kirby Morrow). The murder victim at the museum was a Chameliel who was killed by another Chameliel named Maniken, who is stealing some of the many powerful Chameliel stones that are hidden around the world, intent on using them to gain the alchemical powers of his dead wife Facade, and ruling the world. After Maniken kidnaps her father, Maggie becomes determined to help Mosaic to fight Maniken.\n\nThey go from New York City, to the catacombs of Rome, to a large radio dish at the magnetic North Pole, trying to stop Maniken as he plans to sacrifice Maggie's father to use the Chameliel stones in a ceremony that will transfer to Maniken the powers of his wife from her body and rule Earth like a god. As Maniken prepares to begin the ceremony on the radio dish, Maggie uses her acting skills and shape-shifting abilities to fool Maniken into believing she is his dead wife come back to life, to distract him from noticing Mosaic is planting explosives that destroy everything on the radio dish and render the ceremony impossible, and getting her father to safety. During the battle against Maniken, it is revealed that Mosaic is Maniken and Facade's son who had volunteered to the rest of the Chameliel to go after his father and to stop him. They both end up tumbling into an icy gorge, never to rise again. Maggie then sneaks aboard the Interpol copter her father is on, overhearing him vowing to destroy all Chameliel. Upon returning home, she plans to continue acting and agrees to her father's request to continue her studies, but at the same time, acknowledging her powers as the piece of the Chameliel within her, she vows to search for the remaining Chameliel stones and use their power for good, and honor Mosaic and the rest of the Chameliel by becoming the new Mosaic.\n\n\nMaggie's powers include shapeshifting, superhuman strength, the ability to cling to surfaces allowing for scaling walls and ceilings (much like Spider-Man), seeing the DNA of other creatures (which is how she can compare humans to apes), regeneration, infrared vision, camouflage, invisibility and the ability to mimic voices as well as a gift for understanding the Chameliel language (it is never explained if this ability shows that she can understand other languages or speak them but it makes sense). Strangely, when Maggie becomes invisible, her outline gives off the appearance that she is completely naked, even though she is in fact wearing clothes. Why her clothes are not outlined when her body is invisible is never made clear.\n\n\"Mosaic\" has received mixed reviews. Movie reviewer Rotten Tomatoes gave it an audience rating of 49%, based on 2 reviews.\n\n"}
{"id": "47819166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47819166", "title": "No Colour Bar", "text": "No Colour Bar\n\nNo Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960–1990 was a major public art and archives exhibition, the first of its kind in the UK, held at the Guildhall Art Gallery, City of London, over a six-month period (10 July 2015 – 24 January 2016), with a future digital touring exhibition, and an associated programme of events. \"No Colour Bar\" took its impetus from the life work and archives of Jessica Huntley (23 February 1927 – 13 October 2013) and Eric Huntley (born 25 September 1929), Guyanese-born campaigners, political activists and publishers, who founded the publishing company Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications and the associated Walter Rodney Bookshop.\n\nComprising contemporary fine art combined with archive materials, the multi-media exhibition featured the work of seminal Black British artists and historically significant activists, and was described by Colin Prescod (chair of the Institute of Race Relations) as an \"exposition of startling and radical imaginative works, addressing grand British cultural and historical matters, and touching on themes of existential and social restlessness\". Participants in the Caribbean Artists Movement, such as Winston Branch, Aubrey Williams, Ronald Moody and Errol Lloyd, were featured together with other prominent artists, including Eddie Chambers, Sonia Boyce, Sokari Douglas Camp, Denzil Forrester and Chila Kumari Burman, with works on display across all media: painting sculpture, painting, drawing, illustration, photography and film. In conjunction with the art and archives, panels and talks led by the exhibition curators, Makeda Coaston and Katty Pearce, and featuring individual artists, writers and publishers, including Eddie Chambers, Errol Lloyd, Denzil Forrester, Fowokan, Donald Hinds, Kadija George, Dorothea Smartt, Arif Ali, Sarah White, as well as Eric Huntley himself, were programmed.\n\nWithin the exhibition was a purpose-built interactive installation by Michael McMillan, in conjunction with sound and visual specialists Dubmorphology, that recreates the famed Walter Rodney Bookshop, which was formerly located in West Ealing, functioning as a cultural hub of the community until it closed at the beginning of the 1990s.\n\n\"No Colour Bar\" took its impetus from the cultural and political work of Guyanese activists Eric and Jessica Huntley, founders of the pioneering Black publishing house Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications (commemorating Caribbean resistance heroes Toussaint L'Ouverture of Haiti and Paul Bogle of Jamaica), whose papers, business and personal, archive materials and collections were deposited in 2005 at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA), the first significant deposit there of records from the African-Caribbean community in London. Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the exhibition is a collaboration between LMA, the Friends of the Huntley Archives at LMA (FHALMA), and the Guildhall Art Gallery, supported by the City of London. The exhibition aimed to provide \"an innovative look at Black British cultural identities, heritage and creative voices - and the struggle Black British artists faced to have their voices heard - from the 1960s to the 1990s\"; according to project manager Beverley Mason: \"To have created this culturally important archive and arts exhibition marks a valuable shift in thinking about the approach to opening up and enlivening archives and historical art collections worldwide.\"\n\nThe exhibition was designed as a multimedia interactive experience, in which \"art, sculpture, photographs and paintings can be explored next to letters and other artefacts illustrating how black artists were influenced by the emergence of independent African and Caribbean states, global liberation struggles and the struggle for dignified citizenship within Britain.\" With four themed areas — Elbow Room, Broad Shoulders, Clenched Fists and Open Arms — the exhibition \"challenges visitors to question the meaning of 'black art'\".\n\nThe installation at its centre (which necessitated the unprecedented covering up of the gallery's largest painting, John Singleton Copley's \"The Siege of Gibraltar\"), recreated the bookshop named in honour of assassinated historian Walter Rodney, and served to show something of the connection between the championing of black writers, such as Linton Kwesi Johnson or Lemn Sissay, and the support of black artists — such as Errol Lloyd and George \"Fowokan\" Kelly — through commissions for book covers, posters, greetings cards or the sale of works of art in the shop.\n\nReceiving wide media coverage as a \"new ground-breaking revolutionary archive and art exhibition in the heart of the City of London\", \"No Colour Bar\" was described as \"breath-taking\" and as showcasing \"some of the important aspects of the Black British Experience as well as some of the important figures that helped shape Britain and Black Britain\". CNN's Jim Stenman reported on \"one of the most comprehensive exhibitions on Black British art in recent years... [that] explores gender, race, representation and politics\", interviewing Eric Huntley about the challenges of the past, in addition to Guildhall curator Katty Pearce, who said with reference to the exhibition: \"This is part of British art history. This is the other story that maybe doesn't get told enough.\"\n\nAmandla Thomas-Johnson writing in \"The Voice\" pointed out \"a very visible tension surrounding the exhibition. Its home, the Guildhall, has been the administrative centre of the City of London for hundreds of year and it was here much of the economic policy that steered the British Empire across the seas was driven, where the wealth coming back from the colonies was dished out and whose permanent art collection is the epitome of Imperial chic.\" Also highlighting the history of the venue, the \"New Humanist\" review by Lola Okolosie found that \"holding an exhibition that celebrates black British art at the Guildhall, with its colonial legacy, is an act akin to resistance\".\n\nThe \"Soca News\" review, among others, drew attention to the monthly events linked to the exhibition and different aspects of the Black experience in Britain, including film, music, theatre, poetry, a conference and a Black Artists' Forum, while \"Artlyst\" concluded: \"The realisation that Britain was changing forever is no better articulated than through the lens of the pioneers of what was to become Black British cultural heritage. The Huntleys were the publishing powerhouses that spawned a dynamic generation of cultural and political leaders, whose stories are told and celebrated for the first time in the UK at this fascinating exhibition.\n\n2015 sees the 10th Anniversary of the Huntley Archives at the LMA, and 'No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990' will be a fitting marker and visual record of the socio-cultural dynamics spanning the three decades\"\n\nSumming it up as the \"Exhibition of the Year\", independent curator Hamja Ahsan wrote: \"This was an archival show with the fire of life, the air of authenticity and the buzz of a multi-generational community... For this reason, this remained for me the most essential and inspiring exhibition of the year.\"\n\n"}

It was awarded to individuals, military units, political and other organisations who distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroic deeds during war and in peacetime. The recipients were thereafter known as People's Heroes of Yugoslavia or National Heroes of Yugoslavia. The vast majority was awarded to partisans for actions during the Second World War. A total of 1,322 awards were awarded in Yugoslavia, and 19 were awarded to the foreigners.\n\nIn 1998, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia decided to award the Order of the People's Hero again and decorated several military units, but no individuals.\n\nThe bulletin of the Supreme command of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia no. 12–13 (December 1941 and January 1942) announced the establishment of the title of \"People's Hero\" for heroic and self-sacrificing participants of the People's Liberation War. The first person to be awarded the title was Petar Leković. A total of 22 persons were awarded this title. On 15 August 1943, the title was formalized as an order together with Order of the People's Liberation, Order of Bravery, Order of the Partisan Star, Order of Brotherhood and Unity and the Medal for Bravery. At the same time, all the persons who already held the title of the People's Hero were awarded the order.\n\nThe Order consists of an oval gold badge showing a soldier with rifle and banner superimposed upon a rayed star surrounded by a wreath of laurel. The badge is suspended from a red ribbon, with a narrow white stripe towards each edge. The design for this and the other Orders were undertaken by the painter Đorđe Andrejević Kun and the sculptor Antun Augustinčić. Before 29 November 1943, the title of People's Hero was awarded by the Central Comity of KPJ, after 1945 it was awarded by the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Yugoslavia, and starting in 1953 by the President of Yugoslavia.\n\nFrom its inception until around 1993, the Order had been awarded nearly 1,400 times. Marshal Josip Broz Tito was awarded the Order three times: in 1944, 1972 and 1977. The holders of the order were entitled to certain benefits, like free fares on public transport, and pensions for the surviving family members of deceased people's heroes. Although the benefits have since been downscaled, post-Yugoslav countries still provide certain benefits to people's heroes. Many schools and streets in post-war Yugoslavia were named after people's heroes, and many of the names remain, to varying degrees in different successor countries.\n\nNot only people, but cities, military units and organizations were also awarded the order. Eight cities in Yugoslavia were awarded the order and proclaimed \"hero cities\": Belgrade, Cetinje, Drvar, Ljubljana, Novi Sad, Prilep, Pristina, and Zagreb.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed, and later renamed Serbia and Montenegro. In 1998, it passed a law that continued to use some of the decorations of former Yugoslavia, among them Order of the People's Hero, making it the fourth highest order after the Order of Yugoslavia, Order of the Yugoslav Star and the Order of Freedom.\n\nThe Serbian media ridiculed several proposals to decorate Slobodan Milošević with the Order of the People's hero because he would have had to decorate himself. It was never given to any individuals, but several military units active in the Kosovo War were decorated:\n\nNotable recipients of the order include: \n\n\n\nA total of 1,322 persons were awarded in Yugoslavia by 1981. Most of the awarded were men (1231) and 91 were women. Most People's Heroes were either miners or industrial workers (34%), 19% were university and high school students, 18% were farmworkers and 13% were experts of all kinds.\n\nMost of the awarded were very young. Half of them joined the Army before the 25th birthday, and only 325 of them were over 30. 42% of the Heroes who died in the war were between 16 and 26 years old, 38% were between 27 and 34. Three Heroes were less than 17 years old when died. Milka Bosnić was the youngest recipient of the order, she was just 15 when killed during the Raid on Drvar.\n\nMost recipients were awarded in the years following the World War II, most of them between 1951 and 1953. Tito was the only person to be awarded multiple times, he was awarded the order three times. Of the 955 recipients who died in the war, 77% were killed in combat, about 15% was executed or died in prison, and about 7% died from wounds. Most of the Heroes died in 1943 (about 30%) and in 1942 (27.5%). Nine of them were killed after the war officially ended during the fight with remaining enemy forces. 55 People's Heroes committed suicide to escape arresting.\n\nMost of the recipients of the Order were born in Croatia (21.9%), than in Bosnia and Herzegovina (20.6%), Montenegro (18.7%), Central Serbia (15%) and 11.05% were born in Slovenia. Most of those who died during the World War II died in Bosnia and Herzegovina (32%). In 1957 there were 410 living People's Heroes, in 1975 there were 367, and in 1981 there were 343 living Heroes.\n\n\n\n"}

Pilipinas Kay Ganda was eventually replaced with \"It's More Fun in the Philippines\". \n\nThe advertising agency Campaigns & Grey had advisory capacity over the campaign.

The agency claimed that the released logo was just a study and was released prematurely by the Department of Tourism.\n\nThe Pilipinas Kay Ganda campaign logo design was criticized for alleged plagiarism. Discussions on social media pointed out and suspected that the campaign logo was plagiarized from Poland's own tourism campaign, \"Polska\" (). The logos of Polska and Pilipinas Kay Ganda's font were similar. Both the letter \"L\" of the campaign slogans were stylized into trees. The difference is that Pilipinas Kay Ganda's letter \"L\" was stylized into a coconut tree with a smiley face as opposed to Polska's \"L\" which was stylized into generic tree. \n\nTourism Secretary Alberto Lim acknowledged that the Philippine campaign slogan bare some similarities with the Polska logo and commented that the Philippine campaign logo was more colorful. Tourism Undersecretary Enteng Romano, in a text message forwarded by Palace Spokesperson Abi Valte, denied that the Philippine campaign logo was plagiarized and that the logo has enough elements to be distinct from Poland's campaign logo.\n"}

Sometimes samples of non-perishable items are included in direct marketing mailings. The purpose of a free sample is to acquaint the consumer with a new product, and is similar to the concept of a test drive, in that a customer is able to try out a product before purchasing it.\n\nAlthough an expensive method of targeting customers, conversions to sales can be as high as 90% making it one of the main marketing strategies for certain markets. With effective sampling, marketers can create brand loyalty and assist in the launch of a product through the word of mouth.\n\nMany consumer product companies now offer free samples through their websites, to encourage consumers to use the products regularly, and to gather data for mailing lists of potentially interested customers. Paint chips are samples of paint colors that are sometimes offered as free samples.\n\nCompanies such as C.A. Courtesy, Costco, Sam's Club, Food Courts and Grocery Stores give out free samples to customers to persuade a customer to buy the product.\n\nThe expansion of online marketing with regards to promotional giveaways has facilitated the rise of \"Freebie sites\" that seek to aggregate all promotional free sample offers in one place. These sites will often compile free product samples from all over the World Wide Web and categorize them by type. Some product sample offers may require consumers to complete a survey or refer a friend in order to qualify for the freebies. When all requirements are fulfilled, the product samples are shipped to the consumer.\nSome sample products might be digital goods, where sample might be closely related to a product trial.\n\n19th Century soap manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt was one of the first known people, though not the first ever, to offer free samples of his products.\n\nInnkeepers are portrayed offering free samples in the 14th-century poem \"Piers Plowman:\" \"Tauerners 'a tast for nouht' tolden the same\" (Innkeepers said the same thing, 'A taste for free!').\n\nIn 1987 C. A. Courtesy became the first demonstration company to secure exclusivity with a retailer.\n\nIt is also possible to purchase products in small \"trial size\" containers. This is common with toiletries such as shampoo, which are useful for vacations or other travel, where large bottles or other containers would be impractical (or more recently, not permitted for air travel). These are also often provided in hotel and motel rooms for the guests. Samples may also be loaned to the customer if they are too valuable to be given for free, such as samples of a countertop or of carpet to be used for remodeling.\nSometimes companies in b2b market will offer sample of data or service for free before engaging business relationship.\n\nOther type of samples may include industrial samples, such as in the plastic industry, provided to companies for trial molding to see if the selected material is suitable for manufacturing the application (testing).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 24, 1995. The episode sees the film version of the comic book series \"Radioactive Man\" set up production in Springfield. Much to Bart's disappointment, the part of the hero's sidekick, Fallout Boy, goes to Milhouse. Milhouse, however, hates acting, so he quits the role, forcing the producers of the film to shut down production and go back to Hollywood.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Susie Dietter. Mickey Rooney guest starred as himself in the episode. \"Radioactive Man\" was the first episode of \"The Simpsons\" to be digitally colored. The episode features cultural references to the \"Batman\" television series, the 1995 film \"Waterworld\", and the song \"Lean on Me\" by Bill Withers. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5, and was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nBart and Milhouse are thrilled to hear that a film version of their favorite comic book series, \"Radioactive Man\", is in production. Rainier Wolfcastle, the star of the \"McBain\" films, is chosen to play Radioactive Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town. A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.\n\nA despondent Bart is told by Lisa that he is still needed as Milhouse's friend and confidant, and Bart eagerly accepts this new role. However, Milhouse finds his own job intolerable and disappears, right during the filming of the most expensive scene in the movie. The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Eventually, Bart finds him in his treehouse, and despite encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. With the film now cancelled and the producers bankrupt, the directors return to Hollywood.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very funny because of all the visual gags. Once the animatic was finished, she thought: \"Hey, this is really funny!\"\n\nThis is the first episode of \"The Simpsons\" to be digitally colored. The duties of that task went to USAnimation, who would later work on \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\". Digital coloring would not be attempted again until season 12's \"Tennis the Menace\", and again in season 14's \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\". The show permanently switched to digital coloring later in that same season, beginning with \"The Great Louse Detective\".\n\nMickey Rooney guest starred as himself in the episode. Nancy Cartwright recalls in her autobiography \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\" that Rooney recorded his lines with the other actors. Although he was late for the session, she comments that he was \"so full of pep\" and very enthusiastic about the role.\n\nThe Radioactive Man character is based on Batman, and several scenes in the episode reference the \"Batman\" television series from the 1960s. A \"Radioactive Man\" antagonist, The Scoutmaster, is based on actor/comedian Paul Lynde. The scene in the new \"Radioactive Man\" film where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy are captured in Aquaworld is a reference to the 1995 film \"Waterworld\". The director of the \"Radioactive Man\" film says: \"That Milhouse is going to be big, Gabby Hayes big!\", in reference to the American actor Gabby Hayes. Moe Szyslak, the bartender of Moe's Tavern, says that he, as a kid, played the part of Smelly on \"The Little Rascals\", until he killed Alfalfa for stealing his schtick. Bill Withers' song \"Lean on Me\" from 1972 is played at the end of the episode.\n\nIn one scene, Comic Book Guy sends a message to other Internet nerds about who will star in the new \"Radioactive Man\" film, two of whom are the nerds Homer met in \"Homer Goes to College\", and one is Prince dressed in a purple suit. The last nerd is Curtis Armstrong with an appearance resembling his \"Revenge of the Nerds\" character Booger. The usenet newsgroup which he posts the message to (alt.nerd.obsessive) is a reference to the alt.tv.simpsons newsgroup.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Radioactive Man\" finished 51st in the ratings for the week of September 18 to September 24, 1995. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5. The episode was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", and \"Melrose Place\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \"wonderful pastiche\" on the Tim Burton Batman films, and added that Milhouse is an obvious candidate for Fallout Boy. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode, but he does not consider it a \"classic\". He said that it offers \"more than a few amusing bits\", and added that \"spoofing the movie business isn't anything new, but the show does it well in this solid program\". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Krusty tries to prove the \"range\" of different characters he can portray to the casting director. The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of A-.\n\nNancy Basile of About.com named it one of her twenty favorite episodes of the series, and said that she thinks the friendship between Bart and Milhouse in the episode is \"endearing\" and \"touching\". She added that she thinks the episode \"pokes fun at Hollywood very effectively\", and that \"To top it off, funny favorite characters Rainier Wolfcastle [...] and Lionel Hutz are also in the episode.\" Graham Beckwith of \"The Lantern\" singled out Rainier Wolfcastle's line \"My eyes! The goggles do nothing!\" from the episode as one of \"The Simpsons\" \"greatest one liners\". \"Total Film\"s Nathan Ditum ranked Rooney's performance as the eighth-best guest appearance in the show's history, commenting that he is \"desperately funny and self-effacing as a parody of his fallen child-star self.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "36187312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36187312", "title": "Red carpet fashion", "text": "Red carpet fashion\n\nRed carpet fashion refers to the outfits worn on the red carpet at high-profile gala celebrity events such as award ceremonies and film premieres. The clothes worn to award events such as the Oscars and the Golden Globes consistently receive intense worldwide media scrutiny, making their red carpets an international product placement area of great importance to fashion designers. Despite the publicity given to award ceremonies, other red-carpet events such as the \"Vogue\"-hosted Met Ball also have a significant impact on the fashion world.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, many celebrities chose their own red-carpet dresses, with the Oscars being remembered for some extraordinary and eccentric outfit choices, including torn denim, sequinned jumpsuits and even Indian headdresses. For ceremonies such as the Golden Globes, it was rare to see a star dressing up formally until the late 1990s, with many nominees turning up casually dressed. When Halle Berry came to the 2000 ceremony in a glamorous white Valentino dress, it was described as a game-changer which set the standard for Golden Globe red carpet style, and according to Phillip Bloch, her stylist at the time, \"began the time when a dress could actually make a career.\" The increasing dependence on fashion stylists was something that had emerged since the 1990s, leading to criticism that red carpet fashion, particularly at the Oscars, now appears \"bland and homogeneous\", following a model of \"discreetly elegant gowns, softly swept-up hairdos and lots of diamond jewellery\". The stylist's role is to try to ensure that the client only receives positive publicity for her appearance and is not featured on 'worst-dressed' lists.\n\nIn 2004, \"The New York Times\", asking \"Does the glamour of the Golden Globes steal the scene from Oscar?\", observed that the wider range of potential nominees of the \"younger, hipper\" Globes, from television as well as film, offered designers more opportunity to have their work featured on the red carpet. Unlike the Oscars, nominees for the Golden Globes and other events are under less pressure to choose an expensive, one-of-a-kind haute couture gown, which is also easier for the designers who can offer samples from their latest ready-to-wear lines. One of the most widely publicised and talked-about red-carpet gowns was a ready-to-wear green Versace gown worn by Jennifer Lopez to the 42nd Grammy Awards ceremony on February 23, 2000.\n\nHaving a dress featured on the red carpet, particularly one that attracts media attention, is very important to a designer, with Carmen Marc Valvo saying in 2000:\n\nA year after Kate Winslet wore one of his dresses to the 2002 Oscars, designer Ben de Lisi said:\n\nThis strategy is not without risk, as a designer may invest major labour and time into creating a unique dress (which could cost up to $100,000) for a celebrity, only to have their investment wasted when the star decides at the last moment to wear someone else's dress. Particularly high-profile celebrities are often loaned dresses by several different designers for the ceremony, meaning that the designer often does not know until the night whether his or her dress was chosen to receive the much-desired exposure. In addition, they run the risk of never getting the dress back, rejected or not. The choice for a designer may also be whether to dress one actress for the Oscars, or design an entire ready-to-wear collection.\n\nFashion commentary often forms a key part of the reportage of red-carpet events, both in dedicated programmes such as \"Live From the Red Carpet\" and news reports such as those from \"BBC News\". Looks seen on the red carpet are also often featured in television programmes on fashion, such as \"Fashion Police\". Until they retired in 2011, Joan Rivers and her daughter Melissa presented televised reviews of red carpet fashions from various ceremonies including the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, and the Emmy Awards. In August 2007 Joan Rivers was replaced by Lisa Rinna as the host of TV Guide Network's red carpet coverage.\n\nWhen the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony was cancelled and replaced with a press conference as a result of a writer's strike which also threatened the Oscars, this was also seen as a threat to the fashion industry. Not only were established designers under threat, but the opportunity for up-and-coming designers to achieve widespread recognition through red-carpet exposure of their designs was severely limited. In 2008, a number of events, including the threat of an actor's strike that would have led to cancellation of the 2009 Oscar ceremony, and an upcoming star-studded presidential inauguration had a visible effect on that year's Golden Globes ceremony. Many stars dressed for the Globes in unique couture gowns that they might otherwise have reserved for the Oscars.\n"}

She was the first suffragette to be tried by jury.\n\nSarah Jane Baines was born in Birmingham, England, in 1866 to Sarah Ann (\"née\" Hunt) and James Edward Hunt, a gun maker.\n\nShe began work at Joseph Chamberlain's ordnance factory aged eleven.\n\nAt age fourteen, she joined her parents in working with the Salvation Army. Upon attaining the rank of lieutenant, now aged twenty, she was sent to work as an evangelist in an independent working men's mission in Bolton. In this role, she was also called upon to act as a police court missionary caring for women who had been arrested.\n\nOn 26 September 1888 in Bolton she married George Baines, a boot and shoemaker, and the couple had five children between 1888 and 1899 three of whom survived childhood.\n\nBetween motherhood and working as a sewing machinist, there was little time for public activities. Yet her commitment never wavered. She joined the Independent Labour Party, the feeding of school children committee and the unemployed committee.\n\nIn October 1905, she read about the arrest of suffragists Annie Kenney and Christabel Pankhurst for assault and this motivated Sarah to join the Women's Social and Political Union. Initially this was as a voluntary basis but in February 1908 she was made a paid organiser on a wage of £2 a week, organising open-air rallies, disrupting meetings and establishing new branches of the WSPU in the North of England and the Midlands.\n\nLater this same year, in November 1908, Sarah was to be tried of unlawful assembly at the Coliseum in Leeds, the first ever member of the WSPU to be tried by jury. Refusing to be bound over, she was convicted to six weeks imprisonment because \"she did ‘not recognise the laws of this Court administered by men\".\n\nOne of the first to advocate militant methods, Sarah was imprisoned some fifteen times for her part in protests. In July 1912, she was part of an attempt, along with Gladys Evans and Mary Leigh, to burn down the Theatre Royal in Dublin the night before a scheduled visit from then prime minister, H.H. Asquith. For this she was sentenced to seven months hard labour. Joining her fellow suffragette prisoners on hunger strike, she was released after five days.\n\nThe next year, on 8 July 1913, with her husband and son Wilfred, she was accused of attempting to bomb railway carriages at a Lancashire and Yorkshire railway siding. As a result, Sarah was re-arrested under the 'Cat and Mouse act' and imprisoned at Holloway Prison. She again went on hunger strike, refusing food and water, and was released in a 'very serious condition'.\n\nSarah suffered from St Vitus’ Dance brought on by emotional stress. WSPU leaders determined that Sarah's health could not endure another stint in prison so Sarah and her family were smuggled into Wales as the 'Evans' family and set sail aboard t\"he Ballarat\", bound for Australia, a reward for all she had done as Australia had achieved the federal vote in 1902.\n\nAfter being smuggled out of England, Sarah arrived in Melbourne, Australia in December 1913. She was forty-seven years old.\n\nAdele Pankhurst would later arrive in 1914.\n\nUpon settling in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, the Baines family joined the Victorian Socialist Party and the Labour Party while Sarah busied herself working with the Women's Political Association as early as January 1914 and co-founded the Women's Peace Army. With Adele Pankhurst, Sarah campaigned against World War I conscription in 1916-1917 and against the spiralling cost of living. Both were sentenced to nine months imprisonment but both were freed on appeal on a legal technicality.\n\nSarah was again jailed in March 1919 for flying the prohibited red flag on the Yarra Bank and became the first prisoner in Australia to undergo hunger strike. A special Federal Cabinet meeting was held and her release was secured on the advice of the Attorney-General.\n\nIn 1920, she helped establish the Communist Party in Victoria. Five years later, she would be expelled and this saw her rejoin the Labour Party.\n\nIn 1926, the family relocated to Port Melbourne and Sarah was appointed special magistrate to the Children's Court there from 1928 to 1948.\n\nAlthough her post Second World War activities were curtailed by her failing sight, Sarah Jane Baines continued her \"fiery eloquence on the hustings\" until her death from cancer, only giving up public speaking a few months before her passing on 20 February 1951 in Port Melbourne.\n\nSurvived by her husband and her three children, Sarah's legacy could perhaps be summed up in her own words:\n\nTo fight for that which is better and nobler in this world is to live in the highest sense, but to submit and tolerate the evils which exist is to merely vegetate in the sewers of iniquity. Jennie Baines quoted in \"The Socialist\", 11 April 1919.\n\n\n"}

The paragraph only makes up one of many paragraphs in an essay, most of which have a non-Schaffer-like introduction and conclusion. The structure is utilized because it is thought to help students who struggle with paragraph structure and is taught in some U.S. middle schools and in early high school classes.\n\nGeneral Schaffer paragraphs have some requirements as follows:\n\n\nA basic Schaffer paragraph begins with the topic sentence—stating what the paragraph is about, then followed by a concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a closing sentence. This is called a one-chunk body paragraph and is the most basic Schaffer model.\n\nOne of the key elements in the Schaffer program is what is called the \"ratio.\" Ratio is the amount of Concrete Detail in a paragraph compared to the amount of commentary. In the above paragraph the ratio is 1:2. The actual ratio for response to literature is 1:2+, which means there must be at least two sentences of Commentary for each sentence of Concrete Detail like so:\n\n\nNote that the ratio is still 1:2+ (At least twice as much Commentary as there is Concrete Detail)\n\nThis sentence should state the main point of the paragraph and be straight to the point\n\nThis sentence is the \"what\" is happening. It should be either facts, examples, illustrations, evidence, support, plot references, paraphrases, citations, quotations, plot summary, etc. It should be a concrete detail and should start with \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>for example<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" or a different transition.\n\nThere are one or two commentary sentences in each chunk.

Other works of Zagarenski are \"\", which was also a Caldecott Medal Honor Book in 2010, and \"This Is Just to Say: Poems of Apology and Forgiveness\", which is a 2008 Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry Award Honor Book.\n\nThe story, written by Logue, told in present tense, is a fiction book of 40 pages that follows a very awake little girl asking her parents if everything goes to sleep. The illustrations by Zagarenski show a family surrounded by images of crowns and ornate patterns while the parents coax the little girl to bed. It is a whimsical story with universal appeal. Most of the text is found at the beginning of the book, allowing kids to become drowsy as the story continues making this book a perfect bed time story. \"Sleep Like a Tiger\" also uses different analogies to relate animals and their sleep behaviors to those of the little girl.\n. The parents in this book practice the psychological art of paradoxical intention, realizing that instead of forcing the little girl to go to sleep they let her naturally relax in bed knowing that sleep will come.\n\nStarting with the old adage \"Once there was a little girl...\" you come across a little girl and her parents, all wearing crowns. The little girl is wide awake claiming she is not tired. Her parents take this almost as a regular occurrence and require that she at least put on her pajamas, wash her face, brush her teeth. The little girl keeps repeating that she is not tired but climbs into bed and under the sheets since that is where she is the most comfortable. She then proceeds to ask her parents if everything thing goes to sleep. The parents then proceed to go through a list of animals and their habits of sleeping. They discuss the family dog, the cat, bats, snails, bears, and whales. The little girl proclaims that she knows an animal that sleeps a lot. We then finally come across the tiger in the jungle, where the little girl tells her parents that he sleeps to stay strong. The parents agree that sleep is good to stay strong then say goodnight even though the little girl claims she is still not sleepy. Her parents know what will happen and agree that she can stay awake all night long. After the long discussion, the little girl goes through all the processes that the animals go through and ends up fast asleep.\n\n\"Sleep Like a Tiger\" was published to very strong reviews. \"Kirkus Reviews\" claim that Zagarenski's illustrations are the perfect backdrop to the stories lyrical quality, with her use of different textures, busy lines, and tiny details, observant readers will be pleasantly rewarded. Zagarenski usually has objects hidden in her illustrations having readers take closer looks and finding new objects even after the tenth time reading it, provides entertainment for both children and parents. Her work is a perfect combination of digitally created art and mixed media on wood. \"The Washington Post\" claims that Zagarenski's soft-toned dreamscapes of moons and stars and toys perfectly match the lyrical text and magnifies the mood.\n"}
{"id": "35698719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35698719", "title": "Social Axioms Survey", "text": "Social Axioms Survey\n\nFor the last several decades research in cross-cultural psychology has focused on the cultural patterning and positioning of values. Unfortunately, values have low predictive power for actual behavior. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong decided to develop a questionnaire to measure beliefs, i.e., what is believed to be true about the world, to add to the power of values, i.e., what the person believes is valuable, in predicting behavior.\n\nThey administered the original Social Axioms Survey (SAS) in five countries and used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the individual-level data. Five factors were found: Social cynicism, Social complexity, Reward for application, Religiosity and Fate control. However, analyzing the data on a country-wide level yielded only two factors: Societal cynicism and a combination of the other four factors labeled Dynamic externality. The SAS has proven useful in many research contexts, and eight years later the original researchers developed an updated version, the SAS II, using a more complex methodology to increase the reliability of the various factors. The SAS II is currently being used in research as the more comprehensive and reliable measure of beliefs about the world.\n\nThe study of values has a long history in psychological research, for instance Rokeach's value scale, which has been used widely. That focus has also been transferred to the study of culture in psychology. The anthropologists Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck conducted a large-scale study of values in five Southwestern US cultures in the 1950s. However, it was Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory that really initiated the wave of cross-cultural research on values. His four (later increased to six) dimensions of cultural values have become a major tool in many kinds of cross-cultural research.\nValues, however, have important limitations for predicting behavior. A value states that, \"X is good/desirable/important,\" but it does not indicate if a person thinks that X is obtainable. A belief, on the other hand, is a statement about how things work in reality. A social axiom, according to Leung and Bond's (2002) definition, describes how the world and society are believed to work. In other words, \"...a typical social axiom has the structure – A is related to B. A and B can be any entities, and the relationship can be causal or correlational.\" The strength of a belief can vary from person to person. Furthermore, a social axiom is different from a normative belief. Normative beliefs tell us what we \"ought\" to do, e.g., be polite to everyone. Social axioms are a guide as to what it is \"possible\" to do.\n\nLeung and Bond (2008) provide a formal definition of social axioms: \"Social axioms are generalized beliefs about people, social groups, social institutions, the physical environment, or the spiritual world as well as about categories of events and phenomena in the social world. These generalized beliefs are encoded in the form of an assertion about the relationship between two entities or concepts.\"\nSocial axioms act as a practical guide to human conduct in everyday life. They function in at least four ways. \"They facilitate the attainment of important goals (instrumental), help people protect their self-worth (ego-defensive), serve as a manifestation of people's values (value-expressive), and help people understand the world (knowledge).\" Leung and Bond (2002) also argue that because people in all cultures face similar challenges in everyday life, these axioms should be universal, even if people in each culture do not believe in them with the same strength.\n\nThe Social Axioms Survey (SAS) was developed with the cooperation of researchers in Hong Kong and Venezuela, using materials from local residents along with sources in the psychology literature to develop and screen items for the Survey. The survey was then refined using data from Japan, the USA and Germany.\n\nThree methods were used to generate a list of possible items for the Survey:\n\nOf the more than four thousand items collected, only about a third came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These items were classified, similar items were eliminated, and the remaining items were rewritten to be clear. The rewritten items were then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage.\n\nThe first working version contained 182 items. Scoring used a 5-point Likert-type scale, which ranged from \"strongly believe\" to a neutral midpoint \"no opinion\", to \"strongly disbelieve\", A standard English version was used to generate Chinese and Spanish versions.\n\nThe Survey was administered in both Venezuela and Hong Kong, using both university students (100 and 128 respectively), and citizens approached on the street (122 and 230). The adults completing the survey covered a range of ages, both genders and, in Venezuela, both urban and working participants.\n\nThe data were analyzed separately for Hong Kong and Venezuela using cluster analysis as well as exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to see if there were patterns of relationship among the beliefs within each culture. The analysis pointed to a five factor solution – five clusters of beliefs that seem to be interrelated. The five factors overlapped substantially between the Hong Kong and Venezuelan samples, indicating that they were valid for both cultures. For a second analysis, the scores from both cultures were combined, and principal components analysis was used. Five factors were again obtained. The survey was shortened by eliminating items that had low factor loadings or were inconsistent with the meaning of their factors, resulting in a final survey of 60 questions.\n\nAnother study was conducted to explore the SAS in three more cultures with differing value orientations on Hofstede's cultural dimensions scale. The questionnaire was given to college students in Germany, Japan and the United States. Confirmatory factor analysis checked by Procrustes rotation was used to analyze the data, and again five factors were found, although some differences between cultures were found, especially for Spirituality (subsequently renamed Religiosity) and Fate control.\n\n\nCross-cultural studies have analyzed data at two levels. Analysis can use the scores from individuals as data for statistical analysis, as the original SAS studies did, or it can use the averages of whole countries as data points, as Hofstede's values study did. These two methods can give very different results, since the patterns of scores within a country may be different from the average of the whole country sample.\n\nTo determine the factor structure of the SAS at the culture level Bond, Leung et. al. (2004) collected and analyzed SAS scores from 41 cultures. The data were analyzed at both the individual and country level. While the individual data yielded the expected five-factor structure, the country-level analysis yielded only a two-factor solution. Almost all items in one factor are contained in the original factor Social cynicism, so the factor was named Societal cynicism. The other factor contains items from the other four original factors. It was named Dynamic externality, combining both the \"external\" aspects of religiosity and fate control, and the \"dynamic\" aspects of Reward for application. Only one item from Social complexity appeared.\n\nEight years after their original construction of the SAS, the researchers developed a revised version (the SAS II) to improve its reliability. The earlier reliabilities of Social complexity and Fate control were lower than they liked, and they hoped to generally improve its performance between cultures.\n\nIn developing the SAS II a different strategy was used. The original SAS was deductive – it examined the data and then constructed the axiom categories. The weakness of this method is that some categories may not have been adequately represented in the original group of items. Over the course of eight years, research had shown that the SAS was valid, and could be used in a theory-driven approach to build the SAS II. Another difficulty with the original SAS was that the scale was developed using many Western-influenced items. Those items might not have the same meaning in other cultures, and axioms derived from those items might not be adequately valid. Van de Vijver and Leung (1997) proposed the \"culturally decentered\" approach, in which items are created by researchers from many cultural groups, and the final questionnaire is analyzed so that items that are answered differently by different groups are changed or eliminated. The culturally-decentered approach was used for the development of the SAS II. The SAS II yielded more reliable measures of Social complexity and Fate Control, and showed that Fate control could be sub-divided into two separate components, Fate determination and Fate alterability.\n\n\"Level of knowledge of a culture's social axioms predicts adjustment levels of immigrants.\" Kurman and Ronen-Eilon (2004) demonstrated that an immigrant's level of knowledge of the host culture's social axioms is a better predictor of adjustment than whether the immigrant shares the host culture's values or social axioms themselves. This is in agreement with Berry's model of acculturation, which maintains that the best strategy for immigrant success is integration – learning how to operate in the host culture without assimilating one's own values and beliefs completely.\n\n\"Social axioms supplement the predictive power of values.\" Bond et. al. showed that using social axioms added to the power of values to predict vocational choice, style of conflict resolution and style of coping.\n\n\n"}

If a person knows that they want to teach abroad but they aren't sure if they're able to make the transition, they can pick a teaching program that goes from a semester to a couple years. There are also programs where one can switch positions with a teacher overseas. When picking a program make sure its a credible program. Three often-used paths for American teachers are teaching at a Department of Defense school, teaching at an international school, or working independently at any school accepting foreign applicants.\n\nTeaching at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) school is much like teaching at a school within the United States. The schools enroll the children of military and DOD civilian employees. There are currently 222 public schools in “13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico” (DOD). There are 8,785 teachers working in these schools. The DOD works to keep the school atmosphere and level of learning comparable to schools within the U.S.\n\nThe DOD hires only teachers with bachelor's degrees (which must include some course work in education) and teaching experience. Most placements are for one or two years; teachers are placed at the discretion of the DoD and cannot choose their location.\n\nNumerous volunteer programs exist in which teachers can teach in foreign schools. Costs to participate as a volunteer vary depending on the organization, the country and the length of the program. International volunteer programs usually vary in length from 2 to 12 months. Volunteers most often teach English but other subjects can also be covered, such as computer skills, AIDS/HIV awareness, science, math, etc.\n\nVolunteer English teaching programs exist in almost all corners of the world. Some countries with prominent English teaching programs are Chile, Spain, France and Georgia. Many programs are sponsored by the host nation's ministry of education, such as the Chile's English Opens Doors and Korea's EPIK program.\n\nInternational schools are private schools that cater mainly to children who are not nationals of the host country, including the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Teachers are often hired on contracts which typically last two years Research has indicated that teaching experiences abroad contribute positively to the intercultural development of teachers (Savva, 2013).\n\nMany teaching positions overseas are for teachers of English, and can involve teaching to all ages, including both children and adults. Programs are organized by individual schools, national governments (such as the JET Programme in Japan and English Opens Doors in Chile). The University of Missouri-Saint Louis, like many schools, have required their education majors to either pick TESOL or special education to major in for more specificity. This university in particular wants teachers to be more well rounded for future employers. Some programs require teaching credentials and/or TESOL certification.\n\nThere is some dispute about the claimed usefulness of brief courses (TEFL, TESOL, etc.) in either becoming an effective teacher or finding employment. Such courses are sometimes advertised as being important or even required, without stating that they are no substitute for a university degree in teaching English as a foreign language.\n\n"}

Hours later, Jack stops in a secluded area, and begins digging a grave for the woman he had bound and gagged in the back of his pickup truck.\n\nFour women (Melinda, Patty, Kristina, and Denise) from Colorado Springs are driving through the area on their way to a nurse's conference in Las Vegas. Spotting Jack hitchhiking, the quartet pick him up, and soon after experience car trouble, forcing them to stop at a roadside motel. The manager tells the group that the nearest service station does not open until the morning, so they elect to stay. During the night, Jack shows interest in Melinda, and has rough sex with Kristina, who has a fiancé.\n\nIn the morning, the mechanic arrives, and is shot to death by Jack after the two travel to Jack's abandoned truck. Jack returns to the motel, where he murders the manager and takes the women captive after drugging them. Jack gives a misogynistic speech, and implies he is doing this due to having been \"betrayed\" by his girlfriend or wife. While sexually assaulting Denise and Melinda, Jack is knocked out by the latter, who tries to escape with her friends. The vehicles will either not work, or are missing their keys, so the women decide to kill Jack, who awakens while being attacked, and fatally shoots Kristina. The others are recaptured, and while Jack is binding Melinda (who he has developed a fondness for, and regards as \"special\") a married couple arrives, looking for a room.\n\nAfter giving the couple a room, Jack kills the husband when he goes to investigate noises coming from the room Melinda and the others are in. Jack places the man's wife, Susan, with the other captives, and shoots Patty in the head after Denise goes on an insult-laden rant against him. As Jack sleeps, Susan uses her cellphone to repeatedly dial 911, prompting a pair of police officers to stop by in the morning. Jack gets into a shootout with the officers, who he kills while Melinda, Denise, and Susan drive off in their patrol car. A chase ensues, during which Susan is shot in the head, and Jack is run over.\n\nWeeks later, Denise visits Melinda, and it is revealed that Jack had survived, and is being tried in Wyoming, where he murdered at least two women. That night, Jack, who had escaped from custody and hitchhiked his way to Colorado, breaks into Melinda's home, and ties her husband to a chair. Jack declares his love for Melinda, who responds by rejecting him, shooting him in the stomach, and then in the face.\n\n\nArrow in the Head gave \"The Hitchhiker\" a two and half out of four, describing it as \"a perfectly decent little flick\" and going on to say that \"For a direct-to-DVD knock-off, it's always watchable and mostly engaging. You could do worse than dropping a few bucks down for this, but don't expect to be too surprised or scared by the assembly line plot\". Beyond Hollywood said it was \"not altogether bad\" and that it moves well enough, \"with plenty of gratuitous sex, violence, and exploitative moments\" to warrant a viewing for those interested in the genre.\n\nFelix Vasquez Jr. of Film Threat panned the movie, writing that the movie was \"definite proof that all Leigh Scott had to do to ensure he'd inflict a cruel revenge on me was to make another movie\".\n"}

Based on Natalie Babbitt’s 1975 children’s book of the same name, it was a Walt Disney Pictures release.\n\n15-year-old Winnie (Winifred) Foster is from an upper-class family in the town of Treegap, and wants to make her own choices in life. After being told that she is going to a boarding school, she runs off into the forest where she meets Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring at the foot of a great tree. She is kidnapped by his older brother Miles and brought back to the Tucks' home where they tell her they will return her as soon as they can trust her.\n\nShe becomes enamored of their slow and simple way of life and falls in love with Jesse. She learns that the Tucks cannot age or be injured due to drinking water from a magic spring around a hundred years ago and that they kidnapped her to hide the secret. They tell her that living forever is more painful than it sounds and believe that giving away the secret of the spring will lead to everyone wanting to drink from it.\n\nA man in a yellow suit befriends the Fosters while Winnie is gone. He spies on the Tucks and he desires the spring to sell the water. He makes a deal to save Winnie and get the forest. He goes to the Tucks and orders them to reveal where the spring is; when they deny any knowledge about the spring he threatens Winnie with a pistol. He calls their bluff by shooting Jesse and exposing his youth; but in return Jesse's mother, Mae, kills him with the rear end of a rifle. The constable arrests Mae and Angus. Mae is sentenced to be hanged for murdering the man.\n\nAfter being returned home, Winnie is woken by Jesse who begs her to help him free his parents. The family fears that if Mae will be hanged the next day, she won't die and their immortality will be exposed to the public. Winnie helps Jesse and Miles to break the Tucks out of jail and say goodbye to them. Jesse, who has fallen in love with Winnie, asks her to join them, but Angus warns her that it is dangerous to go with them as they will be hunted. Jesse tells Winnie to drink from the spring so she could live forever and never age, then he will come back for her when everything is safe. He leaves promising to love her until the day he dies. After the Tucks depart, Winnie chooses not to drink the water. She would rather die after living a full life, than be immortal and stuck watching life pass her by.\n\n85 years later, Jesse returns to Treegap, which has now become a modern city. He goes into the woods and at the base of the great tree he finds Winnie's headstone marking the site of where the spring once stood. The stone reads that Winnie became a wife and mother before passing away at 100 years of age.

{"id": "144386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144386", "title": "Voyager Golden Record", "text": "Voyager Golden Record\n\nThe Voyager Golden Records are two phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. The records are a sort of time capsule.\n\nAlthough neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, \"Voyager 1\" will pass within 1.6 light-years' distance of the star Gliese 445, currently in the constellation Camelopardalis, in about 40,000 years.\n\nCarl Sagan noted that \"The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space, but the launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet.\" \n\nThe \"Voyager 1\" probe is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth. \"Voyager 1\" has reached interstellar space, the region between stars where the galactic plasma is present. Like their predecessors \"Pioneer 10\" and \"11\", which featured a simple plaque, both \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" were launched by NASA with a message aboard—a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of humans on Earth.\n\nThe contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of birds and whales). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's), and printed messages from U.S. president Jimmy Carter and U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. The record also includes the inspirational message \"Per aspera ad astra\" in Morse code.\nThe collection of images includes many photographs and diagrams both in black and white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the Solar System and its planets, DNA, and human anatomy and reproduction. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of chemical composition. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the universe.\n\nThe musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as J.S. Bach (interpreted by Glenn Gould), Mozart, Beethoven (played by the Budapest String Quartet), and Stravinsky. The disc also includes music by Guan Pinghu, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry, Kesarbai Kerkar, Valya Balkanska, and electronic composer Laurie Spiegel, as well as Azerbaijani folk music by oboe player Kamil Jalilov. The inclusion of Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" was controversial, with some claiming that rock music was \"adolescent\", to which Sagan replied, \"There are a lot of adolescents on the planet.\" The selection of music for the record was completed by a team composed of Carl Sagan as project director, Linda Salzman Sagan, Frank Drake, Alan Lomax, Ann Druyan as creative director, artist Jon Lomberg, Timothy Ferris as producer, and Jimmy Iovine as sound engineer..\n\nThe Golden Record also carries an hour-long recording of the brainwaves of Ann Druyan. During the recording of the brainwaves, Druyan thought of many topics, including Earth's history, civilizations and the problems they face, and what it was like to fall in love.\n\nAfter NASA had received criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included. However, the record does contain \"Diagram of vertebrate evolution\", by Jon Lomberg, with drawings of an anatomically correct naked male and naked female, showing external organs.\n\nThe pulsar map and hydrogen molecule diagram are shared in common with the Pioneer plaque.\n\nThe 115 images are encoded in analogue form and composed of 512 vertical lines. The remainder of the record is audio, designed to be played at 16⅔ revolutions per minute.\n\nJimmy Iovine, who was still early in his career as a music producer, served as sound engineer for the project.\n\nIt has been said that Carl Sagan suggested including the Beatles song \"Here Comes the Sun\" on the record but the record company EMI, which held the copyrights, declined. However, this was refuted by Timothy Ferris, who worked on the selection with Sagan; the song was never even considered for inclusion.\n\nIn July 2015, NASA uploaded the audio contents of the record to the audio streaming service SoundCloud.\n\nIn the upper left-hand corner is a drawing of the phonograph record and the stylus carried with it. The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side of the record—about an hour (more precisely, between 53 and 54 minutes).\n\nThe information in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs at the start of a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog television (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the \"picture lines,\" about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered \"interlace\" to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture raster, showing that there are 512 (2) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly. A circle was used in this picture to ensure that the recipients use the correct ratio of horizontal to vertical height in picture reconstruction. Color images were represented by three images in sequence, one each for red, green, and blue components of the image. A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.\n\nThe drawing in the lower left-hand corner of the cover is the pulsar map previously sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11. It shows the location of the Solar System with respect to 14 pulsars, whose precise periods are given. The drawing containing two circles in the lower right-hand corner is a drawing of the hydrogen atom in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale, both for the time given on the cover and in the decoded pictures.\n\nBlank records were provided by the Pyral S.A. of Créteil, France. CBS Records contracted the JVC Cutting Center in Boulder, Colorado, to cut the lacquer masters which were then sent to the James G. Lee record-processing center in Gardena, California, to cut and gold-plate eight Voyager records. After the records were plated they were mounted in aluminum containers and delivered to JPL.\n\nThe record is constructed of gold-plated copper and is in diameter. The record's cover is aluminum and electroplated upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope uranium-238. Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.468 billion years. It is possible (e.g. via mass-spectrometry) that a civilization that encounters the record will be able to use the ratio of remaining uranium to the other elements to determine the age of the record.\n\nThe records also had the inscription \"To the makers of music – all worlds, all times\" hand-etched on its surface. The inscription was located in the \"takeout grooves\", an area of the record between the label and playable surface. Since this was not in the original specifications, the record was initially rejected, to be replaced with a blank disc. Sagan later convinced the administrator to include the record as is.\n\n\"Voyager 1\" was launched in 1977, passed the orbit of Pluto in 1990, and left the Solar System (in the sense of passing the termination shock) in November 2004. It is now in the Kuiper belt. In about 40,000 years, it and \"Voyager 2\" will each come to within about 1.8 light-years of two separate stars: \"Voyager 1\" will have approached star Gliese 445, located in the constellation Camelopardalis; and \"Voyager 2\" will have approached star Ross 248, located in the constellation of Andromeda.\n\nIn March 2012, \"Voyager 1\" was over 17.9 billion km from the Sun and traveling at a speed of 3.6 AU per year (approximately ), while \"Voyager 2\" was over 14.7 billion km away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year (approximately ).\n\n\"Voyager 1\" has entered the heliosheath, the region beyond the termination shock. The termination shock is where the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically charged gas blowing continuously outward from the Sun, is slowed by pressure from gas between the stars. At the termination shock, the solar wind slows abruptly from its average speed of and becomes denser and hotter.\n\nOf the eleven instruments carried on \"Voyager 1\", five of them are still operational and continue to send back data today. It is expected that there will be insufficient energy to power any of the instruments beyond 2025.\n\nOn September 12, 2013, NASA announced that \"Voyager 1\" had left the heliosheath and entered interstellar space, although it still remains within the Sun's gravitational sphere of influence.\n\nSeveral works of science fiction, such as the 1979 film \"\", the 1984 film \"Starman\" and the 2000 film \"Battlefield Earth\" feature extraterrestrial intelligences discovering the record and turning their attention to Earth as a result. Among these is included the computer animated television show \"\", which features one of the records as a central plot point in a continuation of the \"Transformers\" storyline. Referred to as the Golden Disk, the record is stolen by Megatron and his band of Predacons. The disk is revealed to contain a hidden message left by the original Megatron, instructing his descendants to venture back in time to prehistoric Earth and assassinate Optimus Prime, to change history and ensure a Decepticon victory against the Autobots. \n\nIn a \"Saturday Night Live\" segment (\"Next Week in Review\") in episode 64 of the show's third season (originally aired 1978), Steve Martin's character, a psychic named Cocuwa, announced that extraterrestrials had responded to the record with the four words \"Send more Chuck Berry\".\n\nThe recording is a major plot piece of \"Little Green Men\", a season 2 episode of \"The X-Files\".\n\nOn \"\", the Greetings from Earth on the golden record are sent to \"Voyager\" by Rain Robinson in Season 3, Episode 8 \"Future's End\".\n\nIt was also referenced in the 2005 animation known as \"Fafner in the Azure\" as being one of the objects that the aliens discover.\n\nIn 2014, the podcast \"The Truth\" produced an episode titled \"Voyager Found\", where the \"Voyager\" crash-lands on the property of Dawn and Tad, an alien couple, who decide to play the record.\n\nIn 2014, composer Dario Marianelli wrote a \"Voyager Concerto\" for Violin and Orchestra, which was premiered in Brisbane, Australia in November that year by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (QSO), and in Stockholm the following April (2015), by the Swedish Radio Orchestra. The QSO, with British violinist Jack Liebeck, performed the piece over several concerts at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre; each performance was preceded by a lecture by physicist professor Brian Cox, who talked at length about NASA's Voyager Mission, and introduced the concerto. The 30-minute piece, in one single movement, depicts the journey of the \"Voyager\" through the Solar System, using as references some of the music that is on board each probe, on the Golden Record.\n\nAn image of the Golden Record cover is printed on the physical CD of Mary Fahl's 2014 release \"Love & Gravity\".\n\nThe 2015 feature documentary \"Sam Klemke's Time Machine\", compares the Golden Record's portrait of humanity to American man Sam Klemke's ongoing self-portraiture. In 1977—the same year that NASA launched Voyager with the Golden Record—Sam started obsessively documenting his entire life on film. \"Sam Klemke's Time Machine\", directed by Matthew Bate, premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nJim Moray, an English folk singer, released the album \"Upcetera\" in September 2016. It contains the track 'Sounds of Earth' in which he interweaves the stories of the production of the Golden Record and the romance between Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. It refers to the recording of an EEG of Druyan as she thought of Sagan as the sound of someone falling in love.\n\nIn October 2016, the podcast Science Friday featured an updated, crowd sourced version of the Golden Record which included, among other entries, I Have a Dream, \"The Little Prince\", and the human genome. \n\nGrace Petrie, an English songwriter and folk singer, released a track by the name of \"The Golden Record\" on her 2017 album \"Heart First Aid Kit,\" which is a love song based upon the story of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, referencing the additions made to the record intended to depict the sound of human beings in love. \n\nThe 2017 documentary \"The Farthest\", directed by Emer Reynolds, features those who worked on the Golden Record and Voyager missions including Frank Drake, Timothy Ferris, and Nick Sagan.\n\nMost of the images used on the record (reproduced in black and white), together with information about its compilation, can be found in the 1978 book \"Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record\" by Carl Sagan, F. D. Drake, Ann Druyan, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg, and Linda Salzman. A CD-ROM version was issued by Warner New Media in 1992. Author Ann Druyan, who later married Carl Sagan, wrote about the Voyager Record in the epilogue of Sagan's final book \"Billions and Billions\".\n\nTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of the record, Ozma Records launched a Kickstarter project to release the record contents in LP format as part of a box set also containing a hardcover book, turntable slipmat, and art print. The Kickstarter was successfully funded with over $1.4 million raised. Ozma Records then produced another edition of the three-disc LP vinyl record box set that also includes the audio content of the Golden Record, softcover book containing the images encoded on the record, images sent back by \"Voyager\", commentary from Ferris, art print, turntable slipmat, and a collector's box. This edition was released in February 2018 along with a 2xCD-Book edition. In January 2018, Ozma Records' \"Voyager Golden Record; 40th Anniversary Edition\" won a Grammy Award for best boxed or limited-edition package. \n\nA book called \"Hello World - A Time Capsule of Life, the Earth, and Humanity\" was inspired by Voyager's Golden Record. This book shares videos from around the world to create a time capsule of the planet Earth.\n\nThe track listing is as it appears on the 2017 edition released by Ozma Records.\n\n\n"}
