He was born in Damascus but lived mainly in Egypt during the 11th century Fatimid Caliphate. He also wrote an historical chronicle of the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. However, the book he is famed for and the only one extant, \"Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim\" (), the \"Selected Maxims and Aphorisms\", is a collection of sayings attributed to the ancient sages (mainly Greeks) translated into Arabic. The date of composition given by the author is 1048–1049.\n\nThe biographical details we have come from Ibn Abi Usaibia's \"Uyūn ul-Anbāʾ fī Ṭabaqāt ul-Aṭibbāʾ\" (, \"the History of Physicians\"). According to Usaibia, Ibn Fatik was from a noble family and held the position of \"emir\" at the court of the Fatimids in the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. He was a passionate bibliophile, acquired a great collection of books and enjoyed the company of scholars, and above all, he devoted himself to study. He trained in mathematics and astronomy under the philosopher, mathematician and astronomer Ibn al-Haytham (965-1040). He also associated with Ibn al-Amidi and the physician, astrologer, and astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan (988–1061). When he died, many heads of state attended his funeral. According to this biography, such was his wife's disaffection through want of attention, she threw most of his books into the pool at the center of the house, and so they were lost by drowning.\n\n \"Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim\" (), the “Book of Selected Maxims and Aphorisms”, can be described as a collection of biographies of twenty-one \"sages\", mainly Greeks (e.g. Seth, (Zedekiah), Hermes, Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Diogenes, Plato, Aristotle, Galen, Alexander the Great), accompanied by the maxims and sayings attributed to them. The biographies are largely legendary and most attributions highly dubious.\n\nHis \"al-Mukhtar\" was a great success in the centuries that followed, first in the Arab-Muslim world where it provided source material for later scholars, such as for Muhammad al-Shahrastani in his book \"Kitab al-wa-l-Milal Nihal\" and Shams al-Din al-Shahrazuri for his \"Nuzhat al-Arwah\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the films starred the Danish performer Bodil Joensen.\n\nIn the early 1980s, during the British home video boom, a videocassette of indeterminate origin began to circulate in underground circles that became known simply as \"Animal Farm\". It contained a plotless series of extremely graphic scenes of zoophilia, including acts of intercourse and fellatio performed with pigs, horses and even chickens (\"avisodomy\"), as well as a scene in which a woman inserts live eels into her vagina. To this day, \"Animal Farm\" remains one of the most notorious and controversial videotapes ever to find its way to British shores.\n\nThe material that constitutes the \"Animal Farm\" bootleg was apparently smuggled through British Customs in the Spring of 1981 by a tourist. It found its way under the counters of various Soho stockists and was eventually prosecuted following a series of police raids — but not before countless bootlegs had gone into circulation. It was discovered that the video actually comprised several short X-rated films from the Danish company Color Climax Corporation, which had been producing a steady stream of extreme pornography since the Danish government made all pornography legal in 1969. To keep up with the growing demand for video titles, Color Climax had taken to transferring their stocks of 8 mm and 16 mm animal films onto cassette, and it was these films — mostly starring Bodil Joensen — that composed the \"Animal Farm\" video, hence its generic title (which at no point appears on the screen) and shadowy origins. It is possible that some of the material was taken from Alex de Renzy's 1971 cash-in feature \"Animal Lover\", which actually managed a brief cinema run in the liberal atmosphere of San Francisco, and whose entire second half consists of the \"distinctively amateurish, shaky, clumsily-shot lurid colour footage\" familiar to anyone who has seen \"Animal Farm\".\n\nIn April 2006, the UK station Channel 4 screened a 50-minute documentary, \"The Real Animal Farm\", as part of their \"Dark Side of Porn\" season. Several interviewees, including David Kerekes (co-author of \"Killing For Culture\" and \"See No Evil\"), author Phil Tonge, feminist writer Germaine Greer and British pornographer Ben Dover, all confessed to having seen bootlegs of \"Animal Farm\" in the 1980s, but were apparently unaware that there was no such film – the entity referred to as such was merely a number of existing zoophilia shorts tacked together. Tonge described the owner of the copy he saw as an \"evil, evil scumbag\" and recalled how several \"hard lads\" either \"left the room\" or \"vomited\", Dover remarked that owning the bootleg was a useful aid to games of one-upmanship, since nothing could top the on-screen depravity of Joensen and her co-stars, and the normally easy-going Kerekes was moved to remark that \"there's only so much filth you can wallow in...and I think \"Animal Farm\" is pretty much at the bottom of the pit.\" Its impact on viewers was compared to that of hearing for the first time about the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThe documentary also told the story of Bodil Joensen, a psychologically traumatised young woman whose brief notoriety as the 'Queen of Bestiality' was followed by a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and prostitution before her death of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 40, and featured an interview with the Danish pornographer Ole Ege. The 1970 documentary \"A Summerday\" apparently formed at least some of the content of the \"Animal Farm\" bootleg, having been shown at the \"Wet Dreams\" pornography film festival beforehand.\n\n"}

Ashura, which is celebrated on the tenth day of Muharram across the Muslim World and is particularly significant for Shia Muslims, where it is a day of mourning. Moroccans however embrace this day with cheerful remembrance of those who passed away. It is a custom to pay visit to cemetery pray for the departed ones. \n\nIn Morocco, where the Muslim population is Sunni, the local customs associated with Ashura vary across the country. But traditionally, people exchange mixes of nuts mainly walnuts and almonds, and the popular Dates. Nowadays eclectic variety of Moroccan pastry is added to the mix. Additionally, children are given toys and this is the best time - a week prior to Ashura- to purchase Moroccan traditional musical instruments mainly; taârija drum, Derbouka, Triir and drum tambourines. The night before children play with fireworks in the streets and light bonfire called \"Sh'ala\" (). Traditionally females play with vigour the instruments around this fire reciting traditional Ashura folklore songs. Females then continue to play and sing taking their joy - Nashat- to other neighbours who then join the crowd of players. Marrakech is very known for their Daqqa Marrakchiya performed by Men.\n\nWith the modernisation expansion of cities this custom is becoming more and more rare and can only be seen is some traditional neighbourhoods and small villages. \n\nShia sources allege that these customs may be a legacy of the Ummayyad rule who sought to time such occasions of popular public display of joy—often pre-existing in local cultures—with the Ashura day in order to humiliate and counter the mourning of their enemies, the supporters of Ali (Shi'a). The latter see this day as a great catastrophe since it was the day of the death of Hussein and the slaughtering of his family at the battle of Karbala. However, today in Morocco, the event is not at all associated with the Shia-Sunni conflict and has little religious significance and is seen as merely a folk tradition.\n\nIn some regions of Morocco, the right of Baba Ashur is an activity for children during the festival of Ashura, wherein children wander from one house to another asking for candy and dried fruits or even money and asking the question \"the right of Baba Aichore?\" of anyone who answers the door This tradition has become famous recently when it has been considered as a substitute for fireworks which usually lead to a range of accidents. \n\nIn some cities, Moroccans call the tenth day of Muharram, Zamzam day. On this day, they spray water on each other. Whoever wakes up first sprays the rest with cold water, and gets lots of children and young people out (especially in the popular neighbourhoods) into the streets to spray every passerby with of water. Over the course of the first hours of the morning there are fierce \"water battles,\" especially among friends and neighbors. Whoever refuses to celebrate with \"Zamzam water,\" by sprinkling a little of it on his clothes, may be exposed to a number of volunteers taking turns dumping all of their water on his clothes. Then the day is capped off with a meal of \"Moroccan couscous\" with dried meat - La Khloua'- saved especially for this day from the sacrifice of Eid al-Adha. \n"}
{"id": "5743212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5743212", "title": "Buffer theory", "text": "Buffer theory\n\nIn the late 1950s a number of European countries (most notably West Germany and France) decided on a migration policy known as the buffer theory.\n\nOwing to rapid economic recovery in the post World War II period (aided by the American Marshall plan) there were many more job vacancies than people who were available or becoming available in the workforce to fill them. To resolve this situation they decided to \"import\" workers from the southern Mediterranean basin (including North Africa) on a temporary capacity to fill this labour shortfall.\n\nThese workers were invitees of the governments and came to Europe initially on the understanding that they could at any point in time in the future be repatriated if and when economic circumstances changed. These Gastarbeiter as they became known in Germany were mainly young unskilled males who very often left their families behind in their country of origin and migrated alone as 'Economic Migrant'. They worked predominantly in certain areas of the economy where working conditions were poorer than those of indigenous Germans and where the rates of pay were considerably lower. Ultimately they came to predominate in low paid service rated employment. The situation remained unchanged until the 1970s economic recession.\n\nJobs were being lost in manufacturing and industry in particular but not necessarily in the occupational types in which the migrants worked. In 1974 the then West German government imposed a ban restricting any future economic migrants and offered the possibility of returning to their country of origin to many others, few migrants took up the offer and stayed at their jobs or began to receive unemployment assistance from the state. This led to increased tensions and feeling of resentment from many German people.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and into the 1980s family reunification took place between Turkish migrants workers and their families. This reunification however took place in Germany rather than in Turkey. In a difficult economic climate after the 1973 oil crisis it was generally believed by most Turks already in Germany that their economic circumstances would be measurably better there than back in Turkey at such a difficult time. The welfare state offered considerable financial support to all people within Germany including immigrants communities. The number of foreign residents therefore increased in absolute terms during this time period.\n\nThe German government's offer to repatriate people back to their home country was not very successful. This created a difficult situation for the German government which became increasingly worse as the number of immigrants swelled to their highest levels ever. Any resentment, hostility and bitterness already present between indigenous Germans and the Turkish community became progressively worse. This often culminated in physical attacks on immigrants, arson and overt racial discrimination. There was a feeling amongst Germans that \"they have taken our jobs\", but this situation only arose because of Germans themselves losing their jobs in industry and manufacturing in particular in the difficult economic situation post 1973. (NB This 'family reunification' corresponds with the second wave on the Everett S. Lee model of migration).\n\nDates to the period from 1989 onwards with the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. East Germans flooded into West Germany along with many ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe. Germany accepted them as they were political refugees and very often asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2194306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194306", "title": "Bògòlanfini", "text": "Bògòlanfini\n\nBògòlanfini or bogolan (; \"mud cloth\") is a handmade Malian cotton fabric traditionally dyed with fermented mud. It has an important place in traditional Malian culture and has, more recently, become a symbol of Malian cultural identity. The cloth is being exported worldwide for use in fashion, fine art and decoration.\n\nThe technique is associated with several Malian ethnic groups, but the Bambaran version has become best known outside Mali. In the Bambara language, the word \"bògòlanfini\" is a composite of \"bɔgɔ\", meaning \"earth\" or \"mud\"; \"lan\", meaning \"with\" or \"by means of\"; and \"fini\", meaning \"cloth\".\nAlthough usually translated as “mud cloth,” bogolan actually refers to a clay slip with a high iron content that produces a black pigment when applied to handspun and handwoven cotton textiles.\n\nThe center of bògòlanfini production, and the source of the highest quality cloth, is the town of San.\n\nIn traditional bògòlanfini production, men weave the cloth and women dye it. On narrow looms, strips of cotton fabric about wide are woven and stitched into cloths about wide and long.\n\nThe dyeing (a \"strange and cumbersome technique\", according to the opinion of J.B. Donne in 1973) begins with a step invisible in the finished product: The cloth is soaked in a dye bath made from mashed and boiled, or soaked, leaves of the \"n'gallama\" tree (\"Anogeissus leiocarpa\"). Now yellow, the cloth is sun-dried and then painted with designs using a piece of metal or wood. The paint, carefully and repeatedly applied to outline the intricate motifs, is a special mud, collected from riverbeds and fermented for up to a year in a clay jar. Thanks to a chemical reaction between the mud and the dyed cloth, the brown color remains after the mud is washed off. Finally, the yellow \"n'gallama\" dye is removed from the unpainted parts of the cloth by applying soap or bleach, rendering them white.\n\nAfter long use, the very dark brown color turns a variety of rich tones of brown, while the unpainted underside of the fabric retains a pale russet color.\n\nAround Mopti and Djenné, a simpler method is used by artists considered to be of inferior skill. The cloth is dyed yellow in \"wolo\" solution, made from the leaves of \"Terminalia avicennoides\", and then painted over with black designs. The yellow is either removed, producing a stark black and white design, or painted a deep orange with a solution from the bark of \"M'Peku\" (\"Lannea velutina\").\n\nBased on these simplified techniques, as of around 2000, large quantities of bògòlanfini are being mass-produced for the tourist and export markets. These fabrics use simpler designs, often applied by stencil, painted in black on a yellow or orange background. With this method, the cloth can be produced about six to seven times faster. The democratic reforms after the overthrow of Moussa Traoré in 1991 caused many young men to lose their previously guaranteed government jobs and scholarships. This led many to take up bògòlanfini production. Consequently, most cloth is now produced by men rather than women, and the traditional year-long apprenticeships have been replaced by short, informal training sessions.\n\nIn traditional Malian culture, bògòlanfini is worn by hunters, serving as camouflage, as ritual protection and as a badge of status. Women are wrapped in bògòlanfini after their initiation into adulthood (which includes genital cutting) and immediately after childbirth, as the cloth is believed to have the power to absorb the dangerous forces released under such circumstances.\n\nBògòlanfini patterns are rich in cultural significance, referring to historical events (such as a famous battle between a Malian warrior and the French), crocodiles (significant in Bambara mythology) or other objects, mythological concepts or proverbs. Since about 1980, Bògòlanfini has become a symbol of Malian cultural identity and is being promoted as such by the Malian government.\n\nBògòlanfini has become a popular Malian export, notably to the United States. There, it is marketed as \"mud cloth\", either as a symbol of African American culture or as a generically \"ethnic\" decorative cloth.\n\nIn Mali, the cloth is worn by people of all ethnicities, including prominently in Malian cinema and by Malian musicians, either as an expression of national or ethnic identity or as a fashion statement. Particularly popular among young people, Bògòlanfini is made into a wide range of clothes, Western miniskirts and jackets as well as traditional flowing robes (\"boubous\").\n\nThe Malian fashion designer Chris Seydou has been credited with popularizing bògòlanfini in international fashion.\n\nBògòlanfini is also produced as fine art by several Malian artists, notably by the \"Groupe Bogolan Kasobané\", six artists collaborating since 1978. These paintings are produced with vegetable dyes and mud, but often feature designs unrelated to those of traditional fabrics; their newer motifs are also often found on clothing. Other notable creators include Nakunte Diarra.\n\nTraditional Bògòlanfini designs are also used for on a wide range of commercial products, such as coffee mugs, curtains, towels, sheets, book covers and wrapping paper.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8478592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8478592", "title": "Chūshingura", "text": "Chūshingura\n\nThe historical basis for the narrative begins in 1701. The ruling \"shōgun\" Tokugawa Tsunayoshi placed Asano Takumi-no-kami Naganori, the \"daimyō\" of Akō, in charge of a reception of envoys from the Imperial Court in Kyoto. He also appointed the protocol official (\"kōke\") Kira Kōzuke-no-suke Yoshinaka to instruct Asano in the ceremonies. On the day of the reception, at Edo Castle, Asano drew his short sword and attempted to kill Kira. His reasons are not known, but many purport that an insult may have provoked him. For this act, he was sentenced to commit \"seppuku\", but Kira did not receive any punishment. The shogunate confiscated Asano's lands (the Akō Domain) and dismissed the samurai who had served him, making them rōnin.\n\nNearly two years later, Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, who had been a high-ranking samurai in the service of Asano, led a group of forty-six/forty-seven of the \"rōnin\" (some discount the membership of one for various reasons). They broke into Kira's mansion in Edo, captured and executed Kira, and laid his head at the grave of Asano at Sengaku-ji. They then turned themselves in to the authorities, and were sentenced to commit \"seppuku\", which they all did on the same day that year. Ōishi is the protagonist in most retellings of the fictionalized form of what became known as the Akō incident, or, in its fictionalized form, the Treasury of Loyal Retainers (\"Chūshingura\").\n\nIn 1822, the earliest known account of the Akō incident in the West was published in Isaac Titsingh's posthumous book, \"Illustrations of Japan\".\n\nIn the story of the 47 \"rōnin\", the concept of \"chūshin gishi\" is another interpretation taken by some. \"Chūshin gishi\" is usually translated as \"loyal and dutiful samurai\". However, as John Allen Tucker points out that definition glosses over the religious meaning behind the term. Scholars during that time used that word to describe people who had given their lives for a greater cause in such a way that they deserved veneration after death. Such people were often entombed or memorialized at shrines.\n\nHowever, there is a debate on whether they even should be worshiped and how controversial their tombs at Sengakuji are. Tucker raises a point in his article that the \"rōnin\" were condemned as \"rōnin\", but then in the end their resting places are now honored. In other words, it is like those that regarded the \"rōnin\" as \"chūshin gishi\" were questioning the decision of the Bakufu (the shogunate, the authorities who declared them \"rōnin\"). Perhaps even implying that the Bakufu had made a mistake. Those recognizing the \"rōnin\" as \"chūshin gishi\" were really focusing on the basics of samurai code where loyalty to your master is their ultimate and most sacred obligation.\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, Confucius used to say that the great ministers served their rulers the moral way. Early Confucianism emphasized loyalty, the moral way and objection and legitimate execution of wrongdoers. \"Chūshin gishi\" is interpreted as almost a blind loyalty to your master. In the \"Book of Rites\", something similar to \"chūshin gishi\" is mentioned which is called zhongchen yishi. Interpretations of the passage from the Book identified those who would sacrifice themselves in the name of duty should live on idealized. However, there were also those that agreed on condemnation of the \"rōnin\" as criminals such as Ogyū Sorai. So definitely there was controversy revolving around the legitimacy of the \"rōnins\" actions. Sorai, Satō Naokata and Dazai Shundai were some of those who believed that the \"rōnin\" were just criminals and had no sense of righteousness. Because they did violate the law by killing Kira Yoshinaka.\n\nConfucianism and the deification of the \"rōnins\" collision is something that is very important to the way to understanding Bakufu law. Confucian classics and the Bakufu law may have seemed to compliment each other to allow revenge. Hayashi Hōkō claims that the idolization of the \"rōnin\" may have been allowed because their actions matched with the Chinese loyalists. Also suggesting that only by killing themselves would they be able to claim their title as \"chūshin gishi\". There then, Hokō summarized that there might have been a correlation between the law and the lessons put forth in Confucian classics.\n\nActually during the seventeenth century there was a system of registered vendettas. This meant that people could avenge a murder of a relative, but only after their plans strictly adhered to legal guidelines. However, the Akō vendetta did not adhere to this legalized system. Thus, they had to look to Confucian texts to justify their vendetta. \"Chūshin gishi\" is something that cannot be looked on lightly in regards to this story because it is the main idea in this story. Loyalty and duty to one's master as a retainer is everything in the story of the 47 \"rōnin\".\n\nBeing able to draw Confucianist values from this story is no coincidence, it is said that Asano was a Confucian. So it would only seem natural that his retainers would practice the same thing. Their ultimate sacrifice for their master is something that is held in high regard in Confucianism because they are fulfilling their responsibility to the fullest extent. There is nothing more after that kind of sacrifice. At that point the warriors have given their everything to their master. That type of devotion is hard to contest as something other than being a \"chūshin gishi\".\n\nThe puppet play based on these events was entitled \"Kanadehon Chūshingura\" and written by Takeda Izumo (1691–1756), Miyoshi Shōraku (c. 1696 – 1772) and Namiki Senryū (1695 – c. 1751). It was first performed in August 1748 at the Takemoto-za theatre in the Dōtonbori entertainment district in Osaka, and an almost identical kabuki adaptation appeared later that year. The title means \"\"Kana\" practice book Treasury of the loyal retainers\". The \"kana practice book\" aspect refers to the coincidence that the number of \"rōnin\" matches the number of \"kana\", and the play portrayed the \"rōnin\" as each prominently displaying one kana to identify him. The forty-seven \"rōnin\" were the loyal retainers of Asano; the title likened them to a warehouse full of treasure. To avoid censorship, the authors placed the action in the time of the \"Taiheiki\" (a few centuries earlier), changing the names of the principals. The play is performed every year in both the bunraku and kabuki versions, though more often than not it is only a few selected acts which are performed and not the entire work.\n\nSections of the following synopsis of Kanadehon Chūshingura are reproduced by permission from the book \"A Guide to the Japanese Stage\" by Ronald Cavaye, Paul Griffith and Akihiko Senda, published by Kodansha International, Japan:\n\nKanadehon Chūshingura (\"The Treasury of Loyal Retainers\") is based on a true incident which took place between 1701 and 1703. To avoid shogunate censorship, the authors set the play in the earlier Muromachi period (1333–1568) and the names of the characters were altered. However some names sounded similar and those with knowledge knew what they were referring to in reality. For example the real person Ōishi Kuranosuke was changed to Ōboshi Yuranosuke. The play therefore fuses fiction and fact. \n\nThe central story concerns the \"daimyō\" En'ya Hangan, who is goaded into drawing his sword and striking a senior lord, Kō no Moronō (Note: although the \"furigana\" for Moronō's name is \"Moronao\", the pronunciation is Moronō). Drawing one's sword in the \"shōgun\"s palace was a capital offense and so Hangan is ordered to commit seppuku, or ritual suicide by disembowelment. The ceremony is carried out with great formality and, with his dying breath, he makes clear to his chief retainer, Ōboshi Yuranosuke, that he wishes to be avenged upon Moronō. \n\nForty-seven of Hangan's now masterless samurai or \"rōnin\" bide their time. Yuranosuke in particular, appears to give himself over to a life of debauchery in Kyoto's Gion pleasure quarters in order to put the enemy off their guard. In fact, they make stealthy but meticulous preparations and, in the depths of winter, storm Moronō's Edo mansion and kill him. Aware, however, that this deed is itself an offense, the retainers then carry Moronō’s head to the grave of their lord at Sengaku-ji temple in Edo, where they all commit seppuku.\n\nAct I, Tsurugaoka kabuto aratame (\"The Helmet Selection at Hachiman Shrine\")\n\nThis play has a unique opening, in which the curtain is pulled open slowly over several minutes, accompanied by forty-seven individual beats of the ki, one for each of the heroic \"rōnin\". Gradually, the actors are revealed in front of the Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura slumped over like lifeless puppets. As the gidayū narrator speaks the name of each character he comes to life. Lord Moronō's evil nature is immediately demonstrated by his black robes and the furious mie pose which he strikes when his name is announced. He is hostile to the younger, inexperienced lords. They have all gathered to find and present a special helmet at the shrine and it is Hangan's wife, Kaoyo, who is the one to identify it. When the ceremony is over and he is eventually left alone with Kaoyo, Moronō propositions her but she rejects his amorous advances.\n\nAct II, The Scriptorium of the Kenchōji Temple\n\nWhen Act II is performed as Kabuki it is often given in a later version, first performed by Ichikawa Danjūrō VII (1791–1859), and entitled \"The Scriptorium of the Kenchōji Temple\". A performance of Act II is extremely rare, even \"complete\" (\"tōshi kyōgen\") performances almost never include it. The original puppet and Kabuki scripts of Act II are similar and the story is as follows –\nThe act takes place in the mansion of the young \"daimyō\", Momonoi Wakasanosuke. His chief retainer, Kakogawa Honzō, admonishes the servants for gossiping about the humiliation of their master by Moronō at the previous day's ceremony at the Tsurugaoka shrine. Even Honzō's wife, Tonase, and daughter, Konami, speak of it. \nŌboshi Rikiya, Konami's betrothed and the son of En'ya Hangan’s chief retainer, Ōboshi Yuranosuke, arrives with a message that Moronō has commanded that both Hangan and Wakasanosuke appear at the palace by four in the morning in order to prepare the ceremonies for the \"shōgun\"s younger brother whom they are to entertain. \nWakasanosuke hears the message and dismisses them all apart from Honzō. He speaks of the insults which he suffered and his determination to take his revenge. He decides to kill Moronō tomorrow even if such a rash and illegal act brings about the eradication of his household. \nSurprisingly, the older and wiser Honzō sympathises with him and, as a symbol that Wakasanosuke should go through with the attack, he cuts off the branch of a bonsai pine tree. It is one o'clock in the morning and Wakasanosuke goes off to bid farewell to his wife for the last time. \nAs soon as his master leaves Honzō calls urgently for his horse. Forbidding his wife and daughter from disclosing his intentions, he gallops off to Moronō's mansion to prevent what would be a disaster both for his master and his master's house.\n\nAct III, scene 2, Matsu no rōka (\"The Pine Corridor in the \"Shōgun\"s Palace\")\n\nThis is the scene which seals Hangan's fate. Offended by Kaoyo's rebuff, Moronō hurls insults at Hangan, accusing him of incompetence and of being late for his duties. Hangan, he says, is like a little fish: he is adequate within the safe confines of a well (his own little domain), but put him in the great river (the \"shōgun\"s mansion in the capital) and he soon hits his nose against the pillar of a bridge and dies. Unable to bear the insults any longer, Hangan strikes Moronō but, to his eternal chagrin, is restrained from killing him by Wakasanosuke's retainer Kakogawa Honzō.\n\nAct IV, scene 1, En'ya yakata no ba (\"En'ya Hangan's Seppuku\")\n\nHangan is ordered to commit seppuku and his castle is confiscated. The emotional highlight of this scene is Hangan's death. The preparations for the ceremony are elaborate and formal. He must kill himself on two upturned tatami mats which are covered with a white cloth and have small vases of anise placed at the four corners. He is dressed in the \"shini-shōzoku\", the white kimono worn for death. \nThe details of the seppuku were strictly prescribed: the initial cut is under the left rib-cage, the blade is then drawn to the right and, finally, a small upward cut is made before withdrawing the blade. Hangan delays as long as he can, however, for he is anxious to have one last word with his chief retainer, Yuranosuke. At the last moment, Yuranosuke rushes in to hear his lord's dying wish to be avenged on Moronō. Hangan is left to despatch himself by cutting his own jugular vein. \n\nThis act is a \"tosan-ba\", or \"do not enter or leave\" scene, which means the audience was not allowed to enter or leave while it was played, the atmosphere had to be completely silent and nothing was allowed to disturb the suicide scene. \n\nAct IV, scene 2, Uramon (\"The Rear Gate of the Mansion\")\n\nNight has fallen and Yuranosuke, left alone, bids a sad farewell to their mansion. He holds the bloody dagger with which his lord killed himself and licks it as an oath to carry out his lord's dying wish. The curtain closes and a lone shamisen player enters to the side of the stage, accompanying Yuranosuke's desolate exit along the hanamichi.\n\nInteract, Michiyuki tabiji no hanamuko (Ochiudo) (\"The Fugitives\")\n\nThis michiyuki or \"travel-dance\" was added to the play in 1833 and is very often performed separately. The dance depicts the lovers Okaru and Kanpei journeying to the home of Okaru's parents in the country after Hangan's death. Kanpei was the retainer who accompanied Hangan to the \"shōgun\"s mansion and he is now guilt ridden at his failure to protect his lord. He would take his own life to atone for his sin, but Okaru persuades him to wait. The couple are waylaid by the comical Sagisaki Bannai and his foolish men. They are working for Lord Moronō but Kanpei easily defeats them and they continue on their way.\n\nAct V, scene 1, Yamazaki kaidō teppō watashi no ba (\"The Musket Shots on the Yamazaki Highway\")\n\nWhile only a peripheral part of the story, these two scenes are very popular because of their fine staging and dramatic action. Kanpei is now living with Okaru's parents and is desperate to join the vendetta. On a dark, rainy night we see him out hunting wild boar. \nMeanwhile, Okaru has agreed that her father, Yoichibei, sell her into prostitution in Kyoto to raise money for the vendetta. On his way home from the Gion pleasure quarter with half the cash as a down payment, Yoichibei is, however, murdered and robbed by Sadakurō, the wicked son of Kudayū, one of Hangan’s retainers. Sadakurō is dressed in a stark black kimono and, though brief, this role is famous for its sinister and blood curdling appeal. \nKanpei shoots at a wild boar but misses. Instead, the shot hits Sadakurō and, as he dies, the blood drips from Sadakurō's mouth onto his exposed white thigh. Kanpei finds the body but cannot see who it is in the darkness. Hardly believing his luck, he discovers the money on the body, and decides to take it to give to the vendetta.\n\nAct VI, Kanpei seppuku no ba (\"Kanpei's Seppuku\")\n\nYoichibei’s murder is discovered and Kanpei, believing mistakenly that he is responsible, commits seppuku. The truth, however, is revealed before he draws his last breath and, in his own blood, Kanpei is permitted to add his name to the vendetta list.\n\nAct VII, Gion Ichiriki no ba (\"The Ichiriki Teahouse at Gion\")\n\nThis act gives a taste of the bustling atmosphere of the Gion pleasure quarter in Kyoto. Yuranosuke is feigning a life of debauchery at the same teahouse to which Okaru has been indentured. Kudayū, the father of Sadakurō, arrives. He is now working for Moronō and his purpose is to discover whether Yuranosuke still plans revenge or not. He tests Yuranosuke's resolve by offering him food on the anniversary of their lord's death when he should be fasting. Yuranosuke is forced to accept. Yuranosuke's sword – the revered symbol of a samurai – is also found to be covered in rust. It would appear that Yuranosuke has no thoughts of revenge. But still unsure, Kudayū hides under the veranda.\nNow believing himself alone, Yuranosuke begins to read a secret letter scroll about preparations for the vendetta. On a higher balcony Okaru comes out to cool herself in the evening breeze and, noticing Yuranosuke close by, she also reads the letter reflected in her mirror. As Yuranosuke unrolls the scroll, Kudayū, too, examines the end which trails below the veranda. Suddenly, one of Okaru's hairpins drops to the floor and a shocked Yuranosuke quickly rolls up the scroll. Finding the end of the letter torn off, he realises that yet another person knows his secret and he must silence them both. Feigning merriment, he calls Okaru to come down and offers to buy out her contract. He goes off supposedly to fix the deal. Then Okaru's brother Heiemon enters and, hearing what has just happened, realises that Yuranosuke actually intends to keep her quiet by killing her. He persuades Okaru to let him kill her instead so as to save their honour and she agrees. Overhearing everything, Yuranosuke is now convinced of the pair's loyalty and stops them. He gives Okaru a sword and, guiding her hand, thrusts it through the floorboards to kill Kudayū.\n\nThe main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen, drunkard \"rōnin\" and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness. This is called \"hara-gei\" or \"belly acting\", which means he has to perform from within to change characters. It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn, but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor's emotion. \n\nEmotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes, a key element in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus. \n\nAct VIII, Michiyuki tabiji no yomeiri (\"The Bride’s Journey\")\n\nWhen Enya Hangan drew his sword against the evil Moronō within the \"shōgun\"s palace, it was Kakogawa Honzō who held him back, preventing him from killing the older lord. Honzō's daughter, Konami, is betrothed to Yuranosuke's son, Rikiya, but since that fateful event the marriage arrangements have been stalled, causing much embarrassment to the girl. Not prepared to leave things as they are, Honzō's wife, Tonase, resolves to deliver Konami to Yuranosuke’s home in order to force the marriage. \nThis act takes the form of a michiyuki dance in which Tonase leads her stepdaughter along the great Tōkaidō Highway, the main thoroughfare linking Edo in the east with Kyoto in the west. On the way, they pass a number of famous sites such as Mt. Fuji and, as a marriage procession passes by, Konami watches enviously, thinking that in better times she herself would have ridden in just such a grand palanquin. Tonase encourages her daughter, telling her of the happiness to come once she is wed.\n\nAct IX, Yamashina kankyo no ba (\"The Retreat at Yamashina\")\n\nSet in the depths of winter, Kakogawa Honzō's wife Tonase, and daughter Konami, arrive at Yuranosuke's home in Yamashina near Kyoto. Yuranosuke's wife is adamant that after all that has happened there can be no possibility of marriage between Konami and Rikiya. In despair, Tonase and Konami decide to take their own lives. Just then, Honzō arrives disguised as a wandering priest. To atone for his part in restraining Hangan from killing Moronō, he deliberately pulls Rikiya's spear into his own stomach and, dying, gives Yuranosuke and Rikiya a plan of Moronō's mansion in Edo.\nAct X, Amakawaya Gihei Uchi no ba (\"The House Amakawaya Gihei\")\nAct X is only rarely performed but provides a realistic interim (performed in the sewamono style) between Yuranosuke setting out at the end of Act IX and the final vendetta. The action takes place at the premises of Amakawaya Gihei, a merchant who lives in the port of Sakai, near Osaka. Yuranosuke has entrusted Gihei with the purchase and shipment to Kamakura of all the weapons, armour and other equipment which they will need for the vendetta. Knowing that he may be linked to the vendetta, Gihei has been preparing by dismissing his staff so that they would not be aware of what he was doing. He has even sent his wife, Osono, to her father's so that she would be out of the way.\nThe act usually opens with some of the boatmen discussing the loading of the chests and the weather and, as they go off, Gihei's father-in-law, Ryōchiku, comes, demanding a letter of divorce so that he can marry Osono off to another man. Gihei agrees, thinking that his wife has betrayed him. \nAfter Ryōchiku's departure, law officers arrive and accuse Gihei of being in league with Hangan's former retainers. Gihei refuses to allow them to open one of the chests of weapons and armour, even threatening to kill his own son to allay their suspicions. Suddenly Yuranosuke himself appears and confesses that the law officers are, in fact, members of the vendetta and that he sent them to test Gihei's loyalty. He praises Gihei's resolution and commitment to their cause. \nAs they all go off to a back room for a celebratory drink of sake, Gihei's wife, Osono arrives, wishing both to return the letter of divorce, which she has stolen from her father, and to see their child. \nGihei, however, torn between his love for his wife and his duty to Yuranosuke reluctantly forces her to leave. Shut outside, she is attacked in the dark by two men who steal her hair pins and combs and cut off her hair. \nYuranosuke and his men reappear and, about to depart, place some gifts for Gihei on an open fan. The gifts turn out to be Osono's shorn hair and ornaments. Yuranosuke had his men attack her and cut her hair to that her father would be unable to marry her off. No one would take a wife with hair as short as a nun's. In hundred days, he says, her hair will grow back and she can be reconciled with her husband, Gihei. By then, Yuranosuke and his men will also have achieved their goal. Gihei and Osono, overawed by his kindness, offer their deepest thanks. Yuranosuke and his men depart for their ship.\nAct XI, Koke uchiiri no ba (\"The Attack on Moronô’s Mansion\")\nThe final act takes place at Moronō's mansion on a snowy night. The attack is presented in a series of tachimawari fight scenes before Moronō is finally captured and killed.\n\nThe play became very popular and was depicted in many \"ukiyo-e\" prints. A large number of them are in the collection of the Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum.\n\nDecember is a popular time for performances of \"Chūshingura\". Because the break-in occurred in December (according to the old calendar), the story is often retold in that month.\n\nThe history of \"Chūshingura\" on film began in 1907, when one act of a kabuki play was released. The first original production followed in 1908. Onoe Matsunosuke played Ōishi in this ground-breaking work. The story was adapted for film again in 1928. This version, \"Jitsuroku Chūshingura\", was made by film-maker Shōzō Makino to commemorate his 50th birthday. Parts of the original film were destroyed when fire broke out during the production. However, these sequences have been restored with new technology.\n\nA Nikkatsu film retold the events to audiences in 1930. It featured the famous Ōkōchi Denjirō in the role of Ōishi. Since then, three generations of leading men have starred in the role. Younger actors play Asano, and the role of Aguri, wife (and later widow) of Asano, is reserved for the most beautiful actresses. Kira, who was over sixty at his death, requires an older actor. Ōkōchi reprised the role in 1934. Other actors who have portrayed Ōishi in film include Bandō Tsumasaburō (1938), and Kawarasaki Chōjūrō IV (1941). In 1939, Kajirō Yamamoto filmed \"Chushingura\" in two parts with his then assistant director Akira Kurosawa. The two parts were titled \"Chushingura (Go)\" (1939) and \"Chushingura (Zen)\" (1939).\n\nIn 1941 the Japanese military commissioned director Kenji Mizoguchi (\"Ugetsu\") to make \"The 47 Ronin\". They wanted a ferocious morale booster based upon the familiar \"rekishi geki\" (\"historical drama\") of \"The Loyal 47 Ronin\". Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source \"Mayama Chushingura\", a cerebral play dealing with the story. \"The 47 Ronin\" was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the Attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite Part One's lukewarm reception. The film was celebrated by foreign scholars who saw it in Japan; it was not shown in the United States until the 1970s.\n\nDuring the occupation of Japan, the GHQ banned performances of the story, charging them with promoting feudal values. Under the influence of Faubion Bowers, the ban was lifted in 1947. In 1952, the first film portrayal of Ōishi by Chiezō Kataoka appeared; he took the part again in 1959 and 1961. Matsumoto Kōshirō VIII (later Hakuō), Ichikawa Utaemon, Ichikawa Ennosuke II, Kinnosuke Yorozuya, Ken Takakura and Masahiko Tsugawa are among the most noteworthy actors to portray Ōishi.\n\nThe story was told again in the 1962 Toho production by the acclaimed director Hiroshi Inagaki and titled \".\" The actor Matsumoto Kōshirō starred as Chamberlain Ōishi Kuranosuke and Toshiro Mifune also appeared in the film. The actress Setsuko Hara retired following her appearance as Riku, wife of Ōishi.\n\nThe Hollywood film \"47 Ronin\" by Universal is a fantasy epic, with Keanu Reeves as an Anglo-Japanese who joins the samurai in their quest for vengeance against Lord Kira, who is aided by a fictitious shape-shifting witch. It co-stars many prominent Japanese actors including Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano, Kō Shibasaki, Rinko Kikuchi, Jin Akanishi, and Togo Igawa. The film was originally scheduled to be released on November 21, 2012, then moved to February 8, 2013, due to creative differences between Universal and director Carl Rinsch, requiring the inclusion of additional scenes and citing the need for work on the 3D visual effects. It was later postponed to December 25, 2013, to account for the reshoots and post-production. Consistently negative film reviews of this film rendition considered it to have almost nothing in common with the original play.\n\nThe 1964 NHK Taiga drama \"Akō Rōshi\" was followed by no fewer than 21 television productions of \"Chūshingura.\" Toshirō Mifune starred in the 1971 \"Daichūshingura\" on NET, and Kinnosuke Yorozuya crossed over from film to play the same role in 1979, also on NET. \"Tōge no Gunzō\", the third NHK Taiga drama on the subject, starred Ken Ogata, and renowned director Juzo Itami appeared as Kira. In 2001 Fuji TV made a four-hour special of the story starring Takuya Kimura as Horibe Yasubei (one of the Akō \"rōnin\") and Kōichi Satō as Ōishi Kuranosuke, called \"Chūshingura 1/47\" . Kōtarō Satomi, Matsumoto Kōshirō IX, Beat Takeshi, Tatsuya Nakadai, Hiroki Matsukata, Kin'ya Kitaōji, Akira Emoto, Akira Nakao, Nakamura Kanzaburō XVIII, Ken Matsudaira, and Shinichi Tsutsumi are among the many stars to play Ōishi. Hisaya Morishige, Naoto Takenaka, and others have portrayed Kira. Izumi Inamori starred as Aguri (Yōzeiin), the central character in the ten-hour 2007 special \"Chūshingura Yōzeiin no Inbō.\"\n\nThe 1927 novel by Jirō Osaragi was the basis for the 1964 Taiga drama \"Akō Rōshi\". Eiji Yoshikawa, Seiichi Funahashi, Futaro Yamada, Kōhei Tsuka, and Shōichirō Ikemiya have also published novels on the subject. Maruya Saiichi, Motohiko Izawa, and Kazuo Kumada have written criticisms of it.\n\nAn episode of the \"tokusatsu\" show \"Juken Sentai Gekiranger\" features its own spin on the Chūshingura, with the main heroes being sent back in time and Kira having been possessed by a \"Rin Jyu Ken\" user, whom they defeat before the Akō incident starts, and thus not interfering with it.\n\nThe ballet choreographer Maurice Béjart created a ballet work called \"The Kabuki\" based on the Chushingura legend in 1986, and it has been performed more than 140 times in 14 nations worldwide by 2006.\n\nThe story was turned into an opera, \"Chūshingura\", by Shigeaki Saegusa in 1997.\n\n\"Chushingura\" is the name of a song by Jefferson Airplane from its \"Crown of Creation\" album.\n\nJorge Luis Borges' 1935 short story \"The Uncivil Teacher of Court Etiquette Kôtsuké no Suké\" (in \"A Universal History of Iniquity\") is a retelling of the \"Chūshingura\" story, drawn from A. B. Mitford's \"Tales of Old Japan\" (London, 1912).\n\nA graphic novel/manga version, well researched and close to the original story, has been written by Sean Michael Wilson and illustrated by Japanese artist Akiko Shimojima: \"\" (2013).\n\nA limited comic book series based on the story entitled \"47 Ronin\", written by Dark Horse Comics publisher Mike Richardson, illustrated by \"Usagi Yojimbo\" creator Stan Sakai and with \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" writer Kazuo Koike as an editorial consultant, was released by Dark Horse Comics in 2013.\n\nThe Tokaido Road (novel) (1991) by Lucia St. Clair Robson is an historical adventure novel linked to the story by a fictional daughter of the murdered lord, searching for her father's loyal men so she can take part in the revenge.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12054070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12054070", "title": "Coin roll hunting", "text": "Coin roll hunting\n\nCoin roll hunting (often abbreviated \"CRH\") is the hobby of searching and sorting coinage pulled from circulation for collectible coins. This is achieved through obtaining rolled coin, boxed coin, or bagged coin from banks and credit unions.\n\nIn the United States, coin roll hunters obtain rolls of cents, nickels, dimes, quarters, halves, and sometimes dollar coins.\n\nPrime targets of American coin roll hunters are silver dimes, quarters, and halves prior to 1965, and 40% silver half dollars from 1965-1970. Nickels are searched for 35% silver \"war nickels\" (1942–1945) older discontinued designs such as the Buffalo and \"V\" Nickel are also collected. Cents are also searched for older designs such as wheat cents (1909–1958) and indian head cents (1859–1909) and some searchers save copper Lincoln cents 1959–1982 for the growing value as copper bullion. An occasional darkly discolored or corroded dime can also be found in cent rolls, giving the collector an instant 10 fold bonus. Often coin roll hunters also collect special proof coins, exonumia, and coins from other nations. Others attempt to find and complete a set of coins, like the America the Beautiful Quarters, 50 State Quarters or Presidential Dollars, and some collect special issues such as the bicentennial quarters and halves (1976), bicentennial nickels (2004-2005), and bicentennial cents (2009). Specific dates of specific denominations that are rarer than others or minted in lower-than-usual quantities may also be taken from circulation, such as 1970, 1987, or 2002 to present halves, 2009 nickels and dimes, or 2002-2008 Sacagawea dollars. Some people search the rolls for error coins that have defects from the minting process and can be worth more over face value.\n\nIn Canada, coin roll hunters obtain rolls of nickels, and sometimes dimes and quarters.\n\nDimes and quarters didn't have very high mint numbers until silver was discontinued in 1968. Coins after 1968 were then minted in very high numbers, making silver coins uncommon, plus the introduction of silver-rejecting bank machines took many silver coins out of circulation. This all made silver too hard to find for coin roll hunters, so they primarily search for 1922-1964 nickels for their numismatic value and for 1965-1981 Nickels for their metal value, which slightly exceeds their face value. Pre-1997 pennies were also pulled out of circulation due to their copper high metal value prior to the removal of pennies from circulation in 2013. Other roll hunters attempt to build sets of special quarters, loonies, and toonies.\n\nThe merits of coin roll hunting as a means of making money are hotly debated. It is not uncommon for coin roll hunters to search through multiple boxes of coins only to find nothing of value. The amount of silver left in circulation is constantly dwindling. Many seasoned veterans of coin roll hunting have commented that in the long run they would have been better off just buying the silver coins they have found as it would have been cheaper and easier once the cost of their time has been factored in. The expected return from coin roll hunting also varies based on what denomination is searched. US quarters and dimes tend to produce the worst as most of the silver from these denominations has already been pulled from circulation. Cents provide the best returns when collecting pre-1982 copper cents with the typical cent roll producing around 20% copper to 80% zinc cents. However, the amount of profit from searching cents is much lower due to the lower face value of the coin. When the US dollar is higher than the Canadian dollar, CRH enthusiasts often pull all the American coins to exchange or spend in the USA.\n\nIn the United States, it is illegal to melt down cents and nickels, so they cannot be legally redeemed for their metal content.\n\nSome coin roll hunters mark, paint or deface coins in order to identify that a batch of coins has been searched. This action is often frowned upon, however. If any of that hunter's mark (or the marks of other hunters) are found in a supply of coins, this is an indicator that said batch has already been searched. However, given the large amounts of coin circulating in the United States, marking searched coins is unlikely to be effective unless done on a large scale. Furthermore, it is often considered bad etiquette in the coin roll hunting community to deface coins with marks since the marked coins may be of some collecting value to other people. Defacing of coins is also illegal in some countries, such as Canada. In the United States countermarking (aka counter stamping) of coins is legal under 18 USC Section 331 provided it is not done for the intent of committing fraud. This is also the legal basis for elongated pennies \nand/or penny smashing machines.\n\nCoin rolling scams\n\nCoin wrapper\n"}

He first appears as the primary antagonist of the first story arc \"Phantom Blood\" in the debut chapter , which was published in \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" magazine on January 1, 1987. He later returns as the main antagonist in the series' third story arc \"Stardust Crusaders\", where he is now known solely as DIO, and he also appears in flashbacks in the sixth story arc \"Stone Ocean\". In the seventh story arc \"Steel Ball Run\" an alternative version of Dio called Diego Brando, who is also called Dio for short, appears as a major character in the setting.\n\nThe poor son of an abusive alcoholic who worked his mother to death, Dio Brando holds an inordinate amount of enmity toward others. As the series' most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which manifests in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost.\n\nWhen beginning the series, Dio is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. He also revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character, and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated. In regard to Dio's characterization, Araki said that he was inspired by FBI profiling of serial killers, admitting that in a way he thinks they must be incredibly strong to be able to commit the heinous crimes that they do. How serial killers control their victims through psychological manipulation interested Araki as well, a trait similar to how Dio uses his charisma to ensure his followers to do his bidding. The author intended to characterize Dio as unapologetically baleful in his pursuit of power, with his literal abandonment of his humanity reflecting his figurative and emotional one. Araki wanted his name to sound cool next to JoJo's, so he chose Dio, the Italian word for God.\n\nAccording to Araki, Dio's physical appearance is inspired by Rutger Hauer's character Roy Batty from the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\". Throughout all his adulthood depictions, Dio possesses a towering, muscular build as impressive as that of the series' first three titular protagonists. As a vampire, he maintains messy, shoulder-length blond hair, and his various designs all feature clothing that prominently display the color gold.\n\nOnce Dio fuses his head to the body of Jonathan Joestar, the first protagonist of \"JoJo\", he abandons his pattern of ornate clothes in favor of simple jackets, tanktops, bracelets, and pants that continue to emphasize the color gold, while simultaneously contrasting this with the rather outlandish wardrobe choices of gold-colored elf shoes and a bright green headband, belt, and knee pads bearing heart symbols. Prior to his full reveal in \"Stardust Crusaders\", Dio appears topless during various interludes in the shadows of his mansion, his face remaining unseen until his reunion with Jean-Pierre Polnareff. After consuming the blood of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson and the second protagonist of \"JoJo\", Dio abandons his jacket and accessories while his spiked blonde hair becomes more prominent; his facial expressions become more manic in nature; and his lips gain a dark coloration. Merchandise often refers to this appearance as \"High Dio\", in reference to him describing this state as \"the ultimate high\".\n\nDio's mannerisms, such as his frequent cries of and \"WRYYY\", have yielded several memes and other popular culture references.\n\nIn \"Phantom Blood\", the child of an abusive drunkard named Dario Brando, Dio Brando becomes the adopted brother of Jonathan Joestar by using the promise that George Joestar made to Dario years ago. Upon entering the Joestar estate after his father died, Dio wasted no time unequivocally making young Jonathan's life a living hell to take everything from him. But Dio underestimated Jonathan's retaliation for kissing his beloved Erina Pendleton, spending the next seven years feigning to be Jonathan's friend before enacting his plan to steal the Joestar fortune by poisoning George with the same poison he used to kill Dario. When Jonathan investigates the matter for proof, Dio plots to use an ancient South American stone mask to murder Jonathan. However, Dio learns the mask transforms the wearer into a vampire when exposed to blood, and uses it on himself when his scheme is exposed. Although seemingly killed when Jonathan impales him on a stone statue and leaves him in the burning Joestar mansion, Dio survives, and proceeds to start his subjugation of England in the small village of Knight's Lot, amassing sired followers to his cause. Jonathan is sought out by William Zeppeli, a master of an ancient martial art called Hamon which can kill Vampires, and he teaches Jonathan how to use this ability as Dio sends other vampires and zombies after him to kill him so he can take over the world. Jonathan seemingly kills him once more, but Dio's head survives. With the help of his servant Wang Chen, Dio attacks Jonathan on his honeymoon with Erina in an attempt to claim his enemy's body for his own. Despite having his throat fatally punctured by Dio, Jonathan is able to use Hamon one last time to overload the ship's engines with Dio apparently destroyed in the resulting explosion. Erina, escaping unharmed with an orphaned girl, survives with their unborn son.\n\nDio Brando does not appear in \"Battle Tendency\", but the aftermath of his apparent death at the hands of Jonathan Joestar affects the plot. It is ultimately revealed that Jonathan and Erina's son George Joestar II, a famed pilot of the Royal Air Force in World War I, was murdered by one of Dio's zombie henchmen who survived the battle of Knight's Lot and had infiltrated the RAF. George II's wife, the orphaned girl Elizabeth, hunted down this zombie and killed him with her Hamon. But as no one in the RAF knew that her victim was not human, she became a wanted murderer, Elizabeth was forced to go into hiding as Lisa Lisa. Lisa Lisa would later encounter her son Joseph Joestar, teaching him Hamon so he can defeat the Pillar Man Kars whose creation of the Stone masks made him indirectly responsible for Dio's transformation.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Stardust Crusaders\" that Dio survived the ship's explosion and attached his head to Jonathan's body as the ship sank, confining himself in a casket at the bottom of the ocean for a century until a shipwreck salvage operation retrieved him in 1983. Dio soon meets the mystic Enya Geil who awakens his Stand, , allowing the newly dubbed \"DIO\" to stop the passage of time around him. As his head is attached to Jonathan Joestar's body, it awakens Stand abilities in all of Jonathan's living descendants. While Joseph Joestar and his grandson Jotaro Kujo have the resolve to control their Stands, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother Holly has her very life sapped away because of her kind disposition. This spurs Jotaro and Joseph to track down Dio along with friends Mohammed Avdol, Noriaki Kakyoin, Jean-Pierre Polnareff, and Iggy the Boston Terrier to kill him once and for all, freeing Holly from the curse the Stand has trapped her under. Dio responds by preemptively trying to assassinate the Joestars before they can find him in his lair in Cairo, sending other evil Stand users, some of whom he controlled mentally before they joined the Joestars on their journey. Along the way, Avdol & Iggy are killed by Dio's right hand Vanilla Ice, who in turn is killed by Polnareff. Dio kills Jotaro's friend Kakyoin in combat and nearly kills Joseph after draining him of his blood, but Jotaro's own Stand Star Platinum proves to be The World's equally powered counterpart, and Jotaro's own rage at Dio being the cause of his friends' deaths and his mother's dwindling health leads him to kill Dio with Star Platinum. After the Speedwagon Foundation restores Joseph's blood, he and Jotaro take Dio's body out into the desert and expose it to sunlight, vanquishing the evil vampire once and for all.\n\nDio is not present in either \"Diamond Is Unbreakable\" or \"Golden Wind\", but his influence on the story is still present. In \"Diamond Is Unbreakable\", it is revealed that Dio acquired his Stand by means of an ancient artifact known as the \"Bow and Arrow\", and this has reappeared in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh because the children of one of his former lackeys are seeking out someone who can possibly free their father from the strange mutation he has suffered as a result of Dio's death. In \"Golden Wind\", the protagonist Giorno Giovanna is Dio's son, but because Dio was in possession of Jonathan's body at the time of Giorno's conception, Giorno is a member of the Joestar family, and his own virtuous soul prevents him from becoming evil as his father was.\n\nDio's influence on the \"JoJo\" story returns in \"Stone Ocean\", where it is revealed that he met the story arc's main antagonist Father Enrico Pucci during the events of \"Stardust Crusaders\". He told Father Pucci of his desire to use his Stand The World in order to reach \"Heaven\", and saw in the young priest a friendship that would help him achieve his goals. Father Pucci's reverence for Dio drives him to carry out his plans decades later, manipulating events to frame Jotaro Kujo's daughter Jolyne Cujoh for murder in order to trap her in the prison where he serves as a chaplain, using the final physical remains of Dio to evolve his Stand to reset reality in what he believes is Dio's vision of Heaven, a world where everyone knows their own destiny, and more importantly a world free of the Joestar bloodline. However, his hubris leads to his defeat at the hands of Jolyne's last surviving friend Emporio, who manages to reset reality back to what it once was, but not quite exactly the way it was before.\n\nDio Brando himself does not appear in \"Steel Ball Run\", set in an alternate universe in 1890, but an alternate version of himself known as Diego Brando does. Diego Brando is again the child of an abusive household, and one who reveres his mother. She instilled in him a sense of pride that he took with him as he became a masterful jockey in his adulthood, when he decides to take part in the Steel Ball Run horse race across the United States. Along the way, he is put under the thrall of the Stand Scary Monsters, transforming him into a dromaeosaurid dinosaur, but as a result of this encounter he gains his own Stand Scary Monsters, which grants him the same abilities that he now has under his control. He is hired by United States President Funny Valentine in his quest to seek out the pieces of the Saint's Corpse scattered along the race course, but after some time fighting against the heroes Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli, he realizes that President Valentine's plans are more dangerous to the world as a whole and joins the heroes in an attempt to stop him, only to die during his attempt to kill the evil President. Valentine then uses his Stand's powers to summon a Diego Brando from an alternate universe. This Diego Brando's possesses the same powers as Dio, along with his Stand THE WORLD. He manages to defeat Johnny Joestar in battle, and wins the Steel Ball Run race, in addition to obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse and hiding it in a secure location, even though President Valentine has already been killed by Johnny in a fight. However, this alternate universe Diego meets his demise at the hands of Lucy Steel, who uses the skull of this universe's Diego Brando to erase him from reality as a result of the effects of Valentine's Stand.\n\nDio Brando has appeared in many video games related to the \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\" franchise, usually as a player character or a boss. Some games include multiple versions of the character; in \"\" for example, both Dio Brando from Part 1 and Dio from Part 3 are playable characters, along with Diego Brando and Parallel World Diego from Part 7. Furthermore, he has appeared as a playable character in several video games not related to the franchise, such as \"Jump Super Stars\" and \"Jump Ultimate Stars\".\n\nDio is the main antagonist in the story mode of \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven\". Although the video game begins with the final scenes of \"Stardust Crusaders\", the antagonist is a version of Dio from another universe who managed to beat the Joestar family. He seeks to control all universes by means of the Saint's Corpse, and uses his more advanced powers over time to bring all of the fallen heroes and villains back to life to serve him in preventing Jotaro Kujo and the other Joestars from obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse, or at least using them to gather the parts so he can steal them from them and achieve his ultimate power. This version of Dio is called and his Stand is called .\n\nIn February 2013, a life-size statue of Dio was displayed at Wonder Festival to promote the event.\n\nStarting in June 2014, Dio began appearing on cans of Japanese best-selling java Georgia coffee, as part of a special promotion of their Emerald Mountain Black flavor.\n\nSeveral characters in Japanese anime, manga, and video games draw inspiration from Dio. One such example is Sakuya Izayoi from the Touhou Project.\n\nAbove all else, Dio Brando is known for his cunning and careful consideration. It is when Jonathan Joestar defies his expectations, defeating him in battle and thwarting his deliberate machinations, that Dio dons the stone mask that grants him the power of a vampire. He attains superhuman speed, regeneration, and strength insofar as he can lift a road roller with ease - a frequent source of references to Dio in popular culture.\n\nAs a vampire, he most frequently uses an exaggerated evaporated cooling form of freezing known simply as the that allows him to freeze his opponents while rendering direct attacks with Hamon useless. He can also graft body parts of different beings together, an ability he used to take Jonathan's body as his own.\n\nOnce he returns 100 years later with the body of Jonathan Joestar, Dio lost many of the abilities he had in his original body. However, Dio's new zombified body enabled him to develop his signature Stand, . As a psychic manifestation of Dio, it has all of his aforementioned superhuman abilities and facilitates melee attacks, though its signature ability is to stop time. This time-stopping ability only lasts for a limited amount of time, though this limit can be extended through practice or through other means of increasing the user's strength (such as when Dio was able to increase his limit by several seconds after drinking Joseph Joestar's blood).\n\nDio Brando has had many different voice actors in different types of media. He was first voiced by Norio Wakamoto in drama CDs, followed by Nobuo Tanaka in the OVAs and Isshin Chiba in the Capcom fighting game. He has been voiced by Kenji Nojima and Hikaru Midorikawa in both the and video game as the younger and older incarnations, respectively. In the television anime and the \"\" and \"\" video games, Dio Brando is voiced by Takehito Koyasu.\n\nDio has only ever had two English voice actors; he was voiced by Kid Beyond in the OVAs and by Patrick Seitz in the TV anime.\n\nDio has generally received praise from various reviewers of manga, anime, and other media; most praised his frightening and enjoyably hatable personality making an appealing antagonist, as well as his influence on the rest of the series. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network notes that his far-reaching influence throughout the entire series works especially well as a stark contrast to his humble origins. Her colleague Hope Chapman called him \"one of the greatest supervillains ever invented in any medium.\" Can Hoang Tran of The News Hub cites the anticipation of Dio's appearance in the 2014 reanimation of \"Stardust Crusaders\" to be a driving force of the series' success, later calling him the most rewarding character to play as in the series' video games. Joel Loynds of The Linc wrote \"Dio's actions so powerfully and immediately establish his evil... that you will be invested in seeing his evolution even more than you [will be for JoJo]\". Dallas Marshall of Green Tea Graffiti writes that Araki's straightforward intention of making the reader hate Dio worked simply and flawlessly, citing Dio's defining character moment as burning the protagonist's dog alive. Readers of Anime News Network voted Dio number one in a poll of which anime villains would make the best friends in real life for his \"cool composure\" and \"awesome lines\". Jun Yamamoto for \"Billboard\" said he \"could almost feel the passion and ambition that Jonathan Joestar had in his fight against Dio\" when listening to the first opening of the tv series.\n"}

{"id": "17966467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17966467", "title": "Elegiac comedy", "text": "Elegiac comedy\n\nElegiac comedy was a genre of medieval Latin literature—or drama—which survives as a collection of about twenty texts written in the 12th and 13th centuries in the liberal arts schools of west central France (roughly the Loire Valley). Though commonly identified in manuscripts as \"comoedia\", modern scholars often reject their status as comedy. Unlike Classical comedy, they were written in elegiac couplets. Denying their true comedic nature, Edmond Faral called them Latin \"fabliaux\", after the later Old French \"fabliaux\", and Ian Thomson labelled them Latin comic tales. Other scholars have invented terms like verse tales, rhymed monologues, epic comedies, and Horatian comedies to describe them. The Latin \"comedies\", the dramatic nature of which varies greatly, may have been the direct ancestors of the \"fabliaux\" but more likely merely share similarities. Other interpretations have concluded that they are primitive romances, student juvenilia, didactic poems, or merely collections of elegies on related themes.\n\nSome elegiac comedies were adapted into vernacular language in the later Middle Ages, and retold by major vernacular writers such as Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Gower. The poem \"Pamphilus\" has Venetian and Old French versions.\n\nThese comedies were composed in a high style, but they were typically about low or unimportant subject matter; lyric complaints only sometimes mixed with amorous content. They combined the plot and character types of the Greek \"new comedy\" practised by Terence and Plautus, but the greatest influence on them was Ovid. His \"Ars amatoria\", \"Amores\", and \"Heroides\" were highly influential. Plautus, though less widely read in the Middle Ages, was also an influence, as were the Scholastic debates concerning the nature of universals and other contemporary philosophical problems, with which the elegiac comedies often dealt, always humorously but no doubt sometimes to a serious end.\n\nThe elegiac dramatists delight in \"showing off\" their Latin skills. Their use of rhetoric, logic, and various grammatical constructions suggest that they may have been used in the schools as exercises in poetic composition and philosophical argument. The language of their \"fools\" can be deliberately outlandish, and their deft use of puns is frequently sexual in nature. Parody is another typical element of elegiac humour. Persons of low rank are often placed in positions unsuited to them. Their bumbling, as when a rustic attempts to speak philosophically or the commoner pretends he is a chivalrous gentleman, is portrayed for its satiric effect. Satire is often employed in long digressions criticizing the corruption of the times, specifically targeting the selling of church offices, political corruption at court, sycophants’ attempts to rise in society, and aristocrats’ attempts to philosophize. In the Middle Ages, satire was usually considered a breed of comedy.\n\nThe comedies were often about a sexual conquest, in which the lover must use his guile to overcome obstacles such as guardians, rivals, and reluctance on the part of the woman. The setting is some unspecified time contemporary with the poet, and the characters are all typical and have names descriptive of their traits and function in the story. The lack of resources on the part of the hero forces him to resort to deception and to employ intermediaries (as Ovid did in his narratives) in order to win the object of his desire.\n\nThe elegiac comedies bear limited dramatic features. Thompson denies their theatricality, saying that \"no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.\" A similar opinion is that the comedies are rhetorical exercises. Medieval poetic theory, however, did not regard comedy and elegy as mutually exclusive, nor identical. John of Garland wrote \"all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.\" Other arguments raised against the dramatic performance of the comedies is, in general, their large number of narrative segments as opposed to dialogue. Arnulf of Orléans, one of the elegiac writers, seems to have considered his work to have been made for the stage. These performances may have been narrated, mimed, or sung.\n\n\n"}

Adopted in 1983 to replace the flag of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, it has been the flag of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis since the country gained independence that year. Although the flag utilises the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement, the symbolism behind them is interpreted differently. The three islands later became part of the West Indies Federation in 1958; after this dissolved four years later, they were granted the status of associate state as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. However, Anguilla decided to secede from the federation in 1969, owing to fears that their population, which was already small, would be further marginalised in parliament. This was eventually formalised in 1980, and a new flag for the remaining parts of the federation was needed, since the symbolism of the previous flag centred on the concept of a union of three.\n\nA national competition was held in the early 1980s to choose a new flag. The winning design by student Edrice Lewis was one of 258 entries. It was first hoisted one minute after midnight on 19 September 1983, the day Saint Kitts and Nevis became an independent country.\n\nThe colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green alludes to the country's fertile land, while the red evokes the fight for freedom against slavery and colonialism. The yellow stripes represent the sunshine the islands enjoy all year round, and the black epitomises the people's African origins. The two stars on the black band symbolise Saint Christopher and Nevis—the two islands that make up the federation—as well as \"hope and liberty.\" The official meaning behind the flag's symbols was formulated by Edrice Lewis, the same person who designed the flag.\n\nThe flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis is mentioned in Series 10 Episode 7 of The Big Bang Theory titled \"The Veracity Elasticity\" in which Sheldon\nsays \"...so let's roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.\"\n"}

He first conceived of the \"Historical Atlas\" in the late 1970s as an extension of his works, \"The Mythic Image\" and \"The Masks of God\". Like those books, the \"Historical Atlas of World Mythology\" intended to show the ways in which those universal themes and motifs were expressed differently by different cultures in different times and places.\n\nHeavily illustrated and annotated, with numerous charts and maps to show both variations and similarities in different cultures' expressions of mythic themes, this series was intended to serve both academic and lay readers.\n\nThe \"Historical Atlas\" was left incomplete when Campbell died in 1987.\n\nThis series was to build on Campbell’s idea, first presented in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", that myth evolves over time through four stages: \n\nOnly the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell's death.

The first three parts of the second volume, which Campbell was working on literally to the day that he died, were completed by Campbell's long-time editor, Robert Walter, and published by Harper and Row in 1989. Both volumes are currently out of print.\n\nCampbell left rough text for the last two parts of \"Way of the Seeded Earth\", as well as notes for the final two volumes.

{"id": "19424606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19424606", "title": "Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica", "text": "Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica\n\nMost of the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec, Maya, Mixtec, Zapotec and Aztec cultures practised some kind of taking of human trophies during warfare. Captives taken during war would often be taken to their captors' city-states where they would be ritually tortured and sacrificed. These practices are documented by a rich material of iconographic and archaeological evidence from across Mesoamerica.\n\nEvidence of the ritualistic sacrifice and taking human body parts as trophies in Maya civilization exists from as far back as the Middle Formative period (800 – 500 BC). The evidence consists of skeletal remains and depictions in Maya iconography, commonly showing acts of human sacrifice. Excavations at the non-Maya site of Teotihuacan have unearthed the remains of hundreds of bodies that are thought to represent a mass sacrifice at the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. At the Temple of the Moon, another excavation site, there were a number of decapitated remains found along with numerous bound bodies of headless males. Given these two examples of mass sacrificial sites, there is no reason why this could not have taken place in Maya society.\n\nWith that in mind, there are other possible explanations that are commonly used among the Maya. It is not unreasonable to think that some of these sites are examples of ancestral veneration. This was a selective social practice in which ancestors were considered a \nsubset of all the deceased and were the ones who validated political power, status and access to resources. There is also proof that the mortuary practices of the region were varied and once thought to be evidence of human sacrifice. They were commonly found in locations of tomb reuse and secondary burial practice.\n\nIt is believed for the most part, that the soldiers did not patrol in large armies; rather there were many smaller groups or raiding parties. Most of these battles were driven by the desire for domination and the intention to intimidate other cities. During this time it was not uncommon that the victors of a battle would take captives back to their cities and use them for ritual sacrifice. In some instances they would bind or hinder the captive so that he could not fairly compete in a winner-take-all ballcourt match. Herein, the loser would be beheaded and the victor would, in certain situations, keep his head as a trophy and confirm victory in order to establish his city's dominance.\n\nIn the Popul Vuh, the vision of human sacrifice and decapitation is abundantly clear and emphasized. However, in instances of decapitation, the sacrifice was intended to signify rebirth and creation. This theme is confirmed when the Hero Twins played the Lords of Death in a ball game match and ended up tricking the Lords of Death into decapitating themselves. With the Lords of Death out of the picture, the Hero Twins were able to resurrect their father, the Maize God. This shows the significance of sacrifice and decapitation in warfare as a means to reenact rebirth, in the Popul Vuh.\n\nMaya art and iconography is a major source to anthropologists' knowledge and beliefs about the culture and history of the Maya. For instance, at the site of Bonampak, photographer Giles Healy discovered exquisite murals showing a battle and its aftermath, including the torture of captives. Other examples of Maya art depicting sacrifice and torture include carved stone stelae, altars, and panels. There is evidence that this type of art was recorded on wood and other perishable media, but they have eroded with time.\n\nIconographic depictions of trophy heads tend to show the heads being suspended in midair, held by the hair, or even upside down. In addition they depict blood or possibly other fluids flowing from the neck, eyes or mouth. Holding a head by the hair is seen as a sign of disrespect. In Maya iconography, these heads are usually fastened upright with the eyes opened and are worn on a belt that is positioned on the small of the wearer's back. The actual act of decapitation in the iconography is rare but does appear from time to time. The most common place to see the decapitation of human heads being worn or presented as trophy heads are on painted cylinder vases of the Late Classic period and usually involve the Hero Twins or some type of Creation myth.\n\nIn Oaxaca there are various pre-Columbian figures in which high-ranking characters, warriors and ball players wear ritual and military paraphernalia, holding inverted heads with their loose, long hair hanging down. One of these figures can be seen in the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. Javier Urcid writes that these trophies may have been \"soft parts of decapitated heads turned into relics to hang\" There are also several figures showing characters with facial skin on their faces: the skin of a flayed human. Urcid’s article in \"El Sacrificio Humano en la Tradición Religiosa Mesoamericana\" includes eight illustrations of these trophies in the southern west of Mexico, including a brazier depicting a ball player with a flayed facial mask, wearing a necklace of human bones and carrying a severed head.\n\nThe \"Relación Geográfica\" of 1580 mentions the festivity of the tlacaxipehualiztli in the context of human skin as trophies in Oaxaca: \"with rods they hit throughout the body until it swelled, and then flayed the bodies and washed the meat with hot water and ate it, and carried the skins in the nearby villages for begging.\"\n\nLos Mangales lies within the Salama Valley in the Northern Highlands of Guatemala. It has been estimated that this site was active from approximately 1000 until 400 BC and was the site of vast, elaborate burials. Three principal mounds entail the main composition of the site, (Str. D6-1) containing varied amounts of adult male crania that have been interpreted as trophy heads or possibly dismembered sacrificial retainers. In addition to the three principal burial mounds, there were multiple burial sites. In particular at burial site 6, there was conclusive evidence of human sacrifice, where were located at least 12 dismembered victims and three possible trophy heads. The heads were found lying inside the crypt with specific individuals. A common trend at this site is that the victims found outside the formal crypt were lying in the prone position (their wrists and ankles were bound tightly together and that they were faced down) and the individuals that were inside the crypt were in the supine position (face up and unbound). However, finding a body in the prone position does not necessarily mean that the individual was a victim of sacrifice. It is believed that finding isolated crania was seen as early evidence of trophy taking in the Maya region.\n\nEvidence of sacrifice and trophy taking was found at an evacuation site in El Chalchuapa, El Salvador. The remains of 33 individuals were found and had appeared to have been victims of ritual sacrifice that had spanned five different episodes of construction to the structure. Many of the individuals were found to be male and most were lying in the prone position. Of the individuals found it was noted that they were represented as crania and were determined to have been trophy heads. The others had a range of signs of mutilation, including: one individual was missing his/her head, two were cut in half at the waist, one individual was missing his/her legs and another was missing his/her feet. Given the age of the individuals, the absence of grave goods, the positions and placement of the bodies, the lack of grave preparation and the evidence for dismemberment, this site seems to show that these individuals were war captives and then used in a form of ritualistic sacrifice.\n\nCuello is a site that provides several examples of decapitation, dismemberment, and sacrifice of young to middle-aged males at public events. Here we see evidence of the sacrifice of children, one of whom appeared to have been decapitated demonstrating the incidence of decapitated individuals in common grounds and public structures. In most mass burials there seem to be primary individuals in the center, surrounded by the remains of others.\n\nIn Colha, Belize, archaeologists discovered a large pit next to a stairway near the center of a monumental structure (operation 2010). This \"Skull Pit\" contained the heads of around 30 individuals. Ten of these were children ranging in age from 6 months to 6 or 7 years old. The remaining 20 individuals were adults. There were cut marks on the crania and the remains were burnt, and the age grouping and the location of the pit has led to multiple conclusions on the reasons behind these sacrifices. One theory is that they were sacrificed as a part of a religious ceremony. Other hypotheses are that the victims were political prisoners treated with ritual violence or that they were ancestors of an elite lineage that was violently deposed.\n\nAt this excavation site in Mexico, archaeologists found roughly 72 males. Due to the evidence surrounding them they were determined to be soldiers. The individuals were placed in a series of highly structured graves that were below, and just outside, the pyramid. From the other evidence unearthed, it was found that each individual had between 7 and 11 human maxillae, or human jaw bones, in his possession. These maxillae were mostly worn around the arm, generally on the biceps of soldiers. This was seen as a testament of strength and power that proved that these individuals had been in multiple battles or campaigns. Along with the maxillae, the men had necklaces made of teeth, obsidian projectile points and slate disks located behind their lower back, which were commonly found on Teotihuacan military figures. This led the excavators to believe that these soldiers were of an elite class of warrior, and not just some semi-organized militia.\n\nAlong with the remains of apparent soldiers, there were also remains found of other males with rich offerings that would suggest they were members of higher social status. This evidence proved that even at an early stage of Teotihuacan’s existence there was large scale human sacrifice as well as warfare-related symbolism.\n"}

Wagamese's best known work, it won the Burt Award for First Nations, Métis and Inuit Literature in 2013 and was a competing title in the 2013 edition of \"Canada Reads\". \n\nThe novel centres on Saul Indian Horse, a First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system and grows up to become a star ice hockey player. It follows Saul on his journey to self-awareness and self-acceptance, taking the reader along so that his painfully-grained insights also become the reader's.\n\nAccording to Wagamese, in the beginning, he intended to write a novel about hockey: he had played amateur hockey himself and still loved the game, but gradually the legacy of the residential school system became a focal point of the story. He said that writing the book took about five times longer than it typically would have taken him to write a book \"because of the emotional territory it covers\". Although Wagamese himself did not attend a residential school, he was still affected by that system because his mother, aunts and uncles were residential school survivors.\n\nA film adaptation, \"Indian Horse\", was directed by Stephen Campanelli and premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.\n"}

The title is a pun on the famous phrase \"Is There a Doctor in the House?\" The cartoon revolves around Jerry drinking a potion which makes him run faster, allowing him to eat all the food around the house, and Tom trying to stop Jerry.\n\nJerry mixes and drinks a potion as the title card and credits are shown. After Jerry drinks the potion, he discovers that it gives him the ability to run (and eat) at blinding speed; he tests this out by eating Tom's canister of sardines, along with the last bit of gravy and bits of his skin. Afterwards, Tom initially comes under the assumption that a ghost was eating his food, but concludes that it's a bug equipped with a jetpack and chattery teeth.\n\nTom slips a large watermelon slice around the corner and readies a flyswatter. Jerry mows through all of the watermelon flesh and Tom only ends up scattering the rind and seeds around. When Tom sees an entire turkey being eaten, he panics and takes a grape cluster and an apple from the table. But Jerry proceeds to eat the apple down to the core and the rest of the fruit and the grapes. After going berserk, Tom hides in the refrigerator and attempts to eat a stack of ribs, which Jerry proceeds to eat.\n\nTom then sets out a cake and films Jerry stealing it so he can see who is taking his food. After Tom prepares the film, he plays it in slow motion to uncover who is behind these charades. This is what happened: Jerry approaches from the right and eats the cake one layer at a time, then he takes the cherry on top. Tom sees this and mutters somewhat in the vein of, \"Why, that mouse is very strong!\" \n\nAfterwards, Tom sets up a mousetrap sandwich for Jerry. Jerry does take the bait, but doesn't trigger the trap. After Tom triggers the trap from attempting to bite Jerry, Tom yells in pain upside the light fixture! When Jerry takes a banana from the refrigerator, Tom grabs the banana and peels the skin, Jerry taunts him by kissing his nose then runs off. The effects of the potion wear off, and Jerry barely escapes Tom.\n\nJerry makes a second potion, but this time, it is an enlargement potion, which enlarges its consumer to an unbelievably large size. Tom catches Jerry's tail and somehow manages to pull him through the wall. When Tom can no longer tug the load around, he turns around to see the mega-Jerry sadistically raising his eyebrows and waving at him. Tom begins to laugh at the Super Sized Jerry, until he realizes his dire predicament and then begins to cry, thinking about what the now-giant Jerry is going to do to him, as the cartoon ends.\n\n"}

The 1960 film was advertised as adult entertainment.\n\"Jigoku\" is notable for separating itself from other Japanese horror films of the era such as \"Kwaidan\" or \"Onibaba\" due to its graphic imagery of torment in Hell. It has gained a cult film status. Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last production being \"Jigoku\".\n\n\"Jigoku\" was re-made in 1969 by Toho Films (as \"Portrait of Hell\"), again in 1979 by Toei Films (as simply \"Jigoku\"), and later re-made once again in 1999 by Toei under the title of \"\", directed by Teruo Ishii.\n\nA young Tokyo theology student, Shirō (Shigeru Amachi), is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), the daughter of his professor, Mr. Yajima. After announcing the engagement, Shirō's dark and unsettling colleague, Tamura (Yôichi Numata), drives Shirō home, suggesting that Shirō had been sleeping with Yukiko for some time. Taking a side street at Shirō's request, Tamura hits and kills drunken yakuza gang leader, Kyōichi. Though Shirō wants to stop, Tamura keeps driving, stating that it does not concern him and that ultimately, the murder is Shirō's fault for asking him to drive down the street. Unbeknown to either of them, Kyōichi's mother (Kiyoko Tsuji) witnessed everything and resolves to find and kill them.\n\nThough Tamura feels no guilt for the murder, Shirō does and attempts to go to the police. After telling Yukiko of what happened, Shirō insists that they take a taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to walk instead. While in the cab, Shirō hallucinates that Tamura is driving the cab, and it crashes, killing Yukiko. After her funeral, Shirō seeks solace in the arms of strip bar worker and Kyōichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko (Akiko Ono), who discovers Shirō's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping with him and, with Kyōichi's mother, plots revenge.\n\nShirō receives a telegram that his mother, Ito, who lives in a country-side retirement community run by his father, Gōzō, is dying and rushes to see her. There, he meets the other residents including a disgraced painter, Ensai, who is painting a portrait of Hell, a former reporter, Akagawa, a corrupt detective, Hariya, and the community doctor, Dr. Kasuma. He meets Sachiko (also played by Mitsuya), a nurse and Ensai's daughter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko, and is taking care of his mother. During his stay, Shirō and Sachiko become close while each of the residents' sordid activities is revealed: While Shirō's mother lies dying, his father carries on an open affair and also cheats the community of its money by cutting corners; the painter is wanted for a crime in another city; the detective threatens to turn the painter in unless he gives him Sachiko to marry; and the doctor knows his diagnoses are wrong, but feels that seeking a second opinion is too cumbersome. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yajima, both despondent after Yukiko's death, arrive by train to pay their respects to Shirō's mother. Ito dies, and Ensai blames Gōzō; decades ago, he and Ito were lovers before Gōzō came between them and married her leaving her unhappy. Inexplicably, Tamura appears and reveals that each of the residents has some complicity in a murder: Mr. Yajima killed his comrade during the war, stealing his water for himself; both the detective and reporter framed or slandered innocent men who then both committed suicide; and the doctor knew his diagnosis of Ito's condition was wrong, but chose not to tell anyone.\n\nYoko tracks Shirō down and meets with him on a rope bridge in the area. There she reveals her identity and attempts to shoot him while Kyōichi's mother watches from the trees, but she trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and the two struggle over the gun, and Tamura also falls into the gorge. Shirō stumbles back in time for the community's tenth anniversary party, where Gōzō has knowingly allowed cheap, rancid fish to be served to the residents. As the party descends into debauchery, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima both decide to leap in front of the train, killing themselves, and Gōzō's mistress falls to her death following an altercation. The residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Kyōichi's mother sneaks into the party, poisoning the remaining residents' wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko, while Kyōichi's mother strangles Shirō to death and then commits suicide.\n\nIn Limbo, Shirō encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with his child, a baby girl named \"Harumi\", but has sent her floating away on the river of the underworld and begs Shirō to save her. Shirō enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment in the Eight Realms of Hell by Lord Enma for his sins. While running through Hell to find his daughter, he encounters each of his acquaintances, who suffer, in gruesome fashion, a variety of punishments for their sins, such as being boiled and burned alive, dismembered and flayed, or cut apart and beaten by ogres, only to be revived to suffer anew. Meanwhile, Tamura taunts Shirō, saying there is no escape from Hell, before being butchered for giving his soul over to evil. In a realm filled with glass shards jutting from the ground, Shirō finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Shirō's mother, who shamefully reveals that Sachiko is his sister: Shirō is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually her daughter, also a product of her later affair with Ensai. Shirō is disgusted with his family, and continues searching for his daughter, determined to live and save her. While caught in a vortex of damned souls, he finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on the Buddhist wheel of life. Lord Enma gives Shirō one chance to save his daughter, otherwise she too will suffer for all eternity in Hell. As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his mother call to him, Shirō leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter.\n\nThe moment is frozen in time, revealed to be nine o'clock: the exact time that everyone at the party has finally died, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after completing his portrait of Hell and set it on fire. In a final scene, both Sachiko and Yukiko stand smiling in peaceful light, calling to Shirō as sister and lover, respectively, with lotus petals falling around them, symbolizing mental and moral purity.\n\n\nNobuo Nakagawa asked Ichirō Miyagawa to write the script, which was originally supposed to be called \"Heaven and Hell\", under order of producer Mitsugu Okura. Mitsugu Okura read the script and angrily said to Miyagawa that \"Heaven is nowhere to be seen in this script!\", to which Miyagawa jokingly replied that he would write about Heaven in the sequel. Actor Yoichi Numata played Tamura in the film, and expressed that he had tried to analyze the role, but couldn't find the best way to play it.\n\nThe film was not expected to be well received, as Shintoho studio was considered to be a maker of low-budget, gory films. \"Jigoku\" was made in a hurry, and was the last Shintoho production. For the scenes which take place in hell, the cast and crew used Shintoho's largest soundstage and put dirt over it. In a recent documentary, a crew member said that normally it would be just the crew helping to build the sets, but because it was Shintoho's last production, all the extras were helping. Mamoru Morita said that Nobuo Nakagawa tried in many ways to make \"Jigoku\" different from other horror films from the time.\n\nIn 1979, the acclaimed Nikkatsu Roman Porno director Tatsumi Kumashiro remade \"Jigoku\" for Toei.\n\n\"Jigoku\" was theatrically released in Japan on July 30, 1960. \nThe film was released on DVD in North America from the Criterion Collection on September 19, 2006.\n\nLater reviews of the film have been more positive, with many critics now recognizing it as a cornerstone for Nakagawa’s career.\nDennis Schwartz from \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" awarded the film a grade \"A\", calling it \"[a] disquieting morality tale based upon the Buddhist concept of an afterlife\". Schwartz praised the film's performances, and visuals which he felt 'acted as a lurid study of sin without salvation'.\nIn an essay for the Criterion Collection, Chuck Stephens wrote, \"Overflowing with brackish ponds of bubbling pus, brain-rattling disjunctions of sound and image, and at times almost dauntingly incomprehensible plot twists and eye-assaulting bouts of brutish montage, \"Jigoku\" is more than merely a boundary-pummeling classic of the horror genre—it’s as lurid a study of sin without salvation as the silver screen has ever seen.\"\nBrett Gallman from \"Oh, the Horror!\" praised the film, calling it \"a masterpiece in visual and abstract horror\". Gallman praised the film's performances, eerie score, Nakagawa’s direction, and \"vivid color palette\". \"HorrorNews.net\" stated in their review of the film that, \"Although this film contains effects that are outdated by modern standards, it is a very powerful story that is based upon the Buddhist belief that sins are atoned for in the afterlife.\"\n\nThe film has developed a cult following over the years and is now considered a cult classic.\n\n"}

He is a legendary giant and trickster whose folk tales were told especially in the city of Antwerp and its neighbouring towns, but similar tales are also prominent in other Flemish cities.\n\nThe legend started in the 16th century in Wilrijk. A farmer found an enormous garden parsley and a red cabbage in his bed. When he touched the vegetables, they turned into a cute baby. As he was unable to take care for the child it was adopted by a family living in Antwerp. Many years later the boy helped persons in need. One day he saved an old woman who was thrown into river Scheldt by a youth gang. The old woman thanked the man by giving him some gifts such as the ability to shapeshift and to make himself so tall he could move from one town to another with a single giant leap. As he preferred to be in his tall size, he got the nickname Lange Wapper. The man turned into a water sprite who liked to live near the sea, near rivers or canals. Since then, Lange Wapper used tricks to approach women to get their breast milk. He teases drunks, cheats whilst playing with children and laughs like the devil.\n\nA man was sitting in an inn in Antwerp. When he went home, he was rather drunk. He heard feet steps behind him. The man turned around and saw another man. The drunk stopped, so did the other. The drunk ran away to his home, but he was followed. The drunk was scared and hid in his bed. Suddenly, a man knocked at the window. It was Lange Wapper who was as big as his house. Lange Wapper said: if you get drunk again, I will break your neck.\"\n\nIn a second story, children were playing nearby Steenplein in Antwerp. Suddenly, a rich man approached. He handed out all kind of candy. The children followed the man in the direction of Boom. Suddenly, the rich man disappeared. The only thing the children heard was a devil's laugh. They realized the man was Lange Wapper.\n\nAnother story is about Stans van 't Gansken, a wheedling woman. She hid aside a place in Antwerp where mothers could abandon their newborn babies. Stans haggled the woman: if they did not give her a large amount of hush money, Stans would inform everybody that she knew about the child abandonment. Everyone paid her. One day, Stans found a baby in front of her door. She took the child and wanted to dump it at the child abandonment location. Suddenly, the baby turned into a giant. It was Lange Wapper. He beat the woman so hard she would never forget. Since then, Stans was never seen again near the child abandon location.\n\nIn a fourth story, a young woman lived nearby Groenplaats in Antwerp. She had four lovers and trumpetted around she even could handle a fifth one. One evening she invited the four lovers one by one in her house. One hour before the first lover arrived, someone knocked at the door. It was a man who presented himself as the fifth lover and invited the woman for a walk in which she agreed. Meanwhile, Lange Wapper hid in the house and used his shapeshifting gift. He wanted to know if the men really loved the woman so he gave them a task. The first man was sent to the cemetery to sit under the big cross. The second had to lay down in a coffin under the cross. The third had to knock on the coffin until someone turned up. The fourth had to walk on the cemetery with a large chain. The four men and the woman died: the first one scared to death when the second one crawled into the coffin. The second man scared to death when the third one knocked on the coffin. The third one died when he heard the noise of the chain thinking it was the devil. The fourth ran to the house of the woman, who was home from the walk, to tell his story. The woman was so scared she died of a stroke. The fourth man went crazy, jumped into the river Scheldt and drowned. The fifth man was revealed to be an assistant of Lange Wapper.\n\n"}

In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.\n\nNusaybah bint Ka’ab, also known as Umm Ammarah (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending the Battle of Uhud like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other interpretations include a seahorse and a lizard. The word \"manaia\" is cognate with the founding Samoan term \"fa'amanaia\", and relevant to the Niuean \"fakamanaia\", both meaning to make a decoration or embellishment.\n\nThe Manaia is traditionally believed to be the messenger between the earthly world of mortals and the domain of the spirits, and its symbol is used as a guardian against evil. In this form, it is usually represented in a figure-of-eight shape, the upper half culminating in a bird-like beak. This form was also widely used in designs of door and window lintels and other architectural features, as well as in ceremonial hafts of weapons. A study of Māori carving suggests that every naturalistic figure there is an equivalent Manaia form which can be seen as a distorted profile-face version of the equivalent full-face figure. It may be that the Manaia represents some spiritual or inner facet of the full face figure.\n\nRelated Manaia-like symbols are also found in other Polynesian cultures, such as in Hawaii and Easter Island.\n\nThe manaia is a useful motif in carving, as it can be distorted to fit any shape and blended into many different designs. As such, it can be used to fill the empty spaces in wood carving, and in many compositions the background between the main figures is filled in with Manaia. It is a very common form in Maori jewellery (possibly only less common than the hei-tiki and hei matau), and is often found worn as a pendant carved from bone or greenstone. Manaia designs vary subtly in form between iwi, though they are often depicted as three-fingered, with these digits representing the trinity of birth, life, and death. A fourth finger, representing the circular rhythms of the life cycle and the afterlife, is also sometimes shown.\n\n\nModern Examples of Manaia Carvings\n"}

In 1911, this committee structure was again reorganized into eight committees: biology was separated into botany; zoology and animal morphology; and physiology and pathology; anthropology was renamed anthropology and psychology with the remaining committees including physics and engineering, unchanged.\n\nIn 1913, George Ellery Hale presented a paper on the occasion of the Academy's 50th anniversary, outlining an expansive future agenda for the Academy. Hale proposed a vision of an Academy that interacted with the \"whole range of science\", one that actively supported newly recognized disciplines, industrial sciences and the humanities. The proposed creation of sections of medicine and engineering was protested by one member because those professions were \"mainly followed for pecuniary gain\". Hale's suggestions were not accepted. Nonetheless, in 1915, the Section of Physics and Engineering was recommended to be changed to physics only, and a year later the Academy began planning a separate section of engineering.\n\nThat same year of 1913, the Academy was requested to investigate the great slide in Culebra Cut late in 1913 which ultimately delayed the opening of the Panama canal by ten months. The study group, commissioned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and although composed of both engineers and geologists resulted in a final report prepared by two geologists Charles Whitman Cross and Harry Fielding Reid. The report, submitted to President Wilson in November 1917, concluded that claims of repeated interruptions in canal traffic for years to come were unjustified.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States confronted the prospect of war with Germany and the question of preparedness was raised. Engineering societies responded to this crisis by offering technical services to the Federal government such as the Naval Consulting Board of 1915 and the Council of National Defense of 1916. On June 19 of that year, then US President Woodrow Wilson requested the National Academy of Sciences to organize a \"National Research Council\" albeit with the assistance of the Engineering Foundation. (pg. 569) The purpose of the Council (at first called the National Research Foundation) was in part to foster and encourage \"the increased use of scientific research in the development of American industries... the employment of scientific methods in strengthening the national defense... and such other applications of science as will promote the national security and welfare.\"\n\nDuring the period of national preparations, an increasing number of engineers were being elected to the physics and engineering section of the Academy, this did not however, resolve the long-standing issue of where to place applied sciences such as engineering in the Academy. In 1863, the founding members who were prominent military and naval engineers comprised almost a fifth of the membership. during the latter part of the 19th century, this engineering membership steadily declined and by 1912, Henry Larcom Abbot, who had been elected in 1872, was the sole remaining representative of the Corps of Engineers. With the Engineering Division in the wartime National Research Council being used as a precedent, the Academy established its first engineering section with nine members in 1919 with civil war veteran Henry Larcom Abbot as its first chairman. OF those nine members, only two were new members, the others had transferred from existing sections; \"... of the 164 members of the Academy that year, only seven chose to identify themselves as engineers.\"\n\nDuring this period of 1915-1916 activity by engineering societies, the National Academy of Sciences complained that there was a lack of scientists and the predominance of engineers on the Federal government's wartime technical committee, the Naval Consulting Board. One of the mathematicians on the Board, Robert Simpson Woodward, was actually trained and early on practiced as a civil engineer. The Academy's response was to move forward with the idea of achieving Academy control over the provision of technical services to the Government by means of formal recognition of the role played by the National Research Council (NRC) established the next year in 1916. Later in 1918, Wilson formalized the NRC's existence under Executive Order 2859. Wilson's order declared the function of the NRC to be in general:\n\nIn 1960, Augustus Braun Kinzel, an engineer with the Union Carbide Corporation and a member of the Academy, stated that the \"..engineering profession was considering the establishment of an academy of engineering...\" confirmed by the Engineers Joint Council of the national engineering societies to afford themselves of opportunities and services similar to those the Academy provided in science. The question being, whether to affiliate with the National Academy or setup a separate Academy.\n\nDuring the past century of the Academy's existence, engineers had been part of the founding members and a sixth of its membership, the founding of the National Research Council in 1916 with the assistance of the Engineering Foundation, the contributions of the NRC Division of Engineering in the post-World War I period, the presidency of engineer Frank B. Jewett during World War II. In short, \"...the ascendancy of science in the public mind since World War I had been partly at the expense of the prestige of the engineering profession.\" (See also\n\nThe Academy worked with the Engineers Joint Council le by President Eric Arthur Walker as the prime mover, to make plans to establish a new National Academy of Engineering that's independent, with a congressional charter of its own. Walker noted that this moment offered a \"...singular opportunity for the engineering profession to participate actively and directly in communicating objective advice to the government...\" on engineering matters related to national policy. A secondary function was to recognize distinguished individuals for their engineering contributions.\n\nUltimately, the initial organizers decided to create the Academy of Engineering as part of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). On December 5, 1964, marking, \"a major landmark in the history of the relationships between science and engineering in our country,\" the Academy approved the Articles of Incorporation of the new academy and its twenty-five charter members met to organize the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) as an autonomous parallel body in the National Academy of Sciences, with Augustus B. Kinzel as its first President. OF the 675 members of the National Academy of Sciences at that time, only about 30 called themselves engineers. The National Academy of Engineering then were a \"purposeful compromise\" given the fears of the NAS of expanded membership by engineers.\n\nThe stated objects and purposes of the newly created National Academy of Engineering were to:\n\nIn 1966, the National Academy of Engineering established the Committee on Public Engineering Policy (COPEP). In 1982, the NAE and NAS committees were merged to become the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy. \nIn 1967, the NAE formed an aeronautics and space engineering board to advise NASA and other Federal agencies chaired by Horton Guyford Stever.\n\nIn 1971, the National Academy of Engineering advised the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey not to construct additional runways at JFK airport as part of a $350,000 study commissioned by the Port Authority. The Port Authority accepted the recommendations of the NAE and NAS.\n\nIn 1975, the NAE added eighty-six new engineer members including noted civil engineer and businessman Stephen Davison Bechtel Jr. \nIn 1986, Tha NAE issued a report encouraging foreign investment, calling for stronger Federal action. That same year, NAE member Robert W. Rummel (1915-2009), space expert and aerospace engineer, served on The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident.\n\nIn 1989, the National Academy of Engineering in conjunction with the National Academy of Science advised the Department of Energy on a site location for the then proposed Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) from a number of States proposals.\n\nIn 1995, The NAE along with the NAS and the National Academy of Medicine reported that the American system of doctoral education in science and engineering, while \"...long a world model, should be reshaped to produce more 'versatile scientists,' rather than narrowly specialized researchers\". \nAgain in 2000, NAE returned to this education theme with its detailed studies of engineering education as part of its \"Engineer of 2020 Studies\" project. The reports concluded that engineering education must be reformed or American engineers will be poorly prepared for engineering practice. Soon after, the American Society of Civil Engineers adopted a policy advocating for the reconstruction of the academic foundation of the professional practice of civil engineering.\n\nFormally, members of the NAE must be U.S. citizens. The term \"foreign associate\" is applied to non-citizens who are elected to the NAE. \"The NAE has more than 2,000 peer-elected members and foreign associates, senior professionals in business, academia, and government who are among the world's most accomplished engineers\", according to the NAE site's About page. Election to the NAE is considered to be among the highest recognitions in engineering-related fields, and it often comes as a recognition of a lifetime's worth of accomplishments. Nomination for membership can only be done by a current member of the NAE for outstanding engineers with identifiable contributions or accomplishments in one or both of the following categories:\n\nIn February, 2000, a National Press Club luncheon during National Engineers Week 2000 sponsored by the NAE, astronaut/engineer Neil Armstrong announced the 20 top engineering achievements having the greatest impact on the quality of life in the 20th century. Twenty-nine professional engineering societies provided 105 nominations which then selected and ranked the top 20 achievements. The nominations were pared to less than fifty and then combined into 29 larger categories. \n\nSome of the achievements, though, such as the telephone and the automobile which were not invented in the 20th century were included because of the impact they had were not really apparent until the 20th century. The top achievement, electrification is essential for almost part of modern society and has \"...literally lighted the world and impacted countless areas of daily life, including food production and processing, air conditioning and heating, refrigeration, entertainment, transportation, communication, health care, and computers.\" Later in 2003, the National Academy of Engineering published \"A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements that Transformed our Lives\".\n\nThe ranked list of the top 20 achievements in the 20th century was published as follows:\nThe NAE's achievements list was criticized for ranking space technology (listed as \"Spacecraft\") twelfth instead of number one despite NAE recognizing in its report that the Soviet Union's Sputnik \"shocked the world and started a space race that launched the greatest engineering team effort in American history.\" (NAE, 2000) \"Time\" magazine ran a similar poll of 20th-century accomplishments, and its website users ranked the first Moon landing in 1969 in second place versus NAE's 12th. The NAE listing was also criticized for not recognizing the role physics played in laying the foundations for the engineering accomplishments such Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry for electrification. NAE's list ranked electronics based upon two inventions, the transistor and integrated circuits, even it neglected to mention their physicist inventors, John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain, William B. Shockley, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce. Another commentator noted that the list ignored the St. Lawrence seaway and power project, built between 1954 and 1959 and by extension the Panama Canal. The St. Lawrence seaway was \"...one of the largest transborder projects ever undertaken by two countries and one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century.\"\n\nIt was also noted that these 20th-century accomplishments did not come without impacts on the environment or societies. Electrification as an example, resulting in fossil-fuel-burning power plants, airplanes and automobiles which emit greenhouse gases while electronics manufacturing leaves heavy-metal byproducts.\n\nThe Grand Challenges confront wicked social issues that are inherently global in nature and require technological innovations and applications of systems thinking. Further, NAE argues that the solutions call upon engineers to persuasively influence \"...public policy, transfer technical innovation to the market place, and to inform and be informed by social science and the humanities.\" The NAE's Grand Challenges overlap with the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and its 2015 successor, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which all depend upon \"a strong engineering component\" for success.\n\nThe Academy introduced its \"Grand Challenges for Engineering\" project in 2007 with the commissioning of a blue ribbon committee composed of leading technological thinkers from around the globe. The committee, led by former Secretary of Defense William Perry was charged with the task of identifying \"..key engineering challenges for improving life in the 21st century.\" NAE's intent was to develop a set of challenges of such importance that they warranted serious investment and if successful, would \"lead to a marked improvement in our quality of life.\" The project received \"...thousands of inputs from around the world to determine its list of Grand Challenges for Engineering, and its report was reviewed by more than 50 subject-matter experts, making it among the most reviewed of Academy studies.\"\nIn February 2008, the committee announced 14 Engineering Grand Challenges fitting into four broad categories: energy, sustainability, and global climate change; medicine, health informatics and health care delivery systems; reducing our vulnerability to natural and human threats; and advancing the human spirit and capabilities. NAE noted that a number of engineering schools had developed coursework based upon Grand Challenge themes. <br> \nThe 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering developed by the NAE committee were to:\n\nNAE noted in its report that the Grand Challenges for Engineering were not \"...ranked in importance or likelihood of solution, nor was any strategy proposed for solving them. Rather, they were offered as a way to inspire the profession, young people, and the public at large to seek the solutions.\" NAE also stated that the Grand Challenges were \"...not targeted to any one country or corporate sector... (and)... are relevant to everyone in every country. In fact, some of them bear on the very survival of society. If solving these challenges can become an international movement, all will benefit.\"\n\nOne writer favorably observed that the Academy's list of 20th-century engineering achievements was dominated by devices and when asked to project advances for the 21st, the result was again, device dominated. With respect to the Grand Challenges, the NAE reframed its discussion from being device centric to addressing complex or wicked social issues that cannot be solved by technology alone, i.e. more devices. With the Grand Challenges though, NAE \"...charted a course for... (engineering)... to move from devices to global social challenges, and has identified a number of exciting ones.\"\nOne critical reaction to the NAE's challenges noted that engineers today are the \"...unacknowledged legislators of the world... (and by)... designing and constructing new structures, processes, and products, they are influencing how we live as much as any laws enacted by politicians. The author argued that NAE's Grand Challenges should have included the \"...challenge of thinking about what we are doing as we turn the world into an (engineering) artifact and the appropriate limitations of this engineering power.\" This is already happening in the Netherlands with its Delta Works as an example of a society being an engineered artifact but also with a community of philosophers of engineering and technology.\n\nAnother commentator observed that challenges with respect to sustainability concentrated on specific elements of the problem without addressing \"... \"what level of energy use would be sustainable on a global scale.\" While India and China are 1000-1500 Watt per person societies, the United States requires 12,000 W per person. An estimate of a sustainable level of power consumption made by a Swiss group is 2,000 W per person. Similar questions were raised on the NAE's challenge for access to clean water. The average daily per capita water consumption in American cities varies from 130 to 2000 liters (35 to 530 gallons).\n\nIn 2010, NAE developed a plan for preparing engineering students at the undergraduate academic degree level to practice in career fields that emerged as a result of effort to answer the Grand Challenges. The program had five components, namely:\n\nWhile the National Academy of Engineering's GC SCholars (GCSP) program was primarily focused on undergraduate level curriculums, STEM focuses on K–12 education. The question for STEM educators was how to prepare K-12 students to participate in solving the wicked problems associated with the Grand Challenges. One response was to align STEM program theories of learning and International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA, formerly ITEA) Technological Literacy Standards with the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges in order to guide current and pending curriculum development. NAE's objective was also to inform instructional practices, particularly dealing with the connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. The Technological Literacy Standards were funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA and NAE's Technology Education Standards Committee led the Academy's efforts on the standards.\n\nAs a result of NAE's Grand Challenge efforts, three national engineering academies–The National Academy of Engineering of the United States, The Royal Academy of Engineering of the United Kingdom,and the Chinese Academy of Engineering–organized a joint \"Global Grand Challenges\" Summit, held in London on March 12–13, 2013. \nIn September 2015 a second Global Grand Challenges Summit was held in Beijing, with more than 800 attendees invited by the three academies. The third Global Grand Challenges Summit, was hosted by the NAE in the United States in 2017.\n\nThe Frontiers of Engineering program assembles a group of emerging engineering leaders - usually aged 30–45 - to discuss cutting-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The goal of the meetings is to bring participants together to collaborate, network, and share ideas. There are three Frontiers of Engineering meetings every year: the U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Symposium, the German-American Frontiers of Engineering Symposium, and the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. The Indo-U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Symposium is held every other year.\n\nThe goal of the diversity office is to participate in studies addressing the issue of increasing and broadening a domestic talent pool. Through this effort the NAE convenes workshops, coordinators with other organizations, and identifies program needs and opportunities for improvement.\n\nAs part of this effort the NAE has launched both the EngineerGirl! and Engineer Your Life webpages.\n\nThe Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education. was established to advance engineering education in the United States, aiming for curriculum changes that address the needs of new generations of engineering students and the unique problems they will face with the challenges of the 21st century.\n\nThe Center worked closely with the Committee on Engineering Education, which works to improve the quality of engineering education by providing advice to policy makers, administrators, employers, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Center is no longer active within the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThis program area studies connections between engineering, technology, and the economic performance of the United States. Efforts aim to advance the understanding of engineering's contribution to the sectors of the domestic economy and to learn where engineering may enhance economic performance.\n\nThe project also aims to investigate the best ways to determine levels of technological literacy in the United States among three distinct populations in the United States: K-12 students, K-12 teachers, and out-of-school adults. A report (and associated website), \"Technically Speaking\", explains what \"technological literacy\" is, why it's important, and what is being done in the U.S. to improve it.\n\nThe Center for Engineering, Ethics, and Society seeks to engage engineers and the engineering profession in identiftying and resolving ethical issues in associated with engineering research and practice. The Center works is closely linked with the Online Ethics Center.\n\nThis program, recognizing that the engineering profession has often been associated with causing environmental harm, looks to recognize and publicize that the profession is now at the forefront of mitigating negative environmental impacts. The program will provide policy guidance to government, the private sector, and the public on ways to create a more environmentally sustainable future.\n\nTo publicize the work of both the profession and the NAE, the institution puts considerable efforts into outreach activities.\n\nA weekly radio spot produced by the NAE is broadcast on WTOP radio in the Washington, DC area and the file and text of the spot can be found on the NAE site. The NAE also distributes a biweekly newsletter focusing on engineering issues and advancements.\n\nIn addition, NAE has held a series of workshops titled \"News and Terrorism: Communicating in a Crisis,\" in which experts from the National Academies and elsewhere provide reporters, state and local public information officers, emergency managers, and representatives from the public sector with important information about weapons of mass destruction and their impact. This project is conducted in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security and the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation.\n\nIn addition to these efforts the NAE fosters good relationships with members of the media to ensure coverage of the work of the institution and to serve as a resource for the media to use when they have technical questions or would like to speak to an NAE member on a particular matter. The NAE is also active in \"social media,\" both to reach new and younger audiences and to reach traditional audiences in new ways.\n\nThe Academy awards several prizes, with each recipient receiving $500,000. The prizes include the Bernard M. Gordon Prize, the Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize, and the Charles Stark Draper Prize. They are sometimes referred to collectively as the American version of a Nobel Prize for engineering.\n\nThe \"Bernard M. Gordon Prize\" was started in 2001 by the NAE. It is named after Bernard Marshall Gordon, the founder of Analogic Corporation. Its purpose is to recognize leaders in academia for the development of new educational approaches to engineering. Each year, the Gordon Prize awards $500,000 to the grantee, of which the recipient may personally use $250,000, and his or her institution receives $250,000 for the ongoing support of academic development.\n\nThe Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize is an American national and international award established by the NAE in October 1999 in Athens, Ohio. The prize has been given biennially in odd years since 2001. Named after Fritz Russ, the founder of Systems Research Laboratories, and his wife Dolores Russ, it recognizes a bioengineering achievement that \"has had a significant impact on society and has contributed to the advancement of the human condition through widespread use.\" The award was instigated at the request of Ohio University to honor Fritz Russ, one of its alumni.\n\nThe NAE annually awards the Charles Stark Draper Prize, which is given for the advancement of engineering and the education of the public about engineering. The recipient receives $500,000. The prize is named for Charles S. Draper, the \"father of inertial navigation\", an MIT professor and founder of the Draper Laboratory.\n\n\n"}

The 1994 Goals 2000 legislation formally established the National Education Goals Panel in federal law, and the legislation assigned it annual reporting responsibilities.

{"id": "2541701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2541701", "title": "Open-source governance", "text": "Open-source governance\n\nOpen-source governance (also known as open politics) is a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the open-source and open-content movements to democratic principles to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy, as with a wiki document. Legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their collective wisdom to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.\n\nTheories on how to constrain, limit or enable this participation vary. Accordingly, there is no one dominant theory of how to go about authoring legislation with this approach. There are a wide array of projects and movements which are working on building open-source governance systems.\n\nMany left-libertarian and radical centrist organizations around the globe have begun advocating open-source governance and its related political ideas as a reformist alternative to current governance systems. Often, these groups have their origins in decentralized structures such as the Internet and place particular importance on the need for anonymity to protect an individual's right to free speech in democratic systems. Opinions vary, however, not least because the principles behind open-source government are still very loosely defined.\n\nIn practice, several applications have evolved and been used by actual democratic institutions in the developed world:\n\nSome models are significantly more sophisticated than a plain wiki, incorporating semantic tags, levels of control or scoring to mediate disputes – however this always risks empowering a clique of moderators more than would be the case given their trust position within the democratic entity – a parallel to the common wiki problem of official vandalism by persons entrusted with power by owners or publishers (so-called \"sysop vandalism\" or \"administrative censorship\").\n\nSome advocates of these approaches, by analogy to software code, argue for a \"central codebase\" in the form of a set of policies that are maintained in a public registry and that are \"infinitely reproducible\". \"Distributions\" of this policy-base are released (periodically or dynamically) for use in localities, which can apply \"patches\" to customize them for their own use. Localities are also able to cease subscribing to the central policy-base and \"fork\" it or adopt someone else's policy-base. In effect, the government stems from emergent cooperation and self-correction among members of a community. As the policies are put into practice in a number of localities, problems and issues are identified and solved, and where appropriate communicated back to the core.\n\nThese goals for instance were cited often during the Green Party of Canada's experiments with open-political-platform development. As one of over a hundred national Green party entities worldwide and the ability to co-ordinate policy among provincial and municipal equivalents within Canada, it was in a good position to maintain just such a central repository of policy, despite being legally separate from those other entities.\n\nOpen-source governance differs from previous open-government initiatives in its broader emphasis on collaborative processes.\nThe \"Imagine Halifax\" (IH) project was designed to create a citizens' forum for elections in Halifax, Nova Scotia in fall 2004. Founded by Angela Bischoff, the widow of Tooker Gomberg, a notable advocate of combining direct action with open politics methods, IH brought a few dozen activists together to compile a platform (using live meetings and email and seedwiki followup). When it became clear that candidates could not all endorse all elements of the platform, it was then turned into questions for candidates in the election. The best ideas from candidates were combined with the best from activists – the final scores reflected a combination of convergence and originality. In contrast to most such questionnaires, it was easier for candidates to excel by contributing original thought than by simply agreeing. One high scorer, Andrew Younger, had not been involved with the project originally but was elected and appeared on TV with project leader Martin Willison. The project had not only changed its original goal from a partisan platform to a citizen questionnaire, but it had recruited a previously uninvolved candidate to its cause during the election. A key output of this effort was a glossary of about 100 keywords relevant to municipal laws.\n\nThe 2004–05 Green Party of Canada Living Platform was a much more planned and designed effort at open politics. As it prepared itself for an electoral breakthrough in the 2004 federal election, the Green Party of Canada began to compile citizen, member and expert opinions in preparation of its platform. During the election, it gathered input even from Internet trolls including supporters of other parties, with no major problems: anonymity was respected and, if they were within the terms of use, comments remained intact. Despite, or perhaps because of, its early success, it was derailed by Jim Harris, the party's leader, when he discovered that it was a threat to his status as a party boss. The Living Platform split off as another service entirely out of GPC control and eventually evolved into OpenPolitics.ca and a service to promote wiki usage among citizens and political groups.\n\nThe Liberal Party of Canada also attempted a deep policy renewal effort in conjunction with its leadership race in 2006. While candidates in that race, notably Carolyn Bennett, Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, all made efforts to facilitate web-threaded policy-driven conversations between supporters, all failed to create lateral relationships and thus also failed to contribute much to the policy renewal effort.\n\nNumerous very different projects related to open-source governance collaborate under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project; Metagovernment uses the term \"collaborative governance\", most of which are building platforms of open-source governance.\n\nFuture Melbourne is a wiki-based collaborative environment for developing Melbourne's 10-year plan. During public consultation periods, it enables the public to edit the plan with the same editing rights as city personnel and councilors.\n\nThe New Zealand Police Act Review was a wiki used to solicit public commentary during the public consultation period of the acts review.\n\nAt linux.conf.au on January 14, 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand, Australian Audrey Lobo-Pulo presented \"Evaluating Government Policies Using Open Source Models\", agitating for government policy related knowledge, data and analysis to be freely available to everyone to use, modify and distribute without restriction \"a parallel universe where public policy development and analysis is a dynamic, collaborative effort between government and its citizens\". Audrey reported that the motivation for her work was personal uncertainty about the nature and accuracy of models, estimates and assumptions used to prepare policies released with the 2014 Australian Federal Government Budget, and whether and to what extent their real world impact is assessed following implementation. A white paper on \"Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models\" was released on September 10, 2015.\n\nThe open-politics theory, a narrow application of open-source governance, combines aspects of the free software and open-content movements, promoting decision-making methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the public interest with respect to public policy issues. It takes special care for instance to deal with equity differences, geographic constraints, defamation versus free political speech, accountability to persons affected by decisions, and the actual standing law and institutions of a jurisdiction. There is also far more focus on compiling actual positions taken by real entities than developing theoretical \"best\" answers or \"solutions\". One example, DiscourseDB, simply lists articles pro and con a given position without organizing their argument or evidence in any way.\n\nWhile some interpret it as an example of \"open-source politics\", open politics is not a top–down theory but a set of best practices from citizen journalism, participatory democracy and deliberative democracy, informed by e-democracy and netroots experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument as they evolved in academic and military use through the 1980s to present. Some variants of it draw on the theory of scientific method and market methods, including prediction markets and anticipatory democracy.\n\nIts advocates often engage in legal lobbying and advocacy to directly change laws in the way of the broader application of the technology, e.g. opposing political libel cases in Canada, fighting libel chill generally, and calling for clarification of privacy and human rights law especially as they relate to citizen journalism. They are less focused on tools although the semantic mediawiki and tikiwiki platforms seem to be generally favored above all others.\n\n"}
{"id": "577577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577577", "title": "Oxford–Cambridge rivalry", "text": "Oxford–Cambridge rivalry\n\nRivalry between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge is a phenomenon going back many centuries. During most of that time, they were the only two universities in England and Wales, making the rivalry more intense than it is now.\n\nThe University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, sometimes collectively known as \"Oxbridge\", are the two oldest universities in the United Kingdom. Both were founded more than 800 years ago, and between them they have produced a large number of Britain's most prominent scientists, writers and politicians, as well as noted figures in many other fields. Yet for many of these centuries the two universities were unrecognisable as universities in the modern sense, as they were largely institutions for producing clergymen and were thus strongly tied to the Church. Competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to around 1208 when Cambridge was founded by scholars taking refuge from hostile townsmen in Oxford.\n\nIn 2012 the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, based on a survey of 13,388 academics over 131 countries which was then the largest evaluation of academic reputation to date found that both Cambridge and Oxford belonged to the elite group of six universities touted as the 'globally recognized super brands'; The other four were Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University.\n\nOxford and Cambridge both have:\n\nOxford and Cambridge also share a common collegiate structure: each university has more than 30 semi-autonomous residential colleges (see Colleges of the University of Cambridge, Colleges of the University of Oxford), which provide the environments in which students live, work and sleep.\n\nApplicants must choose a specific college when applying to Oxford or Cambridge, or allow the university to select one for them, as every undergraduate and graduate student must be a member of one of the colleges. However, all colleges are part of the university and students studying the same subject attend the same lectures and exams, irrespective of to which college they belong. Degrees are also awarded by the central university and not by the individual colleges.\n\nColleges within each university regularly compete with each other in a variety of sporting and other events (e.g. rugby, rowing, athletics and chess), but will pool their talent to form university teams for inter-university contests.\n\nThe principal method of undergraduate teaching (other than lectures) is the \"supervision\" or \"tutorial\": terms used at Cambridge and Oxford respectively, though the meaning is the same. These are typically weekly or more frequent hour-long sessions in which small groups of students – usually between one and three – meet with a member of the university's teaching staff or a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an essay or assignment in advance of the supervision/tutorial, which they will discuss with the supervisor/tutor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. Students typically receive one to four tutorials/supervisions per week.\n\nWithin the cities of Oxford and Cambridge are campuses of other universities, respectively Oxford Brookes University and Anglia Ruskin University. In addition, various English language schools, secretarial and other non-university colleges are based in the two cities.\n\nBoth Oxford and Cambridge have lent their names to educational materials and institutions associated with the two universities. In addition to their printing houses, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is a prominent English-language dictionary worldwide, while Cambridge Assessment provides a number of widely recognised qualifications for students (including GCSEs, A-levels and English-language proficiency certificates such as the Certificate in Advanced English).\n\nThe city of Oxford is larger (having a population about 30 per cent greater than Cambridge's in 2007) and has historically been more urban and industrial, whilst Cambridge more closely resembles an agricultural market town. Oxford is associated with the motor industry (BMW currently produce the Mini in Oxford, and several Formula One teams are based in Oxfordshire and neighbouring counties), whereas the area surrounding Cambridge is known as Silicon Fen—one of the most important technology centres in Europe—that has presence of large companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, ARM, along with many medical technology firms.\n\nBoth cities were built near rivers. However, the sole river is more prominent in Cambridge, flowing through the city centre rather than the two rivers (Thames and Cherwell) which flow around the centre of Oxford. Punting is especially popular in Cambridge along the famous stretch called 'The Backs', which features a number of bridges and 'the backs' of several colleges that abut the River Cam (punting is also popular at Oxford).\n\nDespite many ancient buildings in both Oxford and Cambridge, there are also distinct differences in architecture. Oxford has a uniformity of building material, as a large proportion of the buildings are in the local sandstone. Cambridge, on the other hand, has little local stone, so the building material has been brought in from many different sources, resulting in a greater variety of character. The contrasts in architecture in Cambridge are more pronounced, as can be seen when comparing King's College with the neighbouring Senate House.\n\nOxford is featured more often in literature and the cinema; films with scenes shot in Oxford include Shadowlands and the \"Harry Potter\" movies, while Radcliffe Square was used in the filming of \"\". The television series \"Inspector Morse\" and \"Lewis\" are also set in Oxford. Cambridge may be best known in film as the real-life location of the court race scene portrayed in the film Chariots of Fire (although the scene was filmed at Eton College instead), or for the television series Porterhouse Blue.\n\nThere are differences in the terminology traditionally used at the two universities. For example:\n\nIt is still compulsory at Oxford to wear formal academic dress (sub fusc) for all university examinations, although this is not the case at Cambridge. During Hilary Term 2006, the students of Oxford voted 81% in favour of keeping formal academic dress at university exams. In general, however, traditions and the seriousness with which they are taken tend to vary widely amongst the different colleges within each university, showing more variation than between the two universities as a whole.\n\nFor most of their history, only men were permitted to study at and receive degrees from Oxford and Cambridge. Starting in the late 19th century, both universities saw the establishment of residential colleges exclusively for women students: Girton College, Cambridge, was founded in 1869 and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 1878. Although Cambridge was the first to accommodate female students, women were not permitted to become full members of the university until 1947, whereas at Oxford this had occurred in 1920.\n\nThere are still three colleges at Cambridge which only accept women: Newnham, Murray Edwards and Lucy Cavendish. In 2008, Oxford's last all-female college, St Hilda's, admitted men and became coeducational.\n\nThere is a somewhat common impression that Oxford is stronger in politics and the humanities, while Cambridge is stronger in the sciences and engineering. Despite both universities' stressing that there is no significant difference between them in either the sciences or humanities today, this disparity in the popular imagination has existed since at least the late 1820s, when \"The Times\" newspaper reported on the appointment of Oxford and Cambridge academics to the newly established professorships of University College London: \"it is known to be the intention to choose classical professors at Oxford, and mathematical at Cambridge\", although in the event both the classical and mathematical professors were eventually chosen from Cambridge.\n\nIn his book, \"The Decline of Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University\", Joseph A. Soares, an American sociologist, suggests that Oxford developed a superior political and literary reputation because of its unparalleled connections to England's governing class, its status as the oldest and most traditional university in England, and the greater romantic appeal of Oxford to writers:\n\nDespite Oxford University having been the home of almost 60 Nobel prize winners, Cambridge has been associated with an even larger number of Nobel Prize-winning breakthroughs (ca. 90) and a greater fraction of Britain's most culturally significant scientists, including Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. The authors of \"Oxford Figures\" also suggest that Cambridge's unrivalled intellectual reputation in England, especially although not exclusively in technical fields, could be partly attributed to the emphasis it placed on mathematics for many years:\n\nNotwithstanding the above, significant changes have occurred at both Oxford and Cambridge over the last century, including Cambridge's diversification away from intense mathematical study and Oxford's renewed emphasis on ground-breaking scientific research, such as its influential work in the development of penicillin. However, the withdrawal of equal academic dress from Oxford's scientist alumni may perhaps reflect a current institutional preference towards the arts. Oxford offers the course of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, while Cambridge offers Human, Social and Political Sciences. Software tycoon Bill Gates gives scholarships to Cambridge, while Oxford is home to what is the oldest and arguably the most prestigious academic award for graduates – Rhodes Scholarship – instituted by Cecil Rhodes. US News and World Report rankings support this stereotype; Cambridge tends to rank higher in the sciences, and Oxford in the humanities.\n\nEntrance to Oxford and Cambridge is academically competitive. According to the 2011 Universities Guide from \"The Guardian\" newspaper, the five top universities in the UK based on undergraduate students' performance in public examinations while at high school (as measured on the UCAS tariff scale) were Cambridge (546), Oxford (530), Imperial College London (500), the London School of Economics (493) and Durham University (466). Depending on which subject an applicant wishes to specialise in, there are often compulsory subject-specific entrance tests as well.\n\nAfter an initial screening of submitted applications, short-listed candidates at Oxford and Cambridge are invited to a series of tests and interviews with the academics who may eventually be teaching them. Oxbridge interviews have acquired something of a mythical status in the British media, becoming a source of various humorous anecdotes and urban legends due to the perception that the interviews themselves are bizarre, intimidating and/or frequently involve unusual questions and requests. Interview prompts reportedly used in the past include \"\"Do you think you're clever?\" (from a Law interview at Cambridge) and \"Talk about a light bulb\"\" (from an Engineering interview at Oxford). Admissions staff have said that there are no correct answers to such questions, but that applicants are assessed on their ability to approach unfamiliar, open-ended problems and discuss them articulately, incorporating new ideas and evidence as the discussion progresses. Candidates are also expected to show a willingness to challenge their own preconceptions about the topics under discussion, as well as the preconceptions adopted by their interviewers. This is essentially a test of whether the student would do well under the tutorial/supervision system at Oxford and Cambridge, and a poor performance at interview may negate an otherwise strong application.\n\nIn recent years, Cambridge has placed slightly more emphasis than Oxford on public exam results during the selection process. Cambridge routinely asks applicants who take A-level exams to report their exact scores, not just letter-grades; this is partly to distinguish between high A-grades and borderline A/B grades. In contrast, disclosure of exact scores for Oxford applications is voluntary. In 2010, the new A* grade for A-level exams (an A* indicating a high A) was introduced. Cambridge started requesting that its applicants achieve at least one A* grade if they were taking A-levels, letting students earn a place through their performance in public examinations; Oxford initially stated that it relies more on its own internal aptitude tests and waited to see how effective the A* grade is at highlighting the best candidates, before deciding to implement it as a requirement for most courses starting in 2012.\n\nDue to the similarities between the two universities, and to ease the burden of interviewing so many applicants each year, secondary school students are not normally allowed to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same application cycle. This restriction does not apply to potential organ scholars or students who already have a degree and are applying for a second undergraduate degree or a graduate degree at Oxbridge.\n\nMany annual competitions are held between Oxford and Cambridge, including the annual Boat Race. First contested in 1829, the race pits Cambridge University Boat Club against their Oxford counterparts over a four-mile (6 km) stretch of the River Thames. The very first Boat Race was won by Oxford, but Cambridge lead the overall series with 83 wins to Oxford's 80, with one dead heat in 1877. Recent races have been closely fought, with Oxford winning by the shortest ever margin of in 2003 and Cambridge winning in 2004 despite Oxford's claims of a foul.\n\nThe other major Oxbridge competitions are the Rugby Union and Rugby League Varsity Matches: The Varsity Match is a rugby union game played annually in December at Twickenham stadium. Cambridge currently has 60 wins, Oxford has 55 (including the most recent win in December 2014), and 14 games have ended in draws. The Rugby Football Union chose to advertise the 2006 match with a campaign promoting inter-university rivalry: their advertising agency Lowe London produced posters showing the number of Prime Ministers produced by the universities (Oxford 26 – Cambridge 14), with the tagline \"It's time to get even\".\n\nThe Rugby League Varsity Match is a rugby league game played annually in March at The Stoop. Whilst not having the history of its Union counterpart, the fixture has been contested for over 30 years, and is broadcast live on Sky Sports. Cambridge currently lead the series 16–14, with one draw in 1994.\n\nThe Boat Race and the two Varsity Matches are notable in the UK in that they are the only university sports events that have any public profile outside the universities themselves; all three are screened live on national television and are widely covered in the national media.\n\nAll other significant sports have their own varsity match at some point during the year; some of these, such as the cricket fixture, the Ice Hockey Varsity Match and the Varsity Polo Match have attracted significant attention in the past. The results of all the varsity matches in The Varsity Games are aggregated and each year one university wins the Varsity Games title. Sportsmen who have competed at a Varsity Match in the prestigious Full Blue sports are eligible for an Oxford Blue or Cambridge Blue respectively.\n\nOver the last few years, British universities have been subjected to the increasing popularity of national university league tables, which rank universities based on criteria such as their student-staff ratio, drop-out rates and spending on services and facilities. Oxford and Cambridge have been a constant presence at the top end of the tables, never appearing outside the overall top three and rarely not holding the first and second places, but their dominance in individual subjects has been challenged by other institutions.\n\nAs of 2012, Cambridge has been ranked above Oxford in three out of the four major UK university league tables. Cambridge has been ranked 1st and Oxford 2nd in the tables compiled by the Guardian, and The Sunday Times, and 3rd behind the London School of Economics in The Complete University Guide, whereas Oxford is ranked 1st and Cambridge 2nd in The Times Good University Guide.\n\nInternational league tables of universities across the world, which use a variety of different criteria (often research output in the sciences and reputation among peer institutions), generally ranks Cambridge and Oxford almost equally; for example the 2010 U.S. News & World Report's World's Best Universities ranking placed Cambridge as 1st in the world and Oxford the 6th while in the International 2013 Times Higher Education rankings, Oxford is ranked second globally and Cambridge seventh.\n\nDespite the impassioned rivalry between the two universities, there is also much cooperation when the need arises. Most Oxford colleges have a sister college in Cambridge. Some Oxford and Cambridge colleges with the same name are 'sisters': for example, Jesus College, Cambridge, and Jesus College, Oxford. However, namesakes are not always paired up: for example, St John's College, Oxford, is the sister college of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, while St John's College, Cambridge, is the sister college of Balliol College, Oxford. Arrangements between sister colleges vary, but may include reciprocal offers of accommodation to students from the other university when they are visiting. Furthermore, a significant proportion of academic staff has at some point been a member of the \"other place\".\n\nConcerns are often raised that Oxford and Cambridge do not project a socially inclusive image to potential applicants from state schools, and thus Oxbridge students are disproportionately from wealthy backgrounds. The two universities have made individual and combined efforts in recent years to promote themselves to potential applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. Each year, the Universities spend around £8 million on access schemes and there is a designated Access Officer in every JCR and students' union.\n\n\n"}

E. de Josselin de Jong\n\nPatrick Edward de Josselin de Jong (July 8, 1922 – January 1, 1999) was a professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Leiden for over 30 years, and department chair from 1957 through 1987. His research specialization was on the Minangkabau in West Sumatra. \n\nPatrick was considered a foremost general anthropologist in the tradition set by the Leiden University where he headed the Cultural Anthropology chair, and who inherited his anthropological skills from his equally illustrious uncle J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong, with his dominant field of interest centered on Indonesia. He was also a regional specialist, particularly in western Indonesia with structuralism as his main subject of interest. Structural anthropology originated at the University of Leiden during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHis bibliography lists 208 titles, including reprints and translations. He was decorated with the “Ridder in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw” in April 1986 by the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. He was also decorated for his wartime activities as Verzetsherdenkingskruis award. He retired in 1987 as professor in cultural anthropology and became a professor emeritus thereafter. He was honoured in a farewell symposium where he gave his concluding lecture titled “The Sacred Ruler in Indonesia” in Dutch.\n\nPatrick was born in Beijing in 1922. His father (a Dutch) was a former naval officer and was with the foreign service. His mother was Scottish. \n\nPatrick and his mother moved to the Netherlands when he was aged six in 1928, receiving his secondary education at Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden. Under his father's influence, he enrolled in 1940 in a course in Indonesian Languages at Leiden University to prepare for a career as a linguist with the Dutch East Indies civil service. \n\nHe was the nephew of structural anthropologist J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong who coined the concept of the field of ethnological study in his second inaugural lecture (1935). The Leiden tradition was set by J.P.B. with the concept of Field of Ethnological Study; the focus being on the structural core of Indonesian societies. His successor continued and expanded this line of research (comparative structuralism).\n\nPatrick and J.P.B. regularly attended the evening meetings of the student society W.D.O. Peter Suzuki was his assistant. Patrick occupied the room of his uncle in the University. J.P.B. had also gifted Patrick with his personal toga or professional gown. J.P.B. had used this gown as a symbolic rite on 20 occasions while conferring doctorates on his students. \n\nDuring the Second World War, Patrick was a member of the Dutch resistance. \nPatrick began his first job in 1949 at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden as assistant-curator. He worked in the Islam Department in the section that studied Muslim peoples, especially those who lived in Indonesia. He left this position in 1953 to accept a post as lecturer in Singapore.\n\nFrom 1957, Patrick Edward de Josselin de Jong was involved with teaching two major subjects at Leiden University: cultural anthropology in general, and cultural anthropology of South-East Asia and the South Seas, in particular. Patrick differed from his mentor and uncle, J.P.B., in two main aspects namely: “firstly his view is much more cognitive (stressing the idea principles), and secondly, his view is transformational\". \n\nIn January 1957, Patrick was appointed to professor of cultural anthropology at the Leiden University, his uncle having retired in September 1956. He was chair of the department until 1987. After his appointment as professor, Patrick preferred to denote the Leiden school as “Leidse richting” (Dutch, meaning something like \"the tenor [way] of Leiden\") which he considered an appropriate usage to the comparative and structural study under the well-known Leiden Tradition approach to the field of anthropological study not exclusive to Indonesia.\n\nPatrick's work at the university covered the third phase of the study of cultural anthropology at Leiden University. The first phase involved P.J. Veth, G.A. Wilken, J.J.M. de Groot, and A.W. Nieuwenhuis; J.P.B Josselin de Jong and W.H. Rassers were in the second phase (from 1920 on); the third phase started with the appointment of P.E. de Josselin de Jong. In his inaugural lecture of 1957, Patrick termed his period as a turning point in the history of this study in the university. While the second phase was influenced by the work of Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, as well as of Franz Boas and R.H. Lowie, the third phase was under the influence of Claude Lévi-Strauss (from 1949 on).\n\nHis bibliography lists 208 titles (including reprints and translations), nine books, and edited works, seven in English, one in Dutch and one in Bahasa Indonesia. He published 55 reviews, 136 articles, 3 comments, and also wrote articles with others, including 111 less substantial articles, translations and reprints. He classified his diverse publications under regional and non-regional (South East Asia), popular scientific and pure scientific works.\n\nThe principles adopted by Patrick have been classified under four headings namely, Kinship, Insular South-East Asia, Political Myths and Cultural anthropology, which are not considered “mutually exclusive” but do overlap. Gingrich and Fox (2002) state that J.P.B. identified four elements that constitute a structural core within the field of ethnological study, including circulating connubium, double unilineality, dual symbolic classification, and resilience from foreign cultural influences.\n\nIn his long and distinguished career, Patrick de Josselin de Jong continued the structural anthropology of his predecessor, invigorating it with Levi-Straussian ideas on structural transformations within Fields of Anthropological Study. His career contribution was succinctly hailed with the words “continuation and innovation,” which view was upheld by his senior colleague G.W. Locher who stated that “he is the independent continuator of the Leiden tradition; critical and creative”.\n\nOn May 22, 1947, he gave his first speech at the Ethnological Society W.D.O. \n\nIn January 1961, he was made an honorary member of Royal Asiatic Society. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (RAI), and a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1974.\n\nIn 1986, he received a knighthood in the Order of the Netherlands Lion.\n\nDe Josselin de Jong died in Oegstgeest, Netherlands in 1999.\n\n\n"}

Unlike \"Black Plague\" and \"Overture\" however, the focus is almost exclusively on puzzle solving. No enemies are encountered, meaning that the player can only be injured by environmental hazards.\n\nThe game starts as the last one ends, with Philip sending the 'kill them all' message. As soon as he finishes, one of the Infected barges in and hits Phillip on the head with something unseen. The player then controls a character in some kind of tomb. Items need to be collected in each chamber in order to move on to the next. In the journey, the player starts to see familiar places from other parts of the facility and begins to receive communications from persons who Philip had encountered previously, such as Dr. Richard Emminis who Philip encountered in the Computer Room of \"Black Plague\", a member of the Archaic Elevated Caste called Eloff Carpenter, as well as a person who later identifies himself as Philip's former adviser, Red, from the first \"Penumbra\" game.\n\nAs time goes on various strange happenings occur, such as the Computer referring to both Philip and the Player directly by name as well as more bizarre environments and puzzles. The game, and the entire series, has two possible endings. One concludes with Philip joining Red in the incinerator from \"Overture\", deeming regular life not worth living. As the rest of \"Requiem\" seems to have been a figment of Philip's mind, this leaves him dead in the room where the game originally began and where \"Black Plague\" ended. Philip can also choose to leave Red to die on his own, and return to the fishing boat which was originally used to take him to the mine in the first place. This seems to be a fulfilling of Red's statement that it is \"better to have a story and end it than never to realize it has begun.\"\n\nWith the announcement of \"\", the series (originally intended to be a trilogy) was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. After the release of \"Black Plague\" there continued to be no indication that the developers intended to expand the series other than an April Fools' Day posting about \"Penumbra 3: Back With a Vengeance\", a game which would have featured over the top violence and \"an action-filled blood soaked ending!\"\n\nThe developers did however eventually decide that they would release a third installment in the form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and more fully utilize some of the series characters, as well as to create a more puzzle focused title in order to fully show off the HPL Engine 1's advanced physics effects. \"Penumbra: Requiem\" was officially announced on 16 April 2008. During the expansion's development work also began on what would become \"\".\n\n\"Penumbra: Requiem\" was less popular than the previous games in the series, receiving \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n"}
{"id": "841441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841441", "title": "Psychonautics", "text": "Psychonautics\n\nPsychonautics (from the Ancient Greek ' [\"soul\", \"spirit\" or \"mind\"] and ' [\"sailor\" or \"navigator\"] – \"a sailor of the soul\") refers both to a methodology for describing and explaining the subjective effects of altered states of consciousness, especially an important subgroup called holotropic states, including those induced by meditation or mind-altering substances, and to a research paradigm in which the researcher voluntarily immerses themselves into an altered mental state in order to explore the accompanying experiences.\n\nThe term has been applied diversely, to cover all activities by which altered states are induced and utilized for spiritual purposes or the exploration of the human condition, including shamanism, lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, sensory deprivation, and archaic/modern drug users who use entheogenic substances in order to gain deeper insights and spiritual experiences. A person who uses altered states for such exploration is known as a psychonaut.\n\nThe term \"psychonautics\" derives from the prior term \"psychonaut\", usually attributed to German author Ernst Jünger who used the term in describing Arthur Heffter in his 1970 essay on his own extensive drug experiences \"Annäherungen: Drogen und Rausch\" (literally: \"Approaches: Drugs and Inebriation\"). In this essay, Jünger draws many parallels between drug experience and physical exploration—for example, the danger of encountering hidden \"reefs.\"\n\nPeter J. Carroll made \"Psychonaut\" the title of a 1982 book on the experimental use of meditation, ritual and drugs in the experimental exploration of consciousness and of psychic phenomena, or \"chaos magic\". The term's first published use in a scholarly context is attributed to ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott, in 2001.\n\nClinical psychiatrist Jan Dirk Blom describes psychonautics as denoting \"the exploration of the psyche by means of techniques such as lucid dreaming, brainwave entrainment, sensory deprivation, and the use of hallucinogenics or entheogens\", and a psychonaut as one who \"seeks to investigate their mind using intentionally induced altered states of consciousness\" for spiritual, scientific, or research purposes.\n\nPsychologist Dr. Elliot Cohen of Leeds Metropolitan University and the UK Institute of Psychosomanautics defines psychonautics as \"the means to study and explore consciousness (including the unconscious) and altered states of consciousness; it rests on the realization that to study consciousness is to transform it.\" He associates it with a long tradition of historical cultures worldwide. Leeds Metropolitan University is currently the only university in the UK to offer a module in Psychonautics.\n\nAmerican Buddhist writer Robert Thurman depicts the Tibetan Buddhist master as a psychonaut, stating that \"Tibetan lamas could be called psychonauts, since they journey across the frontiers of death into the in-between realm.\"\n\nThe aims and methods of psychonautics, when state-altering substances are involved, is commonly distinguished from recreational drug use by research sources. Psychonautics as a means of exploration need not involve drugs, and may take place in a religious context with an established history. Cohen considers psychonautics closer in association to wisdom traditions and other transpersonal and integral movements.\n\nHowever, there is considerable overlap with modern drug use and due to its modern close association with psychedelics and other drugs it is also studied in the context of drug abuse from a perspective of addiction, the drug abuse market and online psychology, and studies into existing and emerging drugs within toxicology.\n\n\nThese may be used in combination; for example, traditions such as shamanism may combine ritual, fasting, and hallucinogenic substances.\n\nOne of the best known psychonautical works is Aldous Huxley's \"The Doors of Perception\". In addition to Ernst Jünger, who coined the term, the American physician, neuroscientist, psychoanalyst, philosopher, writer and inventor John C. Lilly is another well-known psychonaut. Lilly was interested in the nature of consciousness and, amongst other techniques, he used isolation tanks in his research.\n\nPhilosophical- and Science-fiction author Philip K. Dick has also been described as a psychonaut for several of his works such as \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\". Another influential psychonaut is the psychologist and writer Timothy Leary. Leary is known for controversial talks and research on the subject; he wrote several books including \"The Psychedelic Experience\". Another widely known psychonaut is the American philosopher, ethnobotanist, lecturer, and author Terence McKenna. McKenna spoke and wrote about subjects including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, culture, technology, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness.\n\n"}

{"id": "8053331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8053331", "title": "Rudaali", "text": "Rudaali\n\nRudaali is a 1993 Indian Hindi film directed by Kalpana Lajmi, based on the short story written by famous Bengali author Mahasweta Devi. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\nThe film is set in a small village in Rajasthan, India. It tells the story of a woman named Shanichari, who was abandoned by her mother shortly after her father's death. Bad fortune follows her throughout her life.\n\nThe title is a reference to a custom in certain areas of Rajasthan where women of a lower caste are hired as professional mourners upon the death of upper-caste males. These women are referred to as a \"rudaali\" (roo-dah-lee), literally translated as \"female weeper\" or \"weeping woman\". Their job is to publicly express grief of family members who are not permitted to display emotion due to social status.\n\nThe story begins with the dying zamindar/ Thakur (translation: landlord) (Amjad Khan) of the desert village of Barna being shifted from his mansion to an outbuilding. He is performing the rite of \"godaan\" or gifting a cow to a brahman. He realizes that none of his close relatives are likely to mourn him, and thus summons a rudaali named Bhikni (Rakhee) from a nearby town. While waiting for her client to die, Bhikni temporarily lodges with Shanichari (Dimple Kapadia), a widow whose life has been nothing but misfortunate. Born on a Saturday (a bad-luck day, ruled by the planet \"Shanichar\" or Saturn), the ill-omened young girl was blamed by villagers for the untimely death of her father, and then for her own abandonment by her mother, Peewli, who ran off to join a \"nautanki\" folk theatre troupe. The tale of Shanichari’s life, told to the sympathetic Bhikni, unfolds in a series of flashbacks.\n\nShanichari's early marriage to a drunkard named Ganju ends abruptly when her husband succumbs to an outbreak of plague at a village fair. She is left with a son, Budhua (played as an adult by Raghuveer Yadav), whom she adores. She soon realizes that he has inherited her mother's trait of wandering irresponsibly. After the zamindar's son, Lakshman Singh (Raj Babbar) takes a fancy to her, her poverty is relieved somewhat by employment at the master's haveli (mansion). She attends on his spoiled but strictly secluded wife, and periodically converses with her benefactor, who lectures her on social equality and urges her to \"look up\" into his eyes when speaking to him. This romance leads to the master's gift to Shanichari, one night after a singing performance, of her own house and two acres of land.\n\nOne day, Budhua brings home a pregnant young prostitute, Mungri (Sushmita Mukherjee) as his wife. Their marriage is brief, as the quarrelsome Mungri aborts their child. Budhua then runs away from home.\n\nShanichari's painful reminiscences of these trials—throughout which, she says, she has never been able to shed a tear—alternate with scenes in the present, depicting her growing bond with Bhikni.\n\nOn the very night of the old zamindar's long-awaited death, Bhikni is called over to meet Bhimdata from the neighbouring village. As Shanichari bids adieu to Lakshman Singh, who plans to leave the village after his father's death, a messenger comes from Bhimdata. The messenger tells her of Bhikni's untimely death due to the plague, and of how in her dying breath she had asked Shanichari to be informed of how she was actually Peewli, her mother. This unleashes Shanichari's pent-up emotions and transforms her, too, into a rudaali.\n\n\n\nThe film has music by folk musician Bhupen Hazarika.\n\n"}

The absolute measurement of speech intelligibility is a complex science. The STI measures some physical characteristics of a transmission channel (a room, electro-acoustic equipment, telephone line, etc.), and expresses the ability of the channel to carry across the characteristics of a speech signal. STI is a well-established objective measurement predictor of how the characteristics of the transmission channel affect speech intelligibility.\n\nThe influence that a transmission channel has on speech intelligibility is dependent on:\n\nThe STI was introduced by Tammo Houtgast and Herman Steeneken in 1971, and was accepted by Acoustical Society of America in 1980. Steeneken and Houtgast decided to develop the Speech Transmission Index because they were tasked to carry out a very lengthy series of dull speech intelligibility measurements for the Netherlands Armed Forces. Instead, they spent the time developing a much quicker objective method (which was actually the predecessor to the STI).\n\nHoutgast and Steeneken developed the Speech Transmission Index while working at The Netherlands Organisation of Applied Scientific Research TNO. Their team at TNO kept supporting and developing the STI, improving the model and developing hardware and software for measuring the STI, until 2010. In that year, the TNO research group responsible for the STI spun out of TNO and continued its work as a privately owned company named Embedded Acoustics. Embedded Acoustics now continues to support development of the STI, with Herman Steeneken (now formally retired from TNO) still acting as a senior consultant.\n\nIn the early years (until approx. 1985) the use of the STI was largely limited to a relatively small international community of speech researchers. The introduction of the RASTI (\"Room Acoustics STI\") made the STI method available to a larger population of engineers and consultants, especially when Bruel & Kjaer introduced their RASTI measuring device (which was based on the earlier RASTI system developed by Steeneken and Houtgast at TNO). RASTI was designed to be much faster than the original (\"full\") STI, taking less than 30 seconds instead of 15 minutes for a measuring point. However, RASTI was only intended (as the name says) for pure room acoustics, not electro-acoustics. Application of RASTI to transmission chains featuring electro-acoustic components (such as loudspeakers and microphones) became fairly common, and led to complaints about inaccurate results. The use of RASTI was even specified by some application standards (such as CAA specification 15 for aircraft cabin PA systems) for applications featuring electro-acoustics, simply because it was the only feasible method at the time. The inadequacies of RASTI were sometimes simply accepted for lack of a better alternative. TNO did produce and sell instruments for measuring full STI and various other STI derivatives, but these devices were relatively expensive, large and heavy.\n\nAround the year 2000, the need for an alternative to RASTI that could also be applied safely to Public Address (PA) systems had become fully apparent. At TNO, Jan Verhave and Herman Steeneken started work on a new STI method, that would later become known as STIPA (STI for Public Address systems). The first device to include STIPA measurements available for sale to the general public was made by Gold-Line. At this time, STIPA measuring instruments are available from various manufacturers.\n\nRASTI was standardized internationally in 1988, in IEC-60268-16. Since then, IEC-60268-16 was revised three times, the latest revisions (rev.4) appearing in 2011. Each revision included updates of the STI methodology that had become accepted in the STI research community over time, such as the inclusion of redundancy between adjacent octave bands (rev.2), level-dependent auditory masking (rev.3) and various methods for applying the STI to specific populations such as non-natives and the hearing impaired (rev.4). An IEC maintenance team is currently working on rev. 5.\n\nRASTI was declared obsolete by the IEC in June 2011, with the appearance of rev. 4 of IEC-602682-16. At this time, this simplified STI derivative was still stipulated as a standard method in some industries. STIPA is now seen as the successor to RASTI for almost every application.\n\nSTI is a numeric representation measure of communication channel characteristics whose value varies from 0 = bad to 1 = excellent. On this scale, an STI of at least .5 is desirable for most applications.\n\nBarnett (1995, 1999) proposed to use a reference scale, the Common Intelligibility Scale (CIS), based on a mathematical relation with STI (CIS = 1 + log (STI)).\n\nSTI predicts the likelihood of syllables, words and sentences being comprehended. As an example, for native speakers, this likelihood is given by:\nIf non-native speakers, people with speech disorders or hard-of-hearing people are involved, other probabilities hold.\n\nIt is interesting but not astonishing that STI prediction is independent of the language spoken – not astonishing, as the ability of the channel to transport patterns of physical speech is measured.\n\nAnother method is defined for computing a physical measure that is highly correlated with the intelligibility of speech as evaluated by speech perception tests given a group of talkers and listeners. This measure is called the Speech Intelligibility Index, or SII.\n\nThe IEC 60268-16 ed4 2011 Standard defines a qualification scale in order to provide flexibility for different applications. The values of this alpha-scale run from \"U\" to \"A+\".\n\nSTI has gained international acceptance as the quantifier of channel influence on speech intelligibility. The International Electrotechnical Commission Objective rating of speech intelligibility by speech transmission index, as prepared by the TC 100 Technical Committee, defines the international standard.\n\nFurther the following standards have, as part of the requirements to be fulfilled, integrated testing the STI and realisation of a minimal speech transmission index:\n\nSTIPA (Speech Transmission Index for Public Address Systems) is a version of the STI using a simplified method and test signal. Within the STIPA signal, each octave band is modulated simultaneously with two modulation frequencies. The modulation frequencies are spread among the octave bands in a balanced way, making it possible to obtain a reliable STI measurement based on a sparsely sampled Modulation Transfer Function matrix. Although initially designed for Public Address systems (and similar installations, such as Voice Evacuation Systems and Mass Notification Systems), STIPA can also be used for a variety of other applications. The only situation in which RASTI is currently considered inferior to full STI is in the presence of strong echoes.\n\nA single STIPA measurement generally takes between 15 and 25 seconds, combining the speed of RASTI with (nearly) the wide scope of applicability and reliability of full STI. \n\nSince STIPA has become widely available, and given the fact that RASTI has several disadvantages and no benefits over STIPA, RASTI is now considered obsolete.\n\nAlthough the STIPA test signal does not resemble speech to the human ear, in terms of frequency content as well as intensity fluctuations it is a signal with speech-like characteristics.\n\nSpeech can be described as noise that is intensity-modulated by low-frequency signals. The STIPA signal contains such intensity modulations at 14 different modulation frequencies, spread across 7 octave bands. At the receiving end of the communication system, the depth of modulation of the received signal is measured and compared with that of the test signal in each of a number of frequency bands. Reductions in the modulation depth are associated with loss of intelligibility.\n\nAn alternative Impulse response method, also known as the \"indirect method,\" assumes that the channel is linear and requires stricter synchronization of the sound source to the measurement instrument. The main benefit of the indirect method over the direct method (based on modulated test signals) is that the full MTF matrix is measured, covering all relevant modulation frequencies in all octave bands. In very large spaces (such as cathedrals), where echoes are likely to occur, the indirect method is usually preferred over direct method (e.g. using modulated STIPA signals). In general, the indirect method is often the best option when studying speech intelligibility based on \"pure room acoustics,\" when no electro-acoustic components are present within the transmission path.\n\nHowever, the requirement that the channel must be linear implies that the indirect method cannot be used reliably in many real-life applications: whenever the transmission chain features components that might exhibit non-linear behaviour (such as loudspeakers), indirect measurements may yield incorrect results. Also, depending on the type of impulse response measurement that is used, the influence of background noise present during measurements may not be dealt with correctly. This means that the indirect method should only be used with great care when measuring Public Address systems and Voice Evacuation systems. IEC-60268-16 rev. 4 does not disallow the indirect method for such applications, but issues the following words of warning: \"Critical analysis is therefore required of how the impulse response is obtained and potentially influenced by non-linearities in the transmission system, particularly as in practice, system components can be operated at the limits of their performance range.\" In practice, verification of the validity of the linearity assumption is often too complex for everyday use, making the (direct) STIPA method the preferred method whenever loudspeakers are involved.\n\nAlthough many measuring tools based on the indirect method offer STIPA as well as \"full STI\" options, the sparse Modulation Transfer Function matrix inherent to STIPA offers no advantages when using the indirect method. Impulse response based STIPA measurements must not be confused with direct STIPA measurements, as the validity of the result still depends on whether or not the channel is linear.\n\nSTI measuring instruments are (and have been) made by various manufacturers. Below is a list of brands under which STI measuring instruments have been sold, in alphabetical order.\n\n\nThe market for STI measuring solution is still developing, so the above list is subject to change as manufacturers enter or leave the market. The list does not include software producers that produce STI-capable acoustic measuring and simulation software. Mobile apps for STIPA measurements (such as the ones sold by Studio Six Digital and Embedded Acoustics ) are also excluded from the list.\n\n\nJacob, K., McManus, S., Verhave, J.A., and Steeneken, H., (2002) \"Development of an Accurate, Handheld, Simple-to-use Meter for the Prediction of Speech Intelligibility\", Past, Present, and Future of the Speech Transmission Index, International Symposium on STI\n"}

When the church was damaged from fire, it was built again in 1890. Church was made in honor of the Virgin Mary. There have been missionaries in Izmir since 14th century. A climate of tolerance in Izmir has helped the missionaries to find the working place and there was an influx of Catholic and Protestant missionaries in Izmir at those years.\nSo the St. Maria church was maden by the Franciscans who were settled in Izmir first. Today It is used as an Italian Catholic Church and the Franciscan priests are serving. The community of the church is about 200 people. Another point about the church is; it is known as \"Sailor's Church\" because of the location.\n\nThe North, South and east facades of the church is quite simply, but main facade and the interior space have ornate fine work. Antique age architecture was simulated in this church. The first things that we can see in interior space are ceiling with iron construction, ceiling ornates and apse. Building was placed symmetrical and longitudinal east-west direction. It has single-aisled basilica plan. It has signs from renaissance and baroque age. We can see these signs in windows, columns and the material that were used. There are too many corinth column in the church. In the entrance, there are three doors, one of them is main the other doors are side doors. The main door is opened in only ritual days.\n\nWhen we enter the space from outer door, three doors (one main, two side) greet us. These three doors open in main church hall and gloomy ambiance of narthex is decrease with the help of the big volume and double height, thus the sumptuous and spacious interior space greets us. The interior is a rectangular volume that length is longer than wide. First things that we can see inside the depictions of the angels, Virgin Mary, Jesus and extravagant decorations that are maden with fine workmanship. There are six niches whiche are placed both side of the nave. There are figures, paintings and columns in these niches. Mostly corinthian column type was used in the church. This shows that they paid attention to the interior decoration. We feel this divine atmosphere thanks to cross figures, Virgin Mary and Jesus sculptures. The dome which is located above the apse space was painted in blue color . This blue color symbolized sky and glory.\n\nSanta Maria Church's structural system is masonry wall. Facades of the church are plain. East facede (which is main facade) is horizontally divided over two floor and it was terminated with a triangular pediment. The roof type is pitch roof and it was reinforced with the iron-truss construction elements. These iron construction's aim is supporting and they are used as vault. The altar is covered by a dome on an octagonal lantern. The windows are round-arched window. They used gold and marble for create rich view and artistic effect in decorations as density. In additions, there are graphic style frescos on the walls. On the floor, Malta style workmanship was applied. Religious motifs, cross and Angels are at the forefront. Generally light and dark colors were used to create contrast. All wooden elements of the church are dark brown.\n\n"}

Each playset comes with three vehicle service and refueling bays, munitions depot, a prison cell for a G.I. Joe action figure, tower-mounted cannons, and a launch silo for the Firebat interceptor mini-jet. The original playset also included an action figure - A.V.A.C (Air Viper Advanced Class) intended as the pilot of the Firebat aircraft.\n\nThe Firebat fighter jet - minus the action figure - was later made available by Hasbro as a stand alone mail order-only vehicle.\n\nA version of the Cobra Firebat came with an A.V.A.C. as part of the Built to Rule Headquarters Attack in 2004. The forearms and the calves of the A.V.A.C. figure sported places where blocks could be attached.\n\nIn the cartoon series, the Terror Drome is portrayed as the premiere Cobra headquarters. Here, it is much larger in design, and houses more troops, vehicles and equipment. The interior as seen in \"\" reveals it to be a much more complex structure than the toy design, with the inclusion of a throne room and a maze of corridors.\n\nIn the from Marvel Comics, the Terror Drome is a small pre-fab fortress, sold by Cobra to third world countries and developing nations for defense. Cobra personnel are required to run the Terror Dromes, providing ways for Cobra to infiltrate the country. Two Cobra Officers, Dr. Mindbender and the Baroness, would have the chance to reflect that it was not designed to deflect a ground assault.\n\nA Terror Drome located on Cobra Island is the site of many important events in issue #46.\n\nIssue #56 features a battle for control of a Terror Drome located in the fictional country of Sierra Gordo. Despite the efforts of Tomax and Xamot and an explosive trap, the Joes gain possession of the Terror Drome and begin dismantling it. The crew includes Tripwire, Recondo, Roadblock, Flint and Scarlett. Using explosives and a self-made loading device, the pieces were sorted and, according to Cobra spies, loaded on a train. The train was destroyed soon after it left, but it was a decoy, as Flint had sacrificed his uniform to make a dummy pilot. This allows the Joes to remove the technology safely. It was acceptable to the Joes to lose some of the pieces as a majority of a typical Terror Drome are three repeating sections.\n\nThe pieces the Joes retrieve are seen in #57 being analyzed by Mainframe, Flash and Dial-Tone. Clues lead to M.A.R.S., the munitions company controlled by Destro, a Cobra officer long-thought dead. Destro assists a Joe team in retrieving Terror Drome plans held on his property; Major Bludd, impersonating Destro, had been striving to steal the plans for himself.\n\nIn issue #68, the dozens of Terror Dromes littering the countryside of the fictional Frusenland were used to artificially incite the citizens to riot and thus, hopefully increase Cobra's sales of weapons even further. One of the Battleforce 2000 team members discovers that loud music assists in neutralizing the angry feelings and a counter-offensive is now possible. The group then neutralizes all of the Terror Dromes in Frusenland.\n\nIn issue #69, a Terror Drome and its Firebat are destroyed by one of Destro's pilots. All the Cobra soldiers still inside the facility are killed.\n\nThis did not stop the Terror Drome efforts. Later, Clutch and Rock 'n Roll would assist Canadian police officers in intercepting another shipment of Terror Drome pieces.\n\nIn the Dreamwave 2003 \"Transformers G.I.

It is based on the motif of human sacrifice.\n\nThe events described in the poem allegedly occurred at the beginning of the 14th century. Jovan Tomić concluded that this song was created in the region near Skadar (now Shkodër), such as upper Albania, Montenegro, or the southwest part of Herzegovina where the tradition of the Mrnjavčević family was strong. His conclusion was later supported by other scholars. The army led by King Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his son Prince Marko came under Skadar in June 1371, but when they were informed about a large Ottoman army advancing from the east they headed east to prepare for the Battle of Maritsa.\n\nThe same motif is described in poetry composed in some other languages. The version in Serbian is considered as the major South-Slavic version. It is the only version which exists in the form of an epic poem, while versions in Hungarian, Romanian and Bulgarian are ballads. The version of the song in the Serbian language recorded by Vuk Karadžić is the oldest collected version of the legend, and the first one which earned literary fame.\n\nThis song was published for the first time in 1815 in a version recorded by Vuk Karadžić from the singing of a Herzegovinian storyteller named Old Rashko. \nIn 1824, Vuk Karadžić sent a copy of his folksong collection to Jacob Grimm, who was particularly enthralled by \"The Building of Skadar\". Grimm translated it into German, and described it as \"one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times\". Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published the German translation, but did not share Grimm's opinion because he found the poem's spirit \"superstitiously barbaric\".\n\nThe song describes the building of a fortress on the Bojana river at Skadar by the Mrnjavčević brothers (Vukašin, Uglješa and Gojko Mrnjavčević). Gojko had to wall up his young wife alive within the walls of the fortress as a sacrifice demanded by the mountain \"vila\" (nymph in Slavic mythology). According to Vuk Karadžić, there was a belief at this time that it was impossible to build a large building without a human sacrifice. Vuk claims that people even avoided the building sites because they were afraid their shadow could be walled-up and they could die without it.\n\n"}

The magazine took its name from the Chariton River, which flows through northeast Missouri.\n\nIn Fall of 1979 a new class, Local History, was offered as an elective at Kirksville High School under the direction of Mrs. Carol Trowbridge. Instead of standard textbook instruction Mrs. Trowbridge envisioned an interactive learning experience where students would collect oral histories from the people of Adair County and the larger northeast Missouri area. This was inspired by the success of the \"Foxfire\" books and magazines along with an increased interest in local history brought about by the U.S. Bicentennial. In the summer of 1980, realizing that the stories written and interviews conducted during the class year should be preserved and published for the general public to enjoy, Mrs. Trowbridge and student volunteers compiled and edited the first issue of \"The Chariton Collector\", which was released in Fall, 1980.\n\nFrom the first issue the general public greeted \"The Chariton Collector\" with eagerness, all of the initial printing of 1,250 magazines selling out within a few weeks time. A change in leadership took place in Fall, 1982 as Mrs. Mary Grossnickle took over the renamed \"Local and State History\" class from the departing Mrs. Trowbridge. Operated on a non-profit basis, any proceeds from sales of \"Collector\" issues were used to fund the next issues printing as well as purchase supplies needed to fulfill the classes primary mission of recording and cataloging oral histories. Over a ten-year period a total of eighteen issues, comprising over 150 stories were published. Little-known or forgotten tales from the whimsical to the gruesome found their way into the pages of the \"Collector\". A typical issue might include the famous, like author Lester Dent and circus impresario William Preston Hall, or the unknown like local basket weavers and former residents of a coal mining camp.\n\nIn the late 1980s the Kirksville R-III school district was facing substantial budget shortfalls, necessitating cutbacks in various classes, programs, and extracurricular activities. Despite the fact that \"The Chariton Collector\" was largely self-funded, the class responsible for its publication, now named \"Missouri History\", was removed from the elective offerings and the final issue of the \"Collector\" published in Spring, 1989. Thanks to the internet and the work of Ms. Katherine Goodwin, a student at Truman State University, \"The Chariton Collector\" experienced a rebirth of sorts in 2006. All stories and photographs from each of the eighteen issues were scanned and placed online for free use by the general public via the website of Truman State's Pickler Memorial Library. Additionally, Kirksville High School donated interview tapes, transcripts, and photographs associated with \"The Chariton Collector\" to Pickler Libraries' Special Collections department.

Westman and published by University of California Press (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London) in 2011. This book is a broad historical overview of scholarly responses to Copernicus’s \"De revolutionibus\" by the three generations immediately succeeding Copernicus. In other words, the book chronicles the intellectual debates that occurred with each succeeding generation following the publication of Copernicus's book until 1610; when, during this period, prognostication by celestial observation was considered to have practical applications.\n\nAs the book steps through the generations following Copernicus, the variation in application of his work is seen and finally concluding with Galileo's and then Newton's and his contemporaries. One trend is that through each generation, the discourse steps away from viewing astrology as a legitimate discipline. It is Galileo's and Newton's work that eventually distinguishes only astronomy as a mainstream scholarly discipline.\n\nThe book also recounts Copernicus’s unseen plan, which was to fortify the \"science of the stars\", i.e., astrology mixed with astronomy, by buttressing its astronomy, including its computation and measurement foundation, commencing with planetary arrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the intention of this book is to unite disconnected modern studies of this historical subject, while ideally completing the studies produced by Edward Rosen, Noel Swerdlow, Owen Gingerich, Barker and Granada. Likewise, it affords a synopsis of Renaissance period astronomy, with its distinctive emphasis on astrology and the arguments and discourses of that period for astrology’s validity, viewed as a crucial segment of systematic scholarly inquiry into the celestial. Furthermore, scholars during the period looked to Copernicus's \"De revolutionibus\" for improved astrological prognostication. Therefore, astrology actually \"played a central role\" in the wide distribution of Copernicus's final publication.\n\n\n"}

While on the plane, Jerry, because he has to be careful with the package, is forced to put his own bag in the overhead compartment and, in the process, a bottle of barbecue sauce in his bag is broken. Upon his arrival in New York, Jerry reveals to his friends that the bottle was decorated with a picture of a man who looked like Charles Grodin, on whose television show he would be appearing, and that he had planned to present Grodin with the bottle on the show. He also gives George the \"delicate\" package, which turns out to be a welcome mat.\n\nMeanwhile, Frank Costanza turns George's old bedroom into a billiard room — \"The Place to Be\" — and Kramer challenges him to a game of billiards, only to discover that the room is too small to play in (every shot has them bumping against the wall). Elaine has told Frank about a picture the Maestro has of a man in front of a store called \"Costanzas\" in Tuscany; Frank thinks this might be his long lost cousin Carlo and wants to get the picture from the Maestro. While visiting the Maestro in his office, the Maestro shows them an old conductor's trick: he takes off his pants when he sits down so he doesn't lose the crease in the pants before his performance. Later he goes to \"The Place to Be\" to play billiards with Kramer and Frank and shows Frank the picture. After he leaves for the bathroom, he leaves his conductor's baton which Kramer then uses as a pool stick to win the game. During the game, George's mother walks in to find all three men with their pants off, the Maestro conducting to recorded music, Kramer leaning over Frank's back guiding Frank's pool shot, and she exclaims \"Oh my God!\".\n\nAt the Costanza/Ross residence, Susan unpacks her doll collection, including one that looks exactly like George's mother. While Susan denies the resemblance, George struggles with the image of his mother and shows it to Jerry who denies seeing the resemblance, but later tells Elaine that he just wanted to get it out of his apartment. George eats at Monk's with the doll and begins to imagine it talking to him.\n\nSally is coming to New York to visit Susan, so Jerry asks her to bring him the barbecue sauce to replace the one that was broken; he asks her to bring a case in order to inconvenience her like he was when bringing the \"delicate package\" to George. However, when she arrives she brings him a case of a different barbecue sauce, claiming that this sauce is much better, leaving Jerry with nothing still to present on his appearance on Grodin's show.\n\nMeanwhile, Elaine is trying to repair her relationship with the Maestro; while in Tuscany she spilled wine on his autographed picture of \"the other guy\", his favorite of the Three Tenors, and he hasn't called her since. She discovers that he will be appearing on \"The Charles Grodin Show\" with Jerry and decides to accompany Jerry to the show. She gets his autograph but must lug the poster and an Oro-Dent electric toothbrush (in a large box) given to her by Jerry across town. She gets battered and coffee spilled on her but she makes it with the poster undamaged and gives it to the Maestro. He loves it and wants to meet her after his performance, but after he leaves Elaine picks up the Oro-Dent box, knocking over a wine bottle and ruining the autograph yet again. Then at the Maestro's concert, his performance is ruined because his conductor's baton is severely bent after Kramer used it to play pool.\n\nIn the dressing room, with nothing to say on the show, Jerry has an idea: have George bring a picture of Estelle, along with the doll. Unfortunately, the only person at home when he calls is Sally. She agrees to bring the doll, but arrives shortly thereafter with the wrong doll, saying that the one she brought is much funnier. The Third Tenor meanwhile wipes off his mouth of spaghetti sauce with Jerry's pants after he took them off doing the trick he learned from Kramer. Jerry receives his cue to go on stage, with no material and no pants.\n\nLater, Frank stops by George's place to show him the picture he got from the Maestro of the man in Tuscany he believes to be his cousin. When Frank sees the doll, he begins to hear his wife's voice and goes crazy, grabbing it out of Susan's hands and beheading it. George says \"I told you it looked like her.\"\n\nDuring the credits, Frank goes to Tuscany to meet his supposed cousin. However, the man reveals that his name is Giuseppe and that he's not Frank's cousin. Frank simply shrugs and leaves, carrying a present for Carlo in a large box much like Jerry and Elaine carried earlier.\n\nThe working title for this episode was \"The Doormat.\" Originally, the doormat that George receives from Sally was to play a larger part in this episode's plot, but as the script was rewritten, the focus changed to Susan's doll collection, and the episode was renamed accordingly. Guest star Kathy Griffin later performed a stand-up comedy routine alleging that Jerry Seinfeld was rude to her during filming. Seinfeld was so amused by this he had it written into a later episode, The Cartoon, where Griffin would return as Sally Weaver.\n\n"}

It is based on the Seven Keys of Great Teaching and the Phases of Learning. This educational paradigm was popularized through the writing and teaching of Oliver and Rachel DeMille, co-authors of the TJEd resource materials. TJED is the reestablishment of a classical Liberal Arts Education based on the education of the founding American era and other classic periods on history.\n\nIn TJEd, the \"Seven Keys of Great Teaching\" are Classics, not Textbooks; Mentors, not Professors; Inspire, not Require; Structure Time, not Content; Quality, not Conformity; Simplicity, not Complexity; and You, not Them.\n\nTJEd prescribes a distinct approach for students of different developmental ages. These are called \"Phases\", and correspond with the physical/emotional/intellectual readiness for the lessons of each phase. The suggested corresponding ages are a general guide, with exceptions that vary widely. DeMille cites such developmental psychologists as Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky and Erik Erikson in support of their paradigm of \"Phases\".\n\nThe \"Foundational Phases\" of TJEd are as follows:\n\nThe \"Educational Phases\" are as follows:\n\nThe \"Applicational [sic] Phases\" are as follows:\n\nThe books note that while the above timeline is in some respects ideal, it is possible to \"renegotiate\" lost lessons from previous phases, and \"catch up\" to the natural flow of the Phases.\n\nTJEd parents and educators wanting an introduction to teaching through the classics can receive orientation and training to do so by completing The Five Pillar Certification. The Five Pillars of Statesmanship are: Classics, Mentors, Simulations, Field Experience and God. Certification endorses an individual’s knowledge and ability in the Classics/Mentors approach to teaching leaders by incorporating all Five Pillars into an overall system of education. The 5 Pillar Certification program is divided into three levels to facilitate progress. \n\nLevel I is an introduction to the Five Pillars and the Classics/Mentors model of education includes attending a seminar, submitting a form to a facilitator, and reading and discussing the following books: \"The Chosen\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"The Lonesome Gods\", \"Little Britches\", \"Laddie\", \"The Merchant of Venice\", and \"A Thomas Jefferson Education\".\n\nLevel II is a comprehensive study of additional classics. It also requires seminar attendance and a reading and one-page summary for 12 of the following books: \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"What is Seen and What is Not Seen\" from \"Essays on Political Economy\", \"The One Minute Teacher\", \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\", \"Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning\", \"Great Expectations\", \"Alas, Babylon\", \"Multiple Intelligences\", \"The 7 Lesson School Teacher\" from \"Dumbing Us Down\", \"Market-Based Education\", \"How Children Learn\", \"Les Misérables\", \"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers\", \"The Abolition of Man\", \"Understanding the Times\", \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\", \"The Fourth Turning\", \"Walden\", and \"The Virginian\".\n\nLevel III is considered a practical application of the Five Pillars in an educational setting. One must administrate or teach in a public, private or home school or class and apply the 5 Pillar system for a minimum of six months; keep a journal of the entire project and write a project summary when the project is complete; pass an oral board covering the content of the three levels, as well as the practicum; and attend a seminar.\n\n\n"}

Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women. Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in Education, History, English, Humanities and the like to be seen as “feminine” careers and areas of study. Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women’s low participation rates in engineering over time. Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's childhoods that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.\n\nNegative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field. According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.\n\nTwo forms of activism tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a President’s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in teaching, science, and engineering. In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men. Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women’s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.\n\nDespite changing political views towards women and minorities during the civil rights movement, college women’s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's. For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women. This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system. Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the United States. However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.\n\nDespite women’s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, affirmative action and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates. It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue. In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields. Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition.\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men. However, men disproportionately outnumber women in the number of Science and Engineering (STEM) degrees received. Between 1989 and 2008, the approximate percentages of women receiving their Bachelor’s degree in any engineering field were 17% and 19.6%, respectively. The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008.\n\nConcerning minority (African American, Hispanic, Native American) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor’s recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008. The percentages of minority women with engineering doctoral degrees were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. Asian women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women’s.\n\nAccording to the National Society of Professional Engineers in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men. Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were software engineers (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in environmental engineering (9% to 4%) and chemical engineering (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in mechanical engineering (8% to 17%) and electrical engineering (12% to 18%).\n\nIn 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades. According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).\n\nAccording to the ASEE, the top 10 colleges producing women engineers:\n\n\nNumerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men. One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional \"male breadwinner\" household model when it comes to organizing families today. Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary wage earners in households where men were present. Even if this is the case women represent close to 60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. IES: What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?\n\nRecently, greater emphasis has been given to women’s socialization throughout their childhoods and adolescences. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematics are largely promoted as “male professions”. The media has also been criticized for giving little representation of prominent female engineers. Instead, some scholars feel the media is guilty of perpetuating gender stereotypes by representing women in traditionally “female occupations” such as nurses, school teachers, housewives, etc.\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers has suggested that subjects such as Engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests: caring for/interaction with living beings may be one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with Lawrence Summers, that women are incapable, or less fundamentally capable than men at Engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject. The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.\n\nThe presence of role models, and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women’s numbers in engineering. Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves. Additionally, encouragement from teachers, counselors, administrators, etc. are all said to positively impact women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, biology, and chemistry were also said to better women's chances for an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages. Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely discriminated against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial social changes are made.\n\nIt has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, high school and college women tend to have lower confidence levels in their mathematical ability compared to men. Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, longitudinal studies on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level calculus.\n\nGoldman later discovered that positive math assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering. However, other studies have before and since emphasized women’s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a self-fulfilling prophecy. If at all, differences in men’s and women’s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S labor force, there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.\n\nFurther studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's dropout rates later in college. Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult. Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male peers, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under. A phenomenon called \"stereotype threat\" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.\n\nAccording to Hersch, a significant number of corporations have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to political and social pressures. In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique caring and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light manufacturing; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women’s status on the job.\n\nOverall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation. Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and management positions than females, whose promotion prospects are usually more limited. This reason, family and child obligations, and layoffs combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990—a statistic over twice of that of men.\n\nIt has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually \"decreasing\" on the whole. Moreover, they suggest that equal-opportunities legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate human capital are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions. Statistically, gender pay gaps in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men’s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs. Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as “dirty”, “rugged”, or “manly” jobs are gradually being eroded—opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.\n\nHowever, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women’s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with sexist men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called “social identity threat” in women. Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren’t exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-stress environments reported higher levels of confidence and self-fulfillment, discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced. Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.\n\nAs science and engineering have become more pervasive in society, women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase. According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's talent in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed. Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: extracurricular accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and communication skills. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.\n\nResearch has revealed that high school- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a \"chilly, male-dominated\" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs. \"Social coping\" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and stress associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers. Multiple regression analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be \"more\" likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school teachers, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.\n\nAn increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates. surveys collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional gender roles. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized \"nuclear family\" model is crucial. The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950 by Elsie Eaves as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates. SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ. With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.\n\n\nfor women in engineering and technology. Membership currently numbers 38,000.\n\n\n"}
