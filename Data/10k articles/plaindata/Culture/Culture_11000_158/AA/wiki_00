{"id": "30890892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30890892", "title": "Abu Salim prison", "text": "Abu Salim prison\n\nAbu Salim prison () is a maximum security prison in Tripoli, Libya. The prison was notorious during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which Human Rights Watch estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed. \n\nIn 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.\n\nAmnesty International has called for an independent inquiry into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996, an incident which some have referred to as the Abu Salim prison massacre. Human Rights Watch believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a \"site of egregious human rights violations.\" Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: \"I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot...\" The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated \"I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners...\"\n\nLibyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.\n\nJournalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book \"Sandstorm\". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.\n\nThe families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer Fathi Terbil helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations circa 2007.\n\nThe Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, and that some 200 guards were killed too. In January 2011, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators. Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured Mansour Dhao, a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.\n\nWhen the Arab Spring occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer Fathi Terbil was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.\n\nOn 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing National Transitional Council (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison. Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: \"We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre.\" Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing. However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.\n\nBefore the civil war, the lawyer Abdul Hafiz Ghoga took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations. During the uprise Ghoga became speaker of the National Transitional Council, in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.\n\n\nOn 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities blocked access to YouTube after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties.\n\nDuring the Libyan Civil War the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free. Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter Matthew VanDyke from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in Brega in March. An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a \"writer and journalist,\" but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.\n"}

Agritourism has different definitions in different parts of the world, and sometimes refers specifically to farm stays, as in Italy. Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a corn maze, slopping hogs, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a bed and breakfast (B&B) on a farm.\n\nAgritourism is a form of niche tourism that is considered a growth industry in many parts of the world, including Australia, Canada, the United States, and the Philippines. Other terms associated with agritourism are \"agritainment\", \"value added products\", \"farm direct marketing\" and \"sustainable agriculture\".\n\nPeople have become more interested in how their food is produced. They want to meet farmers and processors and talk with them about what goes into food production. For many people who visit farms, especially children, the visit marks the first time they see the source of their food, be it a dairy cow, an ear of corn growing in a field, or an apple they can pick right off a tree.\n\nFarmers and ranchers use this interest to develop traffic at their farm or ranch, and interest in the quality of their products, as well as awareness of their products.\n\nWhile revenue and education are often primary drivers for farmers to diversify and invite guests onto their property, safety isn't always a top priority. Accidents involving tractors, wagon rides, trips, falls, and traffic occur at agritourism operations on a regular basis.\n\nData and specific cases of agrotourism-related injuries are tracked and stored by researchers and scientists. Some of this data is available at publicly accessible sites such as AgInjuryNews.org.\n\nAgrotourism in Latvia is a popular international tourist destination with many farming tours available such as grain, vegetable, fruit, dairy, and livestock. The farms display the lifestyles and work of active farmers, farming processes, farm products, and the opportunities and positive aspects of a life in the countryside. Tourists can learn how food is made from the field to the final product whilst also engaging in harvesting if possible. Some tours focus on traditional local Latvian cuisine such as cottage cheese, buckwheat, seaberry buckthorn, caraway cheese, dark rye bread and cured meats. Brewing beer is also widely popular with plenty of breweries producing a wide array of beer types. In addition, farms are gaining popularity that promote and teaches the way Latvian's traditionally used to live and farm their produce.\n\nThe country-hotel scene has come on apace since 1960, when the Michelin guide to Italy listed not a single establishment in the Chianti area. But even after the boom in rural accommodation in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the choice was still limited, by and large, to basic agroturismo farm-holiday places or rather stuffy country-house hotels. The past few years have seen the arrival of a handful of stylish luxury spa resorts, and some mid-range options where guests benefit from a hands-on, personal approach.\n\nSince 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law, emended in 2006. The law states basic requirements to claim the title of \"agriturismo\", and delegates single regions to further regulate the matter.\n\nItalian agritourism attract visitors from all around the globe. In particular, given the luxury nature of rural tourism, international flows are demand-driven.\n\nSince 2004 Agriculture Tourism is operational, it started in Baramati Agri Tourism Center under the guidance of Pandurang Taware. He received the National Tourism Award from the President Of India, for the most innovative Tourism Product. Agri Tourism India (ATDC) is pioneer in the development and marketing of agri tourism concept in India. ATDC, as of 2014, has 218 affiliated farmers and operates agri tourism center in their respective villages in the state of Maharashtra.\n\nIn the province of Hatay, The village of Vakifli has a small eco and cultural tourism industry, as it is often touted as the last rural village in Turkey where Armenians live. The small village has a guest house where visitors can buy organic products and see the life of the village. There is potential for ecotourism in the Aegean area of Western Turkey as well, and is a growing industry there.\n\n\nAgritourism is widespread in the United States. Agritourists can choose from a wide range of activities that include picking fruits and vegetables, riding horses, tasting honey, learning about wine and cheesemaking, or shopping in farm gift shops and farm stands for local and regional produce or hand-crafted gifts.\n\nAccording to the USDA Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service, \"Tourism is becoming increasingly important to the U.S. economy. A conservative estimate from the Federal Reserve Board in Kansas, based on 2000 data, shows that basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.6 percent of all U.S. employment. Even more telling, data from the Travel Industry Association of America indicate that 1 out of every 18 people in the U.S. has a job directly resulting from travel expenditures\".\nThrough the Small Farm Center at the University of California, \"Agricultural tourism or agritourism, is one alternative for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. Some forms of agritourism enterprises are well developed in California, including fairs and festivals. Other possibilities still offer potential for development\". The UC Small Farm Center has developed a California Agritourism Database that \"provides visitors and potential entrepreneurs with information about existing agritourism locations throughout the state\".\n\nThe publication \"Promoting Tourism in Rural America\" explains the need for planning and marketing a rural community and weighing the pros and cons of tourism. According to the publication, local citizen participation is helpful and should be included in starting any kind of a tourism program. Citizen participation in planning tourism can contribute to building a successful program that enhances the community. Additional websites that promote and publicize agritourism in the United States include Rural Bounty, founded by agritourism consultant Jane Eckert, Farm Stay U.S., a nationwide directory of farm stays, and The Farm Stay Project, a blog that profiles farm stays and tracks agritourism news.\n\nThe Agri-Tourism Development Corporation of Pakistan (ATDCP) is a non-government, not-for-profit organization, aiming to connect people through food, farms and education, working to promote Agritourism idea in Pakistan. ATDCP educates consumers about an organic, healthy life style, raises awareness about food from \"farm to dining table\", and introduces agri-tourism & entertainment farming to explore the beauty of agri fields and farm-fresh feelings.\n\nATDCP also works as a training institute for Agripreneurs, where the latter are trained in consumer organic style needs. ATDCP introduces a new breed of Agripreneurs to the business of agri-tourism & entertainment farming for agricultural students and the farming community. It organises agricultural events, agri-themed festivals, agri-field trips and field activities, agri-field picnic parties for school kids and for the community to explore agritourism ideas in Pakistan.\nTariq Tanveer is the CEO & founder.\n\nIn the county of Cornwall there are many Agritourism attractions including the petting zoo at Land's End, Dairyworld in Newquay and Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm near the capital Truro.\n\nDude (or guest) ranches offer tourists the chance to work on cattle ranches, and sometimes participate in cattle drives.\n\nThe fact sheet, \"Promoting the Farm and Ranch Recreation Business\", gives farmers and ranchers information on marketing and developing strategies to win tourism dollars. Dude ranches are common in the United States and Australian Outback.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 1, 2010. The episode focuses on the release of the new eyePhone, resulting in Fry posting a viral video of Leela on the Internet. Craig Ferguson, host of \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", guest stars as Leela's singing boil, Susan.\n\nThe episode opens with the Planet Express crew recycling their old electronics. Hubert J. Farnsworth announces that they will be delivering all the Earth’s e-waste to the Third World of the Antares system. After dropping them off, they decide it would be better to keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new eyePhone. The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the Twitcher application. Bender and Fry get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.\n\nMeanwhile, Mom reveals to her sons that the eyePhones allow her to direct market to the users, based on what they post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be transmitted as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.\n\nFry decides he needs to have more interesting twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that Leela has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his eyePhone, in spite of his promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including Hermes Conrad, Amy Wong and Pro. Farnsworth.\n\nLeela discovers that her humiliation is old news and that a new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals to her that he posted a video of himself completing the loser’s side of the bet in order to make up for the humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the eyePhone 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.\n\nBender's good twin Flexo makes a brief cameo in one of the recycling bins. The cell phone Amy throws away before getting an eyePhone is the same as in \"Amazon Women in the Mood\". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in \"A Leela of Her Own\".\n\nMost of the episode focuses on parodies of the iPhone and Twitter, renamed the eyePhone and Twitcher respectively. The eyePhone is placed directly in the eye, hence the name \"eye\"Phone. \nFry asks, \"Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?\", to which Bender replies, \"August 6, 1991\", which is the date that Tim Berners-Lee announced the World Wide Web project and software on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. A video clip shot by Fry reveals that Leela has a boil (voiced by Craig Ferguson) named Susan on her right buttock that sings show tunes with a Scottish accent, a reference to singer Susan Boyle. The song that was shown in the episode was \"I Dreamed a Dream\", the same song which Susan Boyle performed in her first audition of \"Britain's Got Talent\" which later brought her world-wide fame.\n\nIn the original American broadcast, \"Attack of the Killer App\" was viewed by an estimated 2.159 million households receiving a 1.3 rating/2% share in the Nielsen ratings and 1.1 rating/4% share in the 18-49 demographic.\n\nRobert Canning of IGN in his review gave the episode an 8.5 calling it \"Great\" and also stated in his review \"\"Attack of the Killer App\" had more than enough great laughs to outweigh this weak bit\", in reference to the Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes. \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying \"This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew.\" He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be \"mean-spirited\" but clever and so \"bizarre that it worked\". Darren Franich of EW Popwatch said the episode was \"as good as anything the show produced in its prime\" particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling \"outdated\". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 7.1. While he found the eyePhone jokes to be clever he refers to the Boil plotline as \"a horrifically stupid joke that dominates and largely ruins the second part of the episode\".\n\n\n"}

In 1998, Dino Ignacio, Wout J Reinders and Jasper Hulshoff Pol accepted the Webby Award and the People's Voice Award for Best Weird Website at the Palace of Fine Arts auditorium in San Francisco.\n\nThe website featured manipulated images of the character consorting with nefarious figures such as Adolf Hitler Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe, and Osama bin Laden, as well as being present at events such as the JFK assassination, and Oklahoma City bombing, humorously offered as \"proof\" that Bert was no mere innocent children's television character. The \"Evil Bert\" phenomenon was picked up by other humorists, who created their own images linking Bert to current and historical atrocities.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, due to the website's immense cult popularity, it became too expensive for Ignacio to continue running. Instead of shutting the site down, he offered to allow anyone who was willing to mirror his original website the opportunity to host it.

{"id": "31778977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31778977", "title": "Big Brother Mouse", "text": "Big Brother Mouse\n\nBig Brother Mouse is a not-for-profit publishing project in Laos.\n\nBig Brother Mouse focuses on publishing books that improve literacy and quality of life; and on making those books accessible, particularly in rural Lao villages. Books are scarce in Laos. Many people have never read anything except old textbooks and government pamphlets.\n\nThe project uses the slogan, “Books that make literacy fun!” Its first books, published in 2006, were easy picture books designed to have a strong appeal for children. Since then, it has expanded to publish books for all ages, “designed not only to make reading fun, but also to share information about the wider world.” A growing number of titles focus on health, nutrition, history, and science.\n\nThe founder, retired book publisher Sasha Alyson, first visited Laos in May, 2003, and discovered that many children in Lao villages had never seen a book. In fact, he himself “never saw a book in Lao. That gave me the idea for a publishing project here, that would both teach publishing skills and create books.” He began exploring the feasibility of such an idea.\nFor three years, Alyson regularly visited Laos from a temporary base in Thailand, exploring the feasibility of such a project. He met with government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), teachers, and students. During that period, Alyson also worked with two Lao college students: Khamla Panyasouk and Siphone Vouthisakdee. Together they developed five easy and entertaining books for children, often using popular books from the west for inspiration about how to make books appealing. These first five books were:\n\n\nThree of the books were illustrated by Ounla Santi, a Vientiane art student who has continued to illustrate many books for the project. Two others were illustrated by Tha Tao and Taeng Thaotueheu, high school students who placed first and second in an art contest that Alyson sponsored in an effort to find promising young illustrators.\n\nPublishers in Laos are required to have a special publishing license, and each book must be registered with and approved by the government. At the end of 2005, Alyson entered into an agreement with Dokked, a Vientiane-based publisher, to act as publisher for these first five books. They came off the press in March 2006, under the Dokked imprint, but also carrying the Big Brother Mouse logo. The next month a sixth book, \"The Big Chicken\", was published in a similar cooperative arrangement with Action with Lao Children, a Vientiane-based NGO.\n\nSoon after that, Sasha agreed with Khamla Panyasouk, author of one of the first books, that they would form a new entity to act as publisher for future books, with Khamla as the owner, and Alyson as the volunteer adviser. In June 2006, Khamla graduated from college, obtained his business license, and then received a publishing license. It was, according to officials, the first publishing license they had ever awarded in Luang Prabang Province, and required extra research for them to learn to how to do it. (It is Lao custom to identify people only by first names, even in formal situations. This article uses that first-name convention for people living in Laos, and last names for people living where that usage is customary.)\n\nAlthough many organizations had expressed interest in purchasing children’s books if they were available, few actually did so. Big Brother Mouse began exploring other ways to get books into distribution. On 29 December 2006, they went to a school in Ban Nunsawat, a rural village on the outskirts of Luang Prabang. Khamla discussed the importance of books, Siphone talked about writing books, and Tha Tao gave an art lesson. This developed into the rural school book parties that later became the primary distribution mechanism for Big Brother Mouse books.\n\nIn its first year, Big Brother Mouse published 30 books, and has continued at approximately that rate. It continues to run book parties in rural schools, and that program has expanded considerably, with 31 of these events in 2007, 196 in 2008, increasing to 510 in 2010.\n\nIn 2008, Big Brother Mouse began experimenting with another way to create book access in rural villages, by setting up small reading rooms in the home of a volunteer. This is still conducted on a smaller scale than the school book parties. At the end of 2010, there were 146 of these reading rooms, largely in the Ngoi district of Luang Prabang province, sponsored by Planet Wheeler Foundation (founded by Lonely Planet publishers Tony and Maureen Wheeler) and Global Development Group of Australia.\n\nThe project aims to continue making books available, through village reading rooms such as these in other regions of Laos. This commitment was one of three that was highlighted at the plenary session of the Clinton Global Initiative, held in Hong Kong in 2008.\n\nTourists also help with distribution. “Give books, not candy,” Khamla encourages visitors who want to take a gift when they go to a rural village.\n\nThe Lao name for the project is “Aai Nuu Noi” which literally translates as “Older brother that is a small rodent.” (Lao uses a single term, “nuu”, for mice, rats, and other rodents, then distinguishes between types by using adjectives such as small, big, wild, etc.) In deciding on an English translation, Alyson originally considered “Brother Mouse” to avoid any confusion with the Big Brother of George Orwell, but finally decided “Big Brother Mouse” was a catchier name, and that most people would understand it was not related to the Orwellian connotations.\n\n\nAll of the paid staff are Lao, and three of them are the owners:\n\n\nAs of the end of 2010, about two thirds of the books published by Big Brother Mouse were primarily intended for children up to age 12, although they are also enjoyed by adults, who have not seen such books before. The following sample list of titles shows the range of books the project has produced:\n\n\nLao law does not have a provision for non-profit organizations of the type that exist in many western countries. Big Brother Mouse operates under a standard Lao business license, but on a not-for-profit basis.

Typical athletic offerings are golf, tennis, and swimming. A country club is most commonly located in city outskirts or suburbs, and is distinguished from an urban athletic club by having substantial grounds for outdoor activities and a major focus on golf.\n\nCountry clubs originated in Scotland and first appeared in the US in the early 1880s. Country clubs had a profound effect on expanding suburbanization and are considered to be the precursor to gated community development.\n\nCountry clubs can be exclusive organizations. In small towns, membership in the country club is often not as exclusive or expensive as in larger cities where there is competition for a limited number of memberships. In addition to the fees, some clubs have additional requirements to join. For example, membership can be limited to those who reside in a particular housing community.\n\nCountry clubs were founded by upper-class elites between 1880 and 1930. By 1907, country clubs were claimed to be “the very essence of American upper-class.” The number of country clubs increased exponentially with industrialization, the rise in incomes, and suburbanization in the 1920s. During the 1920s, country clubs acted as community social centers. When people lost most of their income and net worth during the Great Depression, the number of country clubs decreased drastically for lack of membership funding.\n\nHistorically, many country clubs refused to admit members of minority racial groups as well those of specific faiths, such as Jews and Catholics. In a 1990 landmark ruling at Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club, the PGA refused to hold tournaments at private clubs that practiced racial discrimination. This new regulation led to the admittance of blacks at private clubs. The incident at Shoal Creek is comparable to the 1966 NCAA Basketball Tournament, which led to the end of racial discrimination in college basketball.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s civil rights lawsuits forced clubs to drop exclusionary policies, but \"de facto\" discrimination still occurs in cases until protest or legal remedies are brought to bear.\n\nThe Philadelphia Cricket Club is the oldest country club in the United States devoted to playing games, Country Club Of Salisbury is also one of the oldest country clubs in the U.S.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most exclusive country clubs are simply golf clubs, and play a smaller role in their communities than American country clubs; gentlemen's clubs in Britain—many of which admit women while remaining socially exclusive—fill many roles of the United States' country clubs.\n\n Country clubs exist in multiple forms, including athletic-based clubs and golf clubs. Examples are the Breakfast Point Country Club and Cumberland Grove Country Club in Sydney, the Castle Hill Country Club, the Gold Coast Polo & Country Club, Elanora Country Club, and the Sanctuary Cove's Country Club.\n\nIn Japan, almost all golf clubs are called \"Country Clubs\" by their owners.

Vygotsky observed how higher mental functions developed through social interactions with significant people in a child's life, particularly parents, but also other adults. Through these interactions, a child came to learn the habits of mind of her/his culture, including speech patterns, written language, and other symbolic knowledge through which the child derives meaning and affects a child's construction of his or her knowledge. This key premise of Vygotskian psychology is often referred to as \"cultural mediation\". The specific knowledge gained by a child through these interactions also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as internalization.\n\nThe easiest way to understand mediation is to start with an example and follow with the Vygotskian principles behind it.\n\nAt a North American girl's fourth birthday, she sits at the table with friends and family. As the candles on her birthday cake are lit and it is placed on the table, the child gains a feeling of deeply felt joy. This is not only because she knows the cake is sweet and she likes sweet food, nor that the candles' sparkling is pleasing to her eyes. While these would be sufficient reason to arouse an emotional response in an ape, there are mental processes in a four-year-old that extend well beyond this. She patiently waits as her family and friends sing \"Happy Birthday to You\". The joy is not in the cake itself but in the cake's specific meaning to her. It is a sign that today is a special day for her in which she is the center of attention and that her friends and family are praising her. It's also a sign that she is bigger and as such has higher status among her peers. It's not just a cake, it is a birthday cake and, more specifically, it is her own. The true significance of the birthday cake then, is not in its physical properties at all, but rather in the significance bestowed upon it by the culture the daughter is growing into. This is not restricted to such artifacts as a birthday cake. A classroom, a game of soccer, a fire engine are all first and foremost cultural artifacts from which children derive meaning.\n\nThis example can help us understand Vygotsky's approach to human development. Like animals, we have lower mental functions tied closely to biological processes. In our birthday cake example, a toddler may well have reached out to take a handful of cream from the cake as soon as she saw it and the four-year-old may have been tempted to do the same. In humans, however, lower mental functions facilitate a new line of development qualitatively unique to humans. Vygotsky referred to this as the higher mental functions. The lower mental functions cannot be equated to those of an ape as they are interwoven with the line of higher mental functions and are essential to them.\nHowever, it is this higher line of development that explains the birthday cake example with profound insight.\n\nFrom the perspective of an individual child's development, the higher psychological line of development is one guided by the development of \"tools\" and \"signs\" within the culture. In our example above, the birthday cake is much more than a source of nourishment, it is a sign with much deeper and broader meaning. The sign \"mediates\" between the immediate sensory input and the child's response, and in so doing allows for a moment of reflection and self-regulation that would not otherwise be possible. To the extent that these signs can be used to influence or change our physical or social environment they are tools. Even the birthday cake can be considered as a tool in that the parents use it to establish that their daughter is now older and has a new status in society.\n\nThe cake is a sophisticated example. Tools and signs can be much simpler, such as an infant pointing to an object she desires. At first she may simply be trying to reach the object, but the mother's response of passing the object helps the infant realize that the action of pointing is a tool to change the environment according to her needs. It is from these simple inter-subjective beginnings that the world of meaning in the child mediated by tools and signs, including language, develops.\n\nA fundamental premise of Vygotsky's therefore, is that tools and signs are first and foremost shared between individuals in society and only then can they be internalized by individuals developing in the society as is reflected in this famous quote:\n\n"}

The first series was issued by a Prussian royal commission of celebrity musicians and musicologists in instalments through the music publishers Breitkopf & Härtel in Leipzig, and the second by the Society for the Publication of Monuments of Musical Art in Bavaria.\n\nA parallel series of volumes on Austrian composers, \"Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich\" (Monuments of musical art in Austria), was begun in 1959, and as at 2015-10-25 is in progress at one hundred and fifteen volumes.\n\nReferences to these editions in this article in common with general practice use the acronyms \"DdT\", \"DTB\", and \"DTO\", and to the Münchener Digitalisierungs Zentrum Digitale Bibliothek with \"MDZ\".\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 the First Series was revised and re-issued by the publishers under the editorship of H. J. Moser again in sixty-five volumes.\n\nIn 1962 revision of the Second Series of \"DdT\" (i.e., \"DBT\") was begun. By 1970 three volumes (9, 20, and 22) had been revised. San Francisco Public Library lists volumes 34, and 36, with date 1962.\n\nIn 1967 the publication of a \"neue Folge\" (new series) of \"DdT\" : \"DBT\" with the same musical content was started by the Gesellschaft für Bayerische Musikgeschichte (Society for Bavarian Music History) via Breitkopf & Härtel. The \"DdT\" was dropped and the new series entitled \"Denkmaeler der Tonkunst in Bayern\". The editors decided on volumes of musical scores, and book-format special volumes (\"Sonderbände\"). As at 2015-10-25 twenty-four volumes of musical scores have been published, and two special volumes.

After the resignation of the Chancellor in 1890, the Emperor also presided over the fall of the kingdom. The production of \"DdT\" began in 1892, and continued throughout the First World War until 1931 and nearly the start of the Third Reich (1933-1945): an example perhaps of \"ars longa, vita brevis\". The life of \"DdT\" was largely independent of the fall of Prussia, and its significance was tempered by the changes in Europe after 1918, and after 1945. The re-evaluation of its contents in the period 1959 to 1970 may be an indication either of the lasting value of the works of older composers from a modern perspective, or of a tendency to retain nationalism in music in some degree. The philosophy of \"Musica Britannica\" may hold a similar place in England.\n\nThe value of these editions in drawing attention to music by composers who deserved recognition has been illustrated by Sir Jack Westrup.\n\nBismarck's thoroughness, and efficiency, were thus not limited to the Prussian Army, and the Prussian welfare state, but characteristically extended to the art of music: stepping from the particular of Bismarck's choice to the general of national identity, the expression of national identity became a characteristic throughout the wider continent of Europe during the period 1870 to 1914. For example, national feeling in Czechoslovakia, Russia, and England encouraged the fine art counterparts of folk art that achieved expression in the works of \"inter alia\" Smetana, Dvořák, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Holst, and Vaughan Williams.\n\nWithin this heady prevailing mixture of aspiration, purpose, and achievement, the foreword to the First Series explains the Commission's philosophy. \"Die Werke hervorragender älterer deutscher Tonmeister der Kunst und Kunstwissenschaft von neuem zugänglich zu machen, ist längst als eine Aufgabe unserer Zeit erkannt worden. . . . \"\n\nJohann Christoph Bach (1642-1703) was born in Arnstadt, and died in Eisenach. His compositions are regarded as the most important in the Bach family before Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nGerman words and English translations with musical use in the context of \"DdT\" are given with possible interpretation below. Some words may lead to duplication of meaning.\nThis listing is based upon visual inspection of the digital copies available at the Munich Digitization Centre\n\n\"Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst.

{"id": "332280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332280", "title": "Epaulette", "text": "Epaulette\n\nEpaulette (; also spelled epaulet) is a type of ornamental shoulder piece or decoration used as insignia of rank by armed forces and other organizations. In the French and other armies, epaulettes are also worn by all ranks of elite or ceremonial units when on parade. It may bear rank or other insignia, and should not be confused with a shoulder mark - also called an shoulder board, rank slide, or slip-on - a flat cloth sleeve worn on the shoulder strap of a uniform (although the two terms are often used interchangeably).\n\nEpaulettes are fastened to the shoulder by a shoulder strap or \"passenten\",\na small strap parallel to the shoulder seam, and the button near the collar, or by laces on the underside of the epaulette passing through holes in the shoulder of the coat. Colloquially, any shoulder straps with marks are also called epaulettes. The placement of the epaulette, its color and the length and diameter of its bullion fringe are used to signify the wearer's rank. At the join of the fringe and the shoulderpiece is often a metal piece in the form of a crescent. Although originally worn in the field, epaulettes are now normally limited to dress or ceremonial military uniforms.\n\n\"Épaulette\" is a French word meaning \"little shoulder\" (diminutive of \"épaule\", meaning \"shoulder\").\n\nEpaulettes bear some resemblance to the shoulder pteruges of ancient Roman military costumes. However their direct origin lies in the bunches of ribbons worn on the shoulders of military coats at the end of the 17th century, which were partially decorative and partially intended to prevent shoulder belts from slipping. These ribbons were tied into a knot which left the fringed end free. This established the basic design of the epaulette as it evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nFrom the 18th century on, epaulettes were used in the French and other armies to indicate rank. The rank of an officer could be determined by whether an epaulette was worn on the left shoulder, the right shoulder or on both. Later a \"counter-epaulette\" (with no fringe) was worn on the opposite shoulder of those who wore only a single epaulette. Epaulettes were made in silver or gold for officers, and in cloth of various colors for the enlisted men of various arms. Certain categories of cavalry wore flexible metal epaulettes referred to as shoulder scales, rarely worn on the field.\n\nBy the early 18th century, epaulettes had become the distinguishing feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition for the right to wear epaulettes, to ensure that their status would be recognized. \nDuring the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, grenadiers, light infantry, voltigeurs and other specialist categories of infantry in many European armies wore cloth epaulettes with wool fringes in various colours to distinguish them from ordinary line infantry. \"Flying artillery\" wore \"wings\", similar to an epaulette but with only a bit of fringe on the outside, which matched the shoulder seam. Heavy artillery wore small balls representing ammunition on their shoulders.\"\n\nAn intermediate form in some services, such as the Russian Army, is the shoulder board, which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with bullion fringes.\n\nToday, epaulettes have mostly been replaced by a five-sided flap of cloth called a shoulder board, which is sewn into the shoulder seam and the end buttoned like an epaulette.\n\nFrom the shoulder board was developed the shoulder mark, a flat cloth tube that is worn over the shoulder strap and carries embroidered or pinned-on rank insignia. The advantages of this are the ability to easily change the insignia as occasions warrant.\n\nAirline pilot uniform shirts generally include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by shoulder straps integral to the shirts. The rank of the wearer is designated by the number of stripes: Traditionally four for captain, three for first officer (copilot), two for second officer (flight engineer). However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot). Airline captains' uniform caps usually will have a braid pattern on the bill.\n\nIn the Belgian army, red epaulettes with white fringes are worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the Royal Escort while fully red ones are worn by the Grenadiers. Trumpeters of the Royal Escort are distinguished by all red epaulettes while officers of the two units wear silver or gold respectively.\n\nIn the Canadian Armed Forces, epaulettes are still worn on some Army Full Dress, Patrol Dress, and Mess Dress uniforms. Epaulettes in the form of shoulder boards are worn with the officer's white Naval Service Dress. \n\nAfter the unification of the Forces, and prior to the issue of the Distinct Environmental Uniforms, musicians of the Band Branch wore epaulettes of braided gold cord.\n\nUntil 1914, officers of most French Army infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the bullion fringe falling from the crescent differed according to rank. Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as cuirassiers wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for Chasseurs, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th Century. Other cavalry such as hussars, dragoons and chasseurs à cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder.\nIn the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the ESM Saint-Cyr and the Garde Républicaine. The French Foreign Legion continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The Marine nationale and the Armée de l'Air do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called \"attente\", which original function was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The \"attentes\" are also worn by Army generals on dress uniform.\n\nUntil World War I, officers of the Imperial German Army generally wore silver epaulettes as a distinguishing feature of their full-dress uniforms. For ranks up to and including captain these were \"scale\" epaulettes without fringes, for majors and colonels with fine fringes and for generals with a heavy fringe. The base of the epaulette was of regimental colors. For ordinary duty, dress \"shoulder-cords\" of silver braid intertwined with state colors, were worn.\n\nDuring the period 1919-45, German Army uniforms were known for a four cord braided \"figure-of-eight\" decoration which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a \"shoulder knot\" and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the mess uniform. A similar form of shoulder knot was worn by officers of the British Army in full dress until 1914 and is retained by the Household Cavalry today. Epaulettes of this pattern are used by the Republic of Korea Army's general officers and were widely worn by officers of the armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. The Chilean Army still retains the German style of epaulette in the uniforms of its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment \"Aca Caraya\" of the Paraguayan Army sports both epaulettes and shoulder knots in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing Chaco War uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as shoulder knots) are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the Bolivian Army.\n\nGold epaulettes in Haiti, were frequently worn throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in full dress. During the Haitian Revolution, Gen. Charles Leclerc of the French Army wrote a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte saying, \"We must destroy half of those in the plains and must not leave a single colored person in the colony who has worn an epaulette.”\n\nDuring the Tanzimat period in the Ottoman Empire, western style uniforms and court dresses were adopted. Gold epaulettes were worn in full dress.\n\nBoth the Imperial Russian Army and the Imperial Russian Navy sported different forms of epaulettes for its officers and senior NCOs. Today the current Kremlin Regiment continues the epaulette tradition.\n\n1.

The epaulette was officially incorporated into Swedish uniform regulations in 1792, although foreign recruited regiments had had them earlier. Senior officers were to wear golden crowns to distinguish their rank from lower ranking officers who wore golden stars.\n\nEpaulettes were discontinued on the field uniform in the mid-19th century, switching to rank insignia on the collar of the uniform jacket. Epaulettes were discontinued when they were removed from the general issue dress uniform in the 1930s. They are, however, still worn by the Royal Lifeguards and by military bands when in ceremonial full dress.\n\nEpaulettes first appeared on British uniforms in the second half of the 18th century. The epaulette was officially incorporated into Royal Navy uniform regulations in 1795, although some officers wore them before this date. Under this system, flag officers wore silver stars on their epaulettes to distinguish their ranks. A captain with at least three years seniority had two plain epaulettes, while a junior captain wore one on the right shoulder, and a commander one on the left.\n\nIn 1855, army officers' large, gold-fringed epaulettes were abolished and replaced by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords. These were generally worn with full dress uniforms until 1939. Naval officers retained the historic fringed epaulettes for full dress during this period.\n\nBritish cavalry on active service in the Sudan (1898) and during the Boer War (1899–1902) sometimes wore epaulettes made of chainmail to protect against sword blows landing on the shoulder. The blue \"Number 1 dress\" uniforms of some British cavalry regiments and yeomanry units still retain this feature in ornamental silvered form.\n\nWith the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902, the British Army stopped wearing epaulettes in the field, switching to rank insignia embroidered on the cuffs of the uniform jacket. During World War I, this was found to make officers a target for snipers, so the insignia was frequently moved to the shoulder straps, where it was less conspicuous.\n\nThe current multi terrain pattern (MTP) and the older (DPM) have the insignia formerly used on shoulder straps displayed on a single strap worn vertically in the centre of the chest.\n\nEpaulettes were authorized for the United States Navy in the first official uniform regulations, \"Uniform of the Navy of the United States, 1797\". Captains wore an epaulette on each shoulder, lieutenants wore only one, on the right shoulder. By 1802, lieutenants wore their epaulette on the left shoulder, with lieutenants in command of a vessel wearing them on the right shoulder; after the creation of the rank of master commandants, they wore their epaulettes on the right shoulder similar to lieutenants in command. By 1842, captains wore epaulettes on each shoulder with a star on the straps, master commandant were renamed commander in 1838 and wore the same epaulettes as captains except the straps were plain, and lieutenants wore a single epaulette similar to those of the commander, on the left shoulder. After 1852, captains, commanders, lieutenants, pursers, surgeons, passed assistant and assistant surgeons, masters in the line of promotion and chief engineers wore epaulettes.\n\nEpaulettes were specified for all United States Army officers in 1832; infantry officers wore silver epaulettes, while those of the artillery and other branches wore gold epaulettes, following the French manner. The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.\n\nIn 1851, the epaulettes became universally gold. Both majors and second lieutenants had no specific insignia. A major would have been recognizable as he would have worn the more elaborate epaulette fringes of a senior field officer. The rank insignia was silver for senior officers and gold for the bars of captains and first lieutenants. The reason for the choice of silver eagles over gold ones is thought to be one of economy; there were more cavalry and artillery colonels than infantry so it was cheaper to replace the numerically fewer gold ones.\n\nShoulder straps were adopted to replace epaulettes for field duty in 1836.\n\nLicensed officers of the U.S. Merchant Marine may wear shoulder marks and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a foul anchor above the stripes on their shoulder marks and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller. In the U.S. Merchant Marine, the correct wear of shoulder marks depicting the fouled anchor is with the un-fouled stock of the anchor forward on the wearer.\n\nIn literature, film and political satire, dictators, particularly of unstable Third World nations, are often depicted in military dress with oversized gold epaulettes.\n\nThe eponymous character of \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" along with the rest of the duelists have stylised epaulettes on their uniforms.\n\nThe members of the Teikoku Kageki-dan from \"Sakura Wars\" have epaulettes on their uniforms.\n\n"}

China Central Television host Yang Rui said, controversially, that \"foreign trash\" should be cleaned out of the capital. \n\nRacial discrimination by the ruling Han Chinese in imperial China has been documented in historical texts such as Yan Shigu's commentary on the \"Book of Han\", in which the Wusun people were called \"barbarians who have green eyes and red hair\" and compared to macaques.\n\nSome ethnic conflicts resulted in genocides. During the 350 AD Wei–Jie war, the Han Chinese leader Ran Min massacred non-Chinese Wu Hu in retaliation for abuses of the Chinese population; the Jie people were particularly affected. Rebels slaughtered Arab and Persian merchants in the Yangzhou massacre (760). According to Arab historian Abu Zayd Hasan of Siraf, the rebel Huang Chao's army killed Arab, Jewish, Christian, and Parsi merchants in the Guangzhou massacre when he captured Guang Prefecture. Arabs and Persians living in Quanzhou were massacred in the Ispah rebellion.\n\nWidespread violence against the Manchu people by Han Chinese rebels occurred during the Xinhai Revolution, most notably in Xi'an (where the Manchu quarter's population—20,000—was killed) and Wuhan (where 10,000 Manchus were killed). Manchus were seen as uncivilized and lacking culture, adopting Han Chinese and Tibetan culture instead. According to 20th-century social and cultural critic Lu Xun, \"Throughout the ages, Chinese have had only two ways of looking at foreigners, up to them as superior beings or down on them as wild animals.\"\n\nThe Mongols divided groups into a four-class caste system during the Yuan dynasty. Merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually immigrants or local ethnic groups: Turkestani and Persian Muslims and Christians. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire, such as the Polo family, were welcomed.\n\nDespite the Muslims' high position, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them: restricting halal slaughter and other Islamic practices, such as circumcision (and kosher butchering for Jews). Genghis Khan called Muslims \"slaves\". Muslim generals eventually joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. Ming dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals (including Lan Yu) who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in battle. Semu-caste Muslims revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah rebellion, although the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims massacred by Yuan commander Chen Youding. Uyghur leader Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki said about the Han Chinese and Tungans (Hui Muslims):\n\nAn American telegram reported that Uyghur groups in parts of Xinjiang demanded the expulsion of White Russians and Han Chinese from Xinjiang during the Ili Rebellion. The Uyghurs reportedly said, \"We freed ourselves from the yellow men, now we must destroy the white\". According to the telegram, \"Serious native attacks on people of other races frequent. White Russians in terror of uprising.\"\n\nTensions erupted between Muslim sects, ethnic groups, the Tibetans and Han Chinese during the late 19th century near Qinghai. According to volume eight of the \"Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics\", the Muslim Dungan and Panthay revolts were ignited by racial antagonism and class warfare.\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment primarily stems from Japanese war crimes committed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. History-textbook revisionism in Japan and the denial (or whitewashing) of events such as the Nanking Massacre by the whole Japanese people has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feeling in China. It has been alleged that anti-Japanese sentiment is also partially the result of political manipulation by the Communist Party. According to a BBC report, anti-Japanese demonstrations received tacit approval from Chinese authorities (although Chinese ambassador to Japan Wang Yi said that the Chinese government does not condone such protests).\n\nA Uyghur proverb says, \"Protect religion, Kill the Han and destroy the Hui\" (\"baohu zongjiao, sha Han mie Hui\" 保護宗教，殺漢滅回), and anti-Hui poetry was written by Uyghurs:\n<poem>\nIn Bayanday there is a brick factory,\nit had been built by the Chinese.\nIf the Chinese are killed by soldiers,\nthe Tungans take over the plundering.\n</poem>\n\nA Uyghur would reportedly not enter a Hui mosque, and Hui and Han households were built together in a town; Uyghurs would live farther away. Uyghurs have been known to view Hui Muslims from other provinces of China as hostile and threatening. Mixed Han and Uyghur children are known as \"erzhuanzi\" (二转子); Uyghurs call them \"piryotki\", and shun them.\n\nThe Chinese government and individual Han Chinese citizens have been accused of discrimination against the Uyghur minority. This was a reported cause of the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, which occurred largely along racial lines. A \"People's Daily\" essay referred to the events as \"so-called racial conflict\", and several Western media sources called them \"race riots\". Unofficial Chinese policy reportedly denies passports to Uyghurs until they reach retirement age, especially if they intend to leave the country for the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nTensions between Hui and Uyghurs arose because Qing and Republican Chinese authorities used Hui troops and officials to dominate the Uyghurs and suppress Uyghur revolts. The Uyghur population grew by 1.7 percent in Xinjiang between 1940 and 1982, and the Hui population increased by 4.4 percent. Tensions have increased between Uyghur and Hui Muslims due to the population-growth disparity. The massacre of Uyghurs by Ma Zhongying's Hui troops in the Battle of Kashgar (1934) caused unease as more Hui moved into the region from other parts of China. \n\nSome Hui criticize Uyghur separatism. According to Dru C. Gladney, the Hui \"don't tend to get too involved in international Islamic conflict. They don't want to be branded as radical Muslims.\" Hui and Uyghurs live and worship separately.\n\nHan and Hui intermarry more than Uyghurs and Hui do, despite the latter's shared religion. Some Uyghurs believe that a marriage to a Hui is more likely to end in divorce.\n\nThe Sibe tend to believe negative stereotypes of Uyghurs and identify with the Han. According to David Eimer, one Han person had a negative view of Uyghurs but had a positive opinion of Tajiks in Tashkurgan.\n\nYengisar (يېڭىسار, \"Йеңисар\") is known for the manufacture of Uyghur handcrafted knives—\"yingjisha\" (英吉沙刀 or 英吉沙小刀) in Chinese. Although the wearing of knives by Uyghur men (indicating the wearer's masculinity) is a significant part of Uyghur culture, it is seen as an aggressive gesture by others. The Uyghur word for knife is \"pichaq\" (پىچاق, \"пичақ\"), and the plural is \"pichaqchiliq\" (پىچاقچىلىقى, \"пичақчилиқ\"). Limitations were placed on knife vending due to terrorism and violent assaults where they were utilized. Robberies and assaults committed by groups of Uighurs, including children sold to (or kidnapped by) gangs, have increased tensions. China has been working on multilateral anti-terrorism since the September 11 attacks and, according to the United Nations and the U.S. Department of State, some Uyghur separatist movements have been identified as terrorist groups..\n\nMany residents of the frontier districts of Sichuan and other Tibetan areas in China are of Han-Tibetan ethnicity, and are looked down on by Tibetans. Tibetan Muslims, known as \"Kache\" in Tibetan, have lived peacefully with Tibetan Buddhists for over a thousand years because Buddhists are prohibited by their religion from killing animals but require meat to survive in their mountainous climate. However, Tibetans clash with the Hui (known as \"Kyangsha\" in Tibetan). Tibetans and Mongols refused to allow other ethnic groups (such as the Kazakhs) to participate in a ritual ceremony in Qinghai until Muslim general Ma Bufang reformed the practice.\n\nMost Muslims in Tibet are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai (the Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War), in 1949 the Communists ended violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, recent Tibetan-Muslim violence occurred. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over a bone in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans, attacking Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans burned the apartments and shops of Muslims, and Muslims stopped wearing their traditional headwear and began to pray in secret. Chinese-speaking Hui also have problems with the Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking Kache Muslim minority).\n\nThe main mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans, and Hui Muslims were assaulted by rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars overlook sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. Most Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks positively, and anti-Muslim attitudes resulted in boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses. Some Tibetan Buddhists believe that Muslims cremate their imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, although they frequently oppose proposed Muslim cemeteries. Since the Chinese government supports the Hui Muslims, Tibetans attack the Hui to indicate anti-government sentiment and due to the background of hostility since Ma Bufang's rule; they resent perceived Hui economic domination.\n\nIn 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui troops led by Ma Bufang]] reduced the number of Kazakhs to 135. Over 7,000 Kazakhs fled northern Xinjiang to the Tibetan Qinghai plateau region (via Gansu), causing unrest. Ma Bufang relegated the Kazakhs to pastureland in Qinghai, but the Hui, Tibetans and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash.\n\nIn northern Tibet, Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers before being sent to Ladakh. Tibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs at Chamdo, east of Lhasa, when the Kazakhs entered Tibet. In 1934, 1935 and 1936-1938, an estimated 18,000 Kazakhs entered Gansu and Qinghai. In 2017, the Dalai Lama compared the peacefulness of China's Muslims unfavorably to that of their Indian counterparts.\n\nHostility to foreigners by high-ranking Chinese Muslim officers was sparked by foreign arrogance about Chinese affairs; status and wealth were contributing factors. A Hui soldier from the 36th Division called Swedish explorer Sven Hedin a \"foreign devil\",\nand Tungans were reportedly \"strongly anti-Japanese\". During the 1930s, a White Russian driver for Nazi agent Georg Vasel in Xinjiang was afraid to meet Hui general Ma Zhongying, saying: \"You know how the Tungans hate the Russians.\" Vasel passed the Russian driver off as a German.\n\nA Chinese Muslim general encountered by writer Peter Fleming thought that his visitor was a foreign \"barbarian\" until he learned that Fleming's outlook was Chinese. Fleming saw a Uyghur grovel at the general's feet, and other Uighurs were treated contemptuously by his soldiers. Racial slurs were allegedly used by the Chinese Muslim troops against Uyghurs. Ma Qi's Muslim forces ravaged the Labrang Monastery over an eight-year period.\n\nAccording to historian Frank Dikötter,\nA common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is \"nihilation\", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled \"barbarians\" or \"devils\", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as \"foreign devils\" (\"yangguizi\"), \"devil slaves\" (\"guinu\"), \"barbarian devils\" (\"fangui\"), \"island barbarians\" (\"daoyi\"), \"blue-eyed barbarian slaves\" (\"biyan yinu\"), or \"red-haired barbarians\" (\"hongmaofan\").\n\nChinese orthography provides opportunities to write ethnic insults logographically. Some Chinese characters used to transcribe the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically-pejorative ethnic slurs, where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. For example, the name of the Yao people was transcribed as 猺, a character which also means \"jackal\" and is written with the dog radical 犭. This name for the Yao, developed by 11th-century Song dynasty authors, has been replaced twice in 20th-century language reforms: with the invented character \"yao\" 傜 (with the human radical 亻) and with \"yao\" 瑤 (with the jade radical 玉), which can also mean \"precious jade\". Although the characters have the same pronunciation, they have different radicals (which convey different meanings).\n\n"}

In the recruitment industry, e.g., LinkedIn, expertise finding is the problem of searching for employable candidates with certain required skills set.\n\nIt can be argued that human expertise is more valuable than capital, means of production or intellectual property. Contrary to expertise, all other aspects of capitalism are now relatively generic: access to capital is global, as is access to means of production for many areas of manufacturing. Intellectual property can be similarly licensed. Furthermore, expertise finding is also a key aspect of institutional memory, as without its experts an institution is effectively decapitated. However, finding and \"licensing\" expertise, the key to the effective use of these resources, remain much harder, starting with the very first step: finding expertise that you can trust.\n\nUntil very recently, finding expertise required a mix of individual, social and collaborative practices, a haphazard process at best. Mostly, it involved contacting individuals one trusts and asking them for referrals, while hoping that one's judgment about those individuals is justified and that their answers are thoughtful.\n\nIn the last fifteen years, a class of knowledge management software has emerged to facilitate and improve the quality of expertise finding, termed \"expertise locating systems\". These software range from social networking systems to knowledge bases. Some software, like those in the social networking realm, rely on users to connect each other, thus using social filtering to act as \"recommender systems\".\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are specialized knowledge bases that rely on experts to populate a specialized type of database with their self-determined areas of expertise and contributions, and do not rely on user recommendations. Hybrids that feature expert-populated content in conjunction with user recommendations also exist, and are arguably more valuable for doing so.\n\nStill other expertise knowledge bases rely strictly on external manifestations of expertise, herein termed \"gated objects\", e.g., citation impacts for scientific papers or data mining approaches wherein many of the work products of an expert are collated. Such systems are more likely to be free of user-introduced biases (e.g., ResearchScorecard ), though the use of computational methods can introduce other biases.\n\nThere are also hybrid approaches which use user-generated data (e.g., member profiles), community-based signals (e.g., recommendations and skill endorsements), and personalized signals (e.g., social connection between searcher and results), as at LinkedIn.\n\nExamples of the systems outlined above are listed in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: A classification of expertise location systems\n\nA number of interesting problems follow from the use of expertise finding systems:\n\n\nMeans of classifying and ranking expertise (and therefore experts) become essential if the number of experts returned by a query is greater than a handful. This raises the following social problems associated with such systems:\n\n\nMany types of data sources have been used to infer expertise. They can be broadly categorized based on whether they measure \"raw\" contributions provided by the expert, or whether some sort of filter is applied to these contributions.\n\nUnfiltered data sources that have been used to assess expertise, in no particular ranking order:\n\n\nFiltered data sources, that is, contributions that require approval by third parties (grant committees, referees, patent office, etc.) are particularly valuable for measuring expertise in a way that minimizes biases that follow from popularity or other social factors:\n\n\n\nIn no particular order...\n\n\n"}

New fabrics and techniques were invented, and people created new styles and silhouettes. \n\nIn Paris, Dior launched the \"vertical line\", also known as the sheath dress. Its overall silhouette was long and narrow. Generally, it was made with three pieces: a bodice, skirt and jacket. The bodice was high V-shaped with shirring necklines with long straight sleeves, the skirt was narrow and slim, and the jacket was short and boxy.\n\nThe tiny waistline became a popular style this year. Many designers emphasized the waistline, especially Dior. He hired technicians with new skills to create higher waistlines for his collection. \n\nThe United States' new trends spread all around the world. The \"American Look\" especially appealed to teenagers. \n\nMany designers were focusing on the sleeve. Sleeves were still wide but were becoming softer and smoother than previous styles. Popular styles of this year were tailored tweed dresses, ankle-length evening dresses, and small daytime hats with jewels and fur trimming. Popular colors were charcoal grey, green tones, blue tones, purple, and orchid pink.\n\nThis year was all about changes of waistline, from the high waist to the no waist.\n\nAmong designers, Dior and Balenciaga led fashion trends. Dior presented high-waisted garments with swimsuit-inspired tight shapes from neck to hips, which flared smoothly over the knees. Balenciaga went another direction, with slack-waist dresses and middle length skirts. Balenciaga made the silhouette almost not touch the body. The choices of personal fashion styles represented the freedom of women's lives after World War II ended.\n\nThis year focused on shape and sheen. The waistline became more loose. The half-fitted suit and sheath dress were introduced. Hair lengths and skirt lengths became shorter. The skirt lengths were up to 14 to 15 1/2 inches from the ground. The hair trend called \"the Italian haircut\" is a layered short haircut with curly hair, also known as \"the puddle haircut\". The common silhouette of women's wear had bulky shoulders with wide lapels around the chest. \n\nNecklines were accessorized with jeweled scarves. Accessories were a big trend in 1953, becoming more showy, with some designers even embedding jewels in the heels of shoes. The most common accessory for women was the long cotton, wool, silk or fur shawl; it could work with different occasions and outfits.\n\nThe tiny waist and full skirt lost their dominance in the shape of style. Rather than emphasizing the waist, women started makes their breasts pointy and big. \n\nDesigners created relaxed silhouettes, such as the H-line skirt from Dior. Its shape was straight from the shoulder to the hip. It was more than two inches bigger than Dior's previous silhouette. \n\nThis year, the mood was elegant and the colors were soft and bright. Coats or jackets always came with dresses or other outfits. Among the variety of jacket designs, Ben Zuckerman created the \"skyscraper jacket\", which had a short bosom-length bolero. The pants were shorter and long sweaters were often worn over skirts. \n\nBrown was the most used basic color and popular colors were ivory and green.\n\nClothes became contemporary. The women's style became simple but at the same time had sex appeal, and the flavor was from the 1920s. \n\nThe fashion of this year was strongly influenced by Asian designers, especially from Japan and India. The \"Oriental look\" from Givenchy led the trend. Indian saris and tunic were extremely popular. This year's casual clothes were the most demanded style than previously couture, though still popular. Dressing up desire was at its peak in 1955. Women loved to wear long evening dresses rather than short basic dresses. Evening dresses were made with light wool chiffon or thick wool with gold jewels. The desire to be fancy was reflected in the fabric; manufacturers made wool or tweed with mink, cashmere and angora. Because of the influences from Asian fashion, a variety of tones of red, emerald green, yellow and sapphire blue were popular.\n\nWhile women used to wear comfortable clothes, people were starting to look for more personal and formal clothes, and went back to the classics. The big influence for this movement was American Broadway musicals such as \"My Fair Lady\". The style in the musical was following the previous style of World War I. \n\nSilk, satin and chiffon were popular this year. The Asian style became more powerful with influential elements due to the world becoming more accessible via trading. For the comfortable daytime look, fluffy knit and long-length coats were popular.\n\nGabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel became a big name in 1957. She introduced the legendary two-piece suit which had a boxy fit, open button jacket with blouse inside, pockets decorations, cuffs made with pearls, and H-line skirt. Not only did the suit become the iconic style, but also pullovers fabricated with jerseys and tweeds and lace evening dresses became the most elegant look of women. \n\nThe biggest news in the fashion industry was the death of Christian Dior, and Saint Laurent replaced him. \n\nWomen started to come down from stiletto heels due to the disappearance of the waistline, and hemlines were made higher so that the legs could look longer without heels. The cloche hat with a loose pleated skirt was a popular common fashion in 1957.\n\nThis year saw another change of shape. Due to some people not liking the new loose shape like Balenciaga's \"sack dress\", a new shape came out: the triangle shape called \"trapeze\". People's demand was widening, and one dominant shape was no longer wanted. \n\nCoats were also made with the trapeze shape, which looked like a bell. Coats were presented with more designs of collars and details. Hats and shoes were important in 1958. Luxurious materials were often used, such as fox, lynx and mink. \n\nThe popular young generation's look was a bulky sweater with skinny skirts or pants. Beige was the most used basic color and popular colors were bright yellow, blue, magenta red, and fuchsia pink.\n\nMany designers started to create a new silhouette by manipulating fabrics. The \"sack dress\" was still in existence, but was on its way out in 1959. Necklines became more three-dimensional by folding the fabrics and creating geometric shapes around the shoulders. \n\nChanel was still the most wanted designer. Her comfortable new casual look fascinated people for a long time. Women preferred the formal jacket to be longer and slimmer. Fabrics and details became more luxurious, such as mink, sable, leopard, fox and even tiger. Popular colors were olive green, brown, and black and white contrast.\n\n\n"}

Beginning with the domestication of the horse on the steppes of Eurasia, the horse transformed each society that adopted its use. Notable examples are the Mongols of Mongolia, the Scythian and Turkic nomads of Central Asia, and the Native Americans of the Great Plains after horses were imported from Europe, particularly from Spain, during the 16th century.\n\nHistory offers many examples of horse cultures, such as the Huns and other peoples in Europe and Asia. Horse cultures tend to place a great deal of importance on horses and by their very nature are nomadic and usually hunter-gatherer or nomadic pastoralist societies. For example, the arrival of the horse in the Americas revolutionized the culture of the Plains Indians. The horse increased mobility; the ability of the horse to cover a lot of ground in a very short period of time allowed native people to easily move from place to place, bringing on a nomadic shift in their culture, with an impact on transportation, trade, hunting and warfare.\n\nHowever, there were also disadvantages to adopting horse culture, such as the increased responsibility of caring for the horses and keeping them healthy. Social structures of the community also had to shift to accommodate the physical space for horses to graze and feed easily.\n\n\n"}

At Christmas time, the city of Zagreb and the Christmas tree in the main square in particular are festooned with thousands of licitar hearts.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO added the \"Gingerbread craft from Northern Croatia\" to the \"Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage\" for Croatian culture.\n\nThe tradition of making and giving Licitars stretching as far back as the 16th century. Licitar makers, known as \"Medičari\", were highly regarded in society, and their Licitars very much sought after (licitars were more sentimental than giving a bouquet of roses). Even today the tradition is kept alive by a select few who covert the art in family secrecy, and their methods of production have scarcely changed. One Licitar still takes over a month to make.\n\nLicitars became famous due to their being sold at the Marian shrine of Marija Bistrica (near Zagreb) to which pilgrims visited St Mary of Bistrica for the Assumption or St Margaret's Day. Although not a religious symbol, licitars were often bought to take home as a reminder of their long and sometimes arduous journey to Zagorje. Licitars' simple shape and attractive colour and decorations were a keen souvenir to show their families and neighbours when they came back.\n\n Licitars are made using traditional ingredients, methods and devotion. Their ingredients are simple (honey, flour, eggs, water and natural colours) but their preparation is long. The dough matures for a few days, then is shaped and baked and left for two weeks to dry. Colouring is the next step after which they are left to dry again for two weeks. Once dry the licitars are finally decorated and again left to dry for a week.\n\nTraditionally Licitars are 100% handmade, decorated with a swirling outline, small flowers and a small mirror. Being made of honey dough and natural products Licitars are also edible.\n\nLicitars are referred to as gingerbread, though they do not actually contain ginger.\n\nIn modern times Licitars are traditional Croatian souvenirs (and can be found in all Croatian airports and in many tourist gift shops), Christmas tree decorations, wedding favours for guests, business gifts, many other ornamental purposes, and is still given as a way of showing your affection to the ones you love.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9615516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9615516", "title": "Lithuanization", "text": "Lithuanization\n\nLithuanization (sometimes also called \"Lithuanianization\") is a process of cultural assimilation—either forced or voluntary—adoption of Lithuanian culture or language experienced by non-Lithuanian people or groups of people.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages the consolidation of Baltic lands by the Duchy of Lithuania led to gradual Lithuanization and subsequent assimilation of neighboring Baltic tribes or their parts, including the Selonians, Jotvingians, Nadruvians and Curonians who shared religious, cultural, and linguistic similarities with the Lithuanians.\n\nThe Lithuanian annexation of Ruthenian lands between the 13th and 15th centuries was accompanied by some Lithuanization. A large part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained Ruthenian, since due to a religious, linguistic and cultural dissimilarity there was less assimilation between the ruling nobility of the pagan Lithuanians and the conquered Orthodox Eastern Slavs. Moreover, following the military and diplomatic expansion of the Grand Duchy into the Ruthenian and Russian lands, local leaders retained a significant autonomy that limited the amalgamation of cultures. Even when some localities received the appointed Gediminid leaders, the Lithuanian higher nobility in the Ruthenian lands largely embraced the Slavic customs and Orthodox Christianity and became indistinguishable from a larger Ruthenian nobility resulting in the two cultures merging to the extent that much of the upper class of Ruthenians merged into Lithuanian nobility and began to call themselves Lithuanians \"gente Rutenus natione Lituanus\". (Litviny), yet spoke the Ruthenian language In the effect of the processes, Lithuanian higher nobility became largely Ruthenian, while the nobility in the ethnic Lithuania and Samogitia continued to use their native Lithuanian language. The adapted Old Church Slavonic and later the Ruthenian language, acquired a status of a main chancery language in the local matters and relations with other Orthodox principalities as \"lingua franca\", and Latin was used in relations with the Western Europe. This notion however had been gradually reversed by the Polonization of Lithuania occurring since 15th century and then the Russification of the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nA notable example of Lithuanization was the 19th century replacement of Jews (many of them Lithuanian Jews, but also Polish Jews), until then the largest ethnic group among the burghers in the major towns of Lithuania, with ethnic Lithuanians migrating there from the countryside. As such, the process of Lithuanization was mostly demographic and not institutionalized. It was not until Lithuania became an independent state in the effect of World War I that the government of Lithuania turned it into a more institutionalized process.\n\nIt was also around that time that the re-established Lithuanian state started aiming at cultural and linguistic assimilation of other large groups of non-Lithuanian citizens, mainly Poles and Germans. At first, the Lithuanian government was democratic and protected cultural traditions of different ethnic groups. In 1917, the resolution adopted by Vilnius Conference promised national minorities cultural freedom. After World War I ended, the Council of Lithuania, the legislative branch of the government, was expanded to include Jewish and Belarusian representatives. The first governments of Lithuania included Ministries for Jewish and Belarusian affairs; however after the Vilnius region was detached from Lithuania in a staged rebellion commanded by Lucjan Żeligowski (see Republic of Central Lithuania) the largest communities of Belarusians, Jews, and Poles ended up outside of Lithuania. As a result, the special ministries were closed. In 1920 the Jewish community was granted national and cultural autonomy with the right to legislate binding ordinances; however partly due to internal fights between Hebrew and Yiddish groups, the project was terminated in 1924. Afterwards, the Jews were increasingly marginalized and alienated by the \"Lithuania for Lithuanians\" policy.\n\nAs Lithuania established its independence and nationalistic attitudes strengthened, the state sought to increase the use of Lithuanian language in public life. Among the measures taken by the Lithuanian government was a forced Lithuanization of non-Lithuanian names. The largest minority school network was operated by Jewish community. In 1919 there were 49, in 1923 – 107, in 1928 – 144 Jewish grammar schools. In 1931, in part due to consolidations, the number of schools decreased to 115 and remained stable until 1940.\n\nAt the beginning of 1920 Lithuania had 20 Polish language schools for the Polish minority in Lithuania. The number increased to 30 in 1923, but then fell down to 24 in 1926. The major reason for the decrease was the policy of Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party which transferred students whose parents had \"Lithuania\" as their nationality in the passport to Lithuanian schools. After the party lost control, the number of schools jumped to 91. Soon after the coup d'état in 1926, nationalists came to power led by Antanas Smetona. The nationalists made the decision to forbid attendance of Polish schools by Lithuania. Children from mixed families were also forced to attend Lithuanian schools. Many Poles in Lithuania were signed in as Lithuanians in their passports, and as a result they also were forced to attend Lithuanian schools. The number of Polish schools gradually decreased to 9 in 1940. In 1936 a new law was passed that allowed a student to attend Polish school only if both parents were Poles. The situation resulted in the opening of unsanctioned schools that numbered more than 40 in 1935 and were largely sponsored by \"Pochodnia\" Association. A similar situation developed with regard to German schools in the Klaipėda region.\n\nThe Lithuanian attitudes towards ethnic Poles were in large part an effect of the idea to treat them as supposedly native Lithuanians, who got Polonized over the course of the last centuries and needed to be brought back to their \"true identity\". Another major factor was tense relationship between Lithuania and Poland over the Vilnius region and cultural or educational restrictions on Lithuanians there; for example, in 1927, chairman of \"Rytas,\" Lithuanian minority in Poland counterpart to \"Pochodnia,\" and 15 teachers were temporary arrested and 47 schools closed.\n\nWhile the constitution of the Republic of Lithuania guaranteed equal rights to all confessions, Orthodox believers were discriminated against - the Lithuanian state decided to confiscate Orthodox churches. Some, but not all, of these had previously been converted from Catholic churches. Former Eastern Catholic Churches were confiscated as well, for example the Kruonis Orthodox church. Thirteen Orthodox churches were demolished.\n\nAnother target group for discrimination were the Poles. Anti-Polish attitudes had appeared since the Lithuanian National Revival. While in some respects the Lithuanian nationalist movement was positive, over time it became aggressive and intolerant against Poles and chauvinistic against everything Polish. Such attitudes became common. Nationalistic Lithuanian catholic priests, so-called Litwomans, were pushing Lithuanian language everywhere, instead of the Polish which in many places had been used for centuries in church service. Anti-Polish propaganda was sponsored by the Lithuanian state. During the interbellum lots of caricatures and proclamations were published attacking Poles and showing them as criminals or vagabonds.\n\nIn modern Lithuania, independent since the fall of the Soviet Union, Lithuanization is not an official state policy, but it is advocated by some extremist groups like Vilnija, whose activities cause an occasional tension in Polish-Lithuanian relations. The Lithuanization promoted cooperation of Polish and Russian minorities who support the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania.\n\nThe state forces a Lithuanization of surnames and enforces the removal of Polish or bilingual street signs, including those on private property. A Polish-Lithuanian woman protested when her last name Wardyn was Lithuanized to Vardyn. In 2014 Šalčininkai district municipality administrative director Bolesław Daszkiewicz was fined about 12 500 Euro for failure to execute a court ruling to remove Lithuanian-Polish street signs. Lucyna Kotłowska was fined about 1738 Euro.\n\nBilingual Polish schools in Lithuania striked in September 2015. The strike was organised by Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania.\n\n"}
{"id": "19409033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19409033", "title": "Lot No. 249", "text": "Lot No. 249\n\n\"Lot No. 249\" is a Gothic horror short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, first published in 1892. The story tells of a University of Oxford athlete named Abercrombie Smith who notices a strange series of events surrounding Edward Bellingham, an Egyptology student who owns many ancient Egyptian artifacts, including a mummy. After seeing his mummy disappear and reappear, and two instances of Belligham's enemies getting attacked, Smith concludes that Bellingham is reanimating his mummy. Smith confronts Bellingham, who denies this is the case; the next day, Smith is attacked by the mummy and escapes. Smith then forces Bellingham to destroy his mummy and the associated artifacts at gunpoint.\n\nWritten during a period of great European interest in Egyptian culture known as Egyptomania, Doyle was inspired to write \"Lot No. 249\" by his interests in the supernatural, crime and Egyptology. Though reanimated mummies had previously appeared in English literature, Doyle's story was the first to portray one as dangerous. The story was first published in \"Harper's Magazine\" and has since been widely anthologized. \"Lot No. 249\" has received positive reviews from critics, including praise from authors H. P. Lovecraft and Anne Rice. Critics have compared the story to the writings of Edgar Allan Poe and H. Rider Haggard and interpreted it as containing themes of imperialism and masculinity. \"Lot No. 249\" has been adapted for film and television, and has significantly influenced subsequent media that depicts mummies, as well as other works of horror fiction.\n\nIn 1884, Abercrombie Smith, an athlete and medical student at the University of Oxford, is called to the rooms of his neighbor and fellow student Edward Bellingham. Bellingham, a fanatical Egyptology student who owns many ancient Egyptian artifacts, has fainted from a severe shock. As Smith uses his medical skills to revive Bellingham, Bellingham's friend William Monkhouse Lee (to whose sister Bellingham is engaged) explains that Bellingham has a curious obsession with an Egyptian mummy that he purchased from an auction sale. Bellingham keeps the mummy in his room, and has named it \"Lot 249,\" as those were the words the auctioneers put on its case.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Smith is frequently disturbed by the sound of mumbling and muttering from Bellingham's room. The building's caretaker, Thomas Styles, confides in Smith that he has heard something walking around Bellingham's room while Bellingham is out. Shortly afterwards, a student called Long Norton, against whom Bellingham bears a long-standing grudge, is violently attacked by a mysterious and seemingly inhuman figure. Suspecting Bellingham is connected with the assault, Smith vows to avoid his neighbor entirely.\n\nNot long afterwards, Monkhouse Lee issues a warning to Smith against Bellingham. He explains that he has called off his sister's engagement to Bellingham, after Bellingham confided in him a terrible secret about which he has sworn to keep silent. Later, when passing Bellingham's room, Smith witnesses the mummy seemingly vanish and inexplicably reappear in its sarcophagus.\n\nAfter discovering that Lee has been attacked in a similar manner to Norton, Smith concludes that Bellingham has brought the mummy to life and is sending it to attack people whom he dislikes. Smith confronts Bellingham angrily about the attack on Lee, but Bellingham denies any involvement. The following evening, Smith is pursued by the mummy while strolling along a dark country path. Fleeing in terror, he narrowly escapes the creature. He realizes that his own life is now in danger and he must take action to stop Bellingham's evil. The next day Smith enters Bellingham's room and forces him at gunpoint to burn the mummy and all items associated with its animation. Once everything has been destroyed, Smith vows to return if Bellingham attempts any such activity again. Bellingham quits the university immediately and flees to Sudan.\n\nDuring the nineteenth-century, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign (1798–1801), combined with the translation of the Rosetta Stone, led many Europeans to become fascinated with Egyptian art, architecture, science and religion, a fascination that became known as Egyptomania. Egyptomania caused to mummies becoming an \"enduring theme in Western fiction\". In his \"Horror Literature through History: An Encyclopedia of the Stories that Speak to Our Deepest Fears: Volume 1\", Matt Cardin contextualizes \"Lot No. 249\" as an example of Egyptomania. In the early 1880s, the mummy of Ramses II, widely believed to be the Pharaoh of the Exodus, was discovered, and the British occupied Egypt with their military. These two events sparked a late Victorian era \"fascination with the Egyptian undead,\" popularized by H. Rider Haggard's novel \"Cleopatra\" (1889). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was motivated to write \"Lot No. 249\" due to his interest in the supernatural, crime, and Egyptology. \n\n\"Lot. No. 249\" was not the first work of English literature to include a reanimated mummy; that distinction goes to Jane Webb's \"The Mummy!\" (1827), a science fiction novel heavily influenced by Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" (1818). Other works of literature about mummies that predate \"Lot No. 249\" are \"Some Words with a Mummy\" (1845), a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, and Doyle's own short story \"The Ring of Thoth\" (1890). What separates \"Lot No. 249\" from previous literary depictions of reanimated mummies was that Doyle portrayed its mummy as dangerous. Richard Bleiler writes in \"Mummies around the World: An Encyclopedia of Mummies in History, Religion and Popular Culture\" that Doyle drew from \"contemporary archaeological discoveries in Egypt\" while writing the story, but not from any literary model. However, Rafe McGregor writes that \"Lot No. 249\" has an atmosphere reminiscent of Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), a story which Doyle loved. McGregor also hypothesizes that the comparison of the mummy to an ape in \"Lot No. 249\" could be a direct reference to Poe's story. Matt Cardin, however, views \"Lot No. 249\" as simply using a \"standard\" mystery structure. Roger Luckhurst identifies Doyle's story as a work of Gothic fiction which resurrects earlier Gothic tropes of \"revenge, inheritance, and the consequences of possession\". The story was first published in \"Harper's Magazine\" in September of 1892 and was included in Doyle's medical-themed anthology \"Round the Red Lamp\" (1894).\n\nNear the end of the nineteenth-century, many British people felt that Britain was in decline due to a belief that the world was morally and culturally degenerating even as the British Empire expanded. This fear, captured in Max Nordau's influential book \"Degeneration\" (1895), was aided by the fact that Britain faced economic threats from Europe and the United States. These circumstances led to a sub-genre of Gothic fiction that Emily Adler refers to as the \"Imperial Gothic,\" which is concerned with British fears of being invaded by foreign cultures. Adler cites \"Lot. No. 249\" and Rider Haggard's novels \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1885) and \"\" (1887) as examples of this sub-genre. Deaglán Ó Donghaile, however, sees Doyle's story as a critique of imperialism. In \"Blasted Literature\", he writes that \"The story calls into question to what extent colonialism, with its absorption of the cultures of the colonised, destabilises the perspective of the imperial, metropolitan subject position. While the process of imperial assimilation is symbolised by the private museum Bellingham keeps in his rooms...it seems in the end that it is the mummy and not he who is in control.\" Ó Donghaile further argues that the xenophobic portrayal of Egypt in the story actually represents the contemporary threat of Irish political violence against the British.\n\nRafe McGregor notes that Abercrombie Smith is a stereotypical \"image of a man's man that Doyle admired, and tried to project of himself\" and that many Doyle stories, particularly his works of weird fiction, lack such characters. In \"Masculinity and the New Imperialism: Rewriting Manhood in British Popular Literature 1870–1914\", Bradley Deane writes that the mummy from \"Lot No. 249\" is one of the first fictional mummies to be presented as a \"masculine competitor\". Deane opines that some earlier works of British popular literature, like \"She\", characterized the British as masculine and their enemies as feminine; he feels that Doyle subverted this expectation by making the mummy a \"male, mindless but strong and swift [figure] who threatens to defeat a young Oxford athlete in a terrifying footrace.\" Deane argues that the lack of a masculine/feminine distinction between Smith and the mummy \"suggests a darker fragmentation of identity and an emasculating reversal of the imperial hierarchy.\"\n\nRudyard Kipling said that the short story gave him his first nightmare in years. In his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" (1927), H. P. Lovecraft writes that \"Doyle now and then struck a powerfully spectral note, as in 'The Captain of the \"Pole-Star\"', a tale of arctic ghostliness, and 'Lot No. 249', where the reanimated mummy theme is used with more than ordinary skill.\" Anne Rice called the story \"great\". David Stuart Davies enjoyed the subtlety of Doyle's prose and the tale's \"growing sense of horror and unreality,\" adding that Doyle \"carried on the tradition of the great ghost story writers...by allowing the reader's own imagination to enhance the misty picture painted by the writer.\" Rafe McGregor writes in \"The Conan Doyle Weirdbook\" that \"Lot No. 249\" \"remains a highly entertaining – not to mention spinetingling – weird tale.\" McGregor adds that thanks to \"Lot No. 249\" and his other contributions to the genre, Doyle should be seen as a master of weird fiction. Andrew Barger said that \"Not only does this excellent mummy story need more visibility, this Doyle spinetingler is one of the best horror short stories for the last half of the nineteenth century.\" In a mixed review, Richard Bleiler praises the tale's \"narrative vigor\" and \"brisk\" pace. However, he also feels that it is a minor work of Victorian literature remembered primarily due to its author and subject matter, and is neither Doyle's best work or the best work of fiction involving reanimated mummies.\n\nThe story is a possible influence for the lost short film \"Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb\" (1899). The tale was adapted into a 1967 television production for the BBC program \"Tales of Conan Doyle\", as well as the lead segment from \"\" (1990). The \"Tales from the Darkside\" segment contains slapstick and slasher film elements. It depicts Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) as a student who funds his studies through antique dealing and the mummy (played by Mike Deak, the film's makeup artist) \"as an instrument of social justice, defending the poor-but-able student body against the exploitative, leisured classes, who are corrupting the academic system by plagiarism.\" According to Mark Browning's \"Stephen King on the Big Screen\", the \"mummy horror sub-genre\" was \"largely played out\" by the time the film was made.\n\n\"Lot No. 249\" has been widely anthologized, and its titular mummy has become an icon of horror. Rafe McGregor writes in \"The Conan Doyle Weirdbook\" that \"Lot No. 249\" is \"One of the most significant [stories] in the history of supernatural fiction [for] being the first to depict a reanimated mummy as a sinister, dangerous creature.\" It was also the first work of fiction to feature a modern man reviving a mummy with ancient Egyptian texts as opposed to electricity. Emily Adler notes that Doyle's story predates Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" (1897) and Richard Marsh's \"The Beetle\" (1897) in its portrayal of foreign monsters invading Britain. McGregor identifies the short story as a significant influence on other mummy-related media, such as Stoker's novel \"The Jewel of Seven Stars\" (1903) and the Boris Karloff film \"The Mummy\" (1932), as well as zombie fiction. Bradley Deane feels that the masculinity of Kharis from \"The Mummy\" franchise as played by Lon Chaney Jr. was inspired by Doyle's story, while Matthew Coniam feels that Hammer Film Productions' \"The Mummy\" (1959) draws from the atmosphere of \"Lot No. 249\". Anne Rice cited \"Lot No. 249 and \"The Ring of Thoth\" as inspirations for her novel, \"The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned\" (1989), which she dedicated to Doyle.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12824680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12824680", "title": "Madge Allsop", "text": "Madge Allsop\n\nMadge Allsop (born Marjorie Kiri McWhirter) is a fictitious character invented by satirist Barry Humphries as the long-time companion (and former bridesmaid) of his most popular and enduring character, Dame Edna Everage. First mentioned in Edna's monologues in the 1960s, Madge was subsequently depicted on stage, TV and film, over three decades, by several people. The character was discontinued following the retirement of British actress Emily Perry, who played the role for over 15 years.\n\nWhen Barry Humphries first began to perform as Edna Everage during his one-man shows, the character of Madge Allsop, Edna's bridesmaid and companion, was only ever mentioned in passing and never actually depicted on stage. By the early 1970s, Madge was an increasingly strong presence in Edna's on-stage musings, but still remained unseen. In Barry Humphries' 1971 Australian show, \"A Load of Old Stuffe\", her monologue was entitled \"Edna and Madge Allsop in Stratford\", while a later one, performed in the 1974 show \"At least you can say you have seen it\", was entitled \"Polish up your Kiwi (with Madge Allsop)\". \n\nIn 1976, Humphries decided to finally bring Madge Allsop to life with an appearance in his new BBC TV series, \"The Barry Humphries Show\". She was portrayed by the London-based expatriate Australian actress Madeleine Orr, who appeared as Madge on several subsequent occasions until her death three years later. Over a period of almost thirty years, from 1976 until 2003, the adult Madge Allsop was portrayed by at least six different people: \n\n\nMadge Allsop was first portrayed on television in 1976, when she appeared (played by actress Madeleine Orr) in an episode of the BBC series \"The Barry Humphries Show\". Following Orr's death in 1979, the role of Madge was re-cast. She appeared alongside Dame Edna on the BBC Parkinson show in 1982, with her face covered in bandages. The character was written into Humphries' 1987 film, \"Les Patterson Saves the World\", and was portrayed, as a one-off appearance, by Australian actress Connie Hobbs. Later that same year, Humphries announced his search for \"definitive Madge\", who would appear alongside Edna in his new BBC TV series, \"The Dame Edna Experience\". Of the audition, Humphries recalled, \"all of them tried too hard. Some were whimsical, some camp, but most were far too over the top to resemble an oppressed, inarticulate New Zealand spinster whom life had passed by.\" However, after they saw Emily Perry's understated performance, they knew that they had found the perfect Madge. As she later recalled, \"I did nothing at the audition, and I've done nothing ever since.\" \n\nEmily Perry's appearance on the Dame Edna Experience was well-received; she subsequently became the definitive Madge Allsop, reprising the role in many of Humphries' other TV specials, including \"One more Audience with Dame Edna Everage\" (1988), \"A Night on Mount Edna\" (1990), \"Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch\" (1992), \"Dame Edna's Hollywood\" (1993) and \"Dame Edna's Work Experience\" (1996). Perry's last on-screen appearance as Madge Allsop was a cameo in the TV special \"Dame Edna lives at the Palace\" (2003), in which the then 97-year-old actress was 'caught' in bed with Ozzy Osbourne. \n\nEmily Perry became so strongly identified with the character of Madge Allsop that, after her retirement in 2004, the character of Madge was also retired, as it was felt that no other actress could ever recreate her. When Humphries embarked upon a new TV talk show in 2007, \"The Dame Edna Treatment\", the role of Dame Edna's silent scapegoat was filled by an actress portraying her errant (and hitherto unseen) daughter, Valmai Gittis.\n\nMadge Allsop has been referenced in a number of books written by Barry Humphries since the mid-1970s. Photographs of Madge (as portrayed by Madeleine Orr) appeared in \"Dame Edna's Coffee Table Book\" (1976) and \"The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook\" (1979). Because of Orr's death from cancer that same year, Madge was subsequently portrayed in Humphries' next book, \"Dame Edna's Beside Companion\" (1982), by an unidentified stand-in, whose entire head was concealed by bandages. For the purposes of the narrative, this was explained away by the claim that \"Madge\" had recently undergone cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe character of Madge Allsop figured prominently in the book \"My Gorgeous Life\" (1989), which, although written by Humphries, was purported to be an autobiography of Dame Edna herself. The book provides much background to Madge and Edna's ongoing friendship, and includes a detailed account of the death of Madge's husband, Douglas Allsop, whilst on their honeymoon in Rotorua. In the line drawings that illustrate the book (drawn by John Richardson), the young Madge is depicted as a recognizable caricature of Emily Perry.\n\nSince the 1980s, theatre programmes for Barry Humphries' one-man shows have frequently included photographs of Madge Allsop (as portrayed by Emily Perry) alongside those of Dame Edna and Sir Les Patterson. For example, the glossy souvenir programme for Humphries' Australian tour, \"Dame Edna: Back to my roots and other suckers\" included depictions of Madge in her pink frilly “Edna Loves Me” apron, dancing with Dame Edna while wearing a Vivienne Westwood outfit, shopping with Dame Edna in an exclusive boutique, posing mournfully along Errol Flynn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and being attacked by a giant prop shark in Edna's swimming pool.\n\nMadge Allsop's most notable appearance on stage was as part of the 1998 West End production of \"Dame Edna: the Spectacle\". The First Act of this show was essentially a retelling of Dame Edna's life story in the form of a lavish stage musical, and Madge Allsop was portrayed as a young woman by Kerris Peeling and as a child by either (depending on the performance) Keely Fawcett, Caroline Graham or Gabrielle Hoffman. Emily Perry, by then 90 years old, also appeared briefly as the present-day Madge.\n\nAccording to Dame Edna's autobiography, Madge Allsop was born Marjorie Kiri McWhirter in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Her date of birth has not been confirmed, although the fact that she was reportedly orphaned in 1931 \"at a young age\", as a result of the Napier earthquake, implies that she was born in the mid-1920s (and is, therefore, about the same age as Dame Edna herself). Madge then lived with an aunt until the age of ten, when she moved to Melbourne, Australia. It was while attending Moonee Ponds Girls' Grammar School that she met young Edna Mae Beazley, who took pity on her and became a reluctant friend. It is recorded that the young Madge's cardigan, before it was burnt in the school incinerator, yielded some seeds that took root in the school grounds and produced Australia's first kiwi fruit tree. \n\nIn 1951, when Edna married Norm Everage, she chose Madge as one of her four bridesmaids—Madge caught Edna's bouquet \"on the back of her neck\". When Edna was pregnant with her first child, Madge returned to New Zealand to live with her mother's half-sister, Heather McDonald. In her memoirs, Edna described going down to Melbourne's Station Pier to see her off: “I was naturally very sweet and affectionate to her, since I never expected to see her again”. Some years later, as Edna was planning her first trip to London, she received an invitation to act as Matron of Honour at Madge's wedding to Douglas Hugh Allsop, who ran a tourist bus company in Palmerston North. Edna attended the ceremony in Auckland and, at Madge's request, accompanied the couple on their honeymoon to Rotorua. Douglas Allsop, however, was killed when, while visiting the famous hot mud pools, he leant too far over the railing and fell in. The widowed Madge subsequently returned to Australia with Edna, who \"took full responsibility for the life and well-being of her sadly sticken school friend, even charitably incorporating her into some of her theatrrical and television events\".\n\nThere is considerable evidence that Madge Allsop is a lesbian, or at least bisexual. Dame Edna's son, Kenny, has made this suggestion at least twice; it is noted, for example, in the lyrics to the 1978 song “My Bridesmaid and I”, in which Edna sings, “Kenny thinks that she's bi...”. His claims were re-iterated in Dame Edna's autobiography, \"My Gorgeous Life\", when she recalled Kenny's Coming Out, and, after misunderstanding her response, his assumption that she and Madge were also an item. Kenny's sister, Valmai Gittis, makes a similar claim about their mothers relationship with Madge in an unpublished memoir, \"Edna Dearest\", excerpts of which were reproduced in the 1982 book, \"Dame Edna's Bedside Companion\". A photograph, published in the same source, shows Madge Allsop watching adult videos with titles such as \"Sapphic Traffic\", \"Loins of Lesbos\" and \"Kinky Konvent Kapers\". It is also revealed the Edna and Madge have been known to share a bed, although, by Edna's account, this is entirely platonic.\n\nIn 1982, Madge Allsop underwent what was described as “some radical naso-labial corrective therapy”, which necessitated her entire head being encased with bandages. Towards the end of that decade, she underwent a radical facelift under Dr Christiaan Barnard, which made her resemble Australian actress Anne Charleston. The operation, however, was subsequently reversed.\n"}

{"id": "300489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300489", "title": "Marooning", "text": "Marooning\n\nMarooning is the intentional act of abandoning someone in an uninhabited area, such as a desert island. The word first appears in writing in approximately 1709, and is derived from the term maroon, a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of Spanish \"cimarrón\", meaning a household animal (or slave) who has run \"wild\".\n\nThe practice was a penalty for crewmen, or for captains at the hands of a crew in cases of mutiny. Generally, a marooned man was set on a deserted island, often no more than a sand bar at low tide. He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could commit suicide if he desired. The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but William Greenaway and some men loyal to him survived being marooned, as did pirate captain Edward England.\n\nThe chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century pirates, to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as \"marooners\". The pirate articles of captains Bartholomew Roberts and John Phillips specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one's fellow pirates or other offenses. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be \"made governor of an island\".\n\nDuring the late-18th century in the American South, \"marooning\" took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days (\"Oxford English Dictionary\").\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero island passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of \"Recruit\" marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner \"Adams\" from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. A court-martial later dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.\n\nA Dutch sailor, Leendert Hasenbosch, was marooned on the deserted Ascension Island in 1725 as a punishment for sodomy. He is believed to have died there of thirst later that year. In 1726 his tent and diary were discovered by passing British sailors, and his diary was later translated and published in London.\n\nThe most famous literary reference to marooning probably occurs in Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" in which Ben Gunn is left marooned on the island for three years.\n\nA famous real-life marooning, only partly for punishment, was leaving the sailor Alexander Selkirk on Juan Fernández Island off the coast of Chile, in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the Dampier expedition, was worried about the unseaworthy condition of his ship, the \"Cinque Ports\", and had argued with the captain until he left him ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The \"Cinque Ports\" later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by Woodes Rogers. Selkirk's travails provided the inspiration for Daniel Defoe's novel \"Robinson Crusoe\". Today, one of the islands on the Chilean coast is named Alejandro Selkirk Island and another one Robinson Crusoe Island.\n\nIn 2012, Ed Stafford marooned himself on an uninhabited island off Fiji as an experiment for 60 days. He took with him no food, water, or survival equipment of any kind. What he did take were cameras to film the ordeal for Discovery Channel. Stafford completed the task and documents the psychological repercussions in his book \"Naked and Marooned\".\n\n\n \n"}

Together, these six countries form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (مجلس التعاون الخليجي), established in 1981. The GCC cooperates on issues related to economy and politics, and the subject of migrant workers constitutes a substantial part of the council's collaboration. All of the GCC countries are dependent on migrant labor to bolster and stimulate economic growth and development, as the GCC countries possess an abundance of capital while the domestic labor capacity is low. Although migrant workers in the Persian Gulf region amount to no more than 10% of all migrants worldwide, they constitute a significant part of the populations of their host countries.\n\nGlobally, the GCC countries are situated among the top twenty countries where non-nationals outnumber national citizens. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are among the top ten countries accommodating the largest migrant populations in the world, occupying fourth and fifth place respectively. In Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, the majority of the population comprises foreign laborers and in the latter two countries this number is as high as 80%. Furthermore, 95% of the workers active in the domestic and construction sectors are migrant workers. As of 2013, it was estimated that approximately 18 million legal migrants resided in the GCC region. Over the last few years the number of migrants residing in the GCC has increased considerably. The Gulf Research Center defines non-nationals as individuals having citizenship of a country outside the GCC region. People who are lacking any recognized citizenship are also included in this definition. GCC countries have further been criticized for systemic human rights violations perpetrated against migrant workers living within the borders of the GCC member states.\n\nThe history of migration to the GCC countries can be categorized into three waves.\n\nThe first wave concerns migration to the GCC region prior to the British arrival in the so-called Trucial States, being modern-day Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE, in 1820. The oldest known maritime trading route is the one between the Indus Valley Civilisation and Dilmun in modern-day Bahrain. Traders often stayed in the Persian Gulf region for an extended period of time before returning to their port of origin. During the first wave, migrants mainly came from Asia and settled on the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf. Migration was often the result of trade relations between the Gulf and Asia. Migration was mainly undertaken by people from modern-day Iran and India who traveled to the Gulf. Most trading goods were exported to the Gulf, while only a limited amount of goods was exported in the other direction. Pearls were the exception and the main trading product in places like Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Scholars such as Muhammad Azhar point out the longstanding relationship between Indians and the Persian Gulf, where many stayed for generations and even became citizens.\n\nThe second wave may be defined as the migration which took place after the British arrived in the Persian Gulf region in 1820. The British conflict with the Al Qasimi family, who held control over the Strait of Hormuz, started with the British refusal to pay toll for British ships passing through the Strait. Conflict broke out and the Qawasim fleet was destroyed. Pax Britannica was applied to the whole region, which included a series of treaties imposed on the region's leaders and which further cemented the position of Great Britain as the dominant power in the region. The British took control over the region and created the structures needed for increased trade. The British interest in the Gulf is often explained by the fact that Great Britain wanted to protect the sea route to India from rival colonial powers. The East India Company played an important role in this endeavour. Britain made Abu Dhabi a protectorate in 1820 and established control over Aden in 1839. Thereafter Great Britain gained power over Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. The power of the British in the Gulf region, combined with the structures put in place to promote trade, strengthened the relationship between the Gulf region and India further. This, in turn, advanced migration from India to the Gulf, especially Indian civil servants who would manage the relations between the Gulf and India.\n\nThe third wave took off due to rapid economic growth related to the intensified hydrocarbon exploration in the region. This led to the discovery of large quantities of crude oil. Although oil had already been discovered in GCC region during the beginning of the 20th century, the economic benefits of the oil resources were properly actualised during the 1960s and 1970s, as the GCC countries officially gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971. The author Al Shehabi further argues that a capitalist approach to the economy became increasingly more dominant in the GCC region during this time period. Together with the oil boom, it constituted an important factor explaining the importation of migrant workers and economic development. \n\nThe third wave of migration in the GCC can be attributed to the 1960s but intensified during the 1970s, as the increased wealth of the states led to plans of industrialization and modernization. The implementation of these plans increased labor demands, but the GCC countries and their populations did not possess the manpower or knowledge to meet these demands. The relatively small populations in the GCC countries, as well as limited numbers of female workers and male workers of the appropriate age, combined with a plenitude of foreign workers willing to migrate, constitute important \"pull\" and \"push\" factors which explain the migration growth of the 1970s. While seven of the Trucial States decided to unite and form the United Arab Emirates after gaining independence from the United Kingdom, an initiative taken by Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi and Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai, both Qatar and Bahrain decided to found their own independent states.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, while the inflow of foreign workers remained steady, the demographic composition of these migration flows changed. While the initial part of the third wave mainly brought Arab migrant workers to the Persian Gulf region, their numbers declined during the 1980s and 1990s as they were replaced with Southeast Asian migrants. In comparison, there were approximately 2.000.000 migrant workers in the oil-producing countries, of which 68% were Arab workers, while in 1983 the total number of migrant workers had risen to 5.000.000, of which only 55% were Arab migrants. More specifically, in Saudi Arabia the number of Arab migrant workers decreased from 90% to 32% between 1975 and 1985. This change in composition was caused by a change in attitude towards Arab foreign workers. At first, the shared language, religion and culture were seen as benefits by the GCC states. Nevertheless, the rise of Pan-Arabism in the region heightened authorities' fears of political activism and anti-government activities by Arab migrants. Furthermore, the authorities feared that the often low-educated Arab migrants would corrupt the culture of the Gulf states. Thus Asia, and specifically India, became the obvious solution for the GCC countries, considering the historical ties, the geographical proximity and the abundance of workers willing to migrate to the Gulf region. Although the majority of migrants to the GCC today come from either Asia or other Middle Eastern countries, with India making up the highest number, a high number of North Americans and Europeans also migrate to the GCC region. Especially Kuwait and Oman constitute a target destination for high-skilled workers mainly from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and France. All in all, the third wave has resulted in that more than 50% of the workforce in any of the GCC countries consists of migrant workers. \n\nIn 2015, 51.1% of residents in Bahrain were foreign citizens. The amount of non-nationals peaked in 2010, when they constituted 54% of the population. In that same year, approximately 45.5% of the Bahraini residents were Asian migrants, while non-Bahraini Arabs constituted 4.7% of the total population and 1% of the population was European. As of 2013, 85% of the non-Bahraini residents were from Asian countries and 50% of the Asian migrants were of Indian origin. In 2014, 84.4% of the non-nationals were from Asia, and 49.4% came from India.\n\nIn 2013, approximately 80% of all non-Bahraini nationals held some sort of employment, comprising 77% of the Bahraini workforce. In the private sector, non-nationals constituted up to 81% of the employees. Non-nationals occupy low-level positions in areas such as construction work and domestic household work, while non-Bahraini Arabs tend to hold higher status jobs, such as manager positions.\n\nBahrain differentiates itself from other GCC countries, as in 2013 the majority of Bahraini citizens were employed in the private sector (63%). However, most migrant workers are also employed in the private sector (78.5%). A smaller number (20%) are employed in the domestic sector. Approximately 80% of the non-Bahraini residents are men with a low level of education: 82.5% of non-Bahrainis have not finished secondary education. Non-Bahraini residents mainly work in construction (27.9%), wholesale and retail (16.3%), domestic work (16%) and manufacturing (12.4%).\n\nOf the 2,611,292 non-Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait in 2012, 1,864,139 were employed. The large majority worked in the private sector (63%), in contrast to Kuwaiti citizens who were predominantly active in the public sector. Of the total workforce in the private sector, migrant workers made up 93.4% of the total workforce in the Kuwaiti private sector. Most migrant workers were male (65.3%), and 70% had not completed secondary education. The average migrant worker was 32,8 years old and worked either in private households (29%), wholesale and retail (14.8%), construction work (9.9%) or manufacturing (6.1%).\n\nMost migrant workers in Kuwait were of Asian origin and the largest group consisted of Indian nationals, who constituted 30% of the non-Kuwaiti residents in 2012. Approximately 80% of the foreign residents were active laborers, and made up 83% of the workforce. In the private sector, non-Kuwaitis constituted over 90% of the workforce. Foreign nationals from Arab countries tended to hold higher positions with more responsibility, such as manager positions. Asian migrant workers generally worked in crafts or service sectors. Kuwait had a large proportion of Palestinian migrant workers prior to the First Gulf War. The Palestinians had to leave the country once the war was over, as they were accused of supporting Saddam Hussein. Additionally, the Bedoon ethnic minority have gradually been compelled to leave the country since the middle of the 1980s. The ones who still reside in Kuwait are considered to be stateless.\n\nMigration to Oman has increased rapidly since 2000 due to economic growth, which further has resulted in development of infrastructure. After the economic crisis in 2008 the numbers of migrants continued to increase, consequently diverging from the general trend in other GCC countries where the numbers of migrants were decreasing. In 1993, the population constituted 2,017,643 people, of which 26.5% were foreign residents. In 2015, 44.2% (1,849,412 people) of the total Omani population (4,187,516 people) were non-Omanis. This constituted an upsurge of migrants since the second Omani census in 2003, when foreign residents were estimated to account for about 24% of the total populace. In 2013, the majority of migrant workers came from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (87%). 82% of all migrant workers were employed in the private sector. However, in 2013 the Shura Council of Oman established that the inflow of migrant workers should not surpass 33% of the total populace. Further, the Omani leadership carried out extensive deportations of undocumented migrants in 2010, resulting in the return of approximately 70.000 people to their respective countries of origin. At the time of the deportations, Omani authorities estimated that there were approximately 200,000 undocumented migrants in the country.\n\nMigrants from the Middle East are generally located in occupations representing the higher strata of society, in comparison to the average Asian migrant. There is also a recognizable distinction between Middle Eastern and Asian migrants concerning the phenomenon of family reunification. While the former group often can bring family members with them, the latter group generally do not have this possibility.\n\nQatar's population has increased with 6.2% annually between 1986 and 2013. While Qatari citizens have increasingly less children, the main factor contributing to the population growth is migration. Between 2005 and 2015, the population growth intensified after a period of slower growth and increased with 15.3%. In 2013, the total population was expected to be 2,003,700 people, 85.7% of which were foreign residents. Furthermore, foreign residents made up 94.1% of the workforce in the country and approximately 80% of the migrants were estimated to be male. Qatar also had the second highest GDP per capita in 2013, sustaining the cost of migrants coming to the country. However, the labor camps used for over 50% of all residents in Qatar are also home to many Qataris. As demographic statistical data for nationals and non-nationals are not available separately, it is only possible to present the demographics of the total population.\n\nApproximately 80% of all Qatari citizens are employed within white collar work. Non-Qataris dominate all work sectors in the country, from manager positions to unskilled labor. The large majority of migrant workers are employed in the construction sector. Migrants mainly come to Qatar from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nSaudi Arabia has one of the fastest growing populations in the world. The majority of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia come from South Asia. Although migrants constitute 33% of the total population, they represent 56.5% of the total number of employees and 89% of the employees active in the private sector. While over half of the Saudi citizens worked in the public sector, 99% of the non-Saudi population worked in the private sector. As of 2013, approximately 74% of foreign nationals are male and 62.3% had not finished secondary education. Moreover, approximately 80% of foreign nationals are between the ages of 15 and 64. The most common employment for non-nationals is construction (26.5%), retail and wholesale (22.3%), as well as domestic work (15%). Non-nationals can also be found in the health and education sectors. While the majority of migrant workers are to be found in low income jobs, mostly involving physical labour, the majority of managers and specialists are also of non-Saudi origin.\n\nIn terms of remittances, India, Egypt and Pakistan are the main beneficiaries of national citizens working in Saudi Arabia. The data is incomplete but the Gulf Research Center suggests that these nationalities probably constitute the majority of migrant workers in the country.\n\nThe data provided by the federal and emirate-level statistical bureaus is limited in comparison to the other GCC countries. The number of migrants in the UAE has increased rapidly: between 2007 and 2008 the number increased by 30%. In 2010, non-nationals made up 88.5% of the total population. In the same year, foreign residents further made up 96% of the country's workforce. The majority of non-nationals were from Asia, especially from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The majority of migrant workers could be found in the private sector, where they constituted 99.5% of the workforce. Migrant workers also held 40% of the jobs in the public sector. Employment possibilities in the UAE attracted both high, medium and low-skilled workers and, compared to other GCC countries, migrants generally held higher positions, such as manager-positions.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, the Gulf countries have implemented policies focused on nationalisation of the workforce and limiting the influx of foreign labor - so-called \"Gulfization policies\". These policies were adopted because of the perceived threat that a large number migrants posed, combined with high levels of unemployment of nationals. Over the years, these policies have been adjusted and amended to provide a better fit to the situation at hand. These policies have focused both on the supply of foreign labor and the demand of foreign labour. Examples of the former include increasing the costs of living, for example through indirect taxes, cracking down on migrant workers illegally residing in the GCC countries, and restricting visa and work permit rules and visa trading. Examples of policies limiting the demand for foreign labour include financial incentives for employers to hire nationals, training and schooling of nationals, increasing the costs of hiring migrant workers, excluding migrant workers from certain specific sectors and placing quotas on the employment of nationals and migrant workers.\n\nThese policies have been criticised and their effectiveness has been questioned. With regard to the public sector, the implementation of quotas was argued to present its own problem: the large-scale reliance of nationals on employment in the public sector. Nevertheless, this problem has solved itself in most GCC states, except Kuwait, even though the segment of portion employed in the public sector remains disproportionally high. In the private sector, some employers refuse to comply with the policies and it has been argued that some sectors, for example the construction industry, are not able to function successfully without migrant workers. Additionally, in some states, unemployment rates have remained high for nationals.\n\nThe GCC countries are among the top remittance sending countries in the world. In 2013, 23% of all remittances globally were sent from the GCC region. The total official value was estimated to be approximately 90 billion USD. In 2016, Saudi Arabia was second on the list of remittance sending countries and other GCC member states were also among the top countries concerning outflows of remittances. The estimated value of remittances sent from Saudi Arabia annually is expected to be around 16 billion USD. India, Egypt and Pakistan are the main beneficiaries of national citizens working in Saudi Arabia. The data is incomplete, but the Gulf Research Center suggests that these nationalities probably constitute the majority of migrant workers in the country. It is further estimated that outflows of remittances through informal channels are a common phenomenon.\n\nGroups of migrant workers are composed of a variety of nationalities, but are generally united by the fact that the large majority send money to family members and relatives in their respective countries of origin. Migrants in the GCC countries are generally denied the right to own property and bring family members with them to the country of employment. These factors generally contribute to migrants' intentions not to stay in the country of employment for the entirety of their life. Contrary, most migrants have the intent to return to their respective countries of origin. However, the work conducted by migrants in the GCC constitutes an important section of the economy in the country of origin, as money is sent home to family members and relatives. India receives approximately half of all remittances from Indian migrants in the GCC countries and further constitutes the country sending most migrants to the region.\n\nSeveral state leaders in the GCC regard remittances as an economical “leakage”, as economic capital is leaving the country. Due to the value of remittances, GCC countries have recently started to discuss remittance taxes as a strategy to counterbalance budget deficits. The International Monetary Fund recently warned the GCC to be ready for profit decrease, as oil prices might go down. Consequently, tax extraction from migrants may be used to compensate for future economic predicaments. Saudi Arabia, the largest country among the GCC countries, currently has a budget deficit of 38,6 billion USD. Oman is especially sensitive to declining oil prices and economic change, as about 70% of the economy is dependent on natural resources. A leading representative of the Consultative Assembly of Oman (Majlis al-Shura) has expressed the essentiality to “tighten our belts and prepare together for the coming challenges. The honeymoon is over!” However, according to financial experts, it is doubtful whether taxation of remittances will lead to any economic betterment. While leaders in the GCC might moderate the economic situation in the short-run, the long-term consequences of remittance taxation are far from certain.\n\nAlthough the six countries are all members of the International Labour Organization, none of these countries are members of the International Organization for Migration – even though Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are observer states. Furthermore, none of the six states have signed the most important conventions on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, namely the 1949 Migration for Employment Convention, the 1975 Migrant Workers Convention (Supplementary Provisions), and the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Of the so-called eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, Bahrain has ratified five conventions, Kuwait has ratified seven conventions , Oman has ratified four conventions , Qatar has ratified five conventions, Saudi Arabia has ratified six conventions and the UAE have also ratified six conventions. All have ratified the 1930 Forced Labour Convention, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention.\n\nAn important concept which regulates migrant labor in the GCC countries is the kafala system, a sponsorship system which provides the legal basis for both residency and employment of migrant workers in the GCC countries. It relies on a citizen or organization, the kafeel (sponsor) within one of the GCC countries employing migrant workers, which is the only manner in which the migrant worker can receive an entry visa, residence permit and work permit. Furthermore, under the kafala system, the sponsor takes on both legal and economic responsibility for the migrant worker. This system binds the migrant worker to the employer, as the migrant is allowed only to work for the kafeel and only for the duration of the contract. The kafala system remains an important part of the laws regulating migrant workers in all of the Gulf states, even though many of these laws have been amended in the Gulf states in the past 15 years.\n\nSince its creation in 2006 the Bahraini Labour Market Regulation Authority (LMRA) is tasked, not only with the regulation of, inter alia, employment transfers, recruitment agencies and work visas, but also with informing migrant workers of their rights and obligations. Furthermore, the existing legal regime regarding labor is applicable to both national and foreign workers.The protections offered by Bahrain's criminal law to workers applies to migrant workers as well.\n\nIn 2009, Bahrain announced that it would end the kafala system, citing human rights concerns linked to both human trafficking and sexual slavery. The Labour Market Regulatory Law was amended, making the LMRA the official sponsor of migrant workers and, most importantly, allowing migrant workers to leave their employer without the latter's consent. In December 2016, the Bahraini government announced the official and total abolition of the sponsorship system once more.\n\nOther legislative initiatives to protect labor rights in Bahrain include a 2012 private sector labor law, focusing inter alia on the number of sick days, annual leave, compensation for unfair dismissals, fines for labor law violations and the streamlining of labor disputes. A 2008 human trafficking law was presented by the Bahraini government as covering many common labor law violations, for example the withholding of wages. Furthermore, in late 2016 Bahrain was considering to allow the issuance of flexible work permits for undocumented workers, providing them with the ability to work for more than one employer even without legal visa.\n\nThe main legal source for the kafala system in Kuwait is the 1959 Aliens’ Residence Law and its implementing regulations. This law not only provided that all foreign workers should have a local sponsor, but also that the responsibility of monitoring the foreign workers lies with the sponsor. Furthermore, migrant workers were also covered the 1964 Law concerning Labour in the Private Sector, the sector in which most foreign workers are active. The legal system regulating foreign workers has been changing since the early 2000s. For example, in 2007, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs implemented a decree which prohibited employers from taking their employees’ passports. In 2009, another decree was issued, which allowed migrant workers to change employers without the employer's consent. However, this would only be a possibility after the initial employment contract was completed, or after the worker had been employed for three consecutive years.\n\nIn 2010, the Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labor announced that it would abolish the kafala system, requesting the assistance of the ILO on policy issues related to migrant workers. New labor laws were implemented in 2010 One major change was the creation of an agency, the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM), which has the sole responsibility for the importation and employment of foreign workers. The agency also works to prevent the practice of visa trading, in which sponsors or local agencies would charge potential migrant workers large sums for work visas in exchange for employment, without providing the migrant with actual employment. Additionally, the new labor laws placed limits on daily working hours, while also providing for end-of-service payments, paid maternity leave and access to labor dispute settlement mechanisms. The 2010 laws also incorporated the 2009 ministerial decree regarding the possibility to change employers into actual law, while maintaining the requirements of the 2009 decree. However, the new laws did not set a minimum wage requirements, did not allow for the creation of labor unions and did not cover domestic workers.\n\nIn 2015, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs of Kuwait approved a standardized labor contract for foreign workers in the private sector, issued by the PAM, which specifies end-of-contract compensation, holidays and leaves. The standardized contract allows for additional articles to be added as long as these extra articles comply with Kuwait's labor laws. Furthermore, the government distributed copies of this standardized contract among embassies for translation. In the same year, the government adopted new labor laws which extended labor rights to domestic workers and in 2016 the government set a minimum wage for domestic work.\n\nIn Oman, the kafala system is regulated by the foreign residency law and accompanying laws, while the system is enforced by the Ministry of Manpower and the Royal Oman Police. According to Oman's 2003 Labour Law, an employer needs a permit issued by the Ministry of Manpower in order to import foreign workers. Furthermore, migrant workers are prohibited from working for another employer. The Labour Law places responsibility for the migrant worker on the employer. The 2003 Law also sets conditions for the labor contract, as well as the rights and obligations of both employers and migrant workers, including the provision of medical facilities, suitable means of transport and a minimum wage by the Council of Ministers. In addition, if a migrant worker wishes to change employers, the employee needs to receive a No Objection Certificate from the employer.\n\nIn 2011, Oman reportedly informed the United Nations Human Rights Council that alternatives to the kafala system were being considered. However, the sponsorship system still remains in place today. Legislative amendments to the Omani labor laws were under consideration in late 2016.The Ministry of Manpower also announced in 2016 the abolition of the obligatory No Objection Certificate.\n\nIn Qatar before 2009, the entry, residence and employment of foreigners was regulated by different consecutive laws, dating back to 1963. In 2009 these laws were merged into one so-called “sponsorship law”, the Law No. 4 Regulating the Entry, Exit, Residence & Sponsorship of Foreigners. Both the 2009 Sponsorship Law and the laws that preceded the Sponsorship Law were codifications of the kafala system. The 2009 law provided that migrant workers could only receive residence permits without sponsorship in very limited circumstances, that migrant workers are only allowed to work for the employer which sponsored them and that sponsorships can only be transferred by the Minister of Interior in case of labor disputes or when abuse of the employee could be proven. The law additionally required employers to provide employees with exit permits if they wished to leave Qatar either temporarily or permanently, but also forced employers to return passports to employees once the residency procedure is completed.\n\nIn May 2014, Qatar announced its intentions to reform the labor laws and to abolish the kafala system. A new law, titled Law No. 21 on the Entry, Exit and Residency of Foreign Nationals replacing the 2009 Sponsorship Law, was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in December 2016. The aim of the new law was enhancing the rights and protection of migrant workers, although the law has been criticized for insufficiently enhancing migrant worker protection. According to Amnesty International, the new law still requires migrant workers to obtain their employer's permission to change employment or to leave Qatar. Furthermore, even after completion of the labor contract, the migrant worker wishing to find employment elsewhere in Qatar will need permission from “the competent authority”, as well as from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, without the law specifying who is meant by the competent authority.The law also prohibits migrant workers from establishing labor unions or organizing strikes. Additionally, in 2015, the Qatari government announced its plan to set up an electronic contract system, in which workers can find their labor contract which would be available in ten different languages.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the kafala system is enshrined in the 1969 Labor Law. The 1969 law required every migrant worker to have signed a contract with an employer, placing them directly under the responsibility of the sponsor. The employers were required to subsequently request the Saudi government to grant work permits for these migrant workers. Work permits were granted upon arrival of the migrant workers, but only if they could show their employment contracts signed by both themselves and the sponsor.\n\nThe 2005 Labour Law constituted a revision of the 1969 Labor Law, but contained many of the kafala elements found in the old 1969 Labor Law. The Ministry of Labor held the responsibility for work and residence permits. Migrant workers could only receive work permits after signing a contract with an employer and being under the responsibility of the employer. Migrant workers were not allowed to work for other employers, nor were employers permitted to employ migrant workers belonging to other employers. The labor contract had to state the duration of the employment.\n\nThe 2005 Labour Law was amended in 2013, which provided Saudi police and labor authorities with the power to enforce the provisions of the Labor Law against undocumented laborers. Punishments included both detention and deportation. The 2005 Labour Law was again amended in 2015, introducing more extensive labor protections. First of all, the amendments criminalized a series of abuse labor practices. Secondly, the amendments increase paid leave and job-related injury compensation and oblige employers, when terminating a worker's contract, to provide the worker with a week's payment so other employment can be found. Thirdly, the amendments enhance the powers of inspection and enforcement of the Ministry of Labor.\n\nAdditionally, amendments included the introduction fines for labor rights violations, including the confiscations of passports, excessive working hours, dangerous working conditions, absent labor contracts, delayed salary payments and false reports of unauthorized leave. Fines, as well as prison sentences, were also introduced for migrant workers who stayed in Saudi Arabia beyond the length of their residency permit and for leaving without the employer's permission.\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the kafala system was part of the 1980 Federal Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations, which regulated the relationship between the state, the sponsor and the sponsored.The law did not require any written contract to be drawn up between the employer and the migrant worker. Migrant workers required the permission of their employers to change employment and the provided sponsorship could not be transferred to another employer. The 1980 Law did regulate issues such as severance pay, repatriation pay, annual leave, standards for maximum working hours and working conditions, payment for overtime and the payment for treatment of labor-related injuries. However, the law also prohibited labor unions and strikes.\nLabor law reforms were introduced in the UAE in 2016, which included a standardized offer letter prepared by the UAE's Ministry of Labor, a standardized work contract which must specify duration, nature of the work, place of employment, wages and remuneration. The changes also specify working hours as 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. However, these working hours could be higher for those working in the service industry. Furthermore, migrant workers are allowed to change employers after six months and only if their employer consents, or if employment is not provided or if a legal complaint of some sort is issued. Both parties can agree to end the employment contract after six months. According to the reforms, contracts must be made available in both Arabic, English and a third language if required. Employers who fail to provide translations are subjected to fines.\n\nWith regards to the rights and protections granted to migrant workers, the following rights are granted to migrant workers by all GCC countries:\n\nHowever, the following rights are not granted to migrant workers by any of the GCC countries:\n\nMultiple human rights organizations, in particular Human Rights Watch, have reported on widespread violations of labor and human rights of migrant workers in the Gulf region. Reported abuses include the confiscation of passports, mobility restrictions, excessive working hours, delayed or absent salary payments, sub par working and living conditions, as well as sexual, physical and psychological abuse of workers by their employers.\n\nThe kafala system has been pointed out by human rights organization as one of the main sources of some of the human rights abuses reported in the GCC countries. As this sponsorship system, often enshrined in labor laws, assigns the employer with the sole responsibility for the migrant worker, it also provides the employer with a large amount of power leverage over their workers. In some GCC countries, employers have the ability to cancel a work permit at any time, while an employee cannot freely leave the employment without the employer's consent – in some cases, for example in Oman, not even when the contract is completed or if their sponsor submits the workers to abuses. It is reported that migrant workers who do leave without their employer's consent have received punishment in some GCC countries, which can include re-entry bans, fines and deportation. Often, migrant workers cannot leave their employment, as their employer has taken their passports. One report stated that in Qatar 90% of low income workers do not have their passports in possession.\n\nAs seen above, some states, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE, have announced their commitment to amend the legal framework of the kafala system and to extend labor protection to migrant workers. Some of these states have made substantial changes to their labor laws to include migrant workers, other states have not implemented any changes to the kafala system.\n\nThe labor rights of migrant domestic workers are a separate category in this regard, as all of the Gulf states, at least until recently, excluded migrant domestic workers from the protection of labor laws. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, this leaves these workers vulnerable and open to all kinds of abuses, without any type redress available to them. Some the abuses most regularly committed against migrant domestic workers according to NGO reports include sexual abuse, physical abuse, excessive working hours, the withholding of salaries, the absence of adequate food and living conditions and the confiscation of passports.\n\nFurthermore, while some sending states have prohibited migration of domestic workers to some of the Gulf states, NGOs have argued that such prohibitions only increase the possibility of such workers seeking illegal means to enter and work in Gulf states – which in turn increases the risks of forced labor and human trafficking.\n\nSome states, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar, have announced intentions to amend or have indeed amended existing labor laws to give domestic workers better legal protection.\n\nMost of the Gulf states have not adopted any minimum wage requirements, and migrant workers often fall within the category of “low pay” labor. In 2012, Human Rights Watch reported that Bahraini migrant workers comprised 98% of the “low pay” labor group and most of the migrant workers interviewed by Human Rights Watch earned between BD40 and BD100 ($106 and $265) as their monthly salary. However, in 2016 Kuwait became the first Gulf state to set a minimum wage for domestic work and is set at KD60 (approximately $200) per month. \nAnother issue concerns delayed or absent salary payments. For example, in Oman it was reported that falling oil prices and the nationalization program not only led to a drop in new projects in the oil sector, but also to stranded migrant workers who often had not been paid for six months, who did not have employment and whose work permits had expired in the meantime. Some of these workers went on to find new employment, and without the permission of their previous employer, lost their work permit and thus became undocumented. Both the delayed and absent salary payments were found to be the greatest violations of labor laws during inspections in Oman in 2013.\n\nAnother issue with the payment of salaries, as reported by Migrant-Rights.Org, relates to the creation of so-called Wage Protection Systems in the Gulf states. While the Gulf's governments claim the aim of the system is to protect labor rights, according to Migrant-Rights.Org the Omani government has recently stated that it intends to use the system to monitor and gather information about the wages and bank accounts of workers – in order to keep an eye on remittances sent back to the home country. According to the same Migrant-Rights.Org report, the Omani government regards remittances as “wasted investment” and wishes to offer its economy better protection against such losses. The government of Saudi Arabia is also reported to use the Wage Protection System to control the finances and spending of migrant workers. Furthermore, while there have not been any specific proposals in this regard, the International Monetary Fund has warned against potential plans of Gulf states to implement of remittance taxes to increase state revenue.\n\nIn recent years, Gulf states have implemented policies of large-scale deportations of both undocumented and documented migrant workers, for a variety of reasons. According to Kuwaiti media, 14,400 migrants were deported from Kuwait between January and April 2016. In 2016, a total of 29,000 migrants were deported from Kuwait, in comparison to about 25,000 migrants in 2015. In 2013, almost a million migrants were deported from Saudi Arabia, according to Migrant-Rights.Org, in order to boost employment of Saudi nationals and protect national security. In the same year, 7,346 undocumented migrants were deported from Bahrain. In 2016 reportedly more than 600 migrants were deported from Oman in just seven day.\n\nMigrant workers are reportedly often deported for minor transgressions, such as traffic violations, barbecuing in public spaces, complaints about working conditions, organizing strikes or violations of the terms of the residency and work permits. The arrested migrants often only spend three days to a week in prison before the actual deportation, leaving them without time or means to appeal the deportation decision. Nevertheless, these mass deportations still lead to overcrowded prisons, human rights organizations have reported. It is argued that these mass deportations are part of the Gulf States’ policies to increase employment of their nationals and to improve national security.\n\nIn spring 2013, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced a government policy focused on deportation of irregular migrants, which required these migrants to regularize their status or to leave. While about one million foreign workers left voluntarily, reports estimate that between November 2013 and March 2014 around 370,000 migrant workers were forcibly deported from Saudi Arabia. It was reported that crimes were committed by the Saudi police against these migrants, including extreme violence, torture, rape and killing.\n\nAlthough access to legal remedies is provided by the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the 1975 Migrant Workers Convention (Supplementary Provisions), these conventions have not been ratified by the Gulf states. Nevertheless, access to legal redress for labor rights violations is provided in some Gulf states, the accessibility of these remedies in practice is often hampered by multiple factors.\n\nOne set of issues relates to language and mobility barriers, which hinder migrant workers’ access to institutions, information and services. Many migrant workers do not speak enough Arabic to understand the information needed to receive redress, while the lack of public transportation and the long working hours impede the mobility of migrant workers. In this regard, the reportedly existing perception that the courts will favour nationals over the migrant workers does not improve the accessibility of remedies.\n\nAnother issue in this regard is the backlog of some of the Gulf countries’ courts. In the UAE, for example, Dubai courts could not keep up with the number of labor complaints filed – especially around 2008, when the global financial crisis inhibited companies from providing their employees with work or salaries. Some critics have also pointed to understaffing and underfunding and the absence of coordination between enforcement agencies.\n\nHowever, even if migrant workers gain access to legal remedies, they do not always receive redress. In the case of Bahrain, 50 Pakistani workers were detained by the authorities after they filed a complaint with the Bahraini courts concerning a lack of salary payments. Even though the court ruled in the workers’ favour, they were still detained by the authorities for at least a year and were still imprisoned in January 2017.\n\nSince Qatar was elected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the country has been heavily criticized for the treatment of migrant workers in the preparations for the tournament. While Qatar has received less criticism in the past for its treatment of migrant workers than other GCC countries, the preparations for the World Cup have drawn more attention to the situation of workers' rights in the country. Workers have died at a rate of one death per day, and workers' salaries are being withheld by employers. There are also stories of Nepalese migrant workers, constituting the single largest migrant group in Qatar, seeking refuge in the Embassy of Nepal in Doha. The Guardian stated that most Nepalese migrant workers have large debts, as they borrowed money to pay their recruitment agents.\n\nAmnesty International argues that labor migration to Qatar will continue to increase, due to the World Cup constructions and labels the conditions for workers as \"grim\". An additional pull factor is the intention of the Qatari government, in light of the World Cup, to transform Doha into an international hub. Government bodies in Qatar have dismissed critiques regarding the exploitation of migrants and have referred to the exploitation of migrant workers as isolated incidents.\n\nMultiple initiatives have been undertaken on the local, regional and international level, by both non-governmental organizations as well as governmental organizations. Responses from international organizations, civil society organizations, trade unions concerning the protection of migrant workers have increased, as have initiatives to report migrant workers' rights violations.\n\nOn the international level, several large NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have frequently reported on different issues regarding migrant workers' rights. Human Rights Watch has reported, \"inter alia\", on different foreign workers' rights abuses, on specific vulnerable categories of migrant workers, and on new policies and legislation implemented by the Gulf states aimed at protecting migrant workers. Amnesty International has produced similar reports, recently focusing strongly on the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The International Organisation for Migration has also published reports on migrant workers, covering both the Asian sending states and Gulf receiving states. Although the United Nations has produced independent reports on some issues with migrant workers' rights in the Gulf, the International Labour Organisation is the main agency focused on the position migrant workers. One of their projects, introduced in 2016, is the Regional Fair Migration Project in the Middle East, to promote national policies which are fair to migrants, to assist states with the implementation of migrant-friendly legislation and to improve the working conditions of migrant workers. Additionally, they publish reports on the status of migrant workers, receive complaints concerning human rights violations, and in 2015, the ILO also published a paper to improve and increase cooperation between Asian sending countries and the receiving Gulf countries. In December 2016, the Regional Office for Arab States of the ILO, together with the Executive Bureau of the Council of Ministers of Labour and Social Affairs of the GCC, signed a Plan of Joint Activities which focuses on several labor-related subjects, including the management of foreign labourers' issues.\n\nOne important NGO working on the regional level is Migrant-Rights.org , an organisation created in 2007 which draws attention to abuses of migrant workers in the Gulf region, works together with governments to effect legislative and policy changes, informs migrants workers and gives them a voice. The organisation publishes regular reports on migrant workers' rights violations, on legislative changes within the Gulf states, and on personal stories from migrant workers. They also provide detailed information, numbers and infographics. Additionally, they published a graph including all the different organisations and civil society groups they are connected with, including organizations for the general protection of migrant workers and location-specific organizations. Another organisation is the Migrant Forum Asia , a regional network of NGOs, trade unions, associations and individuals created for the protection of migrant workers' rights and the promotion of their wellbeing. They have reported on multiple issues involving Asian migrant workers in the Gulf region.\n\nOne example of a national organisation is Lawyers for Human Rights International , an India-based NGO which campaigns for the protection of Indian migrant workers overseas. One of the main objectives of the NGO is to raise awareness about human rights abuses taking place in the GCC. Furthermore, in 2003 the UAE chapter of the Migrante International was created, an alliance of Filipino migrant worker organizations across the world. The objectives of the organisation are mainly to strengthen labor protection, and to increase penalties for recruitment agencies which violate Filipino laws and for employers who violate UAE labor laws. The organisation additionally provides services such as training, legal advice, counseling and temporary shelter for Filipinos who experience abuse from their employers. Two other organisations active in Bahrain are the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights , focusing on migrant workers' rights amongst other issues, and the Migrant Workers Protection Society , created in 2005 to assist migrant workers in receiving full human rights protection. An example of an individual initiative is the development of a smartphone app for migrant workers, created by an Indian journalist in Oman in 2016 together with the Migrant Forum Asia. On downloading, the app, called MigCall, saves ten helpline telephone numbers which provides access to services in six different languages. During registration, the user must also supply an emergency contact number. In case of an emergency, the user can press the SOS button in the app and a message will be sent to the emergency contact, while the user's GPS location will be sent to the closest Indian embassy or consulate. In February 2016, the app had been downloaded 12.000.000 times.\n\nBecause of the activities of these NGOs, international organisations and local initiatives, large proportions of available data concerning migrant workers and their working conditions come from organisations. During the past decades, these actors have investigated labor conditions, human rights violations, demographics and movements, and have further created guidelines for both recipient and sending countries in order to monitor, investigate, report and strengthen policies aimed at protecting migrant workers in the GCC.\n\nThe GCC constitutes one of the most attractive geographical regions for migrants globally, mainly due to its economic pull factors. International migrants have further contributed to a large proportion of the economic growth in the GCC. The national populace did generally not have the numbers or know-how to implement the development objectives set by the respective national leaderships of the GCC countries. Development plans outlined by several political leaders in the GCC were therefore in need of a high amount of labor migrants. These labor migrants are mainly linked to the private sector, where salaries are lower and hours longer. On the other hand, national citizens in the GCC mainly work in the government-sponsored public sector where labor conditions are generally better.\nAfter the first Gulf War in 1990-1991, Kuwait was especially affected. The immense deprivation of the country required Kuwait to rebuild the country's economy and infrastructure, mainly through the reconstruction of the petroleum industry. Although the pre-war level of the GDP per capita was achieved already in 1992, it constituted a costly the process. The outcome was that a large number of Kuwaitis started to push for workforce nationalization through “Kuwaitization” of the labor force in the country, as it was argued that migrants took work opportunities away from the national citizens. According to Nora Ann Colton, a Professor of International Economics at Drew University, the \"Kuwaitization\" movement was a product of poor planning by the authorities in charge and could have been avoided. However, Kuwaiti authorities enforced policies which required nationals to have a lower skill set than non-Kuwaitis. Similar policies were spread throughout the GCC-region during a relatively short time period. There still exists the concern today that national unemployment will increase, and therefore authorities work to integrate nationals within the private sector. The verdict so far is that these initiatives have proven to be largely unsuccessful.\n\n"}

{"id": "41979701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41979701", "title": "Pan African Federation of Filmmakers", "text": "Pan African Federation of Filmmakers\n\nThe Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes, or FEPACI), formed in 1969 and inaugurated in 1970, is \"the continental voice of filmmakers from various regions of Africa and the Diaspora\", focusing attention on the promotion of African film industries in terms of production, distribution and exhibition.\n\nAt the forefront of the creation of FEPACI were individual film practitioners who were passionate about African cinema. In 1952, Paulin Vieyra and his friends formed a group called African Cinema, an informal body that had no legal status at the time. At the birth of African Cinema it was evident that the commitment from filmmakers to produce films was mainly for ideological, economic and cultural development. Film-makers and other African intellectuals also organized themselves through unions, political parties, associations of writers were participating in a civil movement aimed at the emancipation of African Cinema and other artistic formations from colonial dominated structures. The era played an important role introducing film as a medium of expression and a transformational tool for achieving not only political freedom but cultural and ideological freedom as well.\n\nIn 1955, black Africa was still largely under European colonial domination. The fight for independence by colonized peoples took a new turn and tone, a new lexicon and vocabulary of intellectual thought was found in the speech against colonialism delivered in the 1950s by Aimé Césaire, \"Discours sur le colonialisme\" (\"Discourse on Colonialism\"), subsequently published in 1956 by \"Présence Africaine\". Ideas expressed by African and Caribbean intellectuals about the role of the colonial enterprise in the disruption of African societies and the negation of their indigenous cultures became more succinct and radical. \nThe Bandung conference held in Indonesia in 1955 allowed for the first time the peoples of Africa and Asia, to raise their voices farther and beyond their continents to demand the right to equal emancipation and freedom of their Continents.\n\nIt was in the Second Congress of Black Writers and Artists, held in Rome in 1959, that a group led by Paulin Vieyra called for a resolution to develop art in Africa. The resolution stressed the need for African ownership of the means of expression, control of production and strategic proprietorship of public platforms that disseminated the African story and its imagery. The resolution also requested that future congresses be accompanied by an African Art Festival. The resolution was implemented in April 1966 in Dakar, where the first World Festival of Black Arts was hosted. 26 films from 16 African countries were screened at this festival. At the end of the festival a resolution for the creation of an inter-African body of cinematography was made and this was led by the African Cinema group. The headquarters of this body was to be in Dakar and the office’s mandate was to organize meetings of African cinema professionals, film directors, technicians, actors, students from all over Africa to ensure a strong activist movement set to work collectively in the development and advancement of the audiovisual film industry. \n\nCreating FEPACI\n\nTunisia created the Carthage Film Festival in 1966. Three years later in 1969, FEPACI, a continent body was formed and inaugurated in 1970. The African Cinema group led by Paulin Vieyra helped lay the groundwork at the Pan African Cultural Festival held in Algiers in 1969 for the establishment of the Pan African Federation of Film-Makers (FEPACI).\n\nFEPACI Secretaries General\n\nThe first FEPACI Secretary General elected was Senegalese Ababacar Makharam Samb in the 1970s, followed by Johnson Traore in and then Gaston Kabore. After the Congress in 1997, FEPACI went into a transitional period with its constitution from a mother body strictly for membership by national organizations to the constitution that was adopted in 2001. Pierre Rwamba was chair of the interim committee that was given the task to reformulate the constitution. The 7th congress of FEPACI in 2001 adopted the new constitution and Jacques Behanzin was voted as secretary general. He was followed by Mrs. Seipati Bulane-Hopa; the incumbent secretary general Mr. Cheick Oumar Sissoko was elected at the 2013\n\nFEPACI remains a unique organization of its kind with no equivalent in either Europe, America or Asia. FEPACI reflects the commitment of filmmakers who were anti-imperialist and who in demonstration of their resistance and fight against colonialism drafted the famous Charter of Algiers adopted unanimously on January 18, 1975, at the Second Congress of the FEPACI in Algiers.\n\nFEPACI Policies FEPACI policies were driven by a \"political militancy\" that waged an ideological warfare against cultural imperialism, against the political and economic subversion of Africa. The militancy was led by film pioneers who were not only vocal about the status quo but who made films that interrogated and challenged Africa’s leadership, putting a lot of scrutiny on their ability and capacity to govern in a just and accountable manner. \nThere was some policy changes that positively impacted the production and distribution of African films so FEPACI made some achievements while realizing that a lot more still had to be achieved. \nFEPACI's achievements include: \n\nFEPACI has observer status of the Organization of African Unity and as an NGO representative by UNESCO and other international bodies, among them the Inter-governmental Agency of La Francophonie, the Arab League and the European Union.\n\nMilitancy and thematic and aesthetic choices\n\nWhat was the impact of aesthetic choices of films made during this period?\nFilms such as \"Africa on seine\", \"Borom Sarret\" and \"Black Girl\" (1966) that were shot in the first decade of independence were precursors of militant and radical film-making whose content and themes were aligned to the spirit of the Charter of Algiers. During this period of political activism - with the exception of Ousmane Sembène, who recalls his film \"Emitaï\" (1971) the resistance of peasants and farmers in Casamance to requisitioning of rice during the Second World War - few filmmakers were interested in making films on resistance and colonialism – while filmmakers in the Maghreb or Arabic countries were focused on that genre. The majority of films shot in black francophone Africa were characterized mainly by social disputes, which illustrated themes that spoke of social ills and difficulties common in films such as \"Borom Sarret\" (1963, by Ousmane Sembène), regarded as the first short film to denounce neo-colonialism. In his other film \"Xala\" (1974) Sembène juxtaposes tradition and modernity. \"Touki Bouki\" (1972), by Djibril Diop Mambety, marked a break with the narrative form of classical films of this period and was seen as among the most militant. The time for questions and the crisis The awakening of conscientious filmmakers to renew their activist past was supported by the revolutionary regime of Burkina headed by Captain Sankara in 1983. The third FEPACI congress was held on the ninth edition of FESPACO in 1985. The FEPACI headquarters was moved to Ouagadougou and filmmaker Gaston Kabore was appointed to the post of Secretary General and remained there until 1997. Gaston Kabore restored the Film Federation.\n\nWhile support came from Burkina Faso and a more substantial one comes from the European Union, which financed a plan to revive the African Cinema and the production of African films. FEPACI’s ensuing collaboration with Latin American filmmakers during Gaston’s custodianship allowed filmmakers to train in Cuban schools. The visibility of African cinema was further made greater at the Cannes Festival, also via the publication of the cinema magazine \"Ecrans d'Afrique\", which was produced with the support of the Italian NGO Centro Orientamento educativo (COE).\n\nIn terms of thematic and aesthetic genres, cinema in Africa matured further during the mid-1980s to late '90s and attracted international screens with films such as \"Yeelen\" (1987), \"Wend Kuuni\" (1982), \"Bal Dust\" (1988), \"Tilaï\" (1989), \"Yaaba\" (1989), \"Hyenas\" (1992), and \"Sankofa (film)|Sankofa]]\" (1993). However, it was during this period that FEPACI had to assess the economic crisis and creative impact the lack of funds for films had on the developing production sector had on making African films. The crisis can be traced back to 1980 during the severance tax subsidies from French cinemas by the French ministry of cooperation which before the cut had helped with the production of films.\n\nThe combined effects of the failures of national distribution organizations and CIDC CIPROFILM, the lack of funding policies at state levels, the socio-political and economic changes (including the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994) occurred in the early 1990s and contributed to diminishing the collective commitment and also the political activism. In the mid-1990s a proliferation of a group of filmmakers formed private productions and associations aimed at complementing aims of FEPACI.\n\nAmong them were: \n\nSince the last congress in 2001, FEPACI hopes for a rebirth of a powerful FEPACI again, a renaissance of the organization that proves the vision began African cinema to advance develop and grow the audiovisual cinema industry is not over. FEPACI today remains inspired by the great militant spirit borne by pioneer film-makers in the Charter of Algiers to further the vision of creating a viable and sustainable audiovisual environment in Africa.\n\nDevelopment of FEPACI throughout its Congresses \nOn February 28, 2001, filmmakers gathered in the Dassasgho suburb of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to reconstitute the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), it was the Seventh Congress of the Federation. The Sixth Congress in 1997 had mandated a committee to make a study of the status of the audio-visual industries and contextualise the constitution of FEPACI. It took four years before the next new constitution was presented, so it went to Congress. It was a Congress that marked a major transformation of the nature of the Federation.\nWhereas the founding constitution of FEPACI was open only to national association of filmmakers within the continent, the new constitution allowed for individual membership, related industries and associations as well as those in the global African diaspora. Although the 2001 constitution was a major change to the structure of the organisation, FEPACI had several strategic and principle re-adjustments following trends and developmental challenges of the time on the continent.\nThe formation of the federation in 1969 was more of a consolidation of filmmakers' efforts to create a film industry in the continent. Most of the filmmakers were driven by anti-colonial spirit of the time. Having a profound understanding of the power the medium at their hands had to influence and shape the minds, they immediately aligned themselves as a sister body to the continental body Organization of African Unity (OAU) that was formed in 1963 to promote the unity and solidarity of African Countries, to defend the sovereignty of members to eradicate all forms of colonialism, to coordinate and harmonise Member States economic, educational, scientific policies among others. As with the case of the OAU membership to FEPACI was open only to National Association of Filmmakers Filmmakers had to unify themselves within their country of origin to take membership of FEPACI the exception to this rule was for those filmmakers who were in \"occupied\" or \"troubled\" countries - a condition (status) the late Lionel Ngakane (Doctor - honoris causa) was under for a very long time due to Apartheid, and its racial policies.\nThe development of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers – La Federation Panafricaine des Cineastes (FEPACI) – has been closely related to attempts at developing a film industry in the continent and there were success stories in some Francophone countries. Affected by lack of national and international industries, non existent structures of production, distribution and exhibition, filmmakers would discuss their material condition looking at their individual and national battles at various art and cultural forums that were organised by some of their governments. They would look at finding workable solutions as well as getting their respective national governments' intervention.\nFor an organisation with more than 40 years of existence FEPACI has had very few General Congresses. Perhaps this is because of how FEPACI was founded, from deliberations of cultural industry thinkers. This also reflects the nature of the organisation as a self-conscious organisation that involves a constant reflection upon itself to be at par with the rapid changes in technologies and trends in the overall discipline of the \"seventh art\" within the cultural industries.\nEvery Congress of FEPACI has been necessitated by a need to re-focus the federation on politico-socio and economic principles with the milieu at the time, whether internal or external.\n\n\n• The Constitution/ statutes of FEPACI were to be reviewed and amended. \n• FEPACI be strengthened in terms of its capacity and means to deliver on its mandate in a transparent and accountable manner\n• FEPACI to facilitate unity among African filmmakers\n\nThe Congress of FEPACI always takes a very critical introspective outlook at the state of the organisation vis-a-vis the state of the industry throughout the continent, hence the theme \"Film Making in the 21st century, a contribution to a sustainable economy\", a theme that reflects where audiovisual industries as we know them now have developed from.\n\n2019 will mark the 50th centenary of the existence of FEPACI.\n"}
{"id": "4182978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4182978", "title": "Plastic shaman", "text": "Plastic shaman\n\nPlastic shaman, or plastic medicine people, is a pejorative colloquialism applied to individuals who are attempting to pass themselves off as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent. In some cases, the \"plastic shaman\" may have some genuine cultural connection, but is seen to be exploiting that knowledge for ego, power, or money.\n\nPlastic shamans are believed by their critics to use the mystique of these cultural traditions, and the legitimate curiosity of sincere seekers, for their personal gain. In some cases, exploitation of students and traditional culture may involve the selling of fake \"traditional\" spiritual ceremonies, fake artifacts, fictional accounts in books, illegitimate tours of sacred sites, and often the chance to buy spiritual titles. Often Native American symbols and terms are adopted by plastic shamans, and their adherents are insufficiently familiar with Native American religion to distinguish between imitations and actual Native religion.\n\nThe term \"plastic shaman\" originated among Native American and First Nations activists and is most often applied to people fraudulently posing as Native American traditional healers. People who have been referred to as \"plastic shamans\" include those believed to be fraudulent, self-proclaimed spiritual advisors, seers, psychics, self-identified New Age shamans, or other practitioners of non-traditional modalities of spirituality and healing who are operating on a fraudulent basis. \"Plastic shaman\" has also been used to refer to non-Natives who pose as Native American authors, especially if the writer is misrepresenting Indigenous spiritual ways (such as in the case of Ku Klux Klan member Asa Earl Carter and the scandal around his book \"The Education of Little Tree\").\n\nIt is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in \"Akwesasne Notes\", along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.\n\nCritics of plastic shamans believe there is legitimate danger to seekers who place their trust in such individuals. Those who participate in ceremonies led by the untrained may be exposing themselves to various psychological, spiritual and even physical risks. The methods used by a fraudulent teacher may have been invented outright or recklessly adapted from a variety of other cultures and taught without reference to a real tradition. In almost all \"plastic shaman\" cases a fraud is employing these partial or fraudulent \"healing\" or \"spiritual\" methods without a traditional community of legitimate elders to provide checks and balances on their behaviour. In the absence of the precautions such traditional communities normally have in place in regard to sacred ceremonies, and without traditional guidelines for ethical behavior, abuse can flourish.\n\nPeople have been injured, and some have died, in fraudulent sweat lodge ceremonies performed by non-Natives.\n\nAmong critics, this misappropriation and misrepresentation of Indigenous intellectual property is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism and one step in the destruction of Indigenous cultures:\n\nThe para-esoteric Indianess of Plastic Shamanism creates a neocolonial miniature with multilayered implications. First and foremost, it is suggested that the passé Injun elder is incapable of forwarding their knowledge to the rest of the white world. Their former white trainee, once thoroughly briefed in Indian spirituality, represents the truly erudite expert to pass on wisdom. This rationale, once again, reinforces nature-culture dualisms. The Indian stays the doomed barbaric pet, the Indianized is the eloquent and sophisticated medium to the outer, white world. Silenced and visually annhilated like that, the Indian retreats to prehistory, while the Plastic Shaman can monopolize their culture.\n\nDefenders of the integrity of indigenous religion use the term \"plastic shaman\" to criticize those they believe are potentially dangerous and who may harm the reputations of the cultures and communities they claim to represent. There is evidence that, in the most extreme cases, fraudulent and sometimes criminal acts have been committed by a number of these imposters. It is also claimed by traditional peoples that in some cases these plastic shamans may be using corrupt, negative and sometimes harmful aspects of authentic practices. In many cases this has led to the actual traditional spiritual elders declaring the plastic shaman and their work to be \"dark\" or \"evil\" from the perspective of traditional standards of acceptable conduct.\n\nPlastic shamans are also believed to be dangerous because they give people false ideas about traditional spirituality and ceremonies. In some cases, the plastic shamans will require that the ceremonies are performed in the nude, and that men and women participate in the ceremony together, although such practices are an innovation and were not traditionally followed. Another innovation may include the introduction of sex magic or \"tantric\" elements, which may be a legitimate form of spirituality in its own right (when used in its original cultural context), but in this context it is an importation from a different tradition and is not part of authentic Native practices.\n\nThe results of this appropriation of Indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, intertribal councils, and the United Nations General Assembly to issue several declarations on the subject: \n\nMany of those who work to expose plastic shamans believe that the abuses perpetuated by spiritual frauds can only exist when there is ignorance about the cultures a fraudulent practitioner claims to represent. Activists working to uphold the rights of traditional cultures work not only to expose the fraudulent distortion and exploitation of Indigenous traditions and Indigenous communities, but also to educate seekers about the differences between traditional cultures and the often-distorted modern approaches to spirituality.\n\nOne indicator of a plastic shaman might be someone who discusses \"Native American spirituality\" but does not mention any specific Native American tribe. The \"New Age Frauds and Plastic Shamans\" website discusses potentially plastic shamans.\n\nThe word \"shaman\" originates from the Evenki word \"šamán\". The term came into usage among Europeans via Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. From there, \"shamanism\" was picked up by anthropologists to describe any cultural practice that involves vision-seeking and communication with the spirits, no matter how diverse the cultures included in this generalisation. Native American and First Nations spiritual people use terms in their own languages to describe their traditions; their spiritual teachers, leaders or elders are not called \"shamans\". However, with Michael Harner's invention and promotion of \"core shamanism\" in the 1980s, the term \"shaman\" began to be misapplied to Native American ways by cultural outsiders; this is due to Harner's unfounded claim that the ways of several North American tribes share core elements with those of the Siberian Shamans. This misappellation led to many non-Natives assuming Harner's inventions were traditional Indigenous ceremonies. Geary Hobson sees the New Age use of the term shamanism as a cultural appropriation of Native American culture by \"white\" people who have distanced themselves from their own history.\n\nIn Nepal, the term \"Chicken Shaman\" is used.\n\nA 1996 documentary about this phenomenon, \"White Shamans and Plastic Medicine Men\", was directed by Terry Macy and Daniel Hart.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54966713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54966713", "title": "Polyball", "text": "Polyball\n\nThe Polyball is the most prestigious public event of the ETH Zurich. It has a long tradition since the 1880s and takes place annually at the end of November. The Polyball is the biggest decorated ball in Europe with approximately 9’000 visitors and is a classic dance event.\n\nThe exact year and the location of the first Polyball - then known as \"Akademie\" - is unknown. A general assumption is that the first ball took place in 1880. In 1929 the name changed from Akademie to Polyball. Since the 1940s each Polyball has its one theme with respective decorations of the ballrooms.\nSince its beginning in the Stadttheater Zürich (municipal theatre, now Zürich Opera House) the location has changed several times, such as Tonhalle Zürich, Grand Hotel Dolder, Zürcher Messegelände (Zürich fair areal) as well as the ETH main building where it takes place today.\n\nThe Polyball takes place within the main building of the ETH including the multifunctional hall. It starts at 19:00 on the last Saturday in November and ends at 05:00 on Sunday morning. The ball comprises 16 to 20 ballrooms decorated according to the ball theme. A variety of bands, from street performer to ballroom orchestra, entertain the dancers.\n\nThe Polyball is organized by the KOSTA foundation. It is an officially approved organisation of the VSETH and the University of Zurich (UZH) student societies.

De-limbed timber was placed in the mill. The timber was cut from its somewhat rounded shape to a four-sided piece of lumber, which would be further sawed into lumber of useful sizes. The original pieces that were cut, along with the bark, was called \"slabs\" and discarded nearby until a use was found for them. Eventually, the slab piles became the most visible part of the area. Other specialists would construct businesses in the area, such as a blacksmith, a general store, a post office, and a wheelwright. Sometimes a village or town would form around the place and the sobriquet \"slab city\" was replaced by a place name.\n\nVermont had nine such slab cities. Massachusetts had at least one.\n\nThe term persisted in the Western United States to 2017 as a name for an area considered unaesthetic by some observers.\n"}
{"id": "44609083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44609083", "title": "Terminator Genisys", "text": "Terminator Genisys\n\nTerminator Genisys is a 2015 American science fiction film directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. The fifth installment in the \"Terminator\" franchise, it serves as a soft reboot of the series, using the plot element of time travel to erase the events of the previous films from the series' continuity. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, who reprises his role as the Terminator, alongside Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, J. K. Simmons, Dayo Okeniyi, Matt Smith, Courtney B. Vance, and Lee Byung-hun. It follows soldier Kyle Reese, a soldier in the war against Skynet, who is sent from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor, leader of the Human Resistance, to protect his mother Sarah. When Kyle arrives in the past, he discovers that the timeline has been altered and Sarah has been raised by a reprogrammed Terminator.\n\nMegan Ellison and her production company Annapurna Pictures acquired the franchise rights in May 2011. The following year, production of another installment in the series was set up in collaboration with Skydance Productions, owned by Ellison's brother David. The Ellisons consulted \"Terminator\" creator James Cameron in the hope of returning to the spirit of \"The Terminator\" (1984) and its sequel \"\" (1991). Principal photography was primarily in New Orleans, with some in the on-screen setting of San Francisco. Six companies handled the film's visual effects, with its prosthetic make-up and animatronics created by Legacy Effects.\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Pictures on July 1, 2015, in RealD 3D and IMAX 3D. It was not well-received by critics, who found its story and performances unsatisfactory, although Schwarzenegger's return to the franchise was praised. \"Terminator Genisys\" grossed over $440 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of the franchise and of Schwarzenegger's career, behind \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". Originally planned as the first film of a new trilogy, it was announced in 2017 that the film franchise would be rebooted once again following the return of creative control to Cameron.\n\nHuman Resistance leader John Connor launches a final offensive against Skynet, an artificial general intelligence system in 2029. Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a time machine and sends a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator back to May 12, 1984, to kill John's mother Sarah. John's right-hand man, Kyle Reese, volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machine's magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier and has visions from his childhood about Sarah Connor.\n\nWhen it arrives in Los Angeles 1984, Skynet's T-800 is disabled by Sarah and \"Pops\", a reprogrammed T-800 sent to protect Sarah when she was nine years old. Kyle arrives shortly afterwards, and is intercepted by a T-1000. Sarah and Pops join Kyle and destroy the T-1000 with acid; she and Pops reveal that they have constructed a makeshift time machine similar to Skynet's, and Sarah plans to travel to 1997 (the year Skynet becomes self-aware). Realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has changed because of the warning he received in his childhood vision and persuades Sarah to travel to 2017 to stop Skynet.\n\nIn 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of a busy San Francisco highway and are apprehended by city police. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called \"Genisys\" (a soon-to-be-unveiled global operating system which is embraced by the public). John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle; Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is an advanced T-3000 Terminator. While Kyle was traveling back in time a T-5000, the physical embodiment of Skynet disguised as a member of the Resistance, attacked John and transformed him into a nanocyte infiltrator. John, tasked with ensuring Cyberdyne Systems' survival, traveled back in time to assist them with the development of Genisys and hence securing Skynet and its machines' rise.\n\nA day before Skynet's worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle and Pops escape to a safe house and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdyne's headquarters with the T-3000 in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into the T-3000's helicopter and causes it to crash. The T-3000 survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off the T-3000.\n\nIn a final battle, Pops traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of a prototypical time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the remains of Pops are flung out of the apparatus into a nearby experimental vat of mimetic polyalloy. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components similar to that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.\n\nThe trio travels to Kyle's childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trio's arrival from 1984. Sarah and Kyle finally kiss and they along with Pops drive off into the countryside. A mid-credits scene reveals that the system core of Genisys, located in a protected subterranean chamber, has survived the explosion.\n\n\nAlthough \"Terminator Salvation\" was intended to begin a new trilogy, the production of a fifth film was put on hold because of legal issues with franchise owner the Halcyon Company (which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2009). To avoid bankruptcy, Halcyon later decided to sell the rights to the franchise and valued the property at $70 million. On February 8, 2010, the franchise was auctioned for $29.5 million to Pacificor, a hedge fund which was the largest creditor in Halcyon's bankruptcy proceedings. The deal erased Halcyon's debts to Pacificor and guaranteed Halcyon $5 million for each additional Terminator sequel produced, to pay other outstanding debts. Pacificor sold the franchise again in May 2010.\n\nIn August of that year, Hannover House announced plans to develop a 3D animated film titled \"Terminator 3000\". Pacificor responded with a cease and desist letter, declining a $20–30 million offer from Hannover for the rights to produce the film. In February 2011, Universal Studios considered investing in a fifth \"Terminator\" film with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to the title role, \"Fast & Furious\" director Justin Lin at the helm and Chris Morgan as the screenwriter. In late April 2011, a proposed \"Terminator\" package, dropping Morgan and adding producer Robert W. Cort, was presented to Universal Studios, Sony, Lionsgate and CBS Films. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had a 30-day right of first refusal to finance and distribute \"Terminator 5\" since 2009.\n\nIt was eventually picked up by Megan Ellison and her production company, Annapurna Pictures, in May 2011 after they purchased at auction the rights to make at least two more \"Terminator\" films (including \"Terminator 5\"). The deal was finalized on December 4, 2012; the final price was reportedly less than the auction pledge because new copyright laws had raised concerns that the rights would revert to \"Terminator\" creator James Cameron in 2019. Ellison's brother David and others from his Skydance Productions agreed to co-produce the film. Director Justin Lin had to leave the project because of his involvement in \"Fast & Furious 6\". Two screenwriters, Laeta Kalogridis of \"Shutter Island\" and Patrick Lussier of \"Drive Angry\", were commissioned to write the screenplay in January 2013. Kalogridis and Lussier turned down the project three times, but Cameron persuaded them to accept it.\n\nParamount Pictures (which has a financing and distribution deal with Skydance) was confirmed as the distributor in June 2013, when they and the producers announced a release date of June 26, 2015. Rian Johnson, Denis Villeneuve and Ang Lee were approached to take over direction from Lin, but \"\" director Alan Taylor was selected in September 2013. In January 2014, Megan Ellison announced that Annapurna was no longer financing the film; Skydance and Paramount would provide funding, and Ellison would be credited as an executive producer.\n\nAfter acquiring the rights to the franchise, Megan Ellison asked Cameron for input on the new film. Cameron met several times with David Ellison, where they discussed Schwarzenegger's role and how to remain true to the T-800 character. On August 6, 2014, Schwarzenegger posted a picture on his Twitter account of himself in a production chair on set. The picture indicated the correct spelling of the film's title: \"Terminator Genisys\".\n\nOn June 13, 2013, Schwarzenegger said that he would return for his fourth film as the Terminator. By early November, Garrett Hedlund and Tom Hardy were under consideration for the role of Kyle Reese. That month the choice for Sarah Connor was narrowed to Emilia Clarke, Tatiana Maslany and Brie Larson, and Clarke was selected in December. That month, Jason Clarke began negotiations to play John Connor. In February 2014, the studio considered Garrett Hedlund, Jai Courtney and Boyd Holbrook as Reese, and later that month Courtney was confirmed for the role. J. K. Simmons began talks for the role of Detective O'Brien in March. According to late-March announcements, Dayo Okeniyi would play Danny Dyson and Lee Byung-hun, Michael Gladis, and Sandrine Holt joined the cast (Lee in a lead role). Matt Smith joined the cast in May, as did Douglas Smith in June.\n\nLaeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier were invited to write the script while they worked on another project with David Ellison and Dana Goldberg. They agreed to write a \"Terminator\" film when Cameron, a friend of Kalogridis who worked with her in \"Avatar\", gave it his blessing. The starting point of the script was to retain Schwarzenegger as a central character, unlike the \"Star Trek\" reboot with Leonard Nimoy as an older Spock in a minor role. They had to write in the actor (now 67 years old), and followed a suggestion by Cameron that the Terminator's living-tissue exterior was vulnerable to aging and their idea of Skynet sending a Terminator after an infant Sarah Connor. Kalogridis and Lussier extended this to the core characters of Kyle, Sarah, and John Connor, despite each being from a different time period. Although the writers reportedly enjoyed \"\", they opted to escape its suggestion that Judgment Day is inevitable because of a causal loop in favor of all \"Terminator\" timelines existing simultaneously in a multiverse. To map out the timelines and plot, Kalogridis and Lussier had five whiteboards \"covering every wall in the office\". They eventually reached a central plot thread in which the Skynet of one universe, defeated in several timelines, sent the T-5000 to the \"Genisys\" timeline hoping to defeat the humans by \"having the best weapon that humans have\": John Connor. The first draft of the screenplay, to attract a director, was delivered in July 2013.\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 21, 2014 in New Orleans and ended on August 6 in San Francisco. The Oracle Corporation headquarters in Redwood City was the exterior of Cyberdyne; Oracle was founded by the Ellisons' father, Larry. Legacy Effects, successor to Stan Winston Studio, created the Terminator robotic and make-up effects led by John Rosengrant (who worked on the previous four \"Terminator\" films). Jeff Dawn, lead make-up artist for the first three installments, did not return. The bunker scene and escape on a bus was filmed at Battery Spencer at the Marin Headlands. Scroggins Aviation Mockup & Effects was called in to fabricate and build the Police AS350 and Coast Guard A109 helicopter mock-ups for the production.\n\nThe production tried to match the cinematography of the first two \"Terminator\" films. Scenes set in 1984 favored blue, green, and black tones to match the look of \"The Terminator\", and those set during the future war against the machines were modeled after similar scenes in \"\".\n\nVisual-effects supervisor Janek Sirrs oversaw approximately 1,200 visual-effects shots generated at Double Negative, Moving Picture Company (MPC), Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, One of Us and Method Studios. Double Negative was the lead company, with 900 shots which included the T-1000, T-5000, and T-3000 Terminators, the helicopter and bus-chase scenes and the Cyberdyne explosion. The complexity of the T-3000, which had to be shown as a living mass of nanomites with the ability to transform in successive layers, required as much as 20 hours to render a single frame. The mechanical cells aimed to resemble the material on stealth aircraft, with a result described as \"more matte than metal\" and resembling a slightly-iridescent ceramic carbon. Since the T-3000 was a man transformed into a robot, the design aimed for a human shape streamlined for better combat efficiency. The T-1000 was built from fluid simulations, their environments filmed with high-resolution cameras to ensure proper reflection. Its acid destruction was realistically depicted after studies of acids burning aluminum ingots and other metal. Double Negative's artists shot many reference plates of San Francisco, including scans of the Golden Gate Bridge, to ensure that the city was recreated properly in the bus and helicopter chases.\n\nMPC's most elaborate effect was the digital recreation of the original Terminator, which required 12 months for 35 shots (completed 30 minutes before the final print was submitted to the studio). Performance capture was used only for facial animation, since Schwarzenegger was scanned reading his lines. The studio's artists studied archive footage of the actor, focusing mainly on \"The Terminator\" and \"Pumping Iron\", and were given a 1984 plaster cast of him. On set, the fight between both Terminators had Schwarzenegger and Brett Azar (a bodybuilder chosen for his resemblance to the actor in 1984) and, in more dangerous scenes, Azar and a stunt double—requiring effects artists to replace the face of Pops. MPC also handled the future battle, with set extensions and Skynet robots and vehicles based on models by Legacy Effects. Industrial Light & Magic did the opening scene in which San Francisco is wiped out on Judgement Day, inspired by the Los Angeles nuclear destruction in \"Terminator 2\", and the Terminator vision. For the IMAX 3D release, the film was remastered with IMAX DMR technology to create 3D effects and a high-resolution film print.\n\nLorne Balfe composed the film's score. Balfe aimed to create a soundtrack which stood in its own, since \"Terminator Genisys\" is \"not a prequel and not a sequel\", incorporating Brad Fiedel's iconic theme in \"The Terminator\": \"have a nod to the past but also bring it into the future.\" Chinese pop singer Jane Zhang and hip hop artist Big Sean contributed \"Fighting Shadows\", released by Def Jam Recordings on June 30, 2015, as a soundtrack bonus track. The track is Zhang's first English-language recording and Big Sean's musical feature-film debut. A music video of the single, produced and directed by Robby Starbuck, included footage from the film. The Ramones' \"I Wanna Be Sedated\", OneRepublic's \"Love Runs Out\" and Inner Circle's \"Bad Boys\" are heard in the film but not included in the soundtrack.\n\n\"Terminator Genisys\" saw its European premiere in Berlin, on June 21, 2015, and had its North American premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood one week later, on June 28. The film was first released in ten markets on June 25; the following week, it was released in 35 countries (including the United States) in regular, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. On July 26 the film was playing in 64 countries outside North America, and was released in China on August 23, 2015.\n\nOn December 2, 2014, Paramount released the film's first motion poster, showing a T-800 disintegrating into dust before the logo appeared. A preview trailer was released the following day, with brief clips from the film accompanied by \"I'd Love to Change the World\" by Jetta. Differing from past \"Terminator\" releases, the preview had forced-looking camera motion in aerial-effect scenes and a first look at the color grading used to evoke the look of past films. The full trailer debuted on December 4. A second trailer (released In April 2015) was noted for spoiling the scene in which John Connor becomes a Terminator, a decision criticized by Alan Taylor and the writers.\n\nWWE's March 29, 2015 WrestleMania 31 promoted the film with an elaborate entrance stage for Triple H in his match with Sting. On the stage, Triple H donning a Terminator outfit and a video played of Schwarzenegger saying: \"Judgment Day is here. It's time to play the game.\" Several brands were promotional partners.\n\nOn June 14, Schwarzenegger visited Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton for an advance screening of \"Terminator Genisys\". Two days later, Waze added Schwarzenegger's Terminator voice as a voice-navigation option. On June 19, he and Emilia Clarke appeared on \"The Graham Norton Show\" to promote the film. Schwarzenegger released a video that day of himself walking around Hollywood dressed as the Terminator and posing as a wax model at Madame Tussauds Hollywood. The video promoted a fundraising contest to benefit the After-School All-Stars which would bring selected donors to the \"Terminator Genisys\" premiere.\n\nSeveral YouTubers appeared with Schwarzenegger in a YouTube miniseries, \"Terminator Genisys: The YouTube Chronicles\", produced by Heresy and released on June 22. Consisting of videos uploaded by Machinima, Toby Turner and Lilly Singh, the series also included Olga Kay, Sean Klitzner, Lloyd Ahlquist, and Matthew Santoro. On June 24 Schwarzenegger spoke to attendees of an early fan screening of the movie in New York City (announced on Reddit), which was followed by an interview and selfie session.\n\nThe film was released for digital download on October 20, 2015, and was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on November 10. \"Terminator Genisys\" debuted as the bestselling Blu-ray and the most-rented film of the week, and was second in overall home-video sales to \"Inside Out\". It has grossed over $25.1 million in total domestic video sales, bringing the film's gross to $465.3 million. A 4K UHD Blu-ray release occurred on June 12, 2018.\n\n\"Terminator Genisys\" grossed $89.7 million in North America and $350.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $440.6 million. Of the \"Terminator\" franchise, only \"\" earned more at the box office. Because of its $155 million production budget and an estimated $50–100 million spent on marketing, \"Bloomberg Business\" reported that the film would have needed to earn at least $400 million in its theatrical run to break even. In August 2015 \"Forbes\" cited \"Terminator Genisys\" as the first American film to earn $400 million worldwide without grossing $100 million in North America, earnings comparable to the French film \"The Intouchables\". It was the first Hollywood release to earn $100 million in China and less than that in North America; both were duplicated the following summer by \"Warcraft\".\n\nThe film opened on July 1, 2015 in the United States and Canada (the same day as the comedy-drama \"Magic Mike XXL\") in 3,700 theaters, and previewed the previous evening in 2,527 theaters. The two films and the holdovers \"Jurassic World\" and \"Inside Out\" were each projected to earn $45–55 million during the Independence Day holiday period and $27–30 million over the three-day weekend.\n\nBox-office analysts noted that \"Terminator Genisys\" would have to compete with \"Jurassic World\" and, to some extent, \"Ted 2\" for male moviegoers. They expected the film to have the upper hand, replacing \"Jurassic World\" in IMAX theaters, but good earnings were needed overseas to make up any deficits. It made $2.3 million from the Tuesday-night preview—a record for Paramount Pictures, surpassing the $2.1 million earned by \"Hercules\" (2014)—and $8.9 million on its Wednesday opening day. The film earned $42.4 million over the five-day opening stretch, including $27 million from 3,758 theaters over the weekend, placing it third at the box office behind \"Jurassic World\" and \"Inside Out\". Scott Mendelson of \"Forbes\" suggested several possible explanations for its box-office performance: poor marketing, negative reviews, competition from the family-friendly \"Jurassic World\" and \"Inside Out\", the decline of Schwarzenegger's star power and American indifference to another \"Terminator\" film.\n\nDuring the weekend of August 2, 2015, \"Terminator Genisys\" was playing in 65 countries (including the U.S. and Canada); the film was released in China on August 23. Comparisons of overseas box-office performance were made with Paramount's \"\" (2011), \"Pacific Rim\", \"Lucy\" and \"World War Z\" rather than the preceding \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009) and the other \"Terminator\" films. The film was released in ten countries before its North American debut beginning on June 25, earning $8.4 million over its opening weekend. During its second weekend it expanded to 46 countries, earning $73.3 million and topping the international box office before being passed by \"Minions\" the following weekend. The film led in box-office receipts outside North America for four non-consecutive weekends.\n\n\"Terminator Genisys\" had the franchise's biggest opening and Schwarzenegger's best in Singapore ($1.4 million) and Colombia ($1.3 million); both exceeded the opening of \"Terminator Salvation\" and that of 28 other countries, including Russia, Korea, and Mexico. The film topped the box office in Peru, Vietnam, Turkey, and 28 other countries, was Paramount's biggest Argentine opening ($2.3 million), and was the biggest July opening and the fifth-biggest of all time in Russia and the CIS ($12.5 million). In the U.K. and Brazil it opened behind \"Minions\", earning $5.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and was second in France to \"Les Profs 2\" with $3.8 million. Other notable openings were in South Korea ($11.2 million), Mexico ($6.1 million), Japan ($5.4 million), Australia ($4.4 million), Germany ($3.1 million), and India ($3 million). Its largest markets outside the U.S. and Canada were South Korea ($23.5 million), Russia ($21.8 million), Japan ($19 million) the U.K. ($16.1 million), and Brazil ($11.1 million). \"Terminator Genisys\" earned $2.2 million from Chinese midnight showings (the fourth-largest of all time) and $27.4 million on its opening day, the fourth-biggest opening day of all time for a Hollywood film (behind \"Furious 7\", \"\" and \"\"). It topped the international box office with a one-day gross from China. The film earned $82.8 million in its eight-day opening week (Sunday to Sunday), $58 million from Monday to Sunday and $23.4 million in its three-day opening weekend (Friday to Sunday). Rob Cain of \"Forbes\" attributed the successful opening in China to Schwarzenegger's popularity, audience appetite for films with robots, disasters and machines and its being the first Hollywood film released after a 60-day blackout of non-Chinese films. As of September 12, 2015, \"Terminator Genisys\" had grossed $112.8 million in China.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 26% based on 240 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Mired in its muddled mythology, \"Terminator: Genisys\" is a lurching retread that lacks the thematic depth, conceptual intelligence, or visual thrills that launched this once-mighty franchise.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average to critic reviews, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. The \"Los Angeles Times\" said critics found the film to be a \"messy sequel\" that was a \"convoluted retread\" of past films. According to \"TheWrap\", critics found the time travel storyline to be \"convoluted\" and that the performances were \"unremarkable\" aside from Schwarzenegger reprising his role.\n\nJoe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\" criticized the film, saying that it \"plays like the worst of all outcomes\". James Rocchi of TheWrap compared it negatively to \"The Terminator\", writing that \"Genisys\" \"comes back from the past to water down a whole season of summer moviegoing\". Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" criticized the film's lack of originality, calling it \"simply business and dull business at that\".\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" enjoyed the film: \"\"Genisys\" goes back to what made the franchise work in the first place: not the machine inside the man, but vice versa.\" Richard Lawson of \"Vanity Fair\" also gave a positive review, writing that the film \"makes a surprisingly compelling case\" for itself. Mark Hughes of \"Forbes\" called many of the negative reviews a result of \"cynical nostalgia\" which \"distrusts change and anticipates failure\", calling the review-aggregator ratings \"ridiculously and undeservedly low\".\n\nAfter seeing a pre-release screening of the film, Cameron voiced his support for \"Terminator Genisys\". Describing it as respectful to the first two films, Cameron said he felt like \"the franchise has been reinvigorated\". However, in 2017, James Cameron said that he had supported \"Terminator Genisys\" only because of his friendship with Schwarzenegger.\n\nEmilia Clarke expressed relief to discover there wouldn't be any sequels following the film's poor box office performance. In reference to the film's director Alan Taylor, with whom she had worked on \"Game of Thrones\", Clarke said, \"He was eaten and chewed up on \"Terminator\". He was not the director I remembered. He didn’t have a good time. No one had a good time.\"\n\nIn December 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that a television series was in the works, which would tie into a new \"Terminator\" trilogy. Development stalled in 2015 after \"Terminator Genisys\" under-performed in China. On October 1, 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" confirmed that the sequels and television spin-off were on hold indefinitely, following the film's overall box office performance. According to Skydance COO Dana Goldberg, the company was pressing forward with development but would further analyze market research before starting production.\n\nIn January 2016, the sequel was removed from Paramount's release schedule. In April 2016, Emilia Clarke said that she would not return for any sequels. In April 2018, Jason Clarke was asked by Collider if he knew any details about the planned direction of the cancelled Genisys sequel, to which he said: \n\nOn January 20, 2017, \"Deadline\" reported that James Cameron, who regains the film rights of the franchise in 2019, will produce the next \"Terminator\" film intended to reboot the franchise once again to the events following \"\". Skydance's David Ellison remained involved and declared his intention to have Tim Miller direct it. In May 2017, Schwarzenegger confirmed he will appear in the next \"Terminator\" film, with Cameron overseeing production. Cameron later stated that he is working with Ellison to set up a trilogy of films. The intention is for Schwarzenegger to be involved to some extent but also introduce new characters and \"pass the baton\". The next film in the series is scheduled for release on November 22, 2019.\n\n\n"}

The principal thinkers in this tradition are René Guénon, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon. Other important thinkers in this tradition include Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Huston Smith, Hossein Nasr, Jean Borella, and Julius Evola. A central belief of this school is the existence of a perennial wisdom, or perennial philosophy, which says that there are primordial and universal truths which form the source for, and are shared by all the major world religions.\n\nAccording to the Traditionalists, there are primordial and universal religious truths which are at the foundations of all major world religions. The Traditionalists speak of \"absolute Truth and infinite Presence\". Absolute Truth is \"the perennial wisdom (\"sophia perennis\") that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind.\" According to Traditionalists, \"the primordial and perennial truth\" is manifested in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions. Infinite Presence is \"the perennial religion (\"religio perennis\") that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions.\" According to Frithjof Schuon,\n\nAlthough the Traditionalist school is often said to be a \"perennial philosophy\", its members prefer the term \"sophia perennis\" (\"perennial wisdom\"). According to Frithjof Schuon,\nThe Traditionalist vision of a perennial wisdom is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions. It is \"intuited directly through divine intellect.\" This divine intellect is different from reason, and makes it possible to discern \"the sacred unity of reality that is attested in all authentic esoteric expressions of tradition\"; it is \"the presence of divinity within each human waiting to be uncovered.\" According to Frithjof Schuon,\nTraditionalists discern a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or Absolute, c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional \"mystical concentration on the Real\". \n\nAccording to the Traditionalists, this truth has been lost in the modern world through the rise of novel secular philosophies stemming from the Enlightenment, and modernity itself is considered as an \"anomaly in the history of mankind.\" Traditionalists see their approach as a justifiable \"nostalgia for the past\". According to Frithjof Schuon,\nTraditionalists insist on the necessity for affiliation to one of the \"normal traditions\", or great ancient religions of the world. The regular affiliation to the ordinary life of a believer is crucial, since this could give access to the esoterism of that given religious form.\n\nThe ideas of the Traditionalist School are considered to begin with René Guénon. Other people considered Traditionalists include Titus Burckhardt, Jean Borella, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Martin Lings, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Dragoš Kalajić, Huston Smith, Hossein Nasr, Frithjof Schuon and Julius Evola.\n\nA major theme in the works of René Guénon (1886-1951) is the contrast between traditional world views and modernity, \"which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind.\" For Guénon, the physical world was a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world. For Guénon, \"the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm.\"\n\nEarly on, Guénon was attracted to Sufism, which he saw as a more accessible path of spiritual knowledge. In 1912 Guénon was initiated in the Shadhili order. He started writing after his doctoral dissertation was rejected, and he left academia in 1923. His works center on the return to these traditional world views, trying to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy.\n\nIn his first books and essays he envisaged a restoration of traditional \"intellectualité\" in the West on the basis of Roman Catholicism and Freemasonry. He gave up early on a purely Christian basis for a traditionalist restoration of the West, searching for other traditions. He denounced the lure of Theosophy and neo-occultism in the form of Spiritism, two influential movements that were flourishing in his lifetime. In 1930 he moved to Egypt, where he lived until his death in 1951.\n\nTraditionalism had a discrete impact in the field of comparative religion, particularly on the young Mircea Eliade, although he was not himself a member of this school. Contemporary scholars such as Huston Smith, William Chittick, Harry Oldmeadow, James Cutsinger and Hossein Nasr have advocated Perennialism as an alternative to secularist approach to religious phenomena.\n\nThrough the close affiliation with Sufism, the traditionalist perspective has been gaining ground in Asia and the Islamic world at large.\n\nThe Traditionalist School has been associated with some far right movements. Critics of Traditionalism cite its popularity among the European \"Nouvelle Droite\" (\"New Right\"), while Julius Evola's ideas were used by Italian Fascists during the Years of Lead. Mark Sedgwick's \"Against the Modern World\", published in 2004, gives an analysis of the Traditionalist School and its influence.\nIn his book \"Guénon ou le renversement des clartés\", the French scholar Xavier Accart questions the connection sometimes made between the Traditionalist School and far-right politics. According to Accart, René Guenon was highly critical of Evola's political involvements and was worried about the possible confusion between his own ideas and Evola's. Accart finally claims that the assimilation of Guénon with Evola and the confusion between Traditionalism and the New Right can be traced back to Louis Pauwels and Bergier's \"The Morning of the Magicians\" (1960).\n\nAlain de Benoist, the founder of the Nouvelle Droite declared in 2013 that the influence of Guénon on his political school was very weak and that he does not consider him as a major author.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an extension of the notion of convergence for series of countably many elements to series of arbitrarily many. It has been mostly studied in Banach spaces. \n\nA series of numbers is unconditionally convergent if under all reorderings of the numbers, their sum converges to the same value as under the given ordering—their sum is not conditional on the particular arrangement. In contrast, a series is conditionally convergent if it converges but different orderings do not all converge to that same value.\n\nLet formula_1 be a topological vector space. Let formula_2 be an index set and formula_3 for all formula_4.\n\nThe series formula_5 is called unconditionally convergent to formula_6, if\n\nUnconditional convergence is often defined in an equivalent way: A series is unconditionally convergent if for every sequence formula_10, with formula_11, the series\n\nconverges.\n\nIf \"X\" is a Banach space, every absolutely convergent series is unconditionally convergent, but the converse implication does not hold in general. Indeed, if \"X\" is an infinite dimensional Banach space, then by Dvoretzky–Rogers theorem there always exists an unconditionally convergent series in this space that is not absolutely convergent. However, when \"X\" = R, then, by the Riemann series theorem, the series formula_13 is unconditionally convergent if and only if it is absolutely convergent.\n\n\n"}
